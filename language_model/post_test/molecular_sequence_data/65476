zzso zzso zzso enhances the expression of the zzso A gene zzso The expression of zzso itself, which occurs from two promoters zzso and zzso is not completely zzso We have recently demonstrated that the zzso upstream region contains potential binding sites for multiple regulators, including the zzso factor regulator zzso In this study, we identified within the zzso upstream region, a 25 zzso sequence to which zzso specifically zzso The sequence is located zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter, and zzso a potential binding site for the zzso zzso factor zzso We also show that, throughout the growth cycle, deletion of zzso reduces zzso expression from the zzso promoter in the zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso to zzso but does not affect zzso expression from zzso Further, loss of zzso eliminates the zzso enhancement in the synthesis of zzso A and the zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso through zzso A model defining the relationships between these different genes is zzso
