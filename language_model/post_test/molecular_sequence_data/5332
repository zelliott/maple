zzso zzso zzso are the zzso catalyzing the base exchange required for the synthesis of the modified bases derived from zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso have been clearly identified and highly characterized both zzso and zzso The recent occurrence in sequence databases of zzso and zzso proteins zzso to the zzso zzso reveals that all zzso unexpectedly adopt a common zzso zzso sequence variations at the active site correlate well with their zzso for the various zzso derivatives and the total conservation of the zzso zzso strongly favors a common zzso mechanism for all zzso
