zzso is an zzso zzso degradation zzso characterized by dynamic zzso of zzso that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and pathogens for delivery to the zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to act selectively toward specific cargo is dependent on the small zzso modifier zzso and the zzso region zzso present in zzso zzso Here, we describe a comprehensive zzso interaction analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso as potential zzso zzso We identified 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind directly to zzso zzso and that zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso one of our screening hits, zzso contains two zzso zzso The zzso zzso was critical for interaction with the zzso complex and transport of zzso zzso binding of the zzso component zzso to zzso could be zzso out by zzso indicating a molecular switch between zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso could bridge the zzso and zzso via its zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso are implicated in the zzso of the zzso trafficking events under zzso zzso
