To test a possible role of zzso proteins in the degradation of nitrate zzso zzso in leaves, we monitored zzso bound to zzso in leaf zzso The amount of zzso that zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso increased upon a zzso zzso This was accompanied by a similar increase in the protein turnover rate of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in extracts from darkened but not from illuminated zzso zzso of zzso from such extracts prevented zzso zzso We conclude that the availability of zzso for zzso regulates the stability of zzso
