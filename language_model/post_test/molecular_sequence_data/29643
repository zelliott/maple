Many genes are zzso and/or zzso transcribed during this zzso Isolation and analysis of these genes might help us to understand how zzso and zzso are zzso For this purpose, we have isolated a large number of zzso clones from zzso zzso whose expression is zzso during zzso 

We have isolated zzso zzso which encodes 416 zzso acids and bears zzso to zzso of zzso zzso A strain whose zzso gene has been deleted forms no viable zzso zzso electron zzso showed that the zzso strain has zzso formed spore walls, and then they zzso allowing zzso material to zzso The zzso fusion protein is localized to the spore zzso thereafter returned to the zzso after zzso zzso zzso to the spore wall was almost normal in the zzso or zzso zzso that lack zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is zzso localized in zzso zzso zzso has an zzso domain with zzso to the zzso insulin zzso and a zzso domain with a zzso zzso zzso whose zzso or zzso domain was truncated were severely defective for zzso 

zzso is a spore wall component and plays a pivotal role in the formation of the mature spore wall zzso
