A long-range physical map of the human zzso zzso variable alpha zzso locus was produced using 23 V alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso across the locus was also studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used to map V alpha gene segments onto one zzso zzso of 500 zzso and two of 200 zzso using DNA from peripheral blood zzso zzso and conventional Southern techniques on zzso zzso and zzso zzso lines were used to establish the zzso to 3' order of the gene segments and the relative positions of V alpha gene segments on the zzso zzso The linkage zzso study used zzso zzso zzso analysis to zzso 100 normal zzso subjects for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Strong linkage zzso was detected between zzso and zzso in zzso with the physical zzso This new information will be useful for future studies of genetic variation at the zzso zzso its role in the shaping of the zzso repertoire, and its possible contribution to zzso zzso
