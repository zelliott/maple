The bar zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso growth in bacteria defective for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the bar regions results in zzso of zzso zzso of protein zzso and arrest of zzso cell zzso These effects have been ascribed to the expression of zzso zzso present in zzso sequences named zzso in the zzso bar zzso To investigate the nature, frequency, and distribution of zzso in the zzso zzso we conducted a survey of their location in zzso zzso A zzso random zzso DNA library was constructed for the identification of clones zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso Three new zzso zzso were identified in the library but only one was on the sense strand and it had a rare initiation zzso This result contrasted with the in zzso identification of over a hundred putative zzso using an ad hoc computer program on both strands of zzso zzso Unlike bar zzso most of the toxic constructed clones were also toxic to zzso bacteria, thus suggesting a different zzso zzso zzso analysis of these cloned zzso showed that they zzso zzso zzso gene starts, gene ends, or combinations zzso Our data suggest that zzso sequences may, at least partly, account for toxicity in zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso at gene ends may play a role in gene zzso Other zzso identified in zzso were zzso It is still an open question what the in zzso function of these and toxic zzso might zzso
