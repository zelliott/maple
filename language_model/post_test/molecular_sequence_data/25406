zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso episode zzso is a major group of zzso zzso zzso To identify the defective zzso zzso DNA from a patient with zzso was zzso by using amplified DNA fragments as sequencing zzso In zzso zzso determined out of zzso zzso of the whole zzso zzso at least 21 zzso were different from those of a control human zzso zzso One of the zzso was a transition of A to G in the zzso zzso gene at Cambridge zzso number zzso This zzso is zzso not only in many zzso zzso but in most zzso zzso zzso An zzso I restriction site was gained by the substitution of this zzso The zzso I zzso of the amplified DNA zzso revealed that all independent 6 patients had G at zzso number zzso in their zzso zzso but none of 11 control individuals had G at this zzso This result strongly suggests that the zzso in the zzso zzso gene causes zzso
