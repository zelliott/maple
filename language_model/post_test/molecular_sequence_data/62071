The zzso protein zzso family consists of small zzso zzso that are found in various body zzso In order to study evolutionary events to this family, we cloned member genes and analyzed their zzso A database search revealed the presence of a novel zzso gene on mouse zzso zzso and a zzso zzso adjacent to zzso on human zzso zzso The mouse zzso and four related genes displayed higher zzso and synonymous substitution ratios in comparison to other zzso zzso zzso zzso these genes exhibited distinct zzso among zzso such as seminal zzso zzso and zzso zzso A pair of duplicated genes could have existed prior to radiation to the human and zzso While only zzso is active in the human zzso zzso gene zzso have given rise to functional zzso in zzso zzso evolution potentially has occurred among the zzso and its related genes in the mouse zzso
