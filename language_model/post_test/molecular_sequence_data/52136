Clinical zzso of the zzso respiratory and systemic pathogen zzso zzso have been placed in several different classes by using zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso but in general have not been distinguished zzso We report here that a zzso chain reaction zzso DNA zzso method that has been termed arbitrary primer or random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso can distinguish among zzso in a single zzso zzso In this method, arbitrarily chosen zzso are used to prime DNA synthesis from zzso sites that they zzso match, or almost match, to generate zzso zzso of DNA zzso Each of 29 zzso of zzso class 2, the group endemic in the American Midwest, was distinguished by using just three arbitrary zzso In contrast, zzso S and E colony zzso zzso of two strains were not distinguished from their R parents by using 18 such zzso Thus, the clinical zzso of zzso zzso are quite diverse, but their zzso remain stable during laboratory zzso These outcomes suggest new possibilities for zzso analysis and studies of zzso populations in infected zzso
