Evidence accumulating in the literature supports the hypothesis that zzso growth zzso zzso may play a role in stimulating differentiation of the zzso zzso cells zzso during early zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso enhance the stimulation of zzso zzso and to increase zzso binding in zzso The purpose of the present studies was to examine the role of zzso in zzso differentiation by determining the effects of zzso on 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso to differentiate in zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso immature rats by zzso zzso zzso and cultured in the presence and absence of zzso and zzso for up to 6 zzso At various times zzso zzso was extracted from the zzso and 3 zzso zzso was measured by specific zzso using reverse zzso followed by the zzso chain zzso zzso of 3 zzso zzso using zzso designed to distinguish between the type I and type II 3 zzso gene products revealed that the zzso expressed primarily the type I zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso increase in 3 zzso zzso that was approximately zzso at 100 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso (30 zzso increased 3 zzso zzso approximately zzso over zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
