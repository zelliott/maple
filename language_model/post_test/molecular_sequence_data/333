zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (A zzso is thought to contribute to synaptic dysfunction and zzso death in Alzheimer's zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso receptors play critical roles in synaptic plasticity and zzso survival, but the potential involvement of these receptors in A zzso synaptic dysfunction and zzso death has not been zzso Here we report that A zzso promoted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso We also report evidence that A zzso induced a zzso zzso of the zzso that slowed channel closure times and prevented zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interference to reduce the expression of zzso in primary zzso zzso attenuated A zzso zzso death while induced expression of zzso in a zzso cell line that does not normally express zzso enhanced the toxic effect of A zzso Together these findings suggest that A zzso synaptic dysfunction and zzso death may involve zzso in zzso zzso zzso
