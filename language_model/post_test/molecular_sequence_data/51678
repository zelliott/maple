The family of zzso zzso include a group of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of around 50,000, which are closely related in zzso acid sequence and a smaller group of zzso zzso based on a much larger zzso with zzso zzso zzso comparisons have indicated a low level of similarity between the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and a substantial region of the zzso chain for the more widespread zzso zzso zzso In the light of the solution of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso we have undertaken a detailed examination of the alignment of the sequence for the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against the sequence and the molecular structure of that from zzso zzso This analysis reveals that the zzso zzso between these two families are clustered in the three-dimensional structure and points to a remarkably similar layout of the zzso site and the zzso pocket, though with some differences in the mode of recognition of the zzso zzso
