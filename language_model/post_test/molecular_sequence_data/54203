The diagnosis of many genetic disorders relies on a combination of clinical suspicion and zzso genetic zzso Our laboratory uses a standard zzso zzso zzso to target the zzso zzso zzso gene to test for zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso One patient, a zzso female, who lacked the classical clinical features of zzso but had a molecular diagnosis of zzso by MSP by another laboratory, had repeat testing in our zzso Testing by MSP in our laboratory also identified an apparent loss of the zzso paternal zzso consistent with a diagnosis of zzso zzso testing using Southern zzso analysis with a zzso restriction zzso showed a normal pattern of zzso detecting both the zzso maternal and zzso paternal zzso To investigate these zzso results, we amplified and zzso the zzso locus in this patient and identified a single zzso change within the binding site for the zzso zzso zzso These results indicate this zzso change led to zzso dropout in the MSP analysis, yielding the zzso zzso zzso MSP analysis using an alternate primer set that was developed by our laboratory detected both zzso and zzso zzso These findings illustrate that zzso dropout due to the presence of rare zzso can cause zzso results in commonly used MSP zzso and lead to molecular zzso
