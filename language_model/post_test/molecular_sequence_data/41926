zzso zzso zzso from rat bone, binds zzso but whether different molecular forms of zzso derived from zzso sources and zzso zzso also possess this property remains to be zzso Furthermore, it is not known which specific site or sites of the zzso bind zzso In the present study, following an established zzso total proteins in the zzso media from zzso cell cultures were separated by zzso transferred to zzso zzso and incubated with zzso then zzso zzso bound to protein bands were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso representing specific zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso on the membrane and processed as described zzso Our results show that zzso zzso by normal rat kidney cells, zzso transformed zzso cells, zzso zzso from human milk, and zzso zzso zzso by 1 zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells all bind zzso levels of zzso with zzso We also show that a synthetic zzso representing the domain of zzso which contains nine consecutive zzso acid zzso binds zzso with zzso It is zzso therefore, that a zzso site resides in this region of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a general property of zzso irrespective of its molecular mass and origin, and the zzso zzso of zzso may not influence the zzso or accessibility of the zzso affinity sites of the zzso
