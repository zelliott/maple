This investigation describes the design, synthesis and evaluation of zzso peptides related to the bovine zzso zzso zzso The structures of these zzso peptides were derived from investigations with linear peptides and sequence alignment studies, in association with a zzso model of zzso developed from the zzso X-ray zzso zzso The structures of these zzso peptides comprised zzso regions of loop zzso zzso and loop zzso zzso held in close proximity by a zzso zzso and the zzso bond zzso Linear and zzso zzso peptides were evaluated in zzso zzso for their ability to inhibit the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previously, zzso and zzso have been shown to recognize zzso accessible on the surface of zzso that lie in close proximity to the zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that these zzso peptides can specifically inhibit in a zzso manner the binding of zzso to zzso while having a lesser effect on the binding with zzso Based on these results, it can be concluded that the zzso recognized by zzso involves contributions from zzso zzso from the zzso regions of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and that these loop regions flank part of the zzso binding site of the zzso zzso
