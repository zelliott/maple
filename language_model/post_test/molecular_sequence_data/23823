The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been determined using the zzso zzso In this study, the zzso sequences of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso strains of mice were determined and found to be zzso although many silent variations were found compared with the sequence in a database for zzso zzso protein consists of 12 zzso acids zzso by the 16th zzso and the following 190 zzso acids of zzso In the sequences of zzso zzso 12 specific zzso zzso no substitution was detected among the three strains and zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis clearly showed that zzso zzso expression was present only in zzso No zzso zzso in two important regions of the zzso promoter for zzso zzso was detected within the 16th zzso of the mouse strains zzso However, no functional form of zzso was found in the zzso zzso or human by sequence analysis and zzso zzso
