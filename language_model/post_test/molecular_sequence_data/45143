zzso scaffolds derived from zzso sources are increasingly being adapted and engineered to provide unique binding molecules with a diverse range of targeting zzso The zzso immunity protein zzso from zzso coli is potentially one such zzso as it combines the advantages of zzso small size, zzso stability zzso by a zzso four zzso zzso framework and zzso availability of variable surface zzso evolved to zzso members of the zzso family of bacterial zzso forming one of the tightest known zzso zzso Here we describe initial cloning and protein expression of zzso and its zzso partner the 15 zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Both proteins were produced efficiently in zzso and their in zzso binding interactions were validated using zzso and zzso In order to assess the capacity of the zzso protein to accommodate extensive loop region zzso we performed extensive molecular zzso and constructed a series of loop graft zzso based on transfer of the extended zzso loop from the zzso zzso which targets the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in various zzso resulted in zzso proteins exhibiting retention of the underlying framework zzso as measured using zzso circular zzso zzso zzso there was low but measurable transfer of zzso zzso Finally, to validate zzso as a zzso scaffold for the generation of molecular libraries, we displayed zzso as a gene 3 fusion protein on the surface of zzso zzso the most common library display zzso The fusion was successfully detected using an zzso rabbit zzso zzso and the zzso zzso specifically recognized the immobilized zzso Thus, zzso scaffold is an ideal protein display scaffold for the future generation and for the selection of libraries of novel binding zzso
