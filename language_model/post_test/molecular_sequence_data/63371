In humans, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are identical between zzso acids zzso and then zzso Whereas zzso (the zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso factor, zzso does not bind traditional zzso zzso lacks zzso zzso activity, and acts as a zzso inhibitor of zzso It has been suggested that this zzso zzso is involved in the induction of zzso resistance in asthma zzso Unfortunately, a zzso zzso has been detected in only humans, and therefore, an animal model for studies on this zzso is zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that in zzso a zzso zzso exists that zzso from the zzso zzso zzso at the same position as human zzso from human zzso The zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso inhibitor in reporter zzso and the extent of zzso and the effective zzso ratio is similar to studies performed with the human zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is similar to its human zzso Finally, expression levels of zzso and zzso were determined in adult zzso zzso and at several zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were detected throughout the body, and zzso zzso levels were relatively low compared with zzso zzso levels, as in zzso Thus, for the first time, a zzso zzso has been identified in a nonhuman animal species, shedding new light on the relevance of this zzso zzso zzso and providing a versatile animal model for studies on the zzso zzso
