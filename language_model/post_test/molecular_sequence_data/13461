zzso peptides were prepared as multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of infectious zzso virus zzso The zzso system has been used in the production of zzso and zzso zzso It has an advantage over linking peptides to a highly zzso carrier zzso because zzso are not produced to the zzso core zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso peptides were zzso to the Arkansas zzso and two were zzso to the Massachusetts zzso of zzso The zzso sequences zzso to zzso acid zzso 64 to 88 and to zzso 117 to 141 for each of the zzso zzso A zzso construct for each zzso was prepared by linking 4 copies of a zzso to the zzso zzso core zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were used to zzso specific pathogen free zzso zzso zzso zzso and the dot zzso zzso against the zzso zzso were positive for all of the zzso tested whereas the zzso virus zzso zzso and virus zzso zzso were negative for all of the zzso zzso zzso zzso against whole virus did not cross react with synthetic peptides made to the zzso virus suggesting a possible role for the zzso zzso in a zzso specific dot zzso or zzso test for zzso
