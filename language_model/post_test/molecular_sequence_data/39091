The wheat zzso protein zzso 73 is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family, which zzso the zzso between the zzso and trans forms of the zzso bond preceding zzso zzso in zzso A zzso zzso sequence zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of the wheat zzso was isolated from a wheat zzso library, and characterized by deletion analysis and transient expression in wheat zzso The zzso zzso zzso is referred to as the full promoter due to the zzso activity of the fused zzso reporter zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of three zzso acid zzso elements zzso zzso to zzso elements zzso a putative zzso box, two putative binding sites for the zzso zzso factor and a 36 zzso zzso which exhibits zzso identity to the zzso clone located in the zzso region of wheat zzso In a transient expression zzso the promoter preserved the tissue specificity described in zzso namely it is expressed only in zzso zzso and young zzso The promoter was induced zzso by zzso the minimal promoter was designated at zzso and the zzso box located at zzso The zzso by zzso and the expression during zzso may indicate that zzso belongs to the group of genes induced by zzso upon zzso
