The crystal structure of the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso coli zzso zzso shock protein 70 zzso was determined at zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso binds zzso to a single zzso of zzso The structure of the zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso resembles closely that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso except for an outward rotation of one of the zzso of the zzso This zzso change is not consistent with tight zzso zzso Two long alpha zzso extend away from the zzso zzso and suggest a role for zzso in zzso release from zzso
