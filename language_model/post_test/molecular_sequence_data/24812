We have isolated full-length zzso for two distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso from a rice shoot zzso zzso Open reading frames found in zzso and zzso zzso zzso putative proteins of zzso zzso zzso and 500 zzso acids zzso zzso zzso They show zzso identity to each other and zzso identity to zzso counterpart sequences determined so zzso Comparative analysis of relevant zzso clones obtained from the rice zzso library with these zzso as zzso demonstrated that the number and sizes of zzso deduced for these two genes differ zzso Interestingly, in the regions in the putative gene products corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso known as the zzso domain of plant zzso zzso possesses a typical zzso while zzso contains several zzso of zzso acids that contribute strongly to the binding of zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso of these proteins zzso in zzso coli revealed that zzso can in fact bind specifically to bovine zzso but zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that transcripts of zzso and zzso were present in all zzso zzso but their expression was zzso zzso at least in roots and maturing zzso
