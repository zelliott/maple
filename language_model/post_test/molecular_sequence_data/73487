zzso X receptors zzso are zzso factors that traditionally have been thought to bind DNA as protein zzso Recently, however, it has been recognized that zzso can also bind to DNA as protein zzso zzso zzso form zzso on response elements containing suitably reiterated zzso and play an important role in determining the specificity of DNA recognition by different nuclear zzso We report here that zzso zzso exhibit significant functional zzso and form on response elements possessing diverse zzso zzso and zzso This ability of zzso to form zzso and related zzso appears to contribute to the synergistic zzso zzso observed when zzso zzso separated response elements are introduced into a single zzso zzso may therefore be a common paradigm for DNA recognition and zzso regulation by several different classes of zzso zzso
