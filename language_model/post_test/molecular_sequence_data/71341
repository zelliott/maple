zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso found in several zzso marine algae, and zzso plants, is a biological catalyst responsible for the production of atmospheric zzso zzso A previous paper reports the zzso of this zzso from zzso zzso and the isolation of a zzso clone of the gene for this zzso In this paper, we describe the isolation of a zzso clone of the zzso gene and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli and compare the kinetic behavior of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is active and promotes the production of zzso zzso by zzso coli under in zzso zzso The kinetic data indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso have similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso were found to function well in high zzso zzso This high salt tolerance resembles the activity of zzso zzso rather than zzso plant zzso These findings support the hypothesis that this zzso functions in the control and regulation of the internal concentration of zzso zzso in zzso plant zzso
