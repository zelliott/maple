zzso repeated DNA sequences about 60 zzso in zzso which may be isolated by zzso with zzso restriction zzso were studied by means of molecular and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The results obtained can be summarized as zzso zzso zzso repeats are almost species specific to zzso zzso since they zzso to a minimum extent to zzso DNA of only two out of five related zzso zzso these zzso repeated elements display zzso in structure even within one and the same zzso where different repeats may share not more than zzso zzso zzso their zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso is remarkably high and varies largely between land races zzso numbers per zzso zzso zzso range from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats are clustered in differing amounts in each zzso pair of the zzso complement and are missing or present in a zzso amount in the zzso zzso zzso zzso regions that bear these repeats associate closely to varying degrees in zzso zzso These results are discussed in relation to possible functional roles that zzso repeated DNA sequences such as the zzso elements might zzso
