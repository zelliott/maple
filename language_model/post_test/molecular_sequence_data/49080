The zzso zzso is a recurring zzso zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso fusing two genes designated as zzso and zzso Within zzso almost all zzso cluster in an zzso restricted region and fuse zzso portions of zzso to a variety of zzso genes in various zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common fusion partners of zzso It spans more than 100 zzso and two zzso cluster regions zzso have been identified in a zzso region of zzso 4 zzso and within zzso 7 and 8 zzso We investigated 11 children's bone zzso or peripheral blood samples (3 zzso 5 zzso 2 zzso 1 ALL zzso and two cell lines zzso and zzso with zzso diagnosed zzso zzso By use of an zzso multiplex zzso long-range zzso zzso a zzso DNA zzso from each sample was amplified and directly zzso In four patients and two cell lines, the zzso zzso were located within zzso and in two patients within zzso zzso However, in five patients the zzso zzso were found outside the previously described zzso within the zzso region of zzso 4 and even within zzso 3 in one zzso All five patients with a secondary zzso who had not received zzso during treatment of the primary zzso disease, revealed almost identical zzso zzso very close to a breakage hot spot zzso by zzso II zzso or zzso triggers in zzso zzso patterns around the zzso indicated involvement of a zzso zzso in the development of zzso similar to zzso in zzso acute zzso
