zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause the inherited zzso cancer syndrome and are also observed in some sporadic zzso Recent work indicates that zzso exerts effects on zzso polarity and proliferation by zzso and zzso protein zzso belonging to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso forms a complex with zzso an inactive zzso and zzso an zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso activates zzso and zzso it from the nucleus to the zzso To learn more about the inherent properties of the zzso complex, we first investigated the activity of 34 point zzso of zzso found in human zzso and their ability to interact with zzso and zzso Interestingly, 12 of these zzso failed to interact with zzso Performing zzso analysis, we defined two binding sites located on opposite surfaces of zzso which are required for the assembly of zzso into a complex with zzso and zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso does not require zzso of its own zzso to be activated by zzso and discuss the possibility that this unusual mechanism of regulation arises from zzso functioning as an upstream zzso Finally, we establish that zzso despite being zzso zzso is still capable of binding zzso with high zzso but that this is not required for zzso of zzso Taken together, our findings reinforce the functional importance of the binding of zzso to zzso and provide a greater understanding of the mechanism by which zzso is regulated and activated through its interaction with zzso and zzso
