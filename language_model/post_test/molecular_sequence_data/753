Novel molecular ecological techniques were used to study changes in microbial community structure and population during degradation of zzso zzso modified layered zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences belonging to members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso the most dominant groups of zzso during zzso of zzso zzso Due to their zzso zzso members of these microbial groups are likely to play an important role during zzso zzso This paper presents new insights into the zzso of zzso zzso and highlights the importance of using novel molecular ecological techniques for in zzso identification of new zzso involved in zzso of zzso zzso
