The zzso zzso of zzso contain three highly zzso regions, A, B, and C, of which A and C bind zzso in a strictly zzso manner but have no zzso activity whereas region B zzso zzso on its zzso We zzso the zzso zzso corresponding to regions A and C of human zzso domain I and tested their effect on human zzso zzso and rat zzso The two peptides significantly activate both zzso the zzso concentration required for zzso activity is lowered from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso and from 250 to 140 zzso for zzso The zzso concentration of the peptides is zzso zzso for zzso and 25 zzso for zzso It is noteworthy that at low zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso both zzso are activated about zzso by the zzso Based on these findings, it is suggested that zzso fragments may have a role in zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, these zzso open new avenues to cell biological studies of zzso function and eventually may alleviate pathological states caused by zzso zzso
