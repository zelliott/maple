When zzso aromatic compounds are zzso via zzso zzso of zzso the dead-end zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso has only been described in few bacterial species, including zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso zzso is the first step required for the zzso of zzso and is zzso by an zzso termed zzso zzso zzso We identified the gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and solved the crystal structures of zzso in complex with zzso at zzso resolution, with zzso at zzso resolution and with a zzso buffer zzso at zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso fold and assembles as a tight functional zzso zzso We were able to assign the active site zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which has previously been zzso in a structural zzso zzso zzso and structural analysis of zzso zzso and zzso created by zzso zzso indicate zzso and zzso to be the most probable zzso zzso The previously proposed involvement of zzso in zzso zzso can now be zzso zzso zzso was found to be important for zzso zzso with only marginal effect on zzso zzso Based on these results, a novel zzso mechanism for the zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso involving a zzso zzso is zzso This zzso the knowledge about the diverse group of proteins exhibiting a zzso zzso
