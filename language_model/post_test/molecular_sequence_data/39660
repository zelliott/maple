The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of E group zzso zzso recruits zzso to a zzso complex in the outer membrane zzso as well as zzso in the zzso of zzso coli, the latter triggering zzso of the toxin across the zzso We have identified the zzso zzso binding zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso E9 zzso and solved the crystal structure of the zzso zzso folds into a distorted hairpin within a canyon of the zzso zzso of zzso using two zzso to zzso the toxin to the canyon floor and numerous zzso hydrogen bonds to stabilize the bound zzso This mode of binding enables zzso side chains to zzso zzso zzso in and around the channel that runs through the zzso and that constitutes the binding site of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso binding partner of zzso and their association is known to be important for zzso zzso The structure is therefore consistent with zzso models wherein the zzso zzso the zzso complex causing local instability of the zzso as a prelude to toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind within the zzso channel and switch the surface zzso from negative to positive, are needed for the zzso charged zzso to bind zzso with an affinity equivalent to that of zzso and competitively zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso zzso proteins can compete with zzso proteins for binding to folded scaffolds but that this can require zzso such as metal zzso to offset zzso zzso
