The type II zzso complex exports folded proteins from the zzso to the zzso zzso It is used by the zzso zzso zzso zzso to export several zzso including its major zzso factor, zzso zzso The zzso is an essential component of the type II zzso system and likely acts as a zzso to push the folded proteins across the outer membrane through the zzso zzso The zzso is composed of the major zzso zzso and four minor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We determined the zzso crystal structure of the head domain of zzso at zzso resolution using molecular replacement with the previously reported zzso structure, zzso as the zzso Three additional zzso zzso acids present in our construct prevent an zzso zzso of zzso zzso present in one of the two zzso of the zzso zzso Additional crystal contacts stabilize a long flexible loop comprised of zzso zzso that is more zzso in the zzso structure but is partially observed in our structure in very different positions for the two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In one of the zzso the loop is highly zzso Modeling suggests the highly charged loop is capable of zzso zzso and possibly zzso protein zzso suggesting a role in specificity of zzso assembly or zzso zzso
