zzso peptides derived from zzso or viral proteins can associate with class I or class II major zzso complex zzso zzso while zzso zzso are zzso processed zzso and presented on zzso class II zzso Here we describe a method that allows the presentation of an zzso class zzso zzso zzso on zzso class I zzso although it was taken up from the zzso The zzso influenza virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used either in soluble form or coupled via an zzso bridge to zzso zzso Target cells were incubated with flu or zzso and the effective zzso presentation was detected in a zzso zzso using flu zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso of target cells with zzso required 5 to 10 times higher zzso zzso of zzso compared to zzso with soluble free zzso The zzso construct was taken up by the cells via the zzso zzso zzso as the binding of zzso was blocked by an excess of zzso In contrast to the flu zzso zzso zzso by zzso was blocked by zzso A but not by zzso nor zzso of zzso reducing steps, like zzso or zzso zzso of the flu zzso derived from zzso construct is not hindered in the zzso zzso cell line, which lacks genes coding for zzso proteins for zzso peptides zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the processing zzso described in this report may involve zzso zzso
