A universal zzso zzso was designed that consistently detected zzso beak and feather disease virus zzso in zzso birds affected with zzso beak and feather disease zzso from different geographic regions across zzso zzso within open reading frame 1 zzso of the zzso zzso consistently amplified a zzso zzso product from blood and/or feathers of 32 birds with zzso zzso The zzso did not amplify a product from the feathers or blood from 7 clinically normal zzso zzso zzso based on regions outside of zzso did not consistently produce a zzso product, suggesting there was some zzso variation outside zzso The amplified zzso zzso products of 10 zzso zzso from different zzso species and from various regions around Australia, were cloned and comparative DNA sequence analysis demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequences of the amplified zzso fragments demonstrated similar identity between all 10 zzso Within zzso there was complete conservation of the putative zzso binding site and marked conservation of 2 other motifs previously identified as essential components of the zzso proteins of other zzso and zzso
