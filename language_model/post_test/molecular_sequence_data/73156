The zzso zzso module is found in a family of surface proteins of different bacterial zzso It comprises 45 zzso acid zzso and represents the first known example of contemporary module zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we have determined the solution structure of the zzso module from protein zzso a protein of the zzso human zzso and pathogen zzso zzso This structure, the first three-dimensional structure of an zzso protein domain zzso was shown to be composed of a left-handed zzso zzso differences between zzso zzso with different affinities for zzso indicated that a zzso region in the zzso part of the second zzso and the flexible sequence between zzso 2 and 3 could contribute to the zzso zzso The effect on backbone zzso zzso exchange rates upon binding to zzso support this zzso The zzso module has a fold that is zzso similar to the zzso zzso of zzso protein A but it shows no resemblance to the fold shared by the zzso zzso of zzso protein G and zzso protein zzso When the gene zzso binding properties and zzso stability of these four zzso are zzso in relation to their global folds an evolutionary pattern zzso Thus, in the evolution of novel binding properties zzso are allowed only as long as the energetically zzso global fold is zzso
