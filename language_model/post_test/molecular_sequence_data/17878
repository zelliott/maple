zzso zzso were extracted from zzso three zzso zzso type E strains isolated from food-borne zzso After zzso by zzso the fragments were cloned into zzso coli by using zzso zzso zzso and screened with zzso zzso recognizing the light chain component of zzso type E zzso The fragments (about 1 zzso zzso cloned from each strain were zzso into a zzso zzso zzso The zzso coli cells transformed with the zzso plasmids produced 33 zzso protein with or without zzso zzso which reacted with the zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the cloned zzso fragments from the three type E strains were identical and contain the zzso region of the type E toxin zzso It was also found that there exist several highly zzso zzso sequences among the zzso types A, C and zzso and zzso toxin genes in both translated and untranslated zzso
