A zzso zzso human zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso T cell zzso The predicted zzso acids sequence contains an zzso signal zzso and exhibits zzso zzso acid identity with zzso an open reading frame from a zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso High levels of zzso were induced from primary peripheral blood zzso T cells upon zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso was zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein and zzso from cells zzso with zzso induced zzso and zzso production and enhanced the surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso
