As part of a program designed to characterize human hair zzso genes and their zzso we present the zzso sequences and deduced zzso acid sequences of three zzso hair zzso zzso zzso and zzso which by virtue of their zzso acid zzso are the zzso of the previously described sheep zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences comparisons of these zzso including the previously characterized human zzso zzso zzso show extreme conservation not only in the zzso but also in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso They also demonstrate higher sequence relationships between zzso zzso and zzso as compared to zzso which exhibits zzso sequences in both the head and tail zzso In zzso zzso studies using specific zzso for the four zzso hair zzso reveal sequential patterns of gene expression in human zzso zzso Remarkably the onset of zzso zzso synthesis occurs immediately above a small population of zzso cells at the base of the hair bulb and the zzso lining the zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis extends upward through the zzso and ends in the lower part of the zzso of the hair zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso zzso synthesis begins simultaneously in the zzso zzso cell layers above the zzso of the zzso zzso thus partially overlapping that of zzso but continuing to a point well beyond zzso in the upper zzso zzso of zzso zzso starts slightly higher than either zzso or zzso zzso and proceeds much farther up into the zzso zone of the hair zzso Our study demonstrates that the differentiation of human hair in terms of hair zzso expression begins much earlier than previously zzso zzso in lower zzso cells of the hair zzso This early phase of hair differentiation is followed by a late cortical phase of terminal differentiation which comprises at least three zzso hair zzso in the zone of zzso and the zzso zone of the hair zzso
