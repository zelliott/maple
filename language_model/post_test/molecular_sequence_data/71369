Vitamin C zzso zzso zzso acts as a potent zzso and cellular zzso in plants and zzso zzso has long been known to have many critical zzso roles in plants, yet its zzso is only currently being zzso A zzso for zzso zzso that features zzso and zzso has recently been proposed for zzso We have isolated a collection of zzso zzso of zzso zzso that are valuable tools for testing of an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso contains approximately zzso of zzso zzso and is defective in zzso zzso By using a combination of zzso zzso and genetic techniques, we have demonstrated that the zzso locus encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso provides zzso which is used for cell wall zzso zzso and protein zzso as well as for zzso zzso In addition to genetically defining the first locus involved in zzso zzso this work highlights the power of using traditional zzso techniques coupled with the zzso Genome Initiative to rapidly clone zzso important zzso
