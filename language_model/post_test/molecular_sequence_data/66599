Response regulators are zzso molecules present in bacteria, zzso and plants, acting as zzso for environmental zzso This paper reports the characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that codes for a member of the zzso response regulator class of zzso The gene was found to be expressed exclusively in the zzso zzso layer zzso days after zzso when zzso differentiation is most zzso The promoter of zzso was strongly zzso in zzso systems by the transfer zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso protein was detected not only in the zzso layer, but also in the zzso tissue deep inside the zzso where there is no zzso of the zzso This suggests that zzso systems might be involved in zzso signal transmission, in contrast to the generally held belief that these systems are involved only in zzso zzso
