During nervous system development, zzso form zzso zzso onto specific zzso Here, we analyze the development of stereotyped zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and muscles were not required for accurate synaptic zzso zzso in zzso Instead, zzso zzso cells that contact zzso act as synaptic guidepost cells that direct zzso zzso zzso to adjacent zzso The zzso zzso has defects in zzso formation that resemble those in animals that lack zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic zzso fail to accumulate at normal synaptic locations and form zzso anterior zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso protein that acts in the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is localized to the site of future zzso where it zzso zzso formation and zzso synaptic connections in response to the zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which mediate zzso recognition in diverse zzso zzso
