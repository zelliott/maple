Several dominant zzso receptors of zzso zzso zzso clones specific for zzso tumor zzso were zzso amplified in mixed zzso tumor cell cultures derived from an individual immune zzso Every zzso clone analyzed had a common specificity for a single zzso in the precursor to cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be minimally identified by nine zzso acid zzso zzso This zzso is located within the zzso signal sequence motif that mediates zzso of the protein into the zzso zzso These novel observations suggest that expression of zzso in zzso tumor cells led to the amplification of zzso which recognize the signal sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
