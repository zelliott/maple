zzso zzso cellular zzso P is composed of both protein and zzso components that are essential for zzso The isolated zzso contains a highly structured zzso of zzso zzso that has extensive sequence similarities to the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso P but bears little resemblance to the analogous zzso sequences in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Even so, the predicted secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso is zzso similar to the bacterial zzso consensus rather than to previously predicted structures of other zzso zzso P zzso
