zzso of zzso to zzso requires the consecutive action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Genes for zzso of zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Observations reported here demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso genes are clustered in the order zzso directly downstream from the zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate that zzso encodes a zzso but the specific function of this protein has not been clearly zzso Properties of zzso created by zzso of omega elements show that zzso is expressed as part of a single transcript, but there is also an independent zzso initiation site directly upstream of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso does not resemble any other known zzso zzso zzso zzso is most directly related to a family of zzso with identical zzso activity and zzso zzso function in zzso zzso Evolution of zzso zzso zzso appears to have been accompanied by fusion of a leader sequence for transport of the zzso protein into the inner zzso and the location of reactions zzso by the mature zzso may account for the failure of zzso zzso zzso to achieve effective zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Analysis of a genetic site where a DNA segment zzso a leader sequence was zzso adds to evidence suggesting horizontal transfer of zzso sequences within genes during zzso
