zzso delta virus zzso is a satellite virus of the zzso B virus zzso which provides the surface zzso for the viral zzso The zzso zzso of zzso encodes two zzso the small delta zzso and the large delta zzso The two proteins resemble each other except for the presence of an additional 19 zzso acids at the C zzso of the latter zzso We have found that the zzso zzso region of zzso delta zzso zzso binds to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso zzso A zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso designated zzso was zzso and its solution structure was found to be an zzso by circular zzso and zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso affinity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso was found to increase with its zzso content, and it was further confirmed by zzso its zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the absence of zzso binding activity in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso were changed to zzso indicates a possible involvement of these zzso in their binding zzso zzso knowledge of the zzso zzso region of zzso thus provides a molecular basis for the understanding of its role in the interaction with zzso zzso zzso
