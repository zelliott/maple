The concept of the zzso window has been developed and examined through a comparative study of zzso zzso of a zzso Dickerson's zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the core part consists of the same Dickerson's zzso sequence with the zzso zzso zzso at both 3' and zzso and the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso at both 3' and zzso analogous duplex zzso zzso in which the core zzso to zzso part zzso zzso zzso consists of the natural Dickerson's zzso zzso A comparison of their zzso zzso clearly demonstrates that the severe overlap of zzso zzso in the larger DNA duplex zzso has been successfully reduced in the zzso duplex zzso as a result of specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the latter zzso zzso 97 atom % zzso enrichment at zzso zzso and zzso sites, approximately 85 atom % zzso enrichment at zzso and approximately 20 atom % zzso enrichment at zzso (see zzso 10 and zzso in the zzso duplex zzso These zzso of the resonance overlap by the zzso approach have enabled unequivocal chemical shift assignments and extraction of the quantitative zzso data in the zzso window part of duplex zzso A comparison of the zzso long zzso window in zzso with that of the zzso duplex zzso also shows the scope of studying the changes in zzso and dynamics of the core zzso region in zzso which result from the increase of molecular weight due to the DNA chain zzso It is noteworthy that such a study is clearly impossible for the natural zzso zzso because of the inherent problem of the overlap of zzso
