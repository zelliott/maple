Six zzso charged zzso acids within membrane spans in rice zzso zzso zzso were identified using a three-dimensional structural model based on the crystal structures of three major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These positions in zzso were selected for zzso and zzso zzso Among the six zzso zzso completely lost transport function, zzso retained only a small fraction of zzso zzso activity zzso of that of the wild zzso and zzso and zzso also displayed a substantial decrease in transport zzso zzso functioned as well as zzso zzso zzso did not transport zzso but showed a zzso leak that was inhibited by zzso indicating that zzso had zzso zzso and zzso zzso This demonstrates that charged zzso acids within membrane spans are important for the transport mechanism of zzso as they are in zzso zzso
