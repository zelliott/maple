To address the question of whether human T cells are capable of recognizing novel zzso of influenza virus, in zzso responses to zzso zzso and synthetic peptides derived from the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were examined in a cohort of 64 individuals selected from a healthy blood donor zzso zzso respond in zzso to zzso and zzso following exposure through natural infection and zzso zzso to zzso were well correlated with those to zzso or zzso and thus, a significant repertoire of zzso T cells is present in many zzso clear zzso to zzso zzso and zzso however, do zzso zzso were observed in the zzso responses to zzso zzso and zzso whereas both zzso and zzso production characteristic of memory responses were observed for zzso and zzso and zzso responses zzso primarily zzso and little or no zzso consistent with a zzso T cell zzso zzso to all influenza zzso were restricted by zzso zzso To address the structural basis for T cell recognition of zzso and zzso overlapping synthetic peptides were used to identify zzso and to determine whether recognition of zzso was limited to zzso sequences in zzso the most closely related zzso zzso Although responses were generally zzso no complete structural overlap was zzso These results suggest that helper T cell cross zzso between different influenza strains may impart zzso to H5N1 strain of zzso
