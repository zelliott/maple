In the present study the complete zzso acid sequence of human plasma zzso zzso was zzso This protein whose biological function is unknown consists of a single zzso chain of 276 zzso acid zzso including 8 zzso zzso and has a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The location of the two zzso bonds in the zzso chain was also zzso The three zzso whose structure was zzso with the aid of 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso The molecular weight calculated from the zzso and zzso structure is zzso which is close to the reported value of approximately equal to zzso based on zzso zzso The predicted secondary structure appeared to be comprised of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The three zzso were found to be located in zzso zzso An unexpected finding was made by computer analysis of the sequence zzso this revealed that zzso zzso is closely related to zzso of the major zzso complex in zzso acid sequence and in domain zzso There was an unusually high degree of sequence zzso with the alpha chains of class I zzso zzso Moreover, this plasma protein was shown to be a member of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso appears to be a truncated zzso major zzso zzso zzso and it may have a role in the expression of the immune zzso
