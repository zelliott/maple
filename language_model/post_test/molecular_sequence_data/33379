zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso locus of zzso coli, interacts with zzso and thereby zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso In addition, zzso zzso repress the strong zzso promoter and this repression by zzso is enhanced by zzso that is, zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso is a Lon zzso zzso and Lon is required both for zzso of zzso zzso and for zzso of the zzso zzso activity of zzso Here we characterize the molecular interactions important for zzso control of the zzso model zzso Using an in zzso screen for zzso zzso we identified multiple zzso changes that map to important zzso acid positions within the zzso domain formed by the zzso zzso motif of zzso Analysis of DNA binding of a subset of these zzso zzso proteins by zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso and a structure model of zzso revealed zzso acid zzso making crucial zzso contacts within the operator zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso showed that zzso zzso bind on the same face of the DNA zzso and that the zzso motif recognizes four zzso repeats within the zzso binding zzso The spacing between each zzso was found to be essential for cooperative interactions between zzso bound zzso zzso stabilized by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the interaction between zzso and zzso confirmed that the proteins form a zzso complex with a zzso zzso Lon zzso zzso in zzso and degradation was inhibited by zzso consistent with the proposal that zzso protects zzso from zzso by Lon in zzso
