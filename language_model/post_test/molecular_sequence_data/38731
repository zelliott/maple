In zzso zzso are zzso by a large zzso family but in humans, only three zzso genes were thought to zzso Based on the zzso between the human and the zzso zzso zzso we defined a zzso human zzso gene region on zzso zzso zzso By using linear sequence information, restriction analysis, zzso and zzso techniques, we were able to construct the first detailed map of the human zzso gene zzso Comparative analysis of genes located in this area enabled us to expand the human zzso zzso family with some recently identified zzso zzso and establish common structural zzso We further identified a new zzso zzso named zzso gene 3 zzso zzso symbol zzso We describe the structural characterization of the zzso zzso together with its precise zzso zzso in relation to other zzso and its tissue expression pattern and hormonal zzso
