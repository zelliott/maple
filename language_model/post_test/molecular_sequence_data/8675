An zzso zzso zzso method with a zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso serum was developed for identification of zzso zzso in tissue zzso The diagnostic efficacy was compared with those of in zzso culture and zzso with fresh and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was developed for identification of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic sensitivities of the different techniques were evaluated with zzso zzso and urinary zzso zzso from eight zzso infected zzso A systemic infection was verified by zzso of 23 of 24 zzso organ zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in 9 of 23 zzso of the zzso Among these nine zzso an average of zzso of the 15 sections examined were zzso The zzso accumulated in discrete clusters and were associated with focal zzso zzso The diagnostic sensitivity obtained by zzso with zzso zzso tissue was zzso considerably lower than that with fresh tissue zzso Thus, the reliable demonstration of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is possible but extremely laborious, and considering the fact that the density of zzso zzso in human tissue is even lower than that in zzso infected animals, the method is not useful in a clinical zzso It may, however, still be valuable in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA by zzso should be performed with fresh tissue specimens and not with zzso zzso zzso
