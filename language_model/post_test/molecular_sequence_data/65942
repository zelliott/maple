zzso and zzso of four zzso zzso DNA zzso consisting of third strands with repeating sequence zzso zzso zzso or zzso were studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso in the gas zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso were compared with their CD zzso and melting behaviors in solution, and parallel correlation between two zzso were zzso In the presence of 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of the zzso triplex was not detected in both solution and the gas zzso Other zzso showed the same order, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in mass zzso and zzso values in zzso The more stable zzso are those that contained higher percentage of zzso triplets and an alternating CT zzso However, the zzso with the same zzso triplets as the zzso showed a higher stability than the latter during the zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso transition was detected in the gas phase, while a zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso The present results reveal that hydrogen bonds and zzso interactions dominate in the gas phase, while base stacking and zzso interactions dominate in solution to stabilize the zzso Moreover, weak zzso conditions zzso zzso promote the formation of the parallel zzso
