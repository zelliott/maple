Previous studies have shown that an zzso strain produces a novel protein with a molecular weight of 87,000 which zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and we zzso the zzso In this study, we have isolated and zzso a clone zzso a zzso which had the equivalent zzso The clone contained an open reading frame of 334 zzso zzso The activity was confirmed by the expression in zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso Based on the differences of molecular weight and zzso zzso acid zzso this protein was considered to be different from that previously reported and was named zzso
