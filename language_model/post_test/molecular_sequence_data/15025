Upon binding of the zzso factor zzso analog zzso to the type 1 zzso zzso zzso the zzso portion of the zzso has been shown to lie near zzso in the zzso second zzso loop zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso play a role in the binding of zzso to zzso we carried out an zzso zzso study to determine the functional role of zzso zzso zzso to zzso Only the zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced the binding affinity and potency of zzso In contrast, these zzso did not seem to significantly alter the overall zzso zzso in that they left unchanged the affinities of the zzso zzso and zzso that have been suggested to bind to different regions of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso also decreased the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that these zzso may play a common important role in the binding of different peptides belonging to zzso zzso Parallel zzso acid deletions of the two peptides produced zzso with various affinities for zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso supporting the interaction between the zzso zzso 8 to 10 of zzso and the corresponding region in zzso with zzso of zzso This is the first time that a specific region of zzso has been implicated in detailed interactions between the zzso and the zzso portion of peptides belonging to the zzso zzso
