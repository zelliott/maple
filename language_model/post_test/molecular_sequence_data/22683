zzso zzso is an zzso molecular zzso whose cellular functions are facilitated by its interaction with zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso Several studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso However, the function of this interaction has not been determined, nor has a zzso link between these proteins been zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso domain of zzso We find that zzso possesses a novel zzso binding domain (we propose the name zzso domain, for zzso family zzso binding zzso which appears to be necessary for zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso promote the formation of a zzso zzso complex, potentially allowing for the recruitment of zzso proteins to zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso suggesting that their interaction is zzso zzso Lastly, we provide evidence of functional conservation within the zzso family by showing that a zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso plays a zzso role as a zzso binding zzso of zzso and that human zzso may play an analogous role via its interaction with zzso
