zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from neutral and alkaline hot water springs on four continents, have been screened for the presence of restriction zzso zzso An isolate zzso from Yellowstone National Park, USA, showed a high level of restriction zzso activity when a cell free extract was incubated with zzso zzso DNA at 65 degrees zzso A Type II restriction zzso zzso I) has been partially zzso from this isolate and the recognition and zzso site zzso zzso I has a novel interrupted zzso zzso recognition sequence zzso where W can be either zzso zzso or zzso zzso It zzso the zzso bond in both strands of the zzso between the first and second bases of the recognition zzso zzso decreased or reduced zzso producing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has a pH optimum of zzso requires 8 zzso zzso for maximum activity and is zzso stable, retaining full zzso activity following incubation at 79 degrees C for 10 zzso zzso I not only represents a new addition to the Type II restriction zzso but also increases the small list of zzso restriction zzso
