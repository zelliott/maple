The idiopathic zzso syndrome is a rare zzso disorder characterized by sustained unexplained zzso with associated zzso damage and by a striking male zzso The first insights into the molecular zzso of this zzso disease were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of patients with the zzso syndrome with the selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso ultimately led to the discovery of the zzso fusion zzso in about half of the zzso syndrome zzso 

The zzso fusion gene is generated by a cryptic zzso zzso zzso zzso which indicates that these cases are zzso zzso zzso and should be reclassified as chronic zzso zzso based on current World Health Organization zzso In addition, the zzso fusion gene was also identified in cases with systemic mast cell zzso In zzso and in zzso studies confirmed that zzso is a therapeutic target of zzso forming a rational basis for the treatment of zzso positive chronic zzso leukemia and zzso with zzso Similar to zzso zzso resistance to zzso due to point zzso in the zzso zzso domain may zzso We have explored strategies to circumvent resistance to zzso using alternative zzso zzso zzso such as zzso 

The discovery of the zzso fusion gene in the zzso syndrome is an example of the power of clinical zzso research and identifies zzso zzso deletion as a novel mechanism to generate zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso
