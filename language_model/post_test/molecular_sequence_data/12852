The zzso acid zzso zzso is a typical zzso sequence for converting peripheral zzso into zzso of central zzso How the zzso zzso that zzso such natural sequences have arisen is as yet uncertain, but the explanation is likely to be of interest in devising pathways to zzso the man-made chemicals that are increasingly found in the zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso coli C zzso acid zzso zzso gene zzso reported here completes the sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso and so makes it possible to assess the zzso of all the zzso zzso There were no striking zzso acid zzso sequence identities between any of the zzso zzso suggesting that they had not arisen by zzso of an ancestral zzso with subsequent zzso The zzso zzso showed no striking identity zzso with the zzso from five other bacteria zzso the analogous reaction in the zzso zzso zzso However, there was significant zzso identity zzso with an zzso coli K-12 open reading frame zzso of as yet unknown function, suggesting that this zzso may zzso an zzso of some zzso
