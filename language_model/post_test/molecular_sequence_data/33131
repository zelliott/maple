Cell cycle progression is tightly controlled by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in regulating cell cycle zzso but how zzso is regulated is still incompletely zzso In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a novel gene zzso that regulates zzso zzso The open reading frame sequence of this gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which contains a zzso domain, and this protein is physically associated with zzso As such, we have designated it zzso zzso or zzso zzso is highly expressed in cancer zzso and cancer cell zzso Interestingly, zzso is expressed in a cell zzso manner and its expression is high in late zzso to S zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso Since zzso interacts with zzso and promotes the zzso activity of zzso zzso we propose that zzso is a novel cell cycle associated protein capable of promoting cell zzso Our data provide insight into the mechanism by which zzso is regulated and the molecular basis of cell cycle progression in zzso
