The zzso of zzso zzso is thought to be an important zzso factor that mediates adherence to host zzso The linear zzso and zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso was investigated with synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso acid sequence predicted from the cloned zzso gene for zzso zzso zzso A series of continuous and overlapping peptides corresponding to the entire sequence of zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso were used to test the zzso of the zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso All the peptides zzso specific zzso directed to the corresponding peptides but differed in their ability to elicit zzso that zzso with either native or zzso zzso zzso to various zzso one-third peptides were more zzso to the zzso zzso form of zzso by Western zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was by far the most zzso against the native form of the zzso zzso as well as the partially zzso zzso form of zzso The results indicate that zzso acid zzso zzso on the native zzso protein are accessible to zzso binding and that the zzso zzso when zzso to zzso is able to mimic an zzso on the zzso zzso
