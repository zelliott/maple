The zzso gene zzso appears to be required for zzso cell development, based on its zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso with zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in cell proliferation and zzso we zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso virus expressing the zzso zzso zzso The virus induced the proliferation of chicken zzso cells in response to zzso growth factor 2, which enabled them to form colonies in soft zzso In contrast to control cultures, zzso chicken zzso cells or quail zzso cells became rapidly pigmented and strongly expressed the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso These results demonstrate that Mi not only acts as pigmentation zzso but is also able to zzso the response of cells to growth zzso
