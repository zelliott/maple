A zzso zzso in the zzso membrane mediates active zzso zzso and regulates zzso pH in rabbit zzso The molecular identity of the zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso The zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso is zzso band zzso zzso related proteins in zzso zzso comprise an zzso zzso zzso zzso We used the zzso chain reaction to amplify and clone a zzso zzso an zzso band zzso protein zzso from rabbit zzso zzso The composite sequence is zzso zzso and is predicted to zzso a protein of 136 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is rabbit zzso zzso generated against a zzso zzso of zzso zzso recognized a zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso with previous studies indicating that a zzso exchange is present in zzso but not zzso membrane zzso from rabbit zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a product of the zzso gene family, and is present in the zzso of zzso zzso where it may mediate zzso zzso
