zzso that generate zzso oxygen species elevate zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with decreased cellular zzso The current studies were undertaken with both vascular zzso and smooth muscle cells zzso to compare the influences of cellular proliferation with those of zzso on induction of zzso zzso To assess cell cycling alone, zzso and zzso were growth arrested, then released from zzso Cell cycling was monitored by zzso zzso counts, and flow zzso zzso zzso activity was measured zzso and zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso A zzso probe was used to zzso zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso reached the S phase of the cell cycle in 18 h and completed one cycle in zzso zzso whereas zzso took zzso h to reach the S phase and 48 h to complete one zzso zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso was very low during the zzso phase, peaked during the S phase, and then reverted to lower values as cells progressed through their zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso content showed corresponding changes to those of zzso Exposure to zzso zzso zzso delayed the entry of released cells into the S phase of the cell cycle and blocked the cells in the S or zzso phase, but induced zzso zzso zzso before the S phase and caused persistence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso as cells progressed through their zzso Exposure to zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells within zzso zzso Thus our studies support roles for both cells cycle dependency and zzso oxygen species in the induction of zzso zzso
