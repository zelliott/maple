The zzso factors zzso and zzso are required at a similar step in early B cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso B zzso genes in a non-B cell zzso Here, we examine a genetic collaboration between these factors in regulating B zzso We find that zzso zzso mice display a marked zzso in zzso cell differentiation at a stage later than observed in the single zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso mice show reduced expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also show that zzso directly binds and activates the zzso zzso Together, these data show collaboration between zzso and zzso and provide insight into the hierarchy of zzso factors that regulate B zzso zzso
