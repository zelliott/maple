In several cell lines derived from mouse zzso myeloma cells, zzso fragmentation of zzso DNA, a hallmark of zzso was continuously zzso zzso zzso of the cells died when isolated in a zzso plate, and the surviving cells contained fragmented DNA zzso Among a variety of genes so far reported to be related to zzso only zzso was expressed at an elevated level in the zzso zzso as compared in a control myeloma cell line without zzso zzso of a zzso expression zzso to a zzso myeloma line yielded similar zzso DNA zzso The results hence suggested that zzso activates zzso responsible for DNA fragmentation during zzso and/or repress DNA repair systems to restore fragmented zzso
