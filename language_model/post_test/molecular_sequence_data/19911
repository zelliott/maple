The zzso zzso zzso forms functional zzso zzso zzso channels in human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells zzso and plays an important role in regulating membrane potential, vascular tone, and zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso channel expression and function have been implicated in zzso from patients with idiopathic pulmonary zzso hypertension zzso Here, we report that zzso of the zzso channel gene zzso in human zzso and other cell lines produced a zzso single channel current and a large whole cell current that was sensitive to zzso zzso application of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all significantly and zzso reduced the zzso zzso while nicotine and zzso also accelerated the zzso zzso of the zzso Furthermore, we zzso zzso from zzso patients and identified 17 zzso zzso zzso 7 are novel zzso There are 12 zzso in the upstream zzso region, 2 of which may alter zzso factor binding sites in the promoter, 2 zzso zzso in the coding region, 2 zzso in the zzso region, and 1 zzso in the zzso zzso Two zzso may correlate with the zzso zzso decrease in pulmonary zzso zzso zzso frequency of two other zzso in patients with a history of zzso and zzso use was significantly different from patients who have never taken the zzso These results suggest that 1) zzso channels are modulated by various zzso zzso nicotine and zzso 2) novel zzso in zzso are present in zzso zzso and 3) zzso in the promoter and translated regions of zzso may zzso the altered expression and/or function of zzso channels in zzso from zzso zzso
