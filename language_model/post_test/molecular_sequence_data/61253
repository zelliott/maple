zzso zzso 2A zzso was previously zzso from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was composed of a 37 zzso zzso zzso a 65 zzso zzso and a 55 zzso zzso We report here the characterization of the genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso the zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso library and the deduced zzso acid sequences reveal strong conservation with the zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that each of the zzso zzso genes is present in a single zzso The zzso zzso were localized mainly to the zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the zzso of zzso is highly enriched in zzso suggesting a potential role for this zzso regulatory zzso in the zzso zzso
