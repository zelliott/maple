zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso Most properties of this zzso such as the zzso spectrum, iron content, pH stability, pH zzso zzso zzso zzso values, and zzso acid zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These two zzso zzso were also found, from the results of zzso double zzso to share several zzso zzso The molecular weight of the zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso and 64,000 by zzso equilibrium analysis and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso gave a single band on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso corresponding to Mr zzso The zzso zzso which started with zzso was determined up to 30 zzso by zzso zzso During the degradation, a single zzso acid was released at each zzso The zzso sequence up to 20 zzso was identical to that of the beta zzso of the zzso zzso with one exception at step 16, at which zzso was observed instead of zzso The zzso zzso was deduced to be zzso on zzso A and B zzso and on zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso consists of two identical zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso which consists of two zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although these two zzso have very similar zzso
