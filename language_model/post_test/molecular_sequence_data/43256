zzso zzso of the primer grip region of human zzso virus type 1 reverse zzso were tested for their ability to extend zzso and DNA versions of the zzso tract zzso and an zzso representing the zzso sequence at the 3' end of zzso A majority of the zzso zzso were either completely or severely deficient in zzso zzso activity, but, with only one exception, were able to efficiently extend DNA versions of the same zzso The zzso zzso were able to bind to zzso zzso indicating that the zzso in zzso zzso was not simply a loss of binding zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso and 235 dramatically reduced the amount of specific zzso H zzso at the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso which is required for primer zzso An zzso substitution at position 232 led to loss of zzso zzso although total activity was close to the zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that there are zzso in human zzso virus type 1 reverse zzso which are specifically involved in zzso acid interactions with zzso zzso
