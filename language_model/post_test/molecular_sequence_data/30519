The prevalence of zzso zzso plaques underlying the adherent zzso in the zzso coronary zzso is well zzso In the zzso process associated with plaque zzso zzso forces and the interaction of zzso with exposed collagen fibers play the decisive zzso The zzso zzso from a zzso human blood sample, zzso through zzso zzso was used to simulate zzso changes in the coronary circulation due to plaque zzso When the zzso conditions of a plaque zzso were zzso the sequence of events corresponded to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso plug formation in the wall) resulted in the formation of an zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso Further, the zzso growth on a collagen zzso mounted in the zzso of zzso tubing through which zzso human blood was zzso was used to zzso the exposure of zzso elements during deep vessel wall injury and the formation of zzso superimposed on plaque zzso zzso of both types of zzso revealed large numbers of zzso and zzso associated with the zzso zzso The mechanisms of zzso reactions were characterized by zzso and zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso Generation of zzso at an early stage was shown to be the key event and zzso of the final outcome of both zzso zzso It is suggested that the simultaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction from zzso human blood provide close experimental approximations to the pathological process of acute coronary zzso namely zzso formation at the site of a disrupted zzso zzso
