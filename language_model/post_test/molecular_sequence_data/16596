zzso zzso in more zzso interactions than any other known zzso including the interaction of zzso with itself to form the zzso zzso zzso The vast majority of zzso proteins zzso can be grouped into zzso zzso Only a handful of structures of complexes of zzso with zzso have been determined so zzso These structures are starting to reveal how certain zzso including zzso vitamin zzso protein and zzso syndrome protein zzso zzso zzso share a common zzso zzso It is proposed here that other zzso including zzso itself, might share this zzso providing a mechanism zzso zzso and zzso compete for a common binding zzso Of particular interest is a zzso pocket that mediates important interactions in five of the existing structures of zzso zzso As the pocket remains accessible in zzso it is proposed that this pocket represents a primary target for zzso zzso such as zzso proteins and zzso
