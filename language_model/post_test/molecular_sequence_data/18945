zzso zzso zzso was capable of producing zzso pure zzso in alcoholic zzso The gene zzso an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso coli, and subsequently zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the native form appeared to be a zzso with a calculated zzso size of zzso belonging to the family of the zzso zzso The zzso accepted a broad range of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso It exhibited remarkable tolerance to zzso zzso zzso and retained zzso % of the initial activity after 4 h incubation with 30 % zzso zzso The zzso displayed absolute zzso in the reduction of zzso to zzso via zzso The optimal pH and temperature for zzso reduction were pH zzso and 30 zzso whereas those for zzso zzso were pH zzso and 25 zzso Under the zzso conditions, the activity of zzso reduction was zzso higher than that of zzso zzso zzso parameters of the zzso showed lower zzso values and higher zzso efficiency for zzso and zzso in comparison to those for zzso and zzso suggesting its zzso role in favor of zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso showed higher zzso efficiency for zzso zzso than that for zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso was coupled with zzso zzso of zzso which simultaneously formed both zzso and zzso in great zzso and zzso excess zzso
