We report the zzso sequence and predicted zzso acid sequence of a novel type I zzso designated as zzso and show that zzso expression in the goldfish zzso nerve is highly zzso The zzso protein is one of at least three type I zzso expressed in goldfish zzso nerve based on both zzso zzso and zzso to the type II zzso zzso After zzso nerve crush in zzso zzso shows a localized increase in zzso zzso expression in the crush zzso This is in contrast to zzso zzso which shows a localized increase that is limited to the zzso and zzso margins of the crush zone, suggesting a diversity of zzso expression in different cell types of the goldfish zzso zzso
