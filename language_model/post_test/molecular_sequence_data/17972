The gene zzso zzso the zzso toxin B zzso was zzso to design its production by zzso zzso It was joined in two ways to zzso a gene of the zzso zzso zzso specific to this zzso This gene encodes one of the major zzso proteins zzso zzso by bacteria incubated at 37 degrees C in a zzso zzso In a first construction, an zzso fusion was obtained between zzso and zzso so that zzso and a truncated zzso protein were zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso was structurally and zzso similar to zzso produced by zzso zzso In another construction, the fusion gene obtained directed the production of zzso hybrid proteins that were zzso by zzso zzso In both cases, zzso zzso directed the production of the zzso proteins only when the bacteria were incubated in conditions of zzso zzso When bacteria carrying the zzso fusion were given orally to mice, a clear serum zzso response against zzso was detected by zzso According to zzso analysis, this response was only directed against the zzso form of the B zzso
