To more fully understand the extent of genetic diversity of zzso in China, we analyzed the zzso and zzso gene sequences of 35 representative zzso zzso from 2008 to zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso and zzso genes have undergone genetic zzso Furthermore, the isolate zzso contains five insertions at positions zzso to zzso and is the first isolate from China reported to have an zzso in zzso Our results suggest that the highly zzso zzso has become the dominant strain in China and that Chinese zzso has undergone rapid evolution and can circumvent immune responses induced by currently used zzso
