In a recent publication we demonstrated that zzso zzso occurs in the V region of the zzso zzso gene of the zzso shark zzso zzso We zzso that similar mechanisms are used to generate zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso genes of the zzso Two distinct patterns of zzso occur, single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consecutive bases zzso zzso Our data indicates that point zzso occur by a mechanism similar to that of zzso zzso in zzso genes of zzso whereas tandem zzso may be generated by an zzso DNA zzso with terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hotspot motifs identical to those of higher zzso were zzso We confirm that, as in zzso of zzso and higher zzso highly significant targeting of AID activity to the classical zzso motif occurs in zzso zzso of zzso shark zzso zzso V zzso Our analysis suggests that the purpose of zzso zzso in shark zzso zzso zzso is to generate a more diverse repertoire in zzso zzso rather than receptors with higher zzso
