zzso DNA from zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used as a template to amplify a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pairs designed from the zzso zzso gene to amplify specific regions of the zzso gene yielded zzso bands for all zzso zzso amplification produced DNA products for sequencing and DNA sequences were translated to produce the corresponding zzso acid zzso After removal of two zzso present in the region zzso zzso acid sequences were zzso There were 12 zzso acid differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the coding zzso The differences correlated with the amount of zzso previously produced in culture, with strains of zzso zzso producing the greatest amounts of zzso
