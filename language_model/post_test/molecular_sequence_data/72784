We investigated the in zzso effect of zzso of zzso tuberculosis on human zzso virus type 1 zzso replication using zzso zzso zzso of 11 zzso patients with pulmonary tuberculosis and 10 patients with no lung zzso Lung segments involved with pulmonary tuberculosis had significantly elevated zzso zzso DNA zzso levels and zzso in zzso compared with lung segments zzso with tuberculosis or with zzso from patients with no lung zzso The zzso viral burden was higher than plasma zzso in tuberculosis patients, indicating local production of zzso zzso zzso zzso declined over the course of treatment for tuberculosis in three patients who underwent serial zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso particles were strongly correlated zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in lung segments involved with zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso region from involved segments of three patients with pulmonary tuberculosis showed basic zzso associated with altered viral zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso had zzso from zzso These data support the conclusion that pulmonary tuberculosis enhances local zzso replication in zzso
