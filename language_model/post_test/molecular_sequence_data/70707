We examined the cellular and zzso distribution of the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso and its trafficking to the zzso plasma membrane in zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso to show that zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell bodies, zzso and zzso terminals within the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that a major fraction of zzso was associated with the membrane of zzso large zzso zzso zzso was rarely associated with the plasma membrane in zzso nerve terminals within the zzso zzso A zzso stimulus zzso that elicits zzso release also caused zzso to zzso from these zzso to the plasma zzso After zzso there was a significant decrease in zzso associated with zzso zzso and a significant increase in zzso associated with the plasma zzso This zzso zzso of receptors to the zzso plasma membrane provides a novel mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso
