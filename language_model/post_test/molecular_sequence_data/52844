The human gene for the fourth member of the protein zzso family, zzso was recently identified by comprehensive zzso zzso To further characterize the corresponding gene and its product in rats, we cloned and zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the rat zzso gene was abundantly expressed only in the brain, zzso and zzso Although we have previously reported that the third member of the protein zzso family, the zzso gene product, is predominantly expressed in rat brain, and thus was named brain zzso quantitative zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso should be called something other than brain zzso because the level of zzso zzso was found to be of the same order as that of zzso zzso Our quantitative zzso analysis showed that the most zzso member of the protein zzso family at the protein level was the product of the zzso zzso not that of the zzso zzso Taking these results together, we consider it reasonable to name the zzso and zzso gene products zzso I brain zzso and zzso II brain zzso respectively, because these two products were found to be more prominently produced in rat brain than the other two members of the protein zzso family, zzso zzso and zzso
