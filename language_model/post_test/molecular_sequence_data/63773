We report the sequence of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and its four zzso Our set of zzso genes is supported by extensive zzso and sequence zzso zzso The structures of the zzso which show three large-scale zzso zzso up to 100 zzso were unequivocally confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso of strain zzso is completely zzso and virtually identical to that of strain zzso zzso of the zzso sequences revealed 210 zzso of sequence that occurs only in strain zzso The remaining 350 zzso shows virtual sequence identity in the two zzso Nevertheless, the number and overall structure of the plasmids are largely zzso Also, zzso of the protein sequences differ despite the near identity at the DNA sequence zzso Finally, we report zzso mobility data for zzso sequences from which we conclude that strains zzso and zzso originate from the same natural zzso This exemplifies evolution in the zzso
