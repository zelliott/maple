A clone of a fast zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso gene was isolated from a zzso expression library made from zzso zzso from the deep abdominal zzso muscle of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained the 3' untranslated region zzso and the coding sequence for the last 413 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed high zzso with that of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plots showed a zzso acid zzso that is consistent with the zzso coiled zzso structure of the rod region of native zzso Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso showed that the fast zzso HC zzso was expressed only in fast zzso the zzso did not zzso to zzso from slow zzso The message consisted of a single transcript of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the fast zzso zzso was not zzso The zzso was largely confined to the zzso spaces and to the zzso zzso of the fiber periphery and large zzso of the cell zzso Within these regions the zzso was concentrated in the zzso immediately surrounding the zzso This constitutes the first report of the cloning and expression of a zzso HC gene from a zzso zzso
