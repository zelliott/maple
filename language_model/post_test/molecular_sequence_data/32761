Secondary zzso zzso zzso is a type of zzso zzso identified by searching the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso gene was zzso based on human zzso sequence using zzso The zzso zzso gene was cloned into expression zzso zzso and zzso which used to transform zzso zzso Then the zzso coli was cultured and induced according to zzso The expressed target protein was identified by Western zzso The target protein was expressed as soluble protein as well as inclusion bodies, the ratio of these two forms target protein varied with the difference conditions of culture and zzso The target protein was zzso with the methods of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso of the zzso target protein showed that the molecular weight was larger than the predicted molecular zzso
