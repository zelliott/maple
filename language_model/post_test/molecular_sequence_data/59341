The identification of the zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso is essential for the development of an effective zzso Here, we show that the zzso region 1 zzso of the envelope 2 zzso protein is a critical zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was attempted with a rabbit zzso serum raised against a zzso synthetic zzso derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso and the residual zzso was evaluated by zzso of zzso zzso The source of zzso was plasma obtained from a patient zzso during the acute phase of zzso zzso non-B zzso which had been zzso for zzso in zzso The zzso zzso induced protection against zzso zzso infection in zzso but not against the emergence of zzso escape zzso that were found to be already present in the complex viral zzso of the zzso The finding that zzso can elicit protective immunity opens new perspectives for the development of effective preventive zzso However, the identification of the most variable region of zzso as a critical zzso domain poses a major challenge for the development of a broadly zzso vaccine against zzso
