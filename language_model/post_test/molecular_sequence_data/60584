DNA zzso plays an important role in animal development and gene zzso In zzso several genes zzso DNA zzso zzso have been zzso zzso is zzso expressed and is required for the maintenance of global zzso after DNA zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso family genes appear to be zzso regulated and behave like de zzso DNA zzso in zzso In this study, we have cloned human zzso and zzso that zzso full-length zzso and zzso proteins with zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity to their zzso zzso The zzso and zzso show high zzso in the zzso terminal zzso domain and contain a zzso zzso region, which shares zzso with the zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso We have mapped human zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and determined the zzso zzso zzso We further show that zzso expression is ubiquitous and can be readily detected in most adult zzso whereas zzso is expressed at very low levels in most zzso except zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso both zzso and zzso expression is elevated in several tumor cell lines to levels comparable to zzso The cloning of the human zzso genes will facilitate further zzso and genetic studies of their functions in establishment of DNA zzso patterns, regulation of gene expression and zzso
