zzso the complete zzso of zzso A virus zzso vaccine commonly requires prolonged tissue culture amplification, followed by detection of virus zzso in cell zzso A reliable, but faster, alternative procedure is highly desirable since it will permit the zzso of experimental batches of killed zzso prior to zzso zzso We established experimental conditions for simultaneous, zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of viral and cellular zzso sequences from infected cell zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions, the presence of zzso amplified zzso as detected by Southern zzso allows the identification of incompletely zzso vaccine batches with a threshold practically identical to that of the more time-consuming subculture and zzso zzso zzso is, by its nature flexible enough for zzso to different requirements and it should prove useful for rapid zzso of vaccine batches and pilot studies for improvement of zzso zzso
