Many biological functions in cells are regulated by the effects of the zzso state on cellular signaling zzso In the heart, pathological zzso caused by a wide variety of stimuli is commonly zzso by zzso zzso of class II zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso factors, including nuclear factor of activated zzso and zzso One of the primary triggers of class II zzso nuclear export is zzso by zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso However, zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso can also potentially induce nuclear export of class II zzso zzso 1 zzso a 12 zzso zzso zzso pathological zzso through reduction of zzso zzso in class II zzso In this review, we discuss the role of zzso modification of class II zzso in zzso cardiac zzso and the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso pathological cardiac zzso
