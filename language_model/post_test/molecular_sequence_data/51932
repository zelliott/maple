The segregation of a zzso silent zzso in the zzso zzso gene has been followed in a human maternal lineage zzso eight individuals and spanning three zzso zzso persisted in all eight zzso related family zzso More importantly, the zzso of the two zzso showed relatively little variation among individuals or between zzso In contrast to the findings in other zzso zzso the present results indicate relatively slow zzso gene zzso A narrow bottleneck in the number of zzso DNA zzso zzso which occurs at some stage of zzso has been advanced to explain rapid zzso zzso gene zzso It is suggested here that the segregation of zzso genes may be more complex than initially zzso and that models need to be developed that account for both rapid and slow zzso One possibility, which zzso both physical and genetic studies of zzso zzso is that the unit of zzso segregation is the zzso itself, each containing multiple zzso zzso
