The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso with zzso shows that it is a protein of 77 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso It is closely related to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having zzso zzso These data allowed isolation of a zzso zzso clone which contains the zzso gene and an adjacent zzso gene as in other species which have an zzso The zzso zzso has a signal zzso with a normal zzso site, but the zzso zzso has a signal sequence which suggests that the mature protein has an zzso zzso characteristic of a zzso zzso zzso The membrane zzso of zzso was confirmed by Western zzso with zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso When aligned according to the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso all but one of the side chains near the zzso are zzso These include the zzso 42 zzso zzso zzso binding zzso the zzso zzso 337 zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso with zzso and aromatic zzso which may function as charge transfer zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The genetic context of zzso is different from that in other species in that zzso genes are not zzso The transcript is only large enough to zzso the two zzso zzso Furthermore, Northern zzso showed that the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso All cultures that contained zzso in the medium had elevated levels of zzso zzso compared with cells grown on zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso alone, consistent with the role of zzso in zzso zzso
