Human zzso was initially isolated from pancreatic stones in patients with alcoholic zzso chronic zzso It is zzso into the pancreatic juice where it was believed to inhibit stone zzso The zzso zzso was assumed to play an important role in the zzso by zzso to the crystal zzso Later, the role of zzso in zzso formation and growth was questioned, together with the associated mechanism of zzso In particular, although zzso zzso on zzso zzso this property does not now seem to be zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso is not likely to have, by itself, the function of the entire zzso The different aspects of this controversy are reviewed and discussed, particularly in the light of recent structural zzso Comparative biological data now available allow us to draw an interesting parallel between zzso and other related zzso Finally, zzso might affect stone formation and may also have another function which could be investigated in the other proteins belonging to the same structural zzso
