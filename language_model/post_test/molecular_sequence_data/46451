zzso zzso has been recently demonstrated to be a novel mechanism for zzso of gene expression at the zzso zzso The importance of zzso in the cardiovascular system is now zzso zzso of distinct zzso have provided evidence for fundamental roles of zzso during cardiovascular zzso However, there is limited information about global zzso profiles during mouse heart zzso In this study, we have gained insight from the expression profiles of zzso during mouse zzso development by zzso and zzso zzso 

our zzso analysis reveals that relatively few zzso display either increasing or decreasing expression profiles during zzso chamber zzso Interestingly, most of the zzso expressed zzso display a rather discrete peak of expression at particular zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso zzso displays an overt zzso expression during heart development and that the zzso zzso gene zzso is an zzso zzso 

our data present a comprehensive profile of zzso expression during zzso zzso providing an entry point for investigation of the functional roles of the most abundantly and zzso expressed zzso during zzso
