We have studied the unfolding and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of protein G by using molecular zzso Although this zzso is small, it possesses several of the qualities ascribed to small zzso zzso formed zzso secondary structure and a zzso zzso of packed side zzso At high temperatures, we find that the zzso unfolds through a series of sudden, discrete zzso zzso These changes occur between states that are identified with the folded state, a pair of partially unfolded kinetic zzso and the unfolded zzso To study zzso at low temperatures, we perform a series of short simulations starting from the transition states of the discrete transitions determined by the unfolding zzso
