zzso zzso produces many antibiotics of varying structures and zzso Here we identify a prominent role for zzso an zzso function zzso zzso factor, in providing intrinsic resistance to zzso compounds produced by other zzso By using a panel of zzso zzso zzso disrupted for each of the 30 known zzso zzso we identified resistance genes for at least three different zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes contribute to resistance to zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso provides resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso provide resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso a membrane protein that provides immunity to zzso In competition experiments, we identify zzso as a key factor in allowing zzso zzso to resist zzso killing and encroachment by competing zzso Together with the previous observation that zzso provides zzso resistance against the zzso zzso zzso these studies support the notion that zzso controls an zzso zzso important in the microbial ecology of soil zzso
