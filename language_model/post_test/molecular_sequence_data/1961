The conservation of expression of zzso patterning zzso particularly zzso has been shown in a wide zzso sampling of zzso However, the functional significance of this expression has been tested in only a few zzso Here we report functional analyses of zzso of the genes zzso dachshund, and zzso in the zzso of the zzso bug zzso zzso zzso This zzso insect has typical legs but highly derived zzso zzso dachshund, and zzso are zzso in their individual expression patterns and functions in the legs of zzso but their functions in other zzso are in some cases zzso We find that zzso of zzso identity does not require zzso zzso activity in zzso as it does in zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso show novel patterns of gene expression and function, relative to other zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso does not seem necessary for proper development of this zzso while zzso and zzso are crucial for formation of the zzso and zzso zzso These data are used to evaluate hypotheses for the evolution of zzso zzso and the evolution of zzso mechanisms in insect zzso in zzso
