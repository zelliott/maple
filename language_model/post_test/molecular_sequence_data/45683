zzso zzso are a defining feature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso many of which are zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the biological function of zzso In some zzso proteins there is only a single zzso zzso 2) domain, while others have both type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso in tandem adjacent to their zzso zzso These two types of zzso share little sequence zzso except the presence of zzso and zzso zzso eight in most zzso zzso and seven in zzso zzso We report here the high-resolution solution structure of the first zzso domain (from the human zzso zzso zzso based on 670 nuclear zzso effect zzso distance zzso 12 hydrogen bonds, and 44 zzso zzso The domain consists of a zzso zzso two short zzso and three zzso encompassing zzso to zzso which binds two zinc zzso One zinc atom is coordinated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso 134, 137 and zzso zzso 159 coordinate the zzso This zzso is markedly different from the only other zzso structure zzso that of a type 2 zzso from zzso zzso which binds a single zinc zzso Of note, the zzso structure closely resembles the folds of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso raising the possibility that the zzso domain either has zzso activity itself or enhances the activity of zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso also reveals two potential protein interaction zzso One of these is likely to provide the binding interface for Alpha 4 that is required for the localized turnover of the zzso zzso of zzso the major zzso zzso
