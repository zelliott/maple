The structure of the zzso zzso zzso c of zzso coli zzso zzso in which the essential zzso has been switched from zzso 61 of the second zzso zzso zzso to zzso 24 of the first zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As in the case of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso c forms a hairpin of two extended zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso forming a connecting loop at the center of the zzso The structure was determined at pH 5, where zzso is fully zzso The relative orientation of the two extended zzso in the zzso structure is different from that in the zzso form of the zzso zzso also determined at pH zzso The zzso zzso is rotated by 150 degrees relative to the zzso structure, and the zzso zzso is rotated such that the essential zzso zzso group packs on the same side of the zzso as zzso in the zzso zzso The changes in zzso orientation lead to a structure that is quite similar to that of the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso determined at pH zzso When a zzso ring of c zzso was modeled from the new structure, the zzso zzso group was found to pack in a cavity at the interface between two zzso that is similar to the cavity in which zzso of the zzso protein is predicted to zzso The interacting faces of the packed zzso in this model are also similar to those in the zzso zzso The results provide further evidence that zzso c is likely to fold in at least two zzso states differing most notably in the orientation of the zzso zzso Based upon the structure, a zzso model is discussed that indicates how the zzso and zzso zzso could zzso similar zzso movements during zzso zzso rotation of the zzso c zzso
