The zzso sequence was determined of a zzso zzso DNA zzso located at approximately 35 zzso to the right of the zzso of zzso VI from zzso zzso Analysis revealed the presence of a zzso zzso part of a delta element and a remarkable zzso zzso The longest open reading frame found encodes a putative protein of 195 zzso zzso Although the zzso was isolated by zzso to a human zzso zzso zzso no evidence was obtained for the presence of a gene zzso zzso zzso
