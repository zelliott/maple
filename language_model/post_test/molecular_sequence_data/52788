zzso sodium channels perform critical roles for electrical signaling in the nervous system by generating action zzso in zzso and in zzso At least 10 genes zzso sodium channels in zzso but specific zzso roles that distinguish each of these zzso are not zzso One possibility is that each zzso is expressed in a restricted set of cell types or is targeted to a specific domain of a zzso or muscle zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso is highly concentrated at zzso of zzso of both sensory and motor zzso in the peripheral nervous system and at zzso in the central nervous zzso The specificity of this zzso was also demonstrated with the zzso mouse zzso strain zzso whose zzso were negative for zzso zzso Both the intensity of labeling and the failure of other zzso zzso to label zzso suggest that zzso is the zzso channel type in this zzso In the central nervous system, zzso is localized in zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso and is strongly expressed in zzso of cortical zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that labeling in zzso is both zzso and on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling was observed at both zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso Thus, a single sodium channel zzso is targeted to different zzso zzso and can influence both zzso zzso and synaptic zzso
