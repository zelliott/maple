The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is composed of the zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso the membrane component zzso and the zzso protein zzso In order to dissect the molecular interactions initiating the transport process, zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso were zzso These zzso are localized in two regions of zzso which are zzso to zzso or zzso domain zzso of zzso suggesting that there are two distinct regions of zzso each interacting with one of the two zzso of zzso To demonstrate that these two regions provide a zzso binding surface for zzso we constructed a zzso zzso in which two genes are joined zzso from head to tail with the addition of a zzso The zzso zzso protein is stable and functional in growth and zzso zzso By exploiting the zzso specificity between the zzso zzso and their zzso we generated all zzso combinations in a single zzso plus the zzso zzso zzso Their zzso are consistent with the proposal that the binding protein module interacts zzso with zzso zzso The mode of association proposed here for the zzso transport components could be extended to other ABC zzso with similar structural zzso
