In some patients, zzso coli strains establish significant zzso without causing symptoms of urinary tract infection zzso These zzso zzso strains have been shown to express fewer zzso factors than the zzso zzso coli zzso strains that cause zzso symptomatic zzso Paradoxically, zzso strains carry many typical zzso zzso zzso and the molecular basis of their low zzso therefore remains zzso This study examined whether zzso strains might evolve from zzso by zzso loss and zzso gene zzso The presence of zzso zzso coli K-12 genes was examined using an zzso coli K-12 strain zzso DNA array and the distribution of zzso zzso genes was examined with the zzso coli zzso Two groups of strains could be zzso Several zzso strains were shown by zzso sequence typing and by comparative zzso analyses to be related to zzso but to have smaller zzso zzso There were significant zzso in essential zzso zzso including reductive evolution by point zzso DNA zzso and zzso Other strains were unrelated to zzso and lacked most of the zzso zzso The results suggest that some zzso strains arise from virulent strains by zzso of zzso genes while others are zzso and resemble zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso might constitute a general mechanism for zzso pathogens to evolve toward zzso
