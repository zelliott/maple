zzso zzso zzso produce a black zzso zzso causing a deep stain in zzso zzso We exploited the zzso of zzso zzso to clone zzso a gene responsible for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso has two zzso near its zzso end and encodes a zzso acid zzso with five functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso carrier proteins and a zzso zzso A gene disruption construct designed to replace a portion of zzso with a zzso resistance cassette was transformed into zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had an zzso zzso and pigmentation was restored by the addition of zzso a zzso zzso zzso The disruption of zzso and restoration of pigmentation with zzso confirmed the presence of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso The transformation method described in this paper is the first reported for a zzso zzso
