During zzso zzso development, the zzso pattern of many cell lineages is specified by graded activity of the zzso gene zzso Here we demonstrate that a zzso zzso in zzso protein is generated zzso by multiple elements in the zzso zzso that are regulated by the zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso is both necessary and sufficient to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of the zzso zzso is zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Among the zzso sequences are seven elements that are each complementary to the zzso zzso A reporter gene bearing three of these elements shows partial zzso zzso zzso These data suggest a molecular mechanism for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso base pair to sites in the zzso zzso to form multiple zzso duplexes that zzso zzso zzso
