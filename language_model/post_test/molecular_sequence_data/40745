The present work provides the first zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso magnetic zzso in rolling circle amplified zzso was studied by complex zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso and a statistical analysis of the number of beads zzso to the zzso was zzso The average number of beads per zzso using the results from both methods was found to be around 6 and slightly above 2 for samples with 40 and 130 zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis supported an earlier hypothesis that 40 zzso beads are preferably immobilized in the interior of zzso whereas 130 zzso zzso to a larger extent, are immobilized closer to the exterior of the zzso The methodology demonstrated in the present work should open up new possibilities for characterization of interactions of a large variety of zzso zzso with zzso useful for gaining more fundamental understanding of such interactions as well as for zzso a number of zzso zzso
