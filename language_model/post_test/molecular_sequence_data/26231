The zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso becomes transforming if zzso acid zzso are made at critical positions in the zzso chain, zzso at zzso 12, zzso 13, Ala 59, zzso 61 and zzso zzso Most of these zzso occur in two zzso loop regions, zzso zzso 20, zzso designated as segment 1, and zzso zzso 67, zzso zzso as segment zzso These two segments are zzso to two corresponding regions in the two zzso zzso binding zzso bacterial zzso factor zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso to segment 1; His zzso 92 zzso to segment 2) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso to segment 1 and zzso zzso 107 zzso to segment zzso We find that the zzso of the segment 1 region in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are similar to one another and that the zzso of the segment 2 region of zzso is zzso on that of segment 2 of zzso Furthermore, the relative position of the two segments in zzso is zzso similar to that of the two segments in zzso In the originally proposed X-ray structure for the zzso zzso the zzso of segment 2 in the zzso protein is not similar to that found for the other two zzso and its disposition relative to segment 1 and the remainder of the protein is also different from that observed for the other two zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
