High level bacterial resistance to zzso is generally due to zzso of the zzso in a reaction zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso A is the zzso zzso The crystal structure of the type III zzso from zzso coli with zzso bound has been determined and refined at zzso A resolution, using a restrained zzso zzso space least squares zzso The refined model, which includes zzso 204 zzso molecules and two zzso zzso has a zzso zzso of zzso for zzso reflections between 6 and zzso A zzso The zzso zzso in bond lengths from ideal values is zzso zzso The zzso zzso play a crucial role in stabilizing the packing of the zzso in the crystal zzso zzso is a zzso of identical zzso zzso Mr zzso and the zzso structure is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds, some of which result in the extension of a zzso across the zzso zzso zzso binds in a deep pocket located at the boundary between adjacent zzso of the zzso such that the majority of zzso forming the binding pocket belong to one zzso while the zzso essential zzso belongs to the adjacent zzso zzso is appropriately positioned to act as a general base catalyst in the reaction, and the required zzso stabilization is provided by an unusual interaction with a zzso zzso zzso
