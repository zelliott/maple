The zzso zinc finger proteins form one of the largest families of zzso regulators in zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso zinc finger zzso that is highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso of zzso zzso containing the zzso promoter fused to the zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso activity was highly induced in the zzso zzso zzso stage and zzso after zzso To zzso the function of zzso its expression was silenced by introducing zzso zzso into P zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit altered cell size or zzso of zzso and zzso however, zzso growth rate was reduced by around 50% in the zzso zzso zzso were also impaired in production of zzso swimming zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the gene is involved in various stages of the life zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso lost zzso on host soybean zzso Our results suggest that this zzso zzso zinc finger protein plays an important role in growth, development, and zzso therefore, zzso might be an attractive zzso target for chemical zzso zzso
