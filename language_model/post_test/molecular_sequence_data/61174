During maturation of zzso brain, zzso of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and core zzso zzso zzso proteins accumulate in nerve zzso As the concentration of the corresponding transcripts zzso in zzso cells, even if the genes are actively zzso it is likely that regulation of zzso zzso expression has relevant zzso components and that cellular factors affect zzso zzso stability and/or zzso Here we report that zzso a protein that is highly enriched in the rat brain and contains a zzso domain, binds with high specificity to the transcripts that zzso zzso degrees and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are bound through the very end of their zzso region that encompasses the zzso zzso Although zzso is present both in the zzso and the nucleus of nerve cells, zzso complexes can be obtained only from nuclear zzso The results of two-dimensional zzso analysis suggest that a relevant proportion of nuclear zzso is more zzso than expected, thus suggesting that its zzso binding activity might be modulated by zzso zzso such as zzso
