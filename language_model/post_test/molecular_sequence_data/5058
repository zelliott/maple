Four fatty acid binding proteins zzso have been described in 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso form a zzso family of zzso proteins widely distributed in zzso zzso the function of which is still poorly zzso These zzso proteins have recently received attention, since there are reports to indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be protective zzso In addition, these proteins could play a major role in the zzso zzso because zzso are unable to zzso de zzso most of their zzso We have undertaken zzso and structural analyses of zzso zzso in an attempt to characterize features of biological zzso zzso these zzso appear to be more closely related to those of zzso heart, zzso zzso muscle, zzso skin, brain and zzso although no clear functional relationships were established between zzso We describe several zzso motifs characteristic of specific groups of zzso zzso flexibility and accessibility analyses revealed several major putative zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso that appear to be zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso structure zzso by molecular zzso
