We investigate the genetic structure and molecular selection pattern of a zzso population of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These bacteria fix nitrogen in association with plants of the zzso zzso A set of 116 zzso were obtained from a soil sample, from root zzso of three groups of plants representing zzso zzso and zzso diversity in the zzso zzso zzso were characterized by sequencing at seven zzso evenly distributed along the zzso of both zzso species, covering the zzso and the two zzso We first test whether the diversity of host plants influence the bacterial diversity zzso Using the same data set, we then zzso the selective pattern at each zzso There was no relationship between the diversity of zzso plants that were used for sampling and the diversity of their zzso However, we found evidence of selection within each of the two main symbiotic regions, located on the two different zzso zzso selection or a selective sweep was found to occur in the nod zzso region, which includes genes involved in zzso zzso whereas balancing selection was detected in the zzso region, close to genes involved in zzso zzso Such pattern likely reflects the interaction between host plants and bacterial zzso with a possible conflict of interest between plants and zzso bacterial zzso zzso appears to occur zzso within and among zzso located on zzso rather than within the zzso Thus, zzso may play an important role in resolving this conflict by allowing different selection patterns at different zzso
