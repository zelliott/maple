zzso is a zzso zzso family member that drives the zzso response to a diversity of cellular zzso Deciphering the spectrum of zzso interactions that zzso its zzso zzso properties remains a high priority zzso Here, we report the synthesis of zzso zzso structurally stabilized zzso zzso zzso that, in addition to broadly targeting zzso zzso directly bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso engage zzso trigger site on zzso to initiate its functional zzso We further demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso analog zzso zzso in zzso cells and, like expressed zzso zzso engages zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we find that zzso zzso is a dual zzso inhibitor and zzso direct zzso and its zzso may serve as effective zzso triggers of zzso in resistant human zzso
