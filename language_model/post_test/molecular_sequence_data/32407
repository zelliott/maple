zzso alternative zzso zzso is largely included in zzso zzso cells of the developing limb zzso whereas the zzso is excluded in differentiated zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells is increased by zzso of zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso but not zzso zzso analysis using real-time zzso revealed that the levels of the zzso for these three proteins did not vary significantly in chick zzso versus zzso cells of the developing limb zzso However, a zzso spliced form of zzso zzso zzso is detected zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso but not zzso enhanced zzso differentiation of chick limb zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which produces a truncated form of zzso also was strongly zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso fails to substitute for zzso in zzso an increase in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the latter event is not essential for the zzso zzso These results demonstrate the ability of these highly zzso zzso factors to zzso zzso and are consistent with earlier results that implicated zzso zzso zzso of zzso in formation of zzso zzso
