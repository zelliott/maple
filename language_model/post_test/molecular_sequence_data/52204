The human beta 2 zzso zzso is a type zzso membrane zzso It has a putative zzso zzso but lacks an zzso zzso signal zzso The mechanism by which the zzso zzso of the beta 2 zzso is zzso across the zzso zzso membrane is zzso Furthermore, it is not known if zzso as a type zzso protein is essential for the proper zzso Our studies indicate that conversion of beta 2 zzso from a type zzso to a type zzso membrane protein by introducing an zzso zzso signal sequence enhances zzso of the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso expression of functional zzso
