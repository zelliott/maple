zzso coli zzso is a gastrointestinal pathogen that has become a serious public health concern, as it is associated with outbreaks and severe diseases such as zzso zzso The molecular basis of its greater zzso than that of other zzso is not completely zzso zzso is a putative zzso zzso island that is found almost exclusively in zzso zzso zzso zzso coli strains and may be associated with the enhanced zzso of these zzso In this study, we identified and characterized a novel zzso of zzso synthesis zzso by zzso We showed that deletion of zzso increased the zzso of zzso coli zzso which correlated with an increase in zzso production and enhanced assembly of zzso on the cell zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso inhibited zzso We demonstrated that zzso exerted its regulatory effects downstream of the zzso and translation of zzso but prior to the zzso of class zzso zzso Furthermore, the master regulator of zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso associated with elevated levels of zzso finding consistent with zzso being a potential regulatory zzso This work provides insight into the mechanism by which zzso which we have named zzso zzso zzso synthesis and is the first report of a zzso inhibitor of zzso in zzso coli zzso
