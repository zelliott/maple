A set of zzso expression zzso system has been developed for zzso of proteins in zzso zzso These zzso contain a strong zzso promoter, different drug resistant zzso and an origin of DNA replication from a different zzso group, allowing combinations of these plasmids to be zzso maintained zzso In addition, these plasmids also contain the zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a 3' zzso zzso zzso affinity tag zzso for easy zzso of target zzso All of these zzso contain an identical zzso cassette flanked by suitable restriction zzso zzso sites for easy cloning and shuttling among different zzso This cassette incorporates a zzso cloning zzso site for zzso zzso an optimal zzso binding site for efficient protein translation, and a zzso His affinity tag for protein zzso zzso any zzso coli expression zzso of choice can be easily converted to zzso type expression zzso by shuttling the cassette using the restriction zzso zzso sites at the zzso We have demonstrated the expression capabilities of these zzso by zzso three bacterial zzso zzso and zzso and also two other zzso proteins zzso and zzso We further show that zzso zzso forms soluble protein complexes that can be zzso for further zzso
