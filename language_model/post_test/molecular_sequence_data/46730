We have cloned and characterized a novel zinc finger zzso termed zzso zzso contains four zzso zinc finger motifs that are connected by long zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso tested and zzso in the nucleus, primarily the zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso or zzso hybrids rather than zzso zzso of individual zinc finger motifs reveals that the zinc finger zzso are not only essential for zzso binding but are also required for its zzso zzso which demonstrates a complex trafficking mechanism dependent on the zzso zzso capability of the zzso Furthermore, forced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may belong to a class of zinc finger proteins that features zzso binding and may regulate cell growth via the unique zzso binding zzso
