zzso a recently discovered zzso zzso expressed at high levels on zzso within the marginal zone of the zzso mediates the zzso of zzso zzso by these zzso We now find that zzso zzso zzso are rapidly cleared by these zzso from the zzso and that capture also takes place when different cell lines express zzso after zzso To assess the role of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the interaction of zzso with zzso we first studied binding and zzso of zzso 14 zzso in zzso zzso zzso was observed and was of a much higher zzso zzso for zzso 14 than zzso The zzso from four different zzso were also cleared by marginal zone zzso in zzso To establish a role for zzso in this zzso we selectively zzso expression of the zzso by zzso of the mice with zzso zzso including a newly generated zzso zzso called zzso For several days after this transient zzso the marginal zone zzso were unable to take up either zzso or zzso zzso marginal zone zzso in mice have a zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso setting the stage for further studies of the functional consequences of this zzso
