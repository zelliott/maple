zzso for evaluating the establishment of zzso based on their sensitivity or resistance to zzso zzso zzso patterns and zzso generated fingerprints were zzso Four selected strains zzso from zzso zzso of diverse zzso have shown potential as zzso and exhibited plant growth promoting zzso Different responses were obtained on screening against 40 zzso which aided in developing zzso zzso markers for each zzso zzso profiles generated using standardized zzso identification system (including zzso zzso zzso revealed that 53 % of the zzso tested were not zzso by any strain, while some strains exhibited unique ability for zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based amplification profiles developed using a number of zzso based on repeat sequences revealed the utility of 3 zzso in providing unique fingerprints for the zzso
