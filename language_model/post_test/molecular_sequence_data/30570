Human zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso is a zzso zzso protein which shows strong sequence similarity with the zzso zzso zzso zzso To better understand the role of zzso beta G in pregnancy, we examined its synthesis and regulation in zzso zzso which had been shown to express the zzso beta G zzso The major zzso zzso beta G is a zzso zzso while the major zzso zzso beta G is a zzso zzso Administration of sodium zzso to these zzso slightly zzso the synthesis of the zzso species but markedly increased the production of two additional zzso beta zzso of 72 and 48 zzso The similarity between the zzso beta zzso zzso by zzso zzso and human zzso was confirmed by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso directed the synthesis of two zzso of 48 and 36 zzso which form the zzso backbone of the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the predicted molecular weights of zzso beta zzso zzso by the two types of zzso beta G zzso clones were zzso and zzso Most zzso beta G zzso identified to date, including the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated in this laboratory, share strong sequence similarity at the zzso region zzso zzso but differ in sequences at their 3' zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which identify the majority of zzso beta G zzso zzso with three zzso beta G zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso levels of all three zzso zzso protection analysis showed that zzso increased the zzso beta G zzso containing the zzso or zzso sequence to approximately zzso of human zzso zzso However, unlike human term zzso which predominantly expressed zzso beta G zzso with zzso similar to zzso the zzso zzso expressed roughly equal levels of zzso beta G zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso All zzso beta G zzso identified zzso proteins with distinct zzso zzso suggesting that the composition of the zzso species in zzso and zzso zzso is likely to be zzso zzso zzso provide a unique model for the study of the mechanisms responsible for the differential expression of the zzso beta G zzso
