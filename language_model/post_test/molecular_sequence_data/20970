This study uses sequences from four zzso which are involved in the formation of the type III zzso apparatus, to determine the role of horizontal gene transfer in the evolution of zzso genes for the zzso plant zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were compared zzso with one another, zzso with sequences of zzso animal zzso and zzso with sequences of plant zzso gamma and beta zzso to evaluate probable paths of lateral exchange leading to the current distribution of zzso zzso among these zzso zzso were reconstructed based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences using zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were also compared with several zzso gene zzso in order to evaluate patterns of lateral versus vertical zzso The resulting zzso suggest that multiple horizontal gene transfer events have occurred both within and among the zzso plant pathogens and plant zzso gamma and beta zzso zzso sequences are the most similar, exhibiting anywhere from 2 to 50 % variation at the zzso level, with the highest degree of variation present between plant and animal pathogen zzso zzso sequences are zzso among plant and animal pathogens at the N zzso The zzso domain is zzso only among the zzso plant zzso as are the zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso sequence zzso suggest that at least some type III zzso system zzso genes from zzso plant pathogens are related more closely to those of the zzso zzso a conclusion neither supported nor zzso by zzso or zzso
