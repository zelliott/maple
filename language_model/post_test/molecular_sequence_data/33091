zzso of zzso zzso into the host zzso is a crucial step for viral zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end of the viral zzso zzso are zzso by the viral zzso zzso zzso As IN plays a crucial role in the early stages of the zzso life cycle, zzso zzso of IN is an attractive strategy for therapeutic zzso In this study, we used the zzso junctions of zzso DNA as a model to design zinc finger protein zzso targeting at the end terminal portion of zzso zzso A zzso zzso namely zzso was designed using zinc finger zzso The designed motif was expressed and zzso from zzso coli to determine its binding zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso was used to determine the binding affinity of zzso to its target zzso The level of zzso constant zzso was zzso zzso The competitive zzso confirmed that zzso specifically zzso with its target zzso The qualitative binding activity was subsequently determined by zzso and demonstrated the aforementioned zzso In addition, molecular modeling and binding energy analyses were carried out to provide structural insight into the binding of zzso to the specific and zzso DNA zzso It is suggested that zzso interactions play a key role in the DNA recognition mechanisms of the designed zzso Our study suggested an alternative zzso therapeutic strategy using zzso interference of the zzso integration zzso
