We have cloned three novel zzso genes using zzso that recognize only zzso of the male zzso zzso and zzso cells of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of each clone shows only between zzso and 50% identity with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso core zzso of other plant zzso zzso of these genes were first detected in zzso zzso soon after zzso zzso and their zzso as revealed by in zzso zzso were observed only in the zzso of the zzso zzso As expression of these three genes was specific to zzso cells within the zzso zzso we designated the clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso further revealed that the proteins zzso by these genes accumulated in the zzso and condensing zzso nucleus during development of zzso zzso and were most abundant in the two zzso zzso within an zzso zzso zzso We therefore propose that these male zzso core zzso contribute to zzso zzso of male zzso or to zzso zzso and result in the repression of gene expression in male zzso
