The zzso zzso gene is required for zzso of wingless and other zzso zzso and sporadic zzso in its unique human zzso zzso cause a zzso zzso dominant disorder, focal zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso We generated a conditional zzso of the zzso mouse zzso gene and analyzed its requirement in zzso signaling and embryonic zzso We find that zzso cells exhibit a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso but remain responsive to zzso zzso zzso with the zzso inheritance pattern of zzso zzso zzso male zzso arrest during early zzso and fail to generate zzso a zzso previously associated with loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso females exhibit a spectrum of zzso skin, and body patterning abnormalities resembling those observed in human patients with zzso Many of these defects are zzso by zzso deletion of zzso zzso a long-standing hypothesis regarding the zzso of human zzso and extending previous studies that have focused on downstream elements of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso deletion of zzso thus provides an experimental model of zzso as well as a valuable tool to probe zzso zzso function in zzso
