The zzso clock system instructs zzso zzso on gene expression in essentially all cells, including zzso and zzso mechanisms may participate in this zzso The aim of this research was to investigate the influence of obesity and zzso syndrome zzso features in clock gene zzso and the involvement of these zzso modifications in the zzso Sixty zzso overweight and obese women followed a zzso weight reduction zzso DNA zzso levels at different zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso genes were analyzed by zzso zzso in white blood cells obtained before the zzso zzso differences between zzso and overweight + obese subjects were found in the zzso status of different zzso sites of zzso zzso 1, zzso 8 and zzso and, with lower statistical significance, in zzso zzso 6-7, 8, 15 and zzso The zzso pattern of different zzso sites of the three genes showed significant associations with zzso parameters such as body mass index and zzso and with a zzso zzso Moreover, the baseline zzso levels of zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 2-3 and 25 correlated with the magnitude of weight zzso Interestingly, the percentage of zzso of zzso zzso 1 and 8 showed associations with the intake of zzso and zzso fatty zzso This study demonstrates for the first time an association between zzso status of zzso sites located in clock genes zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and weight zzso Moreover, the zzso status of different zzso sites in zzso and zzso could be used as zzso of weight-loss success, particularly zzso zzso zzso
