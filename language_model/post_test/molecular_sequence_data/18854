The zzso finger zzso zzso are involved in the zzso degradation of cell cycle regulators and play an important role in zzso zzso 4 zzso is a zzso core component of a new class of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of several regulatory proteins through the zzso zzso The zzso zzso two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the two zzso genes are functionally zzso However, zzso or other zzso only contain one zzso zzso Here we cloned the zzso gene and confirmed that there is only one protein of zzso in zzso zzso a full length zzso comprised of zzso zzso an zzso frame of zzso zzso 790 zzso acid zzso The expression level of zzso zzso as demonstrated by quantitative real-time zzso varied significantly during zzso development, with the greatest transcript levels found at an early zzso zzso analysis using zzso against zzso in the zzso system showed that zzso mainly distribute in zzso and primary zzso and gradually reduced during the development and maturation of zzso The results indicated that a single zzso protein may play a role in zzso in zzso zzso
