The zzso motif zzso proteins are involved in a variety of cellular functions including cell zzso zzso development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we report the identification and characterization of an Atlantic cod zzso zzso protein named zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The Atlantic cod zzso zzso has a predicted open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso The zzso region contains the three motifs typical of zzso zzso a zzso finger, one zzso and a zzso domain, which together form the zzso motif found in this large family of zzso whereas the zzso region contains a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells showed mostly diffuse zzso with some discrete compartments in the zzso The induction of zzso transcripts by zzso zzso was seen in zzso using quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern indicates that zzso is involved in zzso immune response in Atlantic zzso
