zzso is present to various degrees in many foods, and zzso in fish samples are considered a good indicator of freshness and hygienic food zzso Seeking for innovative methods to zzso zzso in foods, we used a synthetic gene designed on the sequence of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso as the starting point in this study to develop a zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli cells with a yield of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxidized zzso and zzso whereas it was inactive toward zzso and zzso zzso zzso present in fish zzso The putative zzso involved in zzso binding were identified by an in zzso zzso procedure based on a model of the structure of zzso zzso zzso was performed on 8 zzso The most significant changes in kinetic properties were observed for the zzso zzso this zzso showed higher zzso affinity and lower zzso zzso by zzso than zzso zzso zzso prototypes were produced using both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These zzso showed a good sensitivity and selectivity with respect to zzso zzso present in food zzso zzso the zzso zzso was successfully used to assess zzso in fish samples, yielding values in good agreement with those obtained by zzso analyses but in a few seconds and at a significantly lower cost per zzso
