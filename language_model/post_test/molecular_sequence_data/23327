It has been estimated that less than zzso of the zzso in nature can be cultivated by conventional zzso Thus, the classical approach of zzso zzso from pure cultures allows the analysis of only a subset of the total naturally occurring zzso in environmental samples enriched in zzso To isolate useful microbial zzso from zzso soil zzso a zzso was isolated from soil samples, and a zzso library was constructed by using the zzso zzso The library was screened for zzso activity, and one clone from among approximately 30,000 zzso zzso coli clones showed zzso zzso zzso of the clone revealed a novel zzso zzso expressed from a novel zzso The putative zzso gene zzso was zzso and zzso for zzso zzso conditions for the zzso activity of the zzso protein were 42 degrees C and pH zzso zzso stabilized the zzso The zzso zzso soluble starch and zzso to produce high levels of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso The zzso showed a high zzso activity, making zzso 4) linkages zzso The zzso and zzso properties of zzso suggest that it has novel characteristics and can be regarded as an intermediate type of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
