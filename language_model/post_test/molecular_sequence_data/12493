The central zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is composed of the zzso protein zzso zzso a protein related to zzso and the product of the newly cloned zzso zzso zzso assembles autonomously on the upstream promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso through the interaction of its zzso zzso with a consensus zzso box located at base pair zzso As both the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso box are nearly twofold symmetrical, we have examined how the binding polarity of zzso is zzso We find that zzso can bind to the zzso promoter in both directions, that zzso is unable to discern the natural polarity of the zzso element and that, as a consequence, the zzso zzso box is functionally zzso A modest preference for zzso binding in the natural direction of the zzso promoter is instead dictated by zzso zzso Because the assembly of zzso on the zzso zzso gene in zzso occurs via a zzso zzso we investigated the influence of zzso on the binding polarity of zzso zzso places zzso on the promoter in one direction only; thus, it is zzso that primarily specifies the direction of zzso zzso using zzso zzso with the altered DNA specificity zzso zzso demonstrate that in the zzso promoter complex, the zzso repeat of zzso contacts the upstream half of the zzso zzso This orientation of zzso zzso in Pol III zzso zzso is the same as in Pol II zzso zzso and in zzso complexes that have been analyzed by X-ray zzso
