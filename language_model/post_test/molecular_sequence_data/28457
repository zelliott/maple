The interaction of zzso zzso with lipids has been followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso to BK or its analogue zzso enhances the relative zzso intensity of zzso zzso at 288 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso has been used to zzso the interactions in terms of zzso and equilibrium zzso zzso method of continuous variation for the zzso interaction gave a zzso of zzso for the zzso The value of the equilibrium constant, K, for the interaction of either BK or zzso with zzso is zzso zzso The zzso interaction is zzso K zzso zzso zzso Although zzso forces no doubt play a major role in these zzso zzso on the model zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso of BK are disposed in the zzso environment provided by the zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso show that there is no change in its zzso ratio upon interaction with zzso The increase in the relative zzso intensity of BK accompanying its cooperative interaction with sodium zzso zzso zzso implicates the role of zzso forces in this interaction as zzso These results bear on the interpretation of the changes in circular zzso zzso of BK caused by zzso
