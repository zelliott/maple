zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are becoming increasingly important to clinical assessment of the zzso disease of the zzso A spectrum of zzso is necessary to establish comprehensive zzso to zzso relationship relevant to diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso We aimed to append to the increasing database of these zzso zzso and, therefore, analyzed DNA from tumor tissue and zzso DNA from a patient with zzso zzso zzso screening and sequence characterization of the zzso zzso was performed to include part of the zzso zzso We report a zzso sequence zzso in DNA from the patient diagnosed with zzso zzso zzso The zzso presented not as fully developed zzso zzso zzso but as zzso zzso with tendency to evolve into zzso We characterized the sequence zzso located in the zzso 10 of the zzso zzso as an A to G substitution zzso zzso + zzso The described sequence zzso generates a zzso sequence surrounded by several zzso sequences with zzso zzso Such zzso may be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso via zzso zzso through zzso zzso in the process of tumor zzso This result further zzso the importance of the database zzso specific sequence variations in the zzso gene with distinct disease zzso
