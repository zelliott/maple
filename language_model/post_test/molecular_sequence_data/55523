The zzso is a zzso zzso complex that conveys environmental signals to the zzso stress factor of zzso zzso A functionally zzso complex contains multiple copies of three zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins are zzso in different zzso contexts in diverse bacteria, forming a versatile sensing and transmission module called zzso after its common zzso However, the signaling zzso within the zzso itself is not well zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso project from the zzso and are presumed to channel sensory input to the zzso zzso zzso that form the complex zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso connects these zzso We zzso the in zzso role of the zzso using zzso scanning zzso zzso zzso output in zzso zzso via a zzso reporter zzso zzso at four zzso zzso increased output zzso to zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso at four zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso The zzso of these effects supports a model in which zzso functions as a zzso in zzso with the zzso forming parallel paired zzso via a zzso zzso The zzso further suggests that the opposite, zzso faces make additional contacts important for efficient zzso zzso These results establish that the zzso influences zzso output under zzso zzso However, the stress response zzso of representative zzso zzso provide less support for the notion that the zzso zzso domain senses acute environmental challenge and zzso this information via the zzso zzso
