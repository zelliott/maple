zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein expressed predominantly in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The biological activities of this protein are not zzso however, the presence of a zzso zzso motif in its zzso acid sequence suggests that this protein might interact with other proteins harboring a zzso zzso zzso In this study we found by means of a zzso zzso system, zzso overlay zzso and zzso zzso that zzso interacts with a nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso X in zzso zzso cells by zzso caused abnormal zzso changes in the nucleus and induced cell zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso with zzso X prevented nuclear zzso changes and cell death in zzso zzso zzso X, which is thought to be functionally related to the cell cycle and cell growth, may be regulated by zzso in zzso zzso
