zzso research has been conducted on influenza zzso virus to determine the zzso zzso Limited information on characteristics of pandemic virus has become available in Turkey since the zzso In this first report from Turkey, we investigated the molecular markers that have been associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso We also conducted zzso studies in people after infection, zzso exposure, and zzso controls to determine the level of protection against the pandemic zzso influenza zzso Thirteen zzso positive samples were analyzed for presence of zzso that have been associated with host range, zzso and zzso zzso substitution zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, 135 serum samples from zzso recovered, zzso zzso and control individuals were tested using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso samples from two severe zzso No specified zzso in the zzso and zzso were zzso Additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso were zzso zzso testing from vaccinated individuals, recovered patients, zzso zzso and control individuals showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers promoting influenza zzso to become a pandemic virus are still under zzso zzso results confirm that younger, zzso individuals are at increased risk of pandemic virus zzso zzso zzso viruses are still in circulation around the zzso zzso these viruses need to be monitored closely for development of new markers including zzso resistance zzso
