Although the gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso is not present in all zzso the DNA both upstream and downstream of zzso is present in all zzso zzso Using zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and template DNA from zzso strains that do not zzso zzso we amplified a zzso zzso These results illustrate that the zzso regions upstream and downstream of zzso are zzso in strains that do not zzso zzso Using zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso DNA together with zzso corresponding to the zzso and 3' ends of zzso we also amplified DNA fragments containing the junctions between the zzso genetic element and the zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons of the amplification products from four zzso negative and four zzso positive strains revealed that zzso is within a discrete genetic element that extends 202 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso and 100 zzso downstream of the zzso stop zzso zzso analysis of the ends of the zzso element did not reveal any of the repeats characteristic of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be part of a larger element zzso a zzso that may or may not contain zzso zzso zzso may be a subject to a precise zzso event resulting in its deletion from the zzso Based on sequence analysis of the zzso DNA amplified from strains that do not zzso zzso the presence of a zzso genetic element does not disrupt an zzso
