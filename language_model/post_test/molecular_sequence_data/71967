zzso virus zzso is an zzso that is the zzso agent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso open reading frame 5 zzso encodes zzso K zzso which is zzso among zzso While zzso zzso has not been zzso and its role in viral replication is unknown, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso virus zzso have been well zzso To identify the zzso zzso gene product, we raised a zzso zzso against a fusion protein of zzso zzso 25 to 122 with zzso zzso and used it to study the protein in infected zzso A zzso protein was detected in zzso virus by Western zzso In zzso electron microscopic studies, zzso zzso was in enveloped zzso and was evenly distributed in the zzso in infected zzso To determine the function of zzso zzso in virus growth, a series of zzso deletion zzso were constructed with zzso zzso DNA derived from the zzso zzso Full and partial deletions in zzso prevented viral replication when the zzso zzso zzso were zzso into melanoma zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene into the zzso zzso zzso site did not compensate for the deletion of zzso zzso The replacement of zzso zzso at a zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso restored the zzso characteristics of intact zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso cells zzso with a full zzso deletion zzso exhibited viral plaques indistinguishable from those of zzso Our results are consistent with the studies of zzso proteins of zzso and zzso showing that zzso is indispensable for viral zzso
