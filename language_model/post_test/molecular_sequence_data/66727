In order to identify the zzso zzso domain, a three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso regulation protein from zzso coli zzso zzso was determined using zzso modeling and energy zzso The zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso motif on the zzso domain, followed by another zzso zzso and two zzso separated by a turn which forms the zzso The zzso domain, separated by a long zzso from the zzso and consisting of two anti parallel beta zzso and a zzso zzso zzso in central domain were found to aid the zzso formation, zzso zzso as evident in the calculated zzso this region is rich in zzso zzso Most interactions occur between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with closest contacts occurring at zzso zzso These zzso are part of an zzso zzso near the zzso Upon raising the zzso concentration the binding of zzso zzso to DNA was zzso this was evident when, the zzso zzso zzso was zzso onto DNA zzso zzso (it was found to bind the zzso zzso and upon addition of zzso the zzso near the zzso bound to the major groove of the zzso zzso of high zzso concentration triggered further zzso changes in the zzso zzso as was measured by distances between the two zzso zzso zzso the zzso binding to DNA by attaching itself to the zzso At the same time DNA changed zzso as was evident in the distortion in the backbone and the shrinking of major groove distance from zzso to zzso Two major zzso sites were observed on the zzso zzso site 1, the traditional zzso site, the cavity contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His 145 and His 143 at distances range from zzso to zzso Site 2 enclave consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at very close proximity to zzso The closest contacts between zzso zzso and DNA at the zzso region were at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mostly zzso zzso near the zzso zzso Close contacts repeated at zzso zzso and zzso and a third region near the zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has three major contact regions with DNA, the first on the zzso domain, a second smaller region at zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso and a third region on the zzso domain consisting mainly of zzso contacts and zzso by zzso zzso at high zzso
