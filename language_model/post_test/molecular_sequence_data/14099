The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit DNA repair deficiencies and distinct zzso zzso DNA replication past zzso spontaneous damage might contribute to the zzso of these zzso Because zzso is thought to zzso a DNA zzso that specializes in zzso zzso we determined the zzso dependence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso locus was examined in zzso strains having combinations of normal or zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso rate increase relied zzso but not exclusively, on zzso whereas the zzso zzso was entirely zzso zzso The influence of zzso on the specificity of the zzso zzso differed markedly depending on the zzso class zzso However, the requirement of zzso for the production of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso which zzso only these zzso was similar to that for zzso zzso zzso This supports a role for the zzso protein complex in the control of spontaneous zzso The available data imply that the putative zzso zzso can process a variety of spontaneous DNA zzso that normally are zzso for zzso zzso
