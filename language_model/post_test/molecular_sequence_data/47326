In this study we report the full length zzso zzso sequence of two Australian bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the partial sequence of a third zzso zzso which are the prototypes of the three major zzso groups of zzso in zzso Australian zzso zzso have not previously been related to the international zzso of zzso into the major zzso zzso and zzso The sequences of the three representative Australian zzso were compared to the full length sequence of a Northern Ireland isolate zzso classified as zzso as well as two partial sequences of zzso from the United States and the United Kingdom classified as zzso All three Australian zzso were classified as zzso on the basis of closer zzso and zzso acid similarity to the zzso and zzso proteins of zzso than to the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso identity in the zzso and zzso versus zzso zzso acid identity in the zzso zzso These results indicate that most if not all Australian zzso are zzso The remainder of the zzso which encodes zzso proteins involved in viral zzso showed high sequence zzso as has been observed among such genes in other zzso A system for full-length amplification of zzso zzso was also developed and the zzso isolate was cloned to obtain a zzso infectious DNA copy of the zzso zzso When zzso transcripts of zzso amplification products were zzso into zzso cells infectious particles were zzso These virus particles were identical to the original virus zzso This system can be used as a basis for the development of zzso vaccines as well in further molecular studies of bovine zzso
