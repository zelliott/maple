The zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data have suggested that this negative regulation requires an intact zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso Since zzso zzso recognize zzso it is possible that these two zzso zzso associate, and thereby repress zzso zzso zzso zzso with this model, an isolated zzso zzso domain expressed in bacteria as a zzso fusion protein bound in zzso to a synthetic zzso zzso modeled on the zzso 13 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was absolutely dependent on zzso of zzso in the tail zzso and was modified by both the length and sequence of the zzso Competition experiments indicated only a moderate binding affinity between the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso A distinct zzso zzso previously identified as binding the zzso zzso domain with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso possibly by competing with the zzso tail zzso site for binding to the zzso zzso Indeed, this zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso These data provide direct evidence that the zzso tail has an intrinsic affinity for the zzso zzso domain, and suggest that such an interaction in the intact zzso contributes to maintaining zzso in an inactive zzso
