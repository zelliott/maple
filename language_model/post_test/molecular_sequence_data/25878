zzso regions zzso of the major zzso of zzso zzso were exploited for zzso of foreign zzso Two zzso zzso were created that contain a unique cloning site in zzso or zzso zzso Several zzso coding for zzso zzso derived from different zzso were cloned in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generally shown to be assembled in zzso when the length of the inserted zzso did not exceed 14 zzso zzso The inserted peptides appeared to be exposed in the zzso zzso One hybrid zzso protein induced zzso levels of zzso against the inserted zzso if injected into zzso
