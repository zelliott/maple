zzso clones encompassing all the translated zzso the 3' untranslated zzso and 1 zzso zzso the zzso translation initiation zzso of bovine zzso have been obtained and characterized by restriction zzso analysis and extensive DNA zzso These analyses demonstrated that functionally distinct zzso and zzso zzso of the protein are zzso into separate zzso throughout the zzso The putative promoter region lacks a zzso box, has an extremely high zzso content, and contains several zzso binding zzso Comprehensive zzso analyses using zzso covering the entire zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso ligament of bovine fetuses of different ages, zzso calves, and adult cows demonstrated that while only a single zzso is alternatively spliced at high frequency, many zzso are alternatively spliced at zzso variable zzso The results also suggest that such limited zzso is increased in the adult tissue relative to fetal and zzso zzso
