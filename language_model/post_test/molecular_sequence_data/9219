zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most common form of zzso cardiovascular zzso and an important contributor to the substantially increased morbidity and mortality in zzso Emerging evidence indicates the genetic basis for the zzso of zzso zzso in a significant proportion of zzso However, zzso zzso is a genetically zzso disease and the genetic defects responsible for zzso in the overwhelming majority of cases remain zzso In this study, the entire coding region of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso factor crucial to normal zzso was zzso in 130 unrelated patients with zzso zzso The available relatives of the index patient carrying the identified zzso and 200 unrelated ethnically matched healthy individuals used as controls were subsequently zzso The functional characteristics of the zzso zzso were assessed in contrast to its zzso counterpart using a zzso reporter zzso zzso As a result, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a zzso with zzso The variation was absent in 400 control zzso and the altered zzso acid was highly zzso zzso across zzso zzso analysis of the family members of the zzso carrier showed that the substitution zzso with zzso was inherited as an zzso dominant zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso was associated with significantly decreased zzso zzso The findings provide novel insight into the molecular mechanism involved in zzso zzso the potential clinical implications in the zzso prophylaxis and therapy of this common zzso zzso in zzso
