zzso binding factor zzso a zzso regulator, plays important roles in zzso and zzso In the present study, we report that zzso of zzso in transgenic mice during embryonic development suppresses zzso gene zzso This effect causes defects in zzso development that result in zzso In zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso system, zzso of zzso expression significantly suppressed zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso protein zzso which in turn enhanced the zzso zzso zzso controls zzso zzso by interacting with a zzso element located in the zzso region upstream of the zzso zzso zzso This interaction suppressed zzso gene zzso by blocking the effect of an zzso zzso located zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso We also found an zzso sequence in a region zzso zzso upstream from the zzso promoter that contained multiple zzso binding sites and zzso with nuclear proteins obtained from zzso cells forming zzso mobility shift zzso complexes with zzso We conclude that a novel function of zzso is to regulate zzso zzso by binding to the zzso element, which in turn blocks the effect of the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso promoter zzso
