zzso zzso zzso containing DNA from the region of zzso ring a zzso which develops on zzso IV in cells of the special lobe of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of the clones contained zzso element sequences that zzso to more than 100 sites on all four zzso zzso including constant and variable zzso Two zzso zzso zzso 24 (which lacks the zzso zzso and zzso 43 (which contains this zzso were investigated by zzso sequence zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso element from zzso zzso zzso is reported zzso This element contains two overlapping open reading frames of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Three zzso motifs are found in the sequence of zzso zzso similarity was found between zzso and known genes of viruses and zzso elements which zzso reverse zzso The zzso element has no long terminal repeats and is flanked by short direct repeats of the sequence zzso A 24 zzso zzso sequence was found at the 3' end of the zzso Based upon its structural organization and comparative analysis of its zzso sequence we suggest that this zzso element belongs to the class of zzso zzso The zzso clone zzso was previously obtained by zzso and cloning of DNA from zzso zzso IV of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso contained part of the 3' terminal region of the zzso element, but this differed in sequence from the first copy by several zzso zzso and a shorter zzso zzso tract at the 3' zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
