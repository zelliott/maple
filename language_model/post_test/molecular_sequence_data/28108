The zzso locus of the zzso coli zzso F zzso contains a site at which one of the DNA strands is zzso as a prelude to zzso transmission to recipient zzso We have zzso this site zzso by using zzso plasmids that were zzso from bacteria expressing the F transfer zzso zzso The strand interruption was found on the transferred strand 137 zzso zzso of the center of the zzso site at zzso on the F zzso This location is consistent with the locations anticipated from studies of delta zzso zzso but it differs from previous results by other zzso The strand interruption produced a zzso but the nature of the zzso zzso of the strand on the other side of the zzso was not zzso Some DNA sequence motifs in the vicinity of the zzso zzso site of F resemble the zzso site involved in formation of delta zzso zzso
