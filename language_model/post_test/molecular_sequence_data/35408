zzso molecules are a class of small (7 zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso which have demonstrated substantial potential as zzso for zzso molecular zzso The use of zzso zzso zzso zzso would further increase the resolution and zzso accuracy of zzso zzso The rapid in zzso zzso of zzso molecules permit the use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Earlier studies have demonstrated that the chemical nature of zzso has a substantial influence on the zzso properties of zzso zzso To determine an optimal labeling approach, the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso to the zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso molecules were labeled with zzso and their binding specificity and cellular processing were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as that of their zzso counterparts, was evaluated in zzso zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than for both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (13 zzso zzso at 2 h after zzso zzso had the highest zzso ratio zzso zzso 10) in comparison with both zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio was also higher for zzso (7 zzso 2) than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The influence of zzso on the zzso and targeting properties was less pronounced for zzso than for zzso The results of this study demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso to the zzso have a substantial influence on the zzso of zzso zzso molecules labeled with zzso can be zzso to enhance the imaging contrast of PET imaging using zzso molecules and improve the sensitivity of molecular zzso The study demonstrated an appreciable difference of zzso influence for zzso and zzso
