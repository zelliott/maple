Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been cloned and zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity with zzso yet has much higher affinity for zzso zzso zzso than zzso As a first step toward understanding the interactions between zzso zzso and its zzso the regions that are involved in zzso binding and/or zzso zzso were determined by using zzso zzso zzso of the two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by generating point zzso of the zzso The zzso values in stimulation of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors for the zzso zzso were determined using a zzso reporter zzso Three regions of the zzso were found to be important for optimal binding of zzso and/or zzso zzso The first region was mapped to the junction of the third zzso domain and the fifth zzso zzso substitution of three zzso acids of zzso in this region zzso zzso and zzso by the corresponding zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso increased the zzso value by approximately zzso The other two regions were localized to the second zzso domain of the zzso involving zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso zzso in these two regions each increased the zzso value for zzso by approximately 7- to zzso only in the presence of the zzso acid zzso zzso involving the first region, suggesting that their roles in zzso zzso binding might be zzso
