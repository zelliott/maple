zzso zzso zzso zzso is a virulent type zzso for the species that bears its name and belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso resembled the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso except for a shorter tail and a different zzso zzso Its zzso zzso DNA zzso had 50 open reading zzso zzso functions were assigned to 29 of zzso Unlike other zzso zzso from zzso zzso belonging to this species, zzso did not have a zzso zzso However, it did carry a zzso zzso the most zzso gene among this zzso zzso Comparative zzso analyses revealed a high level of identity between the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were noted in genes coding for zzso zzso in agreement with their distinct host zzso Sixteen structural proteins of zzso zzso were identified by liquid zzso mass zzso A zzso zzso was recognized between the putative genes coding for the zzso of late zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso Four genes within this region were autonomously late transcribed and possibly under the control of zzso Three of the four deduced proteins had similarities with proteins from zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso acquired this module from another zzso zzso The genetic diversity of the zzso species indicates that they are exceptional models for studying the modular theory of zzso zzso
