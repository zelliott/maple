zzso E is an zzso zzso that has been implicated frequently in zzso processing for presentation on class II zzso zzso but no information exists on its zzso specificity within zzso in relation to known T cell zzso We have analyzed the processing by zzso E of a large zzso domain of zzso toxin zzso zzso and we have compared the processing products with those liberated by zzso D, a related zzso zzso also thought to be involved in class II zzso zzso zzso zzso products were analyzed by zzso zzso degradation and mass zzso following zzso zzso separation of zzso A total of 28 zzso sites was identified, 11 of which were recognized by both zzso E and zzso zzso although not all, sites were between pairs of zzso zzso and were located within the zzso C terminal region known to contain several human T cell zzso Previously described T cell zzso for example, between zzso zzso and zzso were flanked by zzso E and D zzso zzso These data are consistent with an important role for zzso E and/or D in zzso processing in the human immune zzso
