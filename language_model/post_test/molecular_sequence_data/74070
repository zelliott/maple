It has been long considered that zinc zzso in bacteria is maintained by export systems and zzso systems, which are separately controlled by their own regulators and the zzso systems are zzso regulated by zzso which binds to an about zzso zzso sequence known as zzso present in its target promoters to block the entry of zzso zzso Here, we demonstrated in zzso and in zzso that in addition to act as a zzso of putative zzso systems, the zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as an zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binds to a similar zzso with approximately zzso zzso sequence in the promoters of the genes zzso putative zzso systems but a zzso zzso sequence with a zzso zzso repeat overlapping the zzso zzso to zzso sequence of the gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso repeat sequence resulted in zzso of the in zzso binding and the in zzso and in zzso zzso of the export zzso promoter by zzso These results reveal that the zzso zzso functions as a zzso and an zzso of putative zinc zzso genes via recognizing two distinct sequences within its target zzso
