A zzso zzso designated zzso was found to be responsible for the diffuse zzso cell adherence of a zzso zzso coli zzso The genetic zzso of zzso was zzso and the order of the genes necessary for production of zzso was determined by zzso zzso Five zzso with apparent sizes of 10, 95, 27, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso in that order by the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene was determined and found to share extensive zzso in its signal sequence with the gene zzso the structural zzso of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso coli strain zzso zzso zzso Schmidt, zzso Walz, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the region zzso the mature zzso Southern zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso are of zzso zzso zzso studies using a probe from the region zzso the zzso zzso indicated that related sequences may be zzso associated in some strains and zzso in zzso Additional zzso studies of zzso coli zzso possessing sequence zzso to the zzso zzso suggest that the sequences in the zzso region of the zzso structural zzso gene are more highly zzso than sequences in the 3' zzso
