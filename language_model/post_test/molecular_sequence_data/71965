zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to membrane is an indispensable step in virus zzso Previously, we reported that a zzso zzso zzso 6 substitution zzso imposed a virus assembly zzso similar to that observed with zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso change impaired membrane zzso zzso the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso The defective zzso imposed by zzso was reversed by changes at other positions in MA, including zzso zzso In this study, we use several zzso methods to demonstrate that the zzso 6 zzso as well as additional zzso in MA zzso acids 7 and 8, reduce membrane binding without affecting zzso zzso This effect is observed in the context of zzso a truncated zzso containing only MA and CA, and in MA zzso The membrane binding zzso imposed by the zzso zzso is reversed by zzso changes in MA zzso 20 and 97, both of which, when present alone, increase membrane binding to levels greater than those for the wild zzso Both reduced and enhanced membrane binding imposed by the MA zzso depend upon the presence of the zzso zzso The results support the zzso switch model recently proposed for the regulation of zzso membrane zzso according to which membrane binding is determined by the degree of exposure or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso into the zzso zzso might be a prerequisite event for the function of other distinct zzso membrane binding zzso
