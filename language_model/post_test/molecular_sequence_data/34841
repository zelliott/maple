zzso is a zzso acid protein that was first identified in a screen for zzso interacting zzso Database analysis revealed that it belongs to a family of proteins characterized by the presence of a highly zzso domain located at its zzso This family was termed the zzso family of interacting proteins zzso as all members have been demonstrated to interact with zzso The zzso can be further subdivided into two zzso zzso belongs to the class I zzso due to the presence of a C2 domain near its zzso zzso and zzso are the other class I family zzso A number of proteins that interact directly with zzso in addition to zzso have been zzso These include the zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso the zzso motor protein zzso zzso and the zzso receptors zzso and zzso It is hypothesized that zzso functions to transport zzso such as zzso receptors and the zzso zzso from the zzso recycling compartment zzso to the plasma zzso
