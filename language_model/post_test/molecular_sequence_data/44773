zzso zzso consists of two protein zzso F (or H gamma I) and H gamma zzso To zzso the mode of action of zzso we studied the binding order of F and H gamma II to human zzso and the zzso state of the two zzso The binding of F to human zzso preceded the binding of H gamma II to the cells, and thereafter zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicated that F and H gamma II components form zzso zzso zzso complexes on the zzso The toxin complexes were recovered in a zzso zzso fraction of the zzso which contains zzso zzso Neither the formation of the toxin zzso nor zzso occurred when the zzso were treated with zzso zzso Abortion of the complex formation on the zzso zzso zzso may be due to the failure of the binding of H gamma II to the cells, because F bound to the zzso zzso zzso to the same extent as to the zzso zzso
