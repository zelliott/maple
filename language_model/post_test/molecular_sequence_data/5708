Based on our findings that the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso shows zzso with human type I zzso zzso and zzso and zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced cell surface expression of major zzso complex zzso class I zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso (B zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, we examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the surface expression of zzso class I molecules on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso could enhance zzso class I expression by about zzso on zzso cells and by about zzso on zzso cells, while zzso zzso (not zzso and zzso carrier protein zzso did not increase the zzso By comparison, human type I zzso zzso and zzso showed similar effects zzso the expression by about zzso to zzso on the zzso class I expression on zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso in a zzso form by its zzso domain zzso human zzso class I zzso The basis for this similar effect of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso class I zzso zzso may be based on the zzso between these otherwise different zzso
