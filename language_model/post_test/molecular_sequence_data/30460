The genes coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these genes and their surrounding sequences are presented and compared with other known zzso genes from plant zzso All six deduced zzso sequences can be folded into the classical zzso structure zzso Only the zzso gene shows high zzso with the corresponding zzso gene and thus appears to be derived from a transfer event of zzso sequences into the zzso zzso The sequences surrounding this zzso however, show little similarity with the zzso zzso The other five deduced zzso display a much lower similarity with their zzso counterparts and thus appear to be genuine zzso zzso These zzso are highly zzso between zzso and zzso with zzso three zzso differing between the zzso sequences and their wheat zzso A zzso sequence is found upstream of each zzso gene in zzso similar to wheat zzso zzso zzso that could be involved in zzso zzso
