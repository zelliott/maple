The zzso growth factor binding proteins zzso are a family of six proteins that bind to zzso growth zzso and zzso with very high zzso Because their affinity zzso are between two- and zzso greater than the zzso zzso they control the distribution of the zzso among soluble zzso in zzso zzso zzso bound to cell surfaces or zzso zzso zzso and cell surface zzso Although there are six forms of zzso growth factor binding zzso most zzso zzso contain only three or four forms, and usually only one or two zzso The proteins differ significantly in their zzso zzso and this accounts for many of the differences that have been observed in their biological zzso Several different types of zzso cleave these binding zzso zzso zzso generally zzso the binding proteins or reduces their ability to bind to zzso or zzso zzso Several cell types have been shown to zzso these zzso therefore, the factors that regulate zzso activity can control binding protein actions zzso Other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso have been shown to alter zzso binding protein zzso While binding protein actions have been studied extensively in zzso many of the in zzso activities of these proteins remain to be zzso
