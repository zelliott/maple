The zzso zzso genes play an important role in the induction of proliferation of infected cells, and these zzso zzso regions are affected by the events leading to integration of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso transcribed mouse zzso zzso and zzso have recently been zzso We searched for human zzso to these zzso and isolated a clone with a zzso zzso insert zzso from a zzso zzso DNA library, that strongly zzso with both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso is a single copy sequence without zzso and viral zzso The zzso region is zzso producing a zzso zzso zzso band detected in the zzso zzso from different cell lines zzso zzso alignments showed a close similarity to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as to zzso and different viral and human growth factors, allowing to fit a putative zzso zzso The corresponding human gene was named zzso It was mapped to the short arm of zzso 7, at zzso as determined by in zzso zzso A zzso region with similarities to zzso zzso sequences may constitute an zzso integration target, which is often located near zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso belongs to an zzso family of cellular zzso and that it may constitute a target for zzso zzso
