The zzso gene zzso the zzso protein of zzso zzso from nine strains of zzso zzso was cloned using zzso chain reaction and the zzso sequence was zzso Analysis of the zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso gene of the test strains was composed of zzso to zzso zzso and the molecular weight of the deduced zzso was calculated to be zzso to zzso All the test strains shared the same or similar zzso but simultaneously considerable differences in the sequences were found among the zzso Western zzso analysis using rabbit zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso of 8 out of 9 strains expressed in zzso coli reacted with the zzso exhibiting a 43 to 48 zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that four zzso clusters are noted among the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso
