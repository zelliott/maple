zzso is able to alter zzso zzso levels and to affect the zzso functions of zzso It also zzso zzso action through its zzso protein coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso regulating zzso levels, exists in the plasma membrane of the zzso but little is known about its action on zzso zzso The present study investigates the expression of a zzso zzso zzso with development and in comparison to several other zzso in the zzso In addition, the sequence of a zzso zzso zzso was determined from an adult mouse zzso zzso We demonstrate for the first time the presence of a major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a weaker 1,200 zzso zzso transcript whose zzso expression starts on day 28 of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso 1 and 2, as well as the first 8 zzso of zzso 3 of the zzso cell zzso zzso were absent in the zzso zzso zzso The deduced open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso indicates absence of the first 51 zzso acids at the zzso end that are present in the zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso onset of expression of the zzso zzso zzso may be related to specific zzso events of zzso
