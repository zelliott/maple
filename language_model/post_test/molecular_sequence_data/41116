zzso are adhesive zzso of zzso and are involved in surface attachment, cell zzso and zzso zzso We reported previously that zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso were much more acid sensitive than their corresponding zzso zzso zzso however, this difference was not linked to the zzso zzso per zzso Here, we investigated the underlying molecular basis of this zzso zzso We identified large deletions in the zzso gene of zzso zzso isolated from the 1993 zzso zzso outbreak zzso zzso encodes the response regulator of the zzso zzso signal zzso system, which regulates zzso zzso zzso but acid resistance zzso Further comparison of stress fitness revealed that zzso zzso were also significantly more sensitive to heat shock but were resistant to zzso stress and zzso damage, similar to zzso zzso zzso analysis uncovered a large number of zzso expressed genes between the zzso zzso characterized by enhanced expression in zzso zzso of genes related to zzso formation, zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso but marked decreases in zzso of genes related to various types of stress zzso zzso zzso zzso with a functional zzso restored resistance to heat shock and acid challenge in cells but blocked zzso production, confirming that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was the basis of fitness segregation within the zzso zzso This study provides an example of how zzso instability of zzso promotes zzso diversification, generating zzso carrying an array of distinct zzso that may zzso the pathogen with survival advantages in diverse zzso
