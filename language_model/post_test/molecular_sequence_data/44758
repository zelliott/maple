zzso are enveloped viruses with a zzso composed of two zzso species, designated L and zzso The zzso were divided in two major groups (Old World and New zzso based on zzso properties and genetic data, as well as geographic zzso A sequence alignment analysis of all reported zzso S zzso yielded 17 zzso regions in addition to a reported zzso region at the end of both zzso The consensus sequences of these regions were used to design generalized zzso suitable for zzso amplification of a set of overlapping zzso sequence fragments zzso the complete S zzso of any zzso A restriction analysis zzso was designed to rapidly zzso the amplified zzso This zzso approach was tested with Old World zzso and New World zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, using this procedure the whole S zzso of a novel zzso isolate obtained from a zzso trapped in central Argentina, was amplified and zzso zzso zzso sequence data were used for zzso analyses that showed the relationships between this zzso and the rest of the members of the zzso This relatively simple methodology will be useful both in basic studies and zzso survey zzso
