A zzso protein interaction screen was used to isolate zzso zzso human proteins that can interact with human zzso in zzso A new member of the zzso zzso gene family, zzso zzso was zzso The sequence of the zzso protein shares approximately 50% identify with zzso and zzso to zzso within the pocket zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso can bind to viral zzso zzso large T zzso and zzso zzso through its pocket zzso Although zzso does not bind to zzso in zzso it can interact with zzso with a clear preference for zzso zzso Because both zzso and zzso show affinity for zzso we suggest that zzso and zzso zzso through a zzso zzso bridge in the zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso mapped to zzso a region of frequent zzso zzso in human zzso
