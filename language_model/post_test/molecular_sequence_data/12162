Engineering zzso zzso sites into the zzso zzso of zzso coli by introducing zzso zzso has been zzso to confirm the proximity of zzso VIII zzso zzso zzso and X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso He, zzso Hubbell, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hubbell, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso In this paper, the approach is used to confirm and extend the relationship between zzso IX zzso and X zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso His were constructed, and zzso binding was zzso by electron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His binds zzso with a zzso of about 24 zzso and a zzso zzso unity in all likelihood because the His zzso at position zzso forms a zzso site in conjunction with the native His zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His also binds zzso with a zzso zzso but the zzso is decreased to about 13 zzso The results suggest that zzso is sufficiently close to both zzso and zzso to form a zzso zzso site in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, replacement of zzso with His in zzso with a native His zzso at position zzso does not lead to zzso zzso The results provide strong support for the zzso packing model zzso
