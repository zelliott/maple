zzso 130 zzso a shared component of all the receptors for the zzso zzso family, zzso zzso signals in part by zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso subsequently zzso into the nucleus and stimulate gene zzso In the studies reported here, the zzso region of the human zzso gene was isolated and the zzso initiation sites were zzso To demonstrate that the isolated DNA zzso contained a functional promoter, a zzso construct containing zzso base pairs of the zzso zzso region, inserted upstream from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso The construct exhibited zzso promoter zzso In addition, a zzso treatment with zzso or zzso M zzso the activity of this promoter zzso zzso of the zzso response element by zzso analysis and zzso zzso revealed a zzso binding site for activated zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA binding analysis demonstrated that this element binds activated zzso and zzso zzso and zzso This zzso element was sufficient to zzso zzso stimulation to a minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso These results establish that the DNA zzso we have isolated contains the human zzso promoter and that zzso type zzso may influence the activity of this promoter via activated zzso
