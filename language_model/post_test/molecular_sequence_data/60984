In the zzso zzso commune the mating type genes of the B locus zzso zzso and zzso receptors in multiple zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and receptors leads to induction of zzso development easily scored in zzso commune by the zzso zzso which lacks aerial zzso formation and shows zzso zzso zzso In contrast, self zzso are not recognized and zzso development is not zzso Natural and zzso zzso of receptors have been analyzed for their specificity in transformation zzso and parts of the zzso involved in zzso discrimination can be zzso The biological role of zzso response in zzso commune is assumed to be connected to nuclear migration based on the observation that zzso cells with a zzso gene of different specificity lead to cells capable of nuclear zzso Other possible roles for zzso function are zzso
