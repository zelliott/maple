In zzso zzso the zzso zzso is controlled by a sensor and regulator protein pair, zzso and zzso that respond to zzso zzso To facilitate studies of the zzso zzso a strain with an altered zzso protein was isolated by in zzso zzso The zzso in this strain zzso leads to the production of a zzso sensor zzso that, unlike the zzso is functionally active in zzso zzso The zzso in zzso was shown to be a single base change that results in an zzso to zzso substitution in a region of zzso that is highly zzso in zzso sensor zzso While a zzso zzso was unable to induce the synthesis of cell wall zzso acid under zzso conditions, the zzso zzso showed a relative increase in zzso acid and a decrease in zzso acid, even under zzso zzso The latter suggests that some or all of the genes required for zzso acid synthesis are members of the zzso zzso
