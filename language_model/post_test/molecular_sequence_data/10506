zzso zzso a bacterial zzso zzso of 198 zzso acids (19 800 zzso has been used as a model system for studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and more recently for studies of pro zzso protein zzso We have assigned the zzso of the zzso alone, and of its complex with the zzso transition state mimic zzso zzso using double- and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Changes in backbone chemical shifts between the zzso and inhibited form of the protein are correlated with distance from the zzso the displacement of backbone zzso and change in hydrogen bond strength upon inhibitor binding zzso from previously solved crystal zzso A comparison of the solution secondary structure of the zzso zzso with that of the X-ray structure reveals no significant zzso zzso line zzso indicating intermediate chemical exchange, was observed in many of the active site zzso (including three broadened to zzso and in a majority of cases the broadening was reversed upon addition of the zzso zzso and possible mechanisms of this line broadening are zzso
