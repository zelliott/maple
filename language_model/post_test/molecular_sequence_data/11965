Changes in protein zzso activity, levels of zzso zzso and the type of zzso modification was described in cells of rat zzso zzso and correlated with zzso events of zzso The activity of protein zzso zzso was at least zzso higher than that for protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells of zzso rats of different zzso Both activities increased during the zzso stages of differentiation and peaked at 23 days of zzso The activity of zzso in zzso zzso was the same as that in mixed zzso cell populations from animals aged 9 and 23 days, indicating that the activity of this zzso in zzso cells and germ cells was similar at these zzso zzso activities were similar and low in both zzso zzso and round zzso from adult zzso however, the activity in zzso zzso from zzso old animals was zzso higher than in zzso The highest activity was associated with zzso zzso appearing late during zzso zzso activity was at least zzso lower than zzso activity and was not significantly different among all cell zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso was demonstrated by labeling of zzso zzso with zzso acid at different zzso zzso Total protein zzso and the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso in contrast to zzso activity, decreased with increasing zzso Although zzso proteins were the most highly labeled at all ages, zzso from zzso zzso rats showed zzso changes in the level of zzso of at least 14 proteins as determined by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso proteins of round zzso were distinguished from those of the zzso by the lack of many zzso proteins and by low zzso zzso zzso These results show that independent changes in zzso activity and protein zzso accompany the differentiation events during the zzso and zzso stages of zzso This suggests that zzso in the zzso zzso may be more dependent on available protein zzso than on protein zzso zzso
