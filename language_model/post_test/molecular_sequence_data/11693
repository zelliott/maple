Mice zzso for either the zzso or zzso zzso develop zzso diseases and progressive zzso The zzso zzso is characterized by the absence of functional zzso whereas zzso mice exhibit an inactive zzso due to a point zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The structural repercussions of this zzso acid substitution remain zzso Here we report that zzso is expressed at similar levels on the surface of activated T zzso from zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso indistinguishable amounts of a 40 zzso protein are detected in both zzso and zzso zzso The molecular model of zzso based on the known structure of zzso predicts that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located at the zzso interface which is close to the zzso interaction zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso allows normal zzso zzso surface expression and zzso but zzso structural zzso to the zzso binding region leading to the zzso changes zzso
