Three dengue virus type 4 zzso vaccine candidates containing deletions in the 3' zzso region were prepared by passage in zzso zzso zzso zzso these vaccine candidates and parental zzso similarly zzso in the same cells failed to elicit either zzso or a zzso zzso zzso Consensus sequence analysis revealed that each of the three zzso as well as the parental zzso when zzso in zzso cells, rapidly acquired a single zzso substitution in domain III zzso of the envelope protein zzso These zzso appear to have accumulated in response to growth adaptation to zzso cells as shown by growth analysis, and the zzso was not detected in the virus following passage in zzso cells, primary African green monkey kidney cells, or zzso zzso The zzso substitution was predicted by molecular modeling to increase the net positive charge on the surface of zzso The zzso zzso of the full-length zzso selected after three passages in zzso cells showed increased affinity for zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso as measured by zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso Evidence indicates that the zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso E protein was responsible for reduced zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our results point out the importance of cell zzso for vaccine preparation since the virus may change during passages in certain cells through zzso selection, and such zzso may affect cell zzso zzso and vaccine zzso
