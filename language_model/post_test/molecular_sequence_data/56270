Terminal differentiation and cell proliferation are in many cases, as in muscle cells, mutually exclusive zzso While zzso zzso are withdrawn from the cell cycle, zzso is inhibited by some zzso and zzso of some zzso including zzso zzso (which expresses a zzso protein zzso the regulatory factor zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor of the basic zzso family, acts at both levels because it triggers a muscle differentiation zzso in zzso cells, and zzso a complete block of cell zzso zzso interaction between zzso and zzso has been zzso We here show that zzso expression greatly decreases upon muscle cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso We have identified a zzso site overlapping with the zzso element in the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso can act as a negative regulator for zzso zzso by blocking serum responsiveness through this binding zzso These data suggest that the zzso negative effect on cell growth could be partly zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso
