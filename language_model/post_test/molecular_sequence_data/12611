The zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso of signals from the zzso to the underlying smooth zzso zzso zzso a complex series of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso which appear to play a role in zzso membrane zzso zzso of the zzso site, which prevents both zzso and zzso blocks zzso targeting to cell zzso Further, as described for some zzso alpha zzso both membrane association and zzso of zzso are zzso zzso in response to zzso the zzso zzso partial zzso to the cell zzso zzso with zzso To clarify the role of zzso in determining zzso zzso zzso we have constructed zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso for zzso at two potential zzso sites zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso following zzso zzso and zzso labeling with zzso revealed that zzso of either zzso zzso attenuated zzso whereas replacement of both zzso completely eliminated zzso Analysis of zzso deletion zzso of zzso demonstrated that the region containing these two zzso zzso is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso The zzso thus identified as the zzso sites for zzso are separated by an unusual zzso sequence and appear to define a sequence motif for dual zzso We analyzed the zzso distribution of zzso zzso by differential zzso and found that zzso of the zzso zzso sites markedly reduced membrane association of the zzso These results document that zzso zzso is an important zzso for the zzso distribution of zzso and identify a new motif for the zzso zzso of signaling zzso
