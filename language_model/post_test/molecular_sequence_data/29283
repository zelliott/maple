zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso by a virus responsive element zzso located in the promoter zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso contains four DNA zzso (A to zzso which cooperate for zzso zzso zzso following virus zzso The differential expression between the highly expressed zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene promoters is essentially due to point zzso within the C and D zzso of the zzso element zzso We now demonstrate that in zzso zzso and human zzso cells, zzso factors zzso and zzso which are potent zzso of zzso type I zzso transcription, zzso affect zzso and zzso promoter zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso data, our studies demonstrate that the AB zzso zzso to a preferential site for zzso whereas the C module is zzso recognized by zzso Furthermore, zzso of reporter zzso driven by four copies of different zzso zzso motifs found within zzso indicates that the zzso zzso of these zzso sequences define the preferential binding sites for zzso or zzso Together, these experiments clarify the molecular basis for differential expression of zzso genes following virus infection by zzso the sequence requirements for zzso association with the virus responsive elements of the zzso zzso
