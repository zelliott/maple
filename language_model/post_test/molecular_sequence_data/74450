The expression of zzso proteins is a zzso technology, but their detection and zzso often require time-consuming and complicated zzso This paper describes the development of a novel double zzso tag zzso for rapid and accurate zzso of zzso protein by a homogeneous zzso based on zzso resonance energy zzso In our double zzso tagging system, zzso proteins can be simply measured on a zzso plate by addition of a pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sensitivity of the zzso with an incubation time of only 5 zzso is almost equal to that of zzso Western zzso In addition, culture media and extracts of host cells generally used for protein expression have little effect on this zzso To investigate the utility of our proposed tag for protein production, several different proteins containing this tag were practically expressed and zzso The data presented demonstrate that the double zzso tag is a reliable tool that can alleviate the zzso and troublesome processes of protein zzso
