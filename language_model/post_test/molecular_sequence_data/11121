As a first step in the study of the functional consequences of molecular zzso at the zzso locus in zzso 1933 zzso of the gene were zzso in 21 zzso lines representative of the zzso of cultivated zzso High levels of zzso were zzso 109 sites were variable in zzso regions and 159 in zzso zzso Among the latter, 103 were zzso resulting in 94 zzso acid replacements in a zzso zzso Moreover, 26 zzso zzso were found, eight of them in coding zzso The high rate of zzso observed could indicate that the effective size of the ancestral population was very large, and/or that the zzso gene evolved under the influence of a high zzso rate or was subjected to some kind of balancing zzso The distribution of zzso within the sequence was not zzso Silent zzso were relatively frequent in zzso 1 and rare in zzso 5, whereas zzso zzso were zzso in the part of the sequence zzso the active domain of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence also showed a relatively higher level of resistance to zzso acid replacements in this zzso Sites in linkage zzso were arranged mainly in three spatial zzso This mosaic pattern can be related with an apparently large number of zzso events which might be a characteristic feature of this particular sample and/or imply that the zzso locus is a hot spot for zzso
