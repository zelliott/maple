zzso of zzso sequences zzso zzso that can be expressed in specific viral proteins during an infection is a useful strategy for zzso viral proteins and their functional complexes from infected cells and/or for visualizing the dynamics of their zzso location over zzso To identify regions in the zzso zzso that could potentially accommodate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to the entire zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso followed by selection of zzso capable of generating zzso viable zzso This procedure allowed us to identify at least one site in each viral zzso zzso except protein zzso in which a minimum of five zzso acids could be zzso The distribution of these sites is analyzed from the perspective of their protein structural context and from the perspective of virus zzso
