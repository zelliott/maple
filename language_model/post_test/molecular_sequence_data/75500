zzso zzso zzso are zzso structures found in extracts of the brains of animals affected with zzso These structures are pathological zzso of a normal host protein zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso has been suggested to explain its zzso properties in zzso brains and although there is a form of zzso in zzso indistinguishable in size from the protein in zzso brain, zzso zzso of zzso are also found in zzso zzso We report the zzso of the multiple forms of zzso found in zzso zzso zzso from mouse brain affected by the zzso strain of zzso The zzso major forms of zzso in zzso prepared without the use of zzso K have the zzso sequence zzso identical to that predicted for the zzso of normal mouse brain zzso However zzso zzso of some zzso does occur in zzso within a domain of repetitive sequences at sites similar to but distinct from those cut by zzso K in zzso This suggests the zzso of the protein in zzso in zzso does not differ extensively from that in zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that the size diversity of zzso in zzso is only partly due to zzso zzso and is independent of the zzso that occurs if zzso K is used in the zzso of zzso Apart from zzso changes in the structure of zzso we found a novel, as yet unidentified, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at position 3 in mouse zzso which may zzso zzso to form zzso
