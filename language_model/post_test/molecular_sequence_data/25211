A detailed analysis of the zzso open reading frame zzso of gene zzso and of an upstream zzso designated zzso indicates the presence of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso promoter zzso and zzso boxes for zzso and zzso No zzso zzso between zzso and zzso is suggested by the zzso zzso contains two zzso one-third zzso with a repetitive structure and the residual two-thirds with no zzso The zzso sequence zzso the repetitive structure is composed of nine groups of different short repetitive zzso zzso A combination of these zzso codes for five groups of combined repetitive zzso zzso Seven zzso acid zzso zzso and 23 zzso of 21 zzso in length are zzso The zzso are generally highly zzso but four exhibit zzso and possibly represent zzso zzso of the repetitive zzso The zzso of the zzso repeat with zzso zzso zzso indicates that this part contains the zzso domain of zzso In this region zzso exists between the zzso repeats and the zzso of zzso We propose that binding of zzso to cells occurs via the zzso repeat domain, with the zzso domain being responsible for toxic zzso
