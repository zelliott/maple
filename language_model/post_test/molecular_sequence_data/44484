The large number zzso of zzso now known at the zzso locus is a serious challenge to the existing methods for zzso zzso including many of the DNA based zzso Here, we describe a zzso typing zzso protocol for typing of zzso zzso using a single zzso zzso This reaction zzso an zzso base pair product from zzso prepared from zzso covering zzso 1-3 and most of zzso zzso This product allows identification of all possible combinations of two zzso from this zzso The sequencing strategy used for zzso assignment contains several improvements compared to those previously zzso The zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso used, combines high-quality sequencing, zzso long reads, low background, and uniform peak heights making the identification of zzso positions very reliable in a fast and easy protocol developed by determining the zzso for a number of zzso Thus, this strategy meets most of the requirements for the use of sequencing in zzso zzso Furthermore, this method is very zzso The use of a zzso zzso zzso with the recognition sites for two different sequencing zzso allows the application of the same sets of zzso sequencing zzso regardless of the amplified zzso Thus, the protocol can very easily be extended to cover the zzso and zzso too, simply by adding zzso reactions specific for these zzso to the zzso Using this zzso we investigated a total of 65 cell lines and clinical samples, many of the latter chosen from samples difficult to type by zzso Our method gave in all cases zzso results and proved functional for work requiring the highest zzso
