In the course of our investigations on DNA zzso a synthesis of new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was brought about starting from zzso and zzso zzso The former compound proved to be a weak zzso for zzso coli DNA zzso I and zzso reverse zzso and inactive towards DNA zzso alpha from zzso and beta from rat zzso The second zzso zzso was incorporated into DNA chain by none of the tested zzso zzso reasons for so strong a decrease in the zzso properties of the prepared compounds are zzso
