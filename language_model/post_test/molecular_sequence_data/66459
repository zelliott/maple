Little is known about the spatial and zzso scales at which zzso organisms are genetically zzso A previous study of zzso DNA zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed strong zzso structuring suggesting that Northeast zzso Atlantic, Mediterranean and Black Sea populations are genetically zzso The present study used a higher sampling intensity and a combination of zzso and four zzso markers to reveal population structuring between and within zzso Between zzso both marker sets indicated significant differentiation confirming earlier results that gene flow is probably absent between the respective zzso zzso zzso At the zzso scale, we found no evidence of spatial or zzso structuring within the zzso zzso In the Mediterranean zzso both marker sets indicated significant zzso but only the zzso data indicated a sharp genetic division between zzso and all other Mediterranean zzso Data were zzso about population structuring in the Black zzso The levels of differentiation indicated by the two marker sets differed zzso with far less pronounced structure detected by zzso than zzso zzso This study also uncovered the presence of highly divergent zzso lineages that were zzso with zzso geography and nuclear zzso We thus propose the hypothesis that highly divergent zzso lineages may be present within zzso zzso zzso zzso
