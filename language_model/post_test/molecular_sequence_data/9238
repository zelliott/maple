zzso recruitment zzso zzso are zzso protein interaction zzso that link the zzso assembly of large signaling platforms such as zzso to the zzso of downstream zzso that often include zzso and zzso and thereby play an important role in the regulation of inflammatory and zzso signaling zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family of zzso pattern recognition receptors zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in response to the recognition of bacterial zzso This process requires the specific recognition of the zzso of the protein zzso zzso by the tandem zzso of zzso Here we demonstrate that the tandem zzso of zzso are engaged in an zzso interaction that is important for the structural stability of this zzso Using a combination of zzso and pull-down experiments we identify distinct surface areas that are involved in the zzso tandem zzso interaction and the interaction with the downstream zzso zzso Our findings indicate that while zzso of zzso might be the primary binding partner of zzso the two zzso of zzso do not act independently of one another but may cooperate to from a binding surface that is distinct from that of single zzso
