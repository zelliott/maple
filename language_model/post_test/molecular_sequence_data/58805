Separate zzso libraries were constructed from cardiac muscle and slow zzso muscle of mature brown trout zzso zzso The complete sequence of zzso zzso that is specific to these muscles was determined from full-length transcripts isolated from the corresponding zzso The identity of the sequences was supported by protein zzso When compared to the sequence of Atlantic salmon fast zzso TM zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso McGowan, zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of fast, slow and cardiac muscle zzso from zzso fish, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the main difference in the zzso and zzso sequences zzso the site of zzso overlap occurs at zzso 276 where an zzso in fast TM is replaced by a zzso in both cardiac and slow zzso Trout cardiac TM exhibited greatest similarity to chicken cardiac TM while trout slow TM exhibited greatest similarity to skeletal zzso Thus, none of the three zzso TM sequences zzso to a zzso zzso In zzso experiments zzso M salt, pH zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso in the presence of zzso differences were observed in the zzso unfolding profiles of the zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso was noted for cardiac zzso Two zzso were observed for fast TM zzso zzso zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C zzso and slow TM zzso zzso zzso degrees C and zzso degrees C zzso Fast TM was cloned and over expressed in the bacterial cell lines zzso and zzso Upon cell zzso zzso TM zzso zzso made in zzso was rapidly and zzso zzso between zzso 6 and zzso zzso zzso TM was produced by using zzso as shown by zzso sequencing, zzso zzso and mass zzso In zzso zzso performed at low zzso strength zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 degrees zzso the full-length zzso TM exhibited markedly lower relative zzso values than the corresponding wild zzso
