The aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial zzso resistance in seawater from four beaches in zzso The most significant resistance rates were observed for zzso and zzso whereas they were relatively low for zzso zzso and zzso According to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thirty-four bacteria resistant to zzso zzso or zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso for extended spectrum zzso showed the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso coli zzso and the zzso gene was zzso in association with the zzso zzso of about 50 zzso zzso sequence zzso was located upstream of the zzso zzso This work showed a significant level of resistance to zzso mainly among environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance zzso
