zzso class I and class II were investigated in 15 Israeli primary zzso zzso patients and compared to healthy zzso None of the well established zzso zzso were found to be associated with the zzso zzso is zzso zzso but its zzso zzso zzso and zzso cannot be precisely defined by zzso zzso zzso we have used zzso typing in order to assign the zzso splits in zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified by zzso zzso and zzso with sequence specific zzso zzso defining the known zzso associated zzso Only 4 out of the 15 zzso patients tested were found to express zzso the zzso that encodes zzso Of the remaining 11 patients, 9 expressed zzso zzso with 2 patients expressing both zzso and zzso and the remaining 2 patients expressed no zzso zzso Our data indicate that there is no apparent association between zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso studied including the zzso of the zzso locus in the Israeli zzso Thus zzso zzso of zzso patients in the Israelis will not be useful for early and/or differential diagnosis of this zzso
