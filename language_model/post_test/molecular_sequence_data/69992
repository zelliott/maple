The zzso zzso genes from two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated after zzso amplification then cloned and zzso The two zzso zzso genes are of 290 zzso and 311 zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, and are clearly zzso to the published sequences of zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso Both genes contain an zzso like the zzso and zzso and unlike the bird zzso genes that are zzso The deduced protein sequences from the coding areas of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes do not contain any zzso zzso This absence of zzso zzso leaves the zzso zzso susceptible to disruption in zzso by exposure to increasing zzso strength and is a characteristic of fish, birds and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso invariably contain zzso zzso zzso that, as a result of the formation of zzso and zzso zzso bridges, significantly increase the stability of the zzso zzso that can only be disrupted following zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences indicates that the zzso occupy a position zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso From the DNA sequences we estimate the time of divergence of the zzso and the zzso to be around 22 million years zzso This date agrees very well with the published estimates of divergence based on other zzso
