Three races of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified on zzso disease resistant and susceptible soybean zzso based on zzso zzso For race 3, an zzso zzso zzso was identified that zzso resistance expressed as a hypersensitive response on resistant zzso Williams zzso zzso in two predicted functional zzso of zzso resulted in gained zzso on Williams 82 and an increase in bacterial population number on susceptible zzso zzso of zzso in race 1, that is predicted to zzso a zzso HR, led to zzso on susceptible zzso Spencer and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in race 2, that is predicted of carrying zzso zzso resulted in gained zzso and fitness of pathogen on both resistant and susceptible zzso The results demonstrate zzso for zzso dependent on pathogen and plant genetic zzso
