zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a signaling agent in numerous signal zzso pathways in zzso zzso However, to date, no sensor for low zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso Using a functional zzso approach, nuclear extracts from human zzso vein zzso cells were analyzed by two-dimensional PAGE with or without prior treatment with a low concentration of zzso A protein zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of approximately zzso was observed to be consistently altered by the zzso Using zzso zzso mass zzso the protein was identified as zzso nuclear zzso zzso a nuclear zzso zzso zzso Upon two-dimensional zzso each zzso nuclear zzso zzso form was present as multiple spots because of differing levels of zzso Upon treatment with zzso there was an increase in zzso at zzso zzso which partially reversed by 30 zzso zzso at 60 zzso after treatment, a population of zzso protein was zzso zzso The effects were observed with as little as 1 zzso zzso and were zzso with 5-8 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso but not by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso
