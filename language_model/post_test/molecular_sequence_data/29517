The complete zzso sequence of the zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso was determined using a Japanese isolate zzso The sequence consisted of zzso zzso excluding the zzso zzso at the 3' zzso and contained a single long open reading frame with a coding capacity for a protein of zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence suggested a zzso organization typical of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso of zzso was also determined and compared with the zzso zzso from the United zzso The larger and smaller zzso protein zzso coding region was compared to those of zzso and zzso which represent two zzso of zzso The larger zzso gene of zzso showed zzso and zzso identities with those of zzso and zzso respectively at the zzso zzso The smaller zzso gene of zzso was zzso and zzso identical with those of zzso and zzso The results suggested that the Japanese zzso isolate zzso is distinct from those in the United States, and might represent a third zzso
