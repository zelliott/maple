We have previously mapped the human zzso factor to a deletion in Y zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso We now report the isolation and characterization of a gene family located within this zzso Analysis of the predicted protein products suggests a possible role in zzso processing or zzso control during early zzso The Y zzso zzso recognition motif zzso family includes a minimum of three members expressed specifically in the zzso zzso in zzso results and Southern zzso analysis indicate that several further zzso sequences map within zzso zzso Several zzso species show Y zzso conservation of zzso zzso We have detected deletions of zzso sequences in two zzso patients with no previously zzso zzso
