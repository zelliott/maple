zzso modeling and site directed zzso were used to analyze the structural features determining the unique inhibitor sensitivities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a highly zzso zzso zzso that provides the bottom of the zzso pocket for zzso yielded a zzso zzso that showed greatly reduced zzso sensitivity and was zzso still zzso Similar zzso were not tolerated in the zzso zzso rendering it zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso located in the active site of zzso were found responsible for the high sensitivity of this zzso to the zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso of one of these zzso zzso reduced the zzso oxide sensitivity of the zzso to the same level observed with the zzso zzso In search of zzso that would discriminate between the closely related zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit zzso with significantly greater potency than zzso These studies should aid development of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and help to better understand the significance of localized zzso production by the various zzso zzso in specific cellular zzso
