Two highly conservative zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso are located in the zzso region zzso involved in binding of the zzso ring of zzso We have performed zzso chain zzso random zzso of the two zzso using zzso chicken muscle zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The synthetic zzso zzso contained zzso bases in the zzso corresponding to those for zzso and zzso The amplified fragments were zzso with the expression zzso zzso and the zzso proteins expressed were identified by zzso zzso active zzso proteins were selected on the basis of the growth at 45 degrees C of the temperature sensitive zzso coli zzso for zzso zzso At position 67, various zzso acid zzso other than Val have been found to restore the growth at 45 degrees C of the zzso zzso In contrast, only zzso zzso and Met could be present at position zzso These results are compatible with the proposal that zzso contributes to the zzso binding through zzso interactions and zzso by forming a hydrogen bond with the zzso zzso Indeed, several zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited markedly high zzso values for zzso whereas the zzso values for zzso were comparable to those of the zzso zzso zzso specificity for zzso zzso was changed significantly by the zzso of the two zzso
