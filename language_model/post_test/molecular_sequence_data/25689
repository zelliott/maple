DNA sequences surrounding the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso contain negative regulatory elements which are important for the tissue specificity of the zzso We have shown that sequences located both zzso and 3' of the zzso corresponding to the negative regulatory zzso become zzso and zzso zzso over an extended length when subjected to zzso zzso These DNA sequences are also included within zzso association zzso The ability of the sequences to assume a zzso zzso zzso was shown by zzso with zzso which is specific for zzso DNA zzso as well as two-dimensional gel zzso of zzso The sequences located 3' of the zzso induce base zzso in the direction of the zzso This zzso region progressively expands to include as much as 200 base pairs as the zzso concentration decreases or zzso density zzso When an zzso motif within a negative regulatory element located 3' of the zzso was zzso the extensive zzso property was zzso This zzso property of DNA may be important for negative regulation of gene expression and attachment to the nuclear zzso
