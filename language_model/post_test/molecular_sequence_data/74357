Here we report an zzso zzso that would allow for simple and rapid analysis of zzso acids in combination with zzso activity on zzso acids and zzso zzso The detection of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso takes advantage of the significant structural and zzso differences between the full hybrids and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as the zzso indicator of zzso zzso had no affinity towards the neutral zzso probe immobilized on a gold zzso zzso zzso When the zzso probe on the zzso surface zzso with a zzso target DNA, zzso zzso attached to the zzso zzso backbone of DNA on the surface and gave rise to a high zzso zzso signal from zzso at approximately zzso zzso zzso the surface to a zzso DNA specific zzso zzso S1, was found to be very effective for removing the zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso in the target DNA to zzso made it susceptible to the zzso zzso After the zzso zzso and subsequent exposure to zzso the presence of zzso was determined by monitoring the changes in the electrical current response of zzso The method provided a detection limit of 1 fM zzso zzso 3) for the target DNA zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was employed to detect the presence of genetically modified zzso zzso in standard Roundup zzso soybean zzso zzso zzso amplification of real DNA samples was performed to detect zzso related to alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso are promising zzso for various zzso and pharmaceutical zzso
