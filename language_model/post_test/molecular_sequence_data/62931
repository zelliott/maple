In this study, we zzso the first member of a new zzso zzso A family from fluid of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso named zzso zzso is the most abundant compound zzso in the anterior part of the zzso zzso After zzso zzso it is characterized by more than 10 zzso ranging in size from 26 to 33 zzso and zzso from 5 to zzso Several zzso peptides were zzso zzso and an zzso against one of these peptides was zzso The protein was zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso especially in the zzso zone and the zzso zzso of the principal zzso In the zzso zzso were negative but droplets of reaction product were observed within the zzso Full lengths of Train A zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library and zzso The deduced protein is composed of zzso zzso zzso including a zzso acid zzso signal and a potential zzso zzso The zzso of this protein has been retrieved and partially zzso in the bull, zzso and ram, and zzso zzso is found in zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso All the sequences are highly zzso between zzso This protein and its zzso are zzso and exclusively expressed in the zzso zzso of the zzso the only site where they have been zzso Train A presents an zzso A family motif in its zzso The zzso A family is a group of several short proteins zzso zzso with greater and lesser degrees of zzso activity and with supposed different roles in zzso However, the presence of a zzso zzso specific sequence and the absence of zzso zzso site for Train A indicate that Train A protein is a member of a new family of zzso zzso
