zzso proteins with the green fluorescent protein zzso from zzso zzso is a good means of analyzing protein zzso in living zzso Nevertheless, zzso and a zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso were less fluorescent at high culture zzso zzso zzso at a low temperature retained their zzso despite a shift to a higher zzso zzso when a zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso was cultured at 23 degrees C and then shifted to 35 degrees C, we were able to exclusively monitor the zzso of the protein zzso prior to the temperature zzso This protein accumulated in novel zzso compartments devoid of zzso
