zzso zzso is derived from a membrane zzso and it enhances zzso zzso responses to zzso We studied the role of soluble zzso in the zzso of the systemic inflammatory response associated with acute zzso to determine whether altered expression was due to a functional zzso zzso in the zzso promoter gene or altered zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso zzso 

zzso pancreatic treatment unit in the United zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso 

DNA from 117 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 263 controls underwent zzso zzso using restriction zzso length zzso chain zzso 

zzso zzso blood samples at 24 and 72 zzso after the onset of abdominal pain were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells were zzso for zzso zzso expression using zzso flow zzso Disease severity was assessed using Atlanta criteria, Acute zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with mild attacks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso although the latter was similar to controls zzso 51 zzso Furthermore, soluble zzso levels correlated with Acute zzso Scores zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were all increased in severe attacks at 24 zzso Early zzso zzso density correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Acute zzso Scores zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso prevalence in acute zzso was similar to controls and failed to correlate with any variables zzso 

Increased soluble zzso expression is associated with the systemic inflammatory response to acute zzso and an expansion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Its targeted disruption may afford some benefit in preventing the development of systemic zzso
