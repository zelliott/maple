We report that a peripheral zzso protein with a molecular mass of 210 zzso localized at the zzso network zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso is a zzso protein that associates in zzso with a zzso of stable zzso zzso of this zzso now called zzso for zzso zzso protein 210, with zzso in zzso is zzso tight and zzso zzso analysis further suggests that zzso specifically binds to zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso predicts a protein of 1, zzso zzso acids with a very long central zzso zzso zzso analyses in zzso show that the zzso zzso of zzso binds to zzso whereas the zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced a dramatic enlargement of the zzso apparatus and zzso in the zzso zzso These effects did not occur when a zzso lacking the zzso domain was zzso When zzso in fusion with the green fluorescent zzso the zzso domain associated with the zzso network whereas the zzso zzso domain localized at the zzso zzso these data support the view that zzso serves to link the zzso network to the minus ends of zzso zzso In addition, this interaction appears essential for ensuring the proper zzso and size of the zzso zzso
