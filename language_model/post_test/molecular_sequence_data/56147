Previous work has shown that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for zzso and zzso is both increased and made insensitive to repression by zzso by the zzso zzso In current work, the gene in which the zzso zzso resides has been identified and zzso this zzso termed zzso is immediately upstream of, but transcribed in the opposite direction from, the zzso zzso The promoter region of zzso contains zzso and zzso sequences similar to those recognized by zzso zzso containing the major zzso zzso factor zzso A, and zzso appears to be zzso The zzso gene codes for a zzso zzso but the zzso zzso zzso has an additional zzso zzso at zzso 55, resulting in generation of a truncated zzso of only 58 zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso identical to that of the zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product zzso was zzso to that of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso characteristic of many zzso zzso was present in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso codes for a zzso of the zzso zzso
