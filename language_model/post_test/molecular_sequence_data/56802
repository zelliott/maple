The human zzso crystal structure has been solved by the molecular replacement zzso The zzso of reflections from native zzso zzso were measured at the zzso A resolution by the zzso method with a zzso zzso zzso operated in automatic zzso To determine the orientation and position of zzso molecules in the unit cell, zzso packages zzso and zzso were applied running on a zzso zzso Prior to the translation search, several rotation function zzso were subjected to a rigid body refinement against the correlation zzso between the observed and calculated structure zzso This approach clearly identified the correct orientation of the zzso The solution obtained from the zzso translation function map was refined by the zzso correlation search and then by zzso zzso The human zzso molecules packing in the crystal unit zzso is zzso
