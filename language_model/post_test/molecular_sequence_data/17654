The preferred solution zzso of the zzso zzso and of some of its structural zzso was investigated by zzso zzso and computer simulation zzso It was found that the preferred zzso is characterized by zzso of zzso and the zzso on the zzso for zzso and zzso a zzso seems to be zzso In such a zzso zzso and zzso zzso occupy exactly the same positions in space as zzso i and i + 3 in an zzso It suggests that the zzso can interact with zzso protein inducing or stabilizing its zzso zzso by zzso into zzso zzso
