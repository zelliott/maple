The surface zzso of zzso zzso of healthy human individuals were zzso B lineage cells comprised zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso Although the majority of zzso cavity zzso zzso T cells expressed alpha beta T cell zzso zzso up to zzso expressed gamma delta zzso The majority of zzso exhibited markers of the zzso lineage zzso zzso zzso alpha beta + zzso or zzso alpha + beta zzso and surface zzso associated with memory and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Up to zzso of both zzso and zzso T cells bore zzso thus characterizing the T cell subset containing helper activity for zzso B cell zzso The majority of zzso T cells were zzso and, in addition, up to zzso of this population expressed the zzso zzso alpha + beta zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso gene zzso was examined in zzso zzso depleted of zzso lineage zzso The zzso population which comprised cells containing zzso zzso transcripts was zzso surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this population was zzso zzso zzso and contained both zzso zzso (up to zzso and zzso zzso (up to zzso zzso These findings are compatible with the hypothesis that the adult human zzso provides a zzso capable of supporting a zzso differentiation of T zzso
