To investigate functional differences between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Pol zzso with zzso and zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso respectively, we have zzso the in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso forms of Pol II on zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with digital imaging, we find Pol zzso and Pol zzso arrayed in markedly different, zzso and zzso zzso Major zzso zzso for example, stain exclusively for Pol zzso indicating that zzso Pol II is the zzso active form of the zzso on these zzso In striking contrast, induced heat shock zzso stain strongly for both Pol zzso and Pol zzso suggesting that heat shock genes are transcribed by a mixture of zzso and zzso forms of Pol zzso At the zzso sites of a zzso carrying a hybrid zzso zzso we observe only Pol zzso before heat shock zzso consistent with the idea that Pol II arrested on the zzso gene is form zzso After a zzso heat zzso we detect heat shock factor zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and after a zzso shock its spatial distribution on the induced zzso zzso is clearly resolved from that of Pol zzso Finally, using zzso to zzso proteins and zzso zzso we have discerned an apparent overall correlation between the presence and processing of nascent transcripts and the presence of Pol zzso
