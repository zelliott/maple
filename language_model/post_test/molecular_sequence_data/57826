zzso zzso zzso produces an zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso which encodes this zzso was determined and found to include regions with a significant zzso to the zzso zzso of members of the family zzso and zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso contained 17 zzso acids immediately preceding the putative zzso zzso which were highly zzso among the zzso of the zzso zzso Although the zzso sequence had a total zzso content of zzso the predicted zzso usage was more characteristic of zzso coli zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso having G or C in the third position, in contrast to the values for the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso can be regulated by the zzso coli gene product zzso A putative zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with the positive regulation of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as confirmed by gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not regulate zzso zzso Thus, by zzso studies, zzso zzso and genetic analysis, the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to have been acquired from members of the family zzso and belongs to the class C group of zzso
