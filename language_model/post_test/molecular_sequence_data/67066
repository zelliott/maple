zzso infection by zzso C virus zzso is a leading cause of liver disease for which better therapies are urgently zzso Because a clearer understanding of the viral life cycle may suggest novel zzso approaches, we studied the role of host signal zzso zzso zzso in viral zzso This zzso zzso zzso within a zzso signal sequence in the viral core zzso but the molecular zzso of zzso and whether it is required for infection in zzso are zzso To answer these questions, we studied zzso processing in zzso virus B zzso zzso zzso is the closest zzso relative of zzso and offers an accurate surrogate model for zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso also processes zzso core protein and that a zzso zzso in the zzso region of the signal sequence zzso also in zzso is critical for efficient zzso zzso The small size of the zzso side chain combined with its ability to form zzso and zzso hydrogen bonds likely contributes to recognition of the signal sequence as a zzso for zzso By introducing zzso with differing effects on zzso processing into an infectious zzso molecular zzso we demonstrate that zzso processing of the core protein is required for productive infection in zzso These results broaden our understanding of the mechanism and requirements for zzso zzso and reveal a functional role in zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, they identify zzso as a potential therapeutic target for reducing the impact of zzso zzso
