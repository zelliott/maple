We have investigated DNA synthesis and levels of zzso zzso zzso and the binding pattern of nuclear proteins to various elements in the rat zzso zzso gene upstream region with zzso I zzso zzso Both DNA synthesis and zzso zzso zzso level were increased with zzso stimulation reached at 24 zzso and 36 zzso after partial zzso zzso In zzso I zzso analysis, the nuclear factors interacting with the three zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso site B at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso were required during zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso level after partial zzso The zzso I protection pattern by nuclear extract of the zzso zzso liver showed the same results with normal zzso These results suggest that zzso regulation of zzso zzso gene during liver zzso may be zzso by nuclear factors that are newly induced by partial zzso
