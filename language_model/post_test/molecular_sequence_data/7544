The zzso c protein of zzso zzso zzso accumulates in zzso storage bodies of numerous zzso in human subjects with certain forms of zzso a degenerative zzso zzso zzso c appears to constitute a major fraction of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso c has also been reported in putative animal models zzso sheep and zzso for zzso In humans with the juvenile form of the disease, zzso of total zzso protein have been found to contain significant amounts of zzso zzso zzso is also abundant in zzso protein zzso from affected dogs and zzso These findings suggested that one or both of the two zzso zzso of zzso c might be zzso in the stored form of the zzso The normal zzso c protein from zzso does not appear to be zzso In a putative canine model for human juvenile zzso zzso 43 of the zzso zzso c was previously found to be zzso In the present study, zzso c was isolated from the storage bodies of humans with juvenile zzso and from sheep and mice with apparently analogous zzso In all three species, partial zzso acid sequence analysis of the stored zzso c indicated that the protein contained zzso at zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that specific zzso of zzso zzso 43 of zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the zzso storage of this zzso
