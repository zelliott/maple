The zzso gene zzso a surface membrane protein is expressed in zzso zzso zzso We have isolated the mouse zzso gene and determined the sequence of all zzso The mouse zzso gene is composed of 14 zzso spanning zzso 31 zzso zzso extension analysis identified two zzso initiation sites 33 zzso and 179 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso region of the first zzso revealed a number of consensus binding sites for known zzso factors such as zzso box, zzso zzso zzso Neither typical zzso nor zzso boxes were found in this zzso These results and the analysis of the zzso activity showed that zzso of the zzso gene is regulated at a zzso zzso
