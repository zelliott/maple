Increased interactions between zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso family proteins at zzso result in tumor zzso progression and resistance to traditional zzso Drugs that mimic the zzso region are expected to release zzso proteins from zzso zzso inducing zzso in some cancer cells and zzso others to zzso Recently, we applied zzso lifetime imaging zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer to measure zzso interactions for the zzso family of proteins in live zzso cells using fluorescent fusion zzso While the zzso bound to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso inhibited binding of only Bad and zzso but not zzso We have extended our studies by investigating zzso a clinical drug based on zzso We show that the zzso effects and pattern of the two drugs are comparable for both zzso and zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso region in Bad and zzso disrupted their interactions with zzso and zzso while the corresponding zzso zzso showed no decrease in binding to these zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso has unique binding properties compared with other zzso proteins that resist displacement from zzso and zzso by zzso zzso
