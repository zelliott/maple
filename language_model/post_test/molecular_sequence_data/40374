Six zzso strains isolated from soil and zzso samples in Indonesia were studied for their zzso position by using a zzso zzso zzso all the strains were located in the broad cluster of the zzso zzso zzso data zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso type III zzso major zzso zzso and zzso major zzso zzso major fatty acid, zzso major zzso zzso supported the affiliation of all six strains to the zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso with DNA from type strains of zzso species with zzso published names revealed three zzso zzso zzso Group I zzso showed low zzso to the other strains zzso The three strains in group II zzso zzso and zzso formed a group with high zzso zzso and showed low zzso to the other strains zzso The two strains in group III zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed low zzso zzso to the other strains zzso The description of three novel species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the single strain in group I zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the strains in group II zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the strains in group III zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
