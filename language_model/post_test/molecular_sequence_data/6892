To search for genes related to zzso the differential display technique for zzso zzso was zzso We have cloned a gene that encodes the zzso protein from the zzso library of human zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso was identified in zzso specimens and the zzso zzso cell line but only rarely in small amounts in zzso zzso In 79 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in 52 cases zzso found in trace amounts in 11, and not zzso in 16 zzso In 12 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in 21 zzso of 31 tumor zzso and was helpful for the determination of tumor zzso zzso There was an increased frequency of zzso zzso zzso in patients younger than 50 years with zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso in serum zzso B surface zzso individuals zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso in those with an elevated serum zzso level zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and in zzso with zzso zzso expression zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso There was a strong correlation of zzso zzso zzso with zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and poorly differentiated zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso Despite its correlation with zzso zzso and the zzso outcome of zzso with zzso zzso the zzso zzso expression did not correlate with tumor size, tumor zzso or patient's zzso Thus, the zzso gene expression appears to be a common event in zzso and may serve as an early but not zzso zzso for zzso transformation of zzso
