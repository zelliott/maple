A zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from tidal flat zzso of the South Sea, South Korea, and subjected to a zzso study using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso at 25 zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it exhibited the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values between strain zzso and the type strains of other species of the zzso zzso were in the range zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso and the mean zzso zzso values with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso fatty zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and one unidentified zzso zzso zzso properties, together with the zzso and genetic zzso showed that strain zzso could be differentiated from other species of the zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
