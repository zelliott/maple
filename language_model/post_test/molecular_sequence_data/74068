The zzso zzso a zzso DNA zzso zzso strand exchange between zzso zzso In rice, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso protein has been partially zzso however the zzso properties of the zzso protein have not been zzso In the present study, we expressed the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in bacteria and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins formed zzso filaments along zzso DNA zzso and zzso DNA zzso and promoted robust strand exchange between zzso and zzso over five thousand base pairs in the presence of zzso as a zzso The zzso and zzso proteins also promoted strand exchange in the absence of zzso with long DNA zzso containing several thousand base zzso In contrast, the human zzso protein strictly required zzso to promote strand exchange with these long DNA zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso protein was much higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso protein was higher than that of the zzso zzso These zzso differences between the zzso and zzso proteins may provide important insight into their functional differences during zzso in zzso
