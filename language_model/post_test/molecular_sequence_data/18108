Two soybean zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso over a region that includes 4 zzso of zzso and 1 zzso of 3' zzso zzso The expression of these genes was compared using synthetic zzso zzso Analysis of a soybean leaf zzso library indicates that zzso and zzso are the most highly expressed members of the soybean zzso gene zzso Similar changes were observed in the zzso levels for these genes in response to white light, zzso light and darkness, although zzso was expressed at a zzso higher level in total zzso than zzso under all zzso However, nuclear zzso zzso indicate that zzso is transcribed at a lower rate than zzso which suggests that zzso zzso is more zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso directed zzso H zzso indicate that transcripts from both genes are zzso within two principle regions separated by 35 zzso zzso analysis of 16 independent zzso clones identified seven different zzso sites, and six of these sites lie within these two zzso Although zzso zzso was poorly recovered during zzso zzso zzso H zzso experiments showed that transcripts from zzso and zzso had similar zzso zzso tail lengths ranging from 0 to 220 zzso In addition, and despite differences in the untranslated leader zzso zzso and zzso zzso are assembled into zzso with equal zzso The overall similarity in expression patterns for these two genes further illustrates the coordinate evolution of individual members of a zzso gene family and is consistent with the proposal that gene conversion zzso both the coding and regulatory regions of these zzso
