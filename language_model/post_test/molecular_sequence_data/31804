zzso zzso comprise a group of small zzso zzso molecules thought to have contributed to the evolution of zzso brain zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is well zzso between zzso and zzso and is expressed abundantly in the central nervous system zzso We identified zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and investigated its role in neural zzso The five candidate genes for zzso precursor zzso are zzso on four different zzso and differ in zzso zzso Their sequences suggest that they can generate functional zzso through conventional zzso zzso by folding into zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and northern zzso revealed that mature zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso and the eyes starting at two days zzso We also examined the sequences and expression of zzso zzso tract binding protein 1 zzso a possible direct target of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso contains predicted binding motifs (target zzso for zzso A zzso reporter zzso for the target sites or the entire zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso is involved in zzso regulation of target genes in neural development and that zzso zzso zzso may have zzso roles different from those in other zzso
