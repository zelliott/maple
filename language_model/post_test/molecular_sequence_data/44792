zzso growth factors zzso and zzso are found in most embryonic and adult normal and tumor zzso where they are immobilized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso is part of a tightly controlled process resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso Recently, we have shown that a novel human zzso protein zzso mediates the release of immobilized zzso from the zzso Here we isolated zzso and zzso clones of the mouse zzso zzso and studied its expression during embryonic development and skin zzso The zzso gene contains two zzso that generate a zzso zzso zzso and predicts an 18 zzso zzso protein that is zzso identical to its human zzso zzso zzso expression during zzso is restricted to skin, zzso and zzso In the developing skin, zzso expression starts at embryonic day 9, reaches peak levels zzso and is zzso during zzso zzso Development regulation in the zzso is similar, but in lungs and zzso high expression was also observed in the zzso zzso zzso expression in the adult skin is dramatically increased during early stages of zzso transformation in zzso and by zzso in zzso Finally, mouse zzso binds to zzso and can function as a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest a potential function of zzso during development and zzso
