The structural zzso of deep rough zzso zzso many biological systems the most active zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was investigated as function of temperature, water content, and zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso was used to determine the amount of bound water and the zzso change at the zzso gel to liquid zzso zzso chain zzso The zzso zzso zzso and completion of the zzso phase transition were studied with zzso infrared zzso zzso radiation X-ray zzso was used to characterize the zzso three-dimensional structures in each phase zzso The results indicate an extremely complex dependence of the structural behavior of zzso on ambient zzso The zzso zzso chain melting temperature zzso lying at 30 degrees C at high water content zzso increases with decreasing water content reaching a value of 50 degrees C at zzso water zzso zzso a broadening of the transition range takes zzso At still lower water content, no distinct phase transition can be zzso This behavior is even more clearly expressed in the presence of zzso In the lower water concentration range zzso zzso at temperatures below 70 degrees C, only zzso structures can be observed independent of the zzso zzso This zzso with the absence of free zzso Above 50% water zzso the zzso structure below 70 degrees C strongly depends on the zzso zzso For large zzso ratios, the zzso structure is zzso for smaller zzso ratios there is a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso At an zzso ratio of zzso and zzso a zzso organization is zzso The zzso structures can be assigned in various cases to structures with cubic symmetry with zzso between 12 and 16 zzso Under all investigated conditions, a transition into the zzso II structure takes place between 70 and 80 degrees zzso These observations are discussed in relation to the biological importance of zzso as constituent of the outer membrane of zzso bacteria and as potent zzso of biological effects in zzso
