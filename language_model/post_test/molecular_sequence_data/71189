To identify genes induced by transient zzso zzso we used the zzso differential display technique in the zzso zzso model in zzso Some genes were identified as candidates that zzso zzso zzso and one of them was cloned as zzso protein 94 zzso zzso from the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that rat zzso was a zzso zzso or a zzso of mouse zzso and human heat shock protein zzso zzso and a member of the zzso family, because zzso was zzso identical to zzso and zzso and approximately zzso identical to the other members of the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the normal zzso it was clearly enhanced zzso h after zzso for 10 zzso zzso and 15 zzso zzso zzso These changes mainly occurred in zzso cells, as judged by the zzso of zzso zzso using in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso stress did not enhance zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso expression was enhanced under zzso stress and not related to the heat shock signaling zzso Our study suggested that zzso a novel member of the zzso family, might play an important role in the environment altering zzso functions, especially after transient zzso zzso
