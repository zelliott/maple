zzso Forest virus zzso and zzso virus zzso are enveloped zzso that enter cells via zzso fusion in the zzso zzso and exit by budding from the plasma zzso Previous studies with zzso insect cells have shown that zzso requires cholesterol in the cell membrane for both virus fusion and efficient exit of progeny zzso An zzso zzso zzso shows efficient fusion and exit in the absence of cholesterol due to a single point zzso in the E1 spike zzso zzso 226 to zzso We have here characterized the role of cholesterol in the entry and exit of zzso an zzso quite zzso related to zzso zzso primary infection, fusion, and exit of zzso were all dramatically inhibited in zzso cells compared to control zzso Based on sequence differences within the E1 226 region between zzso zzso and zzso we constructed six zzso zzso with zzso within this region and characterized their cholesterol zzso A zzso zzso zzso that had the zzso zzso acid sequence from E1 position 224 to 235 showed increases of approximately zzso in infection and approximately zzso in fusion with zzso cells compared with infection and fusion of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso exit from zzso cells was markedly more efficient than that of zzso zzso Thus, similar to zzso zzso was cholesterol dependent for both virus entry and exit, and the cholesterol dependence of both steps could be modulated by sequences within the E1 226 zzso
