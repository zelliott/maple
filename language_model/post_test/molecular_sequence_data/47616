To investigate properties of zzso bundled peptides and their interactions with zzso zzso bundled peptides named zzso and zzso which are composed of four fragments of zzso zzso zzso were designed and zzso zzso zzso was introduced at the 2nd position from the zzso or at the zzso zzso of the zzso to monitor the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the peptides had low zzso in a buffer solution zzso zzso and also in the presence of zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso the measurement could not be taken because of zzso induced by zzso zzso Both peptides had moderate zzso activity for both the neutral and zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso The zzso patterns at 50 degrees C were much different from those at 25 degrees C and the maximum activity reached zzso at a low zzso zzso The results of the measurement of membrane fusion activity of peptides showed a similar tendency to that found in the zzso zzso A zzso experiment indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were scarcely embedded in neutral zzso zzso
