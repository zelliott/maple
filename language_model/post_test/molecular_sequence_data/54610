zzso an zzso zzso skeletal zzso is characterized by short zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso closure, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dental zzso The disorder is caused by zzso gene zzso a gene localized on zzso 

To describe the clinical, zzso and molecular findings in a family with zzso 

The zzso gene was analyzed from zzso DNA in a zzso Mexican family with 3 affected members with zzso and 100 healthy zzso 

We identified the novel zzso zzso zzso within zzso 8 of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso leads to the substitution of the zzso acid zzso at position zzso by zzso acid zzso in zzso K zzso No zzso correlation was present in affected members of the family with zzso
