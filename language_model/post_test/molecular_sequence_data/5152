My colleagues and I have reported that a small nuclear zzso zzso can cause transformation of and zzso aberrations in rat zzso zzso zzso In the study described here, I found that a partial zzso zzso the 3' half of the first stem structure zzso zzso transformed the cells zzso at a high frequency when expressed with a zzso tail zzso The transformation critically depended upon a zzso sequence in zzso The expressed zzso was associated with zzso The transformed cells did not exhibit significant zzso of zzso aberrations when compared with control cells, suggesting that the transformation occurs without significant induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso emerged in zzso when the zzso transformed cells were zzso and maintained at zzso zzso from zzso acquired the ability to form small colonies in soft zzso and tumors in nude mice, suggesting that zzso can drive the cells into the zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso and a growth advantage and decreased levels of zzso protein synthesis in human zzso cells, confirming the transforming potential of the zzso zzso transformation may therefore be a useful model system for studying a transformation zzso
