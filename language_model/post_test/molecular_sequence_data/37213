zzso bodies zzso are nuclear zzso implicated in the zzso maturation of small nuclear and small zzso zzso The number of zzso displayed by various cell lines and zzso varies, and factors that control CB numbers within a given cell have yet to be zzso In this report, we show that specific regions within the zzso of zzso the CB marker zzso are responsible for regulating the number of nuclear zzso Despite the fact that the zzso zzso domain is responsible for its zzso activity, zzso or zzso of predicted sites of zzso in the zzso zzso region leads to a striking zzso in the number of nuclear zzso Similarly, zzso zzso from various species display differential zzso to form nuclear zzso when expressed in zzso zzso We mapped the domain responsible for this zzso to the zzso zzso utilizing zzso zzso Furthermore, the activities responsible for regulating zzso zzso must reside in the nucleus, as zzso lacking critical nuclear zzso sequences fail to form zzso in the zzso zzso controlling the putative signal zzso cascade that zzso zzso are also zzso The results point to a model zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regulates the availability of the zzso zzso zzso
