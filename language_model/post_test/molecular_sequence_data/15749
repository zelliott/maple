Recently, we have isolated zzso genes zzso on the basis of the zzso screening of zzso with a zzso zzso library from zzso One of the selected genes zzso 32 zzso appears to be a key zzso for salt stress tolerance in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes for a zzso zzso which is zzso identity with the zzso zzso 32 zzso unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso altered root zzso including reduced zzso length and reduced seed zzso In an effort to further assess zzso tolerance in zzso we have functionally characterized the zzso gene and determined that zzso and the plant hormone zzso induced the expression of zzso The zzso zzso was more sensitive to zzso than the zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced salt tolerance and increased activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso plants exhibited increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso is involved in both zzso tolerance and zzso signaling as a positive regulator in zzso
