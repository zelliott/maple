A complete understanding of protein and zzso structures and their interactions is important for determining the binding sites in zzso zzso zzso approaches exist for identifying secondary structural elements in proteins from atomic zzso However, similar methods have not been developed for zzso due in part to the very limited structural data so far zzso We have developed a set of zzso for zzso and visualizing secondary and zzso structures of zzso and for analyzing zzso zzso These zzso have been implemented in a zzso program called zzso zzso interaction zzso Given one or more protein data bank files of zzso complexes, zzso analyzes the zzso of the zzso zzso the hydrogen bond zzso zzso and van der zzso interactions between zzso acids and zzso extracts secondary and zzso zzso structure zzso and identifies the patterns of interactions between the proteins and zzso This paper presents zzso and its application to the hydrogen bond and van der zzso interactions in the most representative set of zzso zzso The analysis reveals several interesting interaction patterns at various zzso The information provided by zzso should prove useful for determining the binding sites in zzso zzso zzso is accessible at zzso and supplementary materials are available in the analysis results section at zzso
