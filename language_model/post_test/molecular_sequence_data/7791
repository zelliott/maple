The gene coding the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and its complete DNA sequence was zzso The zzso zzso structural gene consists of zzso zzso and encodes zzso zzso acid zzso The molecular weight of the zzso was calculated to be zzso This value is close to the apparent molecular weight of zzso determined for the zzso zzso from zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein exactly matches the zzso acid sequence derived from the DNA sequence and that determined from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the cloned zzso zzso showed high sequence zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso This fact strongly suggests that these three zzso have evolved from a common ancestral zzso
