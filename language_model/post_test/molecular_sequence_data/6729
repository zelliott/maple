This paper reports the cloning and sequencing of a region of DNA from zzso zzso zzso 3 surrounding zzso zzso zzso of which was previously shown to result in lack of expression of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso inserted into a consensus zzso site 71 zzso from the zzso end of the cloned zzso Within the zzso 3' downstream regions from two different zzso zzso genes were identified, as well as a putative zzso AA open reading frame zzso Moreover, two copies of the repeat element zzso oriented in opposite directions, were located immediately 3' of zzso Within the region bounded by the first pair of internal sequencing zzso analysis revealed that the zzso amplified by zzso was always of the same zzso Moreover, Southern zzso showed that for all zzso examined to date, zzso exists with the cloned zzso These results indicate that this region of the zzso is highly zzso and, taken together with other independently derived data, suggest that interruptions or deletions within this DNA lead to zzso
