The human zzso zzso is the cellular zzso of the viral zzso zzso and codes for a 75 zzso protein involved in growth regulation and differentiation in a number of zzso Fusion proteins in which human zzso sequences are linked to the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso from a reporter gene which carries the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene linked in zzso to a repeat of the zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso sequences allowed the identification of the domain responsible for zzso zzso which is located between zzso acid zzso 275 to zzso zzso of this zzso domain results in zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein can also activate zzso whereas no zzso by zzso is observed, indicating that a zzso domain of zzso which is absent from zzso apparently zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso formation which is required for zzso by zzso fusion proteins can, when zzso is zzso be zzso by a region of the zzso protein upstream of the zzso domain possibly including the zzso domain itself but not a putative zzso zzso located downstream of this zzso
