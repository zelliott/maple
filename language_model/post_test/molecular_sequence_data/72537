The molecular identities of most zzso zzso channel proteins and putative regulatory elements are currently zzso Recently, a role for a zzso zzso zzso regulator, zzso in the function of a ubiquitous zzso zzso channel has been zzso Here, we report the cloning of a zzso of the mouse zzso gene and identification of probable zzso zzso The functional zzso gene was mapped independently to human zzso zzso and mouse zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be abundantly expressed and evenly distributed in all mouse zzso examined and at four stages of embryonic development, consistent with the proposed role of zzso in the regulation of a ubiquitous zzso zzso
