The degradation rates of different zzso in higher plants can vary over a broad range and are regulated by a variety of zzso and zzso zzso During the past several years, efforts to better understand the control of zzso stability in plants have increased considerably and this has led to improved zzso and important zzso zzso In this review, we highlight some of the most interesting examples of plant transcripts that are controlled at the level of zzso zzso and discuss what has been learned from their zzso zzso that zzso or demonstrate the involvement of particular zzso and zzso factors in zzso zzso pathways are a major focus, as are those experiments that have led to zzso zzso zzso is also placed on studies that address the relationship between translation and zzso zzso Our current knowledge indicates that some of the zzso and pathways for zzso zzso may differ in plants compared to other zzso whereas others appear to be zzso This knowledge, coupled with the availability of zzso molecular and genetic approaches to zzso plant zzso zzso mechanisms, should continue to lead to findings of novel and general zzso
