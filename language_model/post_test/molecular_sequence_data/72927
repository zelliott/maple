zzso also known as zzso zzso was recently identified as the naturally occurring zzso of orphan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1995, Nature zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1995, Science zzso zzso zzso is a zzso which, although it resembles zzso A, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso displays very low potency in competing with binding of zzso to or zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used here to establish a pharmacological profile in zzso of the zzso 1 zzso In zzso from zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso 1 zzso equilibrium binding of zzso is highly specific, zzso zzso in the range zzso zzso zzso and of high affinity zzso approximately equal to zzso zzso It is selectively decreased in the presence of zzso zzso and/or of the zzso analog zzso an zzso regulation that is analogous to that of zzso binding to zzso zzso A few zzso namely zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso were found to be quite potent not only in competing with binding of zzso at the zzso 1 zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in intact zzso zzso zzso In a preliminary attempt to delineate active parts of the zzso zzso zzso were also tested, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the highly zzso internal core of zzso might be essential in zzso on the zzso both affinity for and activity at the zzso 1 zzso In this respect, the message and address division of zzso A, zzso closest structural zzso do not seem to apply to zzso
