Small zzso zzso like the hairpin zzso are proving to be useful zzso zzso however, most attempts to demonstrate zzso of zzso by zzso in cells have been frustrated by rapid cellular degradation of the zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso that directly monitors zzso of target zzso in zzso zzso An zzso zzso was modified to inhibit cellular zzso degradation without interfering with zzso zzso and donor zzso and zzso zzso zzso were introduced at positions zzso the zzso zzso In simple zzso the intact zzso produces a strong zzso signal that is lost upon zzso resulting in a zzso shift in dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso were zzso into zzso zzso under conditions in which zzso zzso can occur only inside the zzso A strong zzso signal was observed by zzso zzso when zzso was injected, but rapid zzso of the zzso signal occurred when an active, zzso zzso was introduced with the zzso No acceleration in zzso rates was observed in control experiments utilizing a zzso zzso inactive zzso or an active zzso with altered zzso zzso zzso the fluorescent zzso were injected into zzso cell lines that expressed zzso or zzso zzso A decrease in zzso signal was observed only when zzso was zzso into cells expressing its zzso zzso These results demonstrate zzso of zzso within zzso cells, and provide an experimental basis for quantitative analysis of zzso activity and specificity within the zzso
