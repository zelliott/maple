The major diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso are the H and M zzso zzso zzso that elicit both zzso and zzso immune zzso These zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso M zzso is considered zzso because zzso against it are the first zzso to arise in acute zzso and are commonly present during all zzso of zzso The biological activity of zzso M zzso and its ability to elicit a protective immune response to zzso zzso are largely zzso A molecular approach was used to identify the biological nature of M zzso including its zzso from zzso partial zzso with zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso to separate the released zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso peptides were obtained by zzso degradation, and using zzso zzso zzso for zzso a zzso zzso of the gene zzso the M zzso was amplified from zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was used to screen an zzso zzso zzso DNA library, leading to the isolation, zzso and sequencing of the full-length zzso The M gene consists of 2, zzso DNA zzso a protein of zzso zzso which has significant zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso was generated by reverse zzso and cloned into the expression zzso zzso The identity of the zzso expressed protein was confirmed by Western zzso The zzso fusion protein was zzso with zzso zzso raised against M zzso with zzso mouse zzso zzso and with a serum sample from a patient with zzso The gene zzso the major zzso M zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and the zzso protein retains zzso zzso
