zzso zzso of proteins by zzso or zzso molecules is an important form of zzso modification and plays a critical role in many cellular zzso Similar to the concept of zzso and zzso these zzso are regulated by a large number of zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of a zzso pair DNA zzso from human zzso zzso library by a strategy that involves expressed sequence tag data base searching, zzso chain reaction, and rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the cloned zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a novel zzso zzso which is composed of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of 43 zzso The human zzso gene is located on zzso zzso and encodes a member of the zzso zzso family with highly zzso zzso and His zzso The activity and specificity of zzso were determined by using a zzso cell expression system in zzso We showed that zzso is capable of removing zzso from zzso proteins as zzso Furthermore, zzso is capable of removing zzso from zzso zzso but has no effect on zzso zzso As expected from its zzso activity, zzso of zzso has a profound growth zzso effect on zzso zzso Thus, zzso is the first zzso zzso shown to have dual specificity for both zzso and zzso and may play an important role in the regulation of cell zzso
