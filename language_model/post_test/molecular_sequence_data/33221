After zzso grouping of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso has been always a big topic to the zzso Because of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and stable characters have been investigated for zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso analyses revealed different patterns among strains assigned to a same zzso zzso these characteristics would be considered as tools for strain discrimination than species zzso The most recently developed and the most promising method is the sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso coding DNA zzso zzso The zzso tree based on comparison of zzso zzso sequences distinguished the 3 zzso groups of zzso and divided them into 12 unique sequence types zzso zzso Most clinical and environmental zzso belonged to the zzso group II and the zzso zzso In the Republic of Korea, 2 strains of zzso zzso and zzso were first isolated from the environment in zzso However, zzso identification of Korean zzso zzso from human infections or the environment were tried from the late zzso By zzso analysis or total sequence analysis of zzso zzso revealed that almost all clinical zzso including the one from a suspicious zzso zzso encephalitis patient belonged to the zzso zzso A large number of environmental zzso from contact lens storage cases, tapped water, and ocean sediments also belonged to the zzso zzso Almost identical strain zzso such as Mt DNA zzso pattern of environmental zzso with the clinical zzso could make a simple conclusion that most environmental zzso might be a potential zzso
