zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso in an zzso zzso The product of this conversion is a building block for a variety of primary zzso zzso in bacteria, possibly implicated directly in zzso zzso Here, we describe the solution of the high-resolution crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso in the resting zzso This structure represents the first zzso zzso utilizing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family to be determined, as well as the first zzso structure of the zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso a full reaction zzso On the basis of a comparison of this structure with structures of zzso zzso a chemical mechanism is proposed in which zzso acts as the zzso base, initiating hydride transfer by abstraction of the zzso from the sugar zzso zzso with the removal of the zzso from the zzso zzso the sugar zzso is transferred to the B face of the zzso zzso forming the reduced zzso and a zzso zzso A zzso zzso most likely acts to position the zzso zzso so that hydride transfer is favorable and/or to reduce the zzso of zzso Following zzso zzso we propose that zzso acting as a base, would abstract the zzso of zzso zzso the intermediate for the spontaneous loss of zzso Finally, the resulting zzso intermediate would be reduced zzso by the zzso and zzso at zzso is likely zzso by zzso
