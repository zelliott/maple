A mouse model was designed to test in zzso the efficacy of rabies immune zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso to prevent European bat zzso 1 zzso Human or zzso rabies immune zzso previously found to contain variable amounts of zzso bat zzso zzso zzso were passively transferred to mice receiving zzso a lethal dose of bat zzso type zzso zzso zzso did not protect mice well against bat zzso 1 whereas they reduced the mortality caused by rabies zzso In contrast, mice zzso with bat zzso 1 or rabies virus survived when passively zzso with bat zzso 1 specific zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso an zzso zzso recognized an zzso located in the zzso site zzso of rabies zzso A zzso replacing the zzso 198 by zzso in a rabies zzso zzso sensitivity to this zzso zzso Because of its broad zzso spectrum against wild virus zzso including European bat zzso this zzso zzso should be a good candidate for rabies immune zzso zzso It could improve efficacy of rabies zzso used either alone or in conjunction with human rabies immune zzso or zzso zzso cocktail to supplement their lack of zzso to European bat zzso zzso
