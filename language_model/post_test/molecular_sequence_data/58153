We have deduced the zzso acid sequences of four sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared them to rat brain light chain zzso zzso of the zzso open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso reveals that the first 500 or so zzso of the zzso are highly zzso but the zzso ends of rat and sea zzso light chains are zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 share a highly zzso 86 zzso zzso segment that is missing from the shorter rat light chains and zzso The zzso of 28 and 37 zzso segments at zzso zzso of zzso 2 and 3, respectively, gives rise to sequence zzso at the zzso ends of the sea zzso zzso zzso sequence differences between light chains may provide zzso and zzso differences in the functional properties of the zzso cargo attachment elements of zzso
