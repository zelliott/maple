zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso that can regulate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is comprised of a zzso domain and a long zzso regulatory zzso This zzso domain has a scaffold function in that it can assemble zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso which has zzso protein activity toward zzso Thus, we tested whether zzso zzso interact with the regulatory domain of zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso binds to a site in the zzso one-third of zzso which includes its zzso zzso The interaction is prevented by zzso of the essential zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the zzso activity of full-length zzso as much as zzso toward zzso but does not appear to be zzso by zzso under conditions that result in modification of zzso In zzso we have characterized a novel point at which zzso zzso impinge upon the regulation and function of zzso
