The zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso encodes five type zzso zzso systems, zzso to zzso most of which are associated with genes zzso zzso zzso named after their zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the strong zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which share a large panel of zzso zzso zzso with substantial numbers of their zzso zzso zzso The zzso of these numerous zzso proteins is dependent on their export by a functional zzso the predicted zzso channel of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso deleted for all zzso zzso and zzso zzso although highly attenuated in zzso mice, remains able to induce immunity against the zzso zzso zzso factors, via zzso with their numerous zzso and against the zzso zzso factors zzso The zzso strain is strongly protective against zzso infection zzso and represents a potential zzso vaccine zzso
