zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two zzso linked zzso zzso A, a zzso anchor, and a zzso core zzso consisting of an inner and outer core zzso We report the isolation and characterization of the deepest rough zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso I that zzso the transfer of the first zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso followed by silver zzso showed that zzso zzso in the zzso gene resulted in the expression of a severely truncated LOS compared to zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso showed that the zzso LOS species lacked all zzso zzso to zzso zzso Parallel structural studies of the zzso zzso of the zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso revealed loss of the zzso group in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene into a zzso locus resulted in LOS and zzso structures identical to those expressed in the parent zzso We also report here the presence of zzso zzso in zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
