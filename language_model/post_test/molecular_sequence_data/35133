zzso zzso System zzso zzso arising from DNA replication that escape from DNA zzso zzso zzso This system consists of three main zzso zzso responsible for zzso recognition and zzso zzso is a member of zzso zzso family and its zzso cycle has been proposed to zzso zzso activity during the repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso domain connected by a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso domain that possesses metal zzso zzso zzso With the aim to identify characteristics that allow the zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso activity, we used an in zzso and experimental approach to determine the interaction surfaces of zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared it with the well characterized zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations of zzso and zzso bound to or free of zzso zzso showed that a significant difference exists between the behavior of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso particularly in the zzso zzso zzso based simulations of zzso zzso with zzso activity were performed that allowed an insight of the zzso interface behavior in this family of zzso Our experimental results show that, unlike zzso zzso is zzso in presence of zzso zzso in mixed zzso allowed us to identify the zzso putative DNA binding patch and a putative interaction patch located opposite to the zzso zzso zzso based simulations of zzso zzso in presence of zzso or zzso suggest that zzso binding could zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Far western zzso performed in presence of zzso or zzso are in agreement with our in zzso zzso
