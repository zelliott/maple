The zzso zzso zzso is mainly regulated at the level of conversion of zzso zzso A zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso As zzso are known to influence cholesterol zzso we have explored the potential regulation of the zzso zzso zzso gene promoter by zzso The promoter contains an zzso zzso sequence at position zzso zzso zzso which differs from the zzso consensus by one mismatch in each half of the zzso A zzso zzso specifically bound zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso responsiveness to a zzso promoter in all cell lines zzso However, expression of a reporter driven by the rat zzso zzso zzso promoter was induced by zzso treatment after transient zzso into the breast cancer cell line zzso cells but not in zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso zzso induction in zzso cells was dependent on the zzso and was strongly inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso A functional zzso element is located immediately upstream of the zzso but zzso and zzso inhibit each other in terms of zzso of the zzso Similarly, induction by zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso of cholesterol, likely acting via changes in occupancy of the zzso element located 70 zzso upstream of the zzso Thus, within its natural context, zzso is able to mediate hormonal regulation of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso that respond to zzso with enhanced cell zzso while it is not operative in liver zzso We zzso that this zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso could partially explain the protective effect of zzso against heart zzso
