It is well known that using random zzso sequences for zzso experiments will generally yield zzso zzso Early experimental results suggest that having a structurally diverse library, which, for instance, includes zzso zzso may prove useful in finding new functional zzso Here, we develop two zzso methods to generate sequences that exhibit higher structural complexity and can be used to increase the overall structural diversity of initial pools for in zzso selection zzso Random zzso selectively increases the number of zzso junctions in zzso pools, and zzso zzso designs zzso pools to a specified structure distribution, whether uniform or zzso We show that using our zzso designed DNA pool greatly improves access to highly complex sequence structures for zzso experiments (without losing our ability to select for common one-way and zzso junction zzso
