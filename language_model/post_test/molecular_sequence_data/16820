As key regulators of zzso zzso zzso the Aurora family of zzso zzso play an important role in cell zzso zzso in Aurora zzso have been strongly linked with cancer, which has lead to the recent development of new classes of zzso drugs that specifically target the zzso domain of these zzso From an evolutionary perspective, the species distribution of the Aurora zzso family is zzso zzso uniquely have three Aurora zzso zzso zzso and zzso while for other zzso including the frog, zzso and zzso only zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The zzso have a single zzso zzso Based on the tacit assumption of zzso to human counterparts, model zzso studies have been central to the functional characterization of Aurora zzso However, the zzso and zzso relationships of these zzso across various species have not been rigorously zzso Here, we present comprehensive evolutionary analyses of the Aurora zzso zzso 

zzso trees suggest that all three zzso zzso evolved from a single zzso zzso Specifically, zzso is an zzso lineage in cold-blooded zzso and zzso while structurally similar zzso and zzso evolved more recently in zzso from a zzso of an ancestral zzso gene found in cold-blooded zzso All so-called zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are ancestral to the zzso of zzso zzso and, therefore, are not strictly zzso to zzso zzso Comparisons of human zzso and zzso sequences to the resolved zzso structure of human zzso lends further support to the evolutionary scenario that zzso zzso and zzso are closely related zzso Of the 26 zzso lining the zzso active site, only three were zzso and all were specific to zzso 

In this study, we found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are highly divergent protein families from their zzso zzso Furthermore, while the zzso family is ubiquitous among all zzso the zzso and zzso families in humans arose from a gene zzso event in zzso These findings show the importance of understanding evolutionary relationships in the interpretation and zzso of knowledge from studies of model zzso systems to human cellular zzso In addition, given the important role of Aurora zzso in cancer, evolutionary analysis and comparisons of zzso zzso suggest a rationale for designing dual action zzso drugs that inhibit both zzso and zzso zzso
