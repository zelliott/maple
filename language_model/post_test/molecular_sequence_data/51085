The zzso binding site of the zzso protein zzso from brown zzso tissue was mapped by zzso labeling with zzso zzso zzso and by affinity labeling with zzso zzso zzso Both zzso bind with high affinity and specificity to the zzso in intact zzso as well as to the isolated zzso zzso zzso binding at 4 degrees C in the dark is competitively blocked by zzso Like the natural zzso zzso and zzso both zzso are capable of zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso as measured in zzso with zzso zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso in zzso in the presence of zzso while zzso was inserted into isolated zzso by prolonged incubation at room temperature under pH zzso Both reactions can be blocked by zzso The incorporation of zzso could be localized between zzso 258 and 283 by zzso with zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso radioactive zzso indicated that the zzso was linked to zzso The incorporation of zzso could be assigned by zzso with zzso and alternatively with zzso at a locus of zzso attachment between zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of published data that no zzso zzso in zzso binding of the zzso the probable zzso reacting with zzso is zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
