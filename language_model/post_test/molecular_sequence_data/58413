A sequence strategy which combines a low zzso shotgun approach and directed sequencing has been zzso Essentially, the zzso as well as the size of the fragments zzso for a low coverage shotgun approach, were exploited for the construction of a physical map of the region to be zzso The latter considerably simplified the subsequent directed sequencing zzso We report the physical mapping of a 115 zzso segment which covers nearly 100 zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso and contains previously zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso and analysis of a zzso zzso segment, which includes the zzso zzso revealed 21 zzso apparently belonging to at least seven zzso zzso This segment has a G + C content greater than zzso compared to zzso characteristic of the zzso regions, and mainly consists of genes whose products seem to be involved in the synthesis of an zzso These observations leave open the possibility that the zzso zzso has been acquired through horizontal zzso
