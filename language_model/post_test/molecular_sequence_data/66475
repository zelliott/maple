One of the mechanisms plants have developed for zzso protection against zzso damage involves a zzso zzso which has been proposed to be reduced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso We show that rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso domain, uses zzso to reduce the zzso zzso zzso zzso which then reduces hydrogen zzso The presence of both zzso and zzso zzso in a single zzso is absolutely required for the high zzso efficiency of zzso An zzso zzso knockout zzso for zzso shows irregular zzso cell shape, abnormal zzso structure, and unbalanced zzso zzso state, resulting in impaired photosynthesis rate under low zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso transgenic lines rescued this zzso Moreover, prolonged darkness followed by zzso incubation produced an increase in hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso in leaves and accelerated zzso of zzso zzso We propose that zzso constitutes an alternative system for zzso protection against zzso damage, using zzso as the source of reducing zzso Since no zzso reduced zzso is produced at night, the zzso zzso may be a key zzso system during darkness, with zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the source of reducing zzso
