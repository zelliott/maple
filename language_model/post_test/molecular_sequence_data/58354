The zzso zzso arm of the coat protein of zzso zzso zzso virus has been studied with five molecular dynamics simulations of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso it contains six zzso and three zzso zzso An zzso fraction of the sequence is stabilized in zzso by zzso The interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was zzso and it was found that only two zzso zzso are bound to zzso on average, but zzso interactions between zzso and zzso which provide zzso screening for zzso zzso are zzso zzso by the zzso zzso of repulsive zzso interactions between zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso A hydrogen bond at the zzso end of the zzso renders extension of the zzso in the zzso direction impossible, in agreement with evidence from nuclear magnetic resonance zzso
