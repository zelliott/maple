zzso of zzso zzso occurs in specific peptides and proteins derived from plants and animals, but the functional role of this modification has been characterized primarily in zzso Marine cone snails produce zzso peptides that have undergone a plethora of zzso zzso including zzso zzso Although zzso snails extensively zzso zzso zzso the consequences of this modification remain largely zzso In this work, we investigated the function of zzso zzso in zzso from three distinct gene families: zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with either Pro or zzso and their in zzso zzso folding and biological activity were zzso For zzso which naturally contains three zzso zzso the modifications improved the ability to block zzso sodium channels but did not affect zzso In contrast, the presence of zzso in zzso had a significant impact on the zzso folding but not on the biological zzso The folding yields for the zzso analogue were approximately zzso higher than for zzso under a variety of zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso Pro zzso improved their folding but impaired their activities against target zzso Since zzso and protein zzso zzso coexist as a zzso in the zzso we discuss the effects of zzso on the folding of zzso in the context of zzso zzso of Pro and zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso is important for both in zzso zzso folding and the zzso of zzso
