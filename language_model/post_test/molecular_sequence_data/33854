A hybrid zone along an environmental zzso should contain a zzso pattern of genetic and zzso zzso This occurs because divergent selection in the two parental zzso is typically strong enough to overcome the zzso effects of gene flow across the environmental zzso We studied zzso between two zzso tree squirrels zzso zzso across a forest zzso over which the two species vary in zzso zzso zzso and body zzso We sampled zzso individuals at 29 locations across a zzso zzso to seek genetic evidence for zzso upon confirming zzso we examined levels of genetic zzso in relation to maintenance of zzso divergence despite potentially zzso gene zzso zzso population assignment analyses to zzso data, we found that zzso and zzso form two distinct genetic clusters but also zzso mostly within transitional forest zzso Overall, based on this nuclear analysis, zzso of the specimens were characterized as zzso zzso as hybrids and zzso as zzso zzso appeared to be reproductively viable, as evidenced by the presence of zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso in ecologically important zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sharper than the zzso of zzso neutral zzso which suggests that divergent selection may maintain zzso zzso The relatively recent divergence of these two species (probably late zzso apparent lack of zzso zzso mechanisms and geographic coincidence of zzso zzso for both genetic and zzso variation suggest that environmental factors play a large role in maintaining the distinctiveness of these two species across the hybrid zzso
