zzso has been a major component of the cellular zzso of species throughout zzso evolution, from zzso to zzso zzso analysis of the embryonic turtle zzso using zzso to zzso zzso showed that the protein is expressed throughout zzso and is present at high zzso in all parts of the zzso zzso zzso sequence for the isolated turtle protein and deduced sequences for several zzso peptides all revealed a close similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso for putative duck zzso was obtained and zzso confirming the close relationship with zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the duck zzso contains a single zzso zzso while Northern zzso analysis showed that the message for zzso is present in embryonic duck lens at 25 times the abundance found in zzso zzso possesses zzso activity, but the activity is greatly reduced, probably because of age-related zzso zzso It thus appears that a highly zzso important zzso zzso has been used as a structural component of lens since the start of zzso zzso Apparently the zzso has not been recruited for its zzso activity but for some distinct structural zzso zzso is an example of a zzso protein playing two very different roles in evolution but zzso by a single zzso
