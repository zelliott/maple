The zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso the reduction of zzso zzso by zzso via a zzso reaction zzso zzso of the reduced zzso in complex with zzso and of the oxidized zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2005) zzso 44, zzso have revealed zzso as a zzso mobile active site zzso In the zzso complex, the zzso adopts an unusual hairpin zzso and is wedged between the zzso ring of the zzso and the side chain of zzso In the folate complex, zzso swings out from its position in the zzso complex to stack against the zzso ring of the zzso Although zzso contacts each zzso in zzso coli zzso this zzso is not zzso for example, a zzso occurs at this site in the human zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso binding and zzso we have constructed zzso zzso and zzso As predicted, our results indicate that zzso zzso in the binding of both zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding each zzso yet slows zzso of both zzso less than zzso zzso for zzso is unaffected by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso faster than the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in complex with zzso have been determined at zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso The structures show that the folate is bound in a zzso competent zzso and zzso zzso a zzso change similar to that observed for zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may be a suitable replacement for zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso
