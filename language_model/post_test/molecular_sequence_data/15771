The complete zzso sequence of the infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso zzso gene has been determined using zzso clones of zzso and zzso zzso zzso clones were generated by using random DNA zzso to prime zzso synthesis and were mapped to their respective locations on the zzso by the use of zzso zzso derived from viral zzso zzso features of the zzso zzso gene sequence zzso by the sequencing of these clones include short zzso with N genes of other zzso at the zzso and 3' zzso zzso of the zzso as well as an exceptionally long zzso zzso region of the zzso suggesting a leader zzso may be coupled to the N zzso A comparison of the zzso N protein coding sequence with other zzso N genes shows some zzso at the zzso acid level which indicates the possible evolutionary relationship of these N zzso The determination of the zzso sequences of zzso genes and zzso regions will be useful for studying the mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso
