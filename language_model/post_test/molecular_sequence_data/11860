The production of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso within vascular smooth muscle zzso cells following exposure to zzso zzso is a major cause of the zzso and zzso of septic zzso We have defined the zzso element of the zzso zzso promoter, zzso into a zzso cell line, and the role of the zzso zzso family of proteins in zzso gene zzso in these zzso The combination of zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso stimulates promoter activity by a factor of zzso single zzso show little activity, while pairs of zzso produce an intermediate zzso Using a series of promoter deletion zzso we have defined the zzso element from position zzso to zzso this region contains an zzso zzso site as well as a number of zzso response zzso Nuclear proteins from zzso zzso cells which bind to an zzso containing this zzso B site are composed of zzso together with an unidentified protein of 50 zzso which is not a known zzso family zzso A promoter zzso with a zzso pair change within this zzso B site, which zzso zzso B zzso has an activity of only approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, protein binding to this site is abolished by a specific inhibitor of zzso B zzso which also abrogates zzso zzso zzso zzso in such zzso promoters is attributable to the presence of an independently functioning downstream zzso B site zzso to zzso The mechanism by which zzso B activates the zzso promoter in zzso cells in response to zzso appears to be markedly different to that operative in zzso in response to zzso
