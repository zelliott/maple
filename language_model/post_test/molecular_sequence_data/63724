In the last 25 years we have witnessed the triumph of the zzso There are now well over 200 complete zzso zzso The application of modern solid state technologies to zzso sequencing promises affordable personalized sequences for the individual in the very near zzso With this explosion in DNA sequence data, the focus in the immediate past has been on the primary DNA zzso the zzso interactions that zzso controlled transcription, cataloging the zzso and applying zzso systems analysis to those data sets in an attempt to assign molecular signatures to normal and abnormal zzso zzso However, it is becoming clear that the zzso zzso which operate at the levels of zzso stability and selection for zzso zzso as well as the zzso processes of protein stability, trafficking, and secondary zzso such as zzso all play key roles in the zzso of the zzso apparatus and its overall zzso Defining the interplay of these zzso in concert with the signaling pathways that allow transcription, translation, and zzso processes to be quickly modified in response to events outside of the zzso are leading to an understanding of the spatial and zzso requirements for each of these processes in controlling cardiac zzso In order to confirm the importance of zzso modification in controlling cardiac zzso in zzso we examined the role that zzso modification of an important component of the cardiac zzso apparatus, zzso binding protein C zzso plays in the normal and diseased heart by creating transgenic mice in which the effects of chronic cardiac zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso
