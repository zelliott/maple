The zzso zzso gene encodes the zzso steroid 16 zzso in mouse liver and shares a zzso regulatory element zzso with another zzso zzso zzso As shown with the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso Moore, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso the zzso zzso also occurs at zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso factor which specifically binds to the zzso element has been zzso The zzso sequences reveal that the factor consists of zzso alpha and zzso beta 1 with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso I zzso and gel shift zzso indicate that the zzso expressed zzso zzso fusion proteins bind to the regulatory element only when zzso is zzso Moreover, zzso zzso promoter is zzso by zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso Given the additional results that zzso of the zzso steroid 15 zzso zzso zzso promoter is zzso zzso in the zzso the zzso expressions of the zzso genes correlate very well with DNA zzso We also conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso factor and is a potential zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
