Three protein binding sites have been identified in the upstream region of the zzso zzso Two of them, zzso and SC sites, have been known as putative zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso of these binding sites, it was found that silk zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso site, and silk zzso zzso zzso binds to the SC site but not to a zzso SC site, zzso zzso distribution of the two factors was zzso zzso is present abundantly in the middle silk zzso zzso where the zzso gene is transcribed specifically but is also present in other cell types, though in a much less zzso zzso is observed very abundantly in the two parts of silk zzso zzso and zzso silk zzso zzso but not in other zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or SC sites at zzso of the zzso gene promoter were tested in zzso nuclear zzso The SC zzso strongly activated transcription, while the zzso zzso zzso did zzso The zzso zzso also gave a slight stimulation of zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulates zzso through an interaction with the SC site, and zzso does so zzso through the zzso zzso
