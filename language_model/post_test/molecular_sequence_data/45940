An zzso acid zzso was isolated from the zzso of the common zzso zzso zzso zzso by a three-step procedure combining gel zzso zzso exchange and zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso bound zzso with a zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence and the internal zzso sequences show close structural zzso with other snake zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the most specific zzso is zzso The best zzso among the studied 20 zzso acids were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso The zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso The effect was neutralized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in cultured zzso and zzso cells as shown by DNA fragmentation gel zzso The induction of zzso was inhibited by zzso
