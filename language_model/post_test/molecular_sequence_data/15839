The zzso for the 80 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the 140 zzso DNA zzso zzso contain several zzso spliced to the main open reading frames zzso located in the early zzso unit zzso These proteins were zzso expressed in monkey kidney cells zzso utilizing the first zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso of a zzso inserted at the beginning of the zzso zzso and zzso Only zzso and zzso were functionally active in an in zzso replication initiation zzso Both zzso and zzso were transported to the zzso The sequence zzso which is present in both zzso is identified as their nuclear zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso zzso whereas zzso was distributed in both zzso suggesting that the nuclear zzso signal for zzso is within the first 139 zzso zzso Interestingly, when zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso cells, the nuclear distribution of zzso or zzso was significantly zzso We demonstrate that the nuclear transport of zzso is zzso irrespective of the presence of its nuclear zzso zzso by interaction with zzso
