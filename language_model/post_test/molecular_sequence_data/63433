The variable regions of zzso zzso the zzso zzso allergic responses, are poorly defined to zzso In this study we define the character of human zzso binding sites recognizing zzso p 2, a major zzso from zzso grass zzso zzso raised zzso developed by zzso display technology tended to have common sequence motifs zzso such as zzso zzso gene origin and heavy chain zzso region zzso 3 length and zzso They also combined with highly related light chain zzso Such heavy chain variable zzso transcripts have also been found in the zzso zzso of yet other grass zzso allergic zzso zzso these data argue that a common zzso is used to establish specific zzso with a potential to mediate allergic responses to zzso p zzso Such a restriction may contribute to the limited molecular diversity observed in some zzso zzso
