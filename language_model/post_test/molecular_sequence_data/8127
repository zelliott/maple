Eleven different zzso and one nonsense zzso zzso zzso which have been frequently detected in human zzso zzso were constructed and examined for their ability to cooperate with activated human zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso zzso zzso with either of the two activated zzso genes transformed zzso with a different frequency of transformation depending on the different kind of zzso whereas zzso zzso (with zzso nonsense zzso zzso (with zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not transform zzso Six transformed zzso cell lines were established from zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of them exhibiting zzso human zzso DNA, zzso zzso and zzso DNA and zzso All six transformed cell lines showed both zzso and lung zzso potential in nude zzso They also exhibited 92 zzso zzso activity, which was not detected in parental zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso gene have a role in zzso transformation as well as zzso zzso
