To evaluate alternative human zzso zzso zzso typing methods, we used a system of zzso amplification zzso with a probe zzso protection zzso zzso in a zzso plate format developed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Japan) to perform zzso zzso typing for 502 individual zzso Two hundred zzso samples submitted to our Clinical zzso Laboratory were zzso tested zzso with a locally developed zzso zzso zzso chain zzso zzso probe zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, 250 retrospective samples of zzso frozen cells or DNA from clinical and research panels, previously typed by zzso zzso zzso were chosen to include 66 distinct zzso zzso representing zzso American Black, Asian, and Native American ethnic zzso Among the zzso typed samples, except for four samples with a zzso zzso handling problem, a single zzso zzso assignment zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso Among the 250 retrospective samples, a single zzso probe for zzso 57 zzso acid consistently zzso with the zzso 57 zzso sequence of zzso However, zzso identified six samples with previous zzso typing zzso all of which involved identification of sequences at zzso zzso in samples zzso for two zzso zzso zzso zzso turnaround time from sample preparation to results was 11 h for 24 samples or zzso h for zzso zzso In zzso we found the zzso zzso typing system to provide zzso reliable, and accurate zzso typing zzso The current zzso methodology could be improved by use of a molded plastic cold block to provide more consistent and secure zzso plate cooling than the current zzso zzso Nevertheless, this methodology, based on a zzso plate format but without the usual plate washing steps of the traditional zzso has superior potential for zzso handling and zzso distribution with a zzso system and a work surface incorporating zzso heating and cooling zzso
