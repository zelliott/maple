The zzso of the beta zzso zzso exchange zzso allowed for the association of zzso with human zzso Upon association with zzso human zzso zzso structural zzso in zzso that appear dependent upon zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso In this regard, zzso zzso exchange is used as a tool to induce structural zzso in class I as a means of zzso the zzso relationship of zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the experimental approach provided strong evidence that zzso makes indirect contact with discrete class I specific zzso acid positions located in the zzso region of the alpha 1 zzso
