Design of efficient treatment strategies for diseases requires clarification of the nature of each zzso causing the zzso In this study, we have investigated three factors to correctly predict the correlation between zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso gene responsible for one of zzso storage diseases, known as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso evolutionary conservation of zzso acid zzso among family zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid changes in zzso and zzso structural conservation of zzso acid zzso The results showed that zzso the likelihood of a zzso zzso causing zzso zzso was directly correlated with the level of evolutionary conservation and zzso correlated with zzso but not correlated with the structural zzso zzso the zzso zzso were 9 times more likely to be located on the zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso the likelihood of zzso zzso acid changes in zzso zzso was zzso times higher than those in the zzso zzso the degree of evolutionary conservation was nearly as zzso in zzso as that of zzso of zzso acid changes, and zzso the combination of the two factors, evolutionary conservation and zzso provides a better association between zzso zzso and clinical severity with higher sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso than that obtained by either factor zzso These findings suggest that the combination of evolutionary conservation and zzso is a useful tool to predict the effect of each zzso on the clinical zzso and can be applied to the analysis of zzso relation in other genetic zzso
