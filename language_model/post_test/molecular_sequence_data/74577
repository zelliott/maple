In the present study, we cloned the promoter sequence of the chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and observed the induction of germ zzso gene expression regulated by zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso promoter sequence involved putative binding sites of zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a putative zzso zzso The reporter zzso which expressed humanized zzso green fluorescent protein zzso under the control of one of three lengths zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso promoter, were zzso to the dispersed zzso cells of zzso incubated zzso in zzso Every length of zzso germ zzso zzso expression was verified by zzso for germ zzso zzso and the intensity of zzso was significantly higher in the zzso zzso cells using zzso and zzso zzso promoter compared with zzso zzso These results suggested that the germ zzso and enhanced gene expression required at least a zzso sequence of the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the reporter zzso with zzso zzso promoter, which was performed by injecting zzso complex into the blood vessels of zzso incubated zzso also induced germ zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter could provide the basis for a methodology for the zzso zzso and zzso modification of germ cells, and might further contribute to our understanding of the development, zzso migration and differentiation of germ cells in the zzso
