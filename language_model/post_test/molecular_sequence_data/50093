We report a zzso zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso not caused by a zzso repeat expansion that is, to our knowledge, the first such zzso The zzso zzso currently comprise a group of zzso or zzso genetically distinct neurodegenerative conditions, all characterized by progressive zzso of gait and limbs and by speech and zzso zzso Six of the nine zzso for which the genes are known result from zzso expansions that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expansions are responsible for three other zzso zzso zzso of families with zzso do not have linkage to the known zzso We recently mapped the locus for an zzso zzso in a family zzso to zzso zzso A particularly compelling candidate zzso zzso encodes protein zzso C gamma zzso zzso a member of a family of zzso zzso The entire coding region of zzso was zzso in an affected member of family zzso and in a group of 39 unrelated patients with zzso not attributable to zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso zzso in highly zzso zzso in zzso the zzso region of the zzso were found in family zzso another familial case, and a sporadic zzso The zzso zzso with disease in both zzso zzso modeling predicts that two of these zzso acid zzso would severely abrogate the zzso or zzso zzso capabilities of the zzso zzso studies on zzso tissue from an affected member of family zzso demonstrated reduced zzso for both zzso gamma and zzso 1 in zzso cells, whereas zzso for zzso was zzso These results strongly support a new mechanism for zzso cell dysfunction and death in zzso zzso and suggest that there may be a common zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
