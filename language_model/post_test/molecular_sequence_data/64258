zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a family of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso and hence likely involved in zzso zzso A class of proteins zzso has been identified in plants and animals, containing the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso combined with the zzso regulatory domain of zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein was previously reported to function as a zzso growth factor zzso zzso We have performed an in zzso analysis on zzso proteins from zzso zzso and demonstrate that structural features of both CB and zzso zzso are well zzso The combination of both zzso may have evolved from a functional interaction between a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso illustrating the so-called zzso zzso evolutionary principle, and this hypothesis is supported by sequence zzso zzso proteins form a newly identified group of zzso likely to play a key role in zzso action in zzso It is suggested that these proteins may function as zzso electron zzso possibly regulated by zzso The role and action of catecholamines in plants is poorly zzso but it is clear that they are involved in many aspects of growth and zzso Whether the zzso proteins functionally interact with zzso as is the case for zzso zzso remains to be zzso
