The complexity of molecular diagnostic zzso is a significant barrier to employment in zzso zzso despite the growing need for such zzso We have developed a sensitive, accurate, zzso and simple DNA amplification scheme that shows potential for zzso medicine from zzso drug discovery through to zzso zzso Called the zzso zzso process zzso zzso zzso the method is zzso and employs a unique primer design and background suppression technology that can amplify target sequences from crude cell zzso The specificity of the zzso 2 zzso enables detection of zzso differences such as zzso zzso in tumors and single zzso zzso zzso zzso Because mismatch amplification can be completely suppressed in zzso 2, a reliable diagnostic result can be achieved based exclusively on amplification zzso Furthermore, zzso detection and zzso zzso can be obtained in as little as zzso zzso from sample preparation of raw blood or tissue zzso
