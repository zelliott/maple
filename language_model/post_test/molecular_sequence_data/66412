To zzso whether a dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso species in an environmental sample zzso zzso possesses an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although it may not be zzso 

A modified zzso accessory gene regulator zzso zzso protocol was performed on extracted DNA from a landfill zzso sample (also characterized by zzso zzso gene zzso and the zzso products were zzso zzso and zzso zzso It appeared that two zzso gene zzso existed, most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso differing by only 1 zzso 

It is possible to specifically identify and characterize the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria derived from environmental zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first successful attempt at identifying zzso zzso genes from a zzso environment zzso The zzso gene was identified as being most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the same zzso identified as being dominant, according to zzso zzso gene cloning and subsequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso
