zzso studies in the highly zzso region I domain of the human DNA zzso alpha zzso demonstrated a change in metal zzso zzso Here, we extend the investigation to include the zzso of DNA synthesis by these zzso studying zzso zzso extension, and the zzso analog zzso The zzso of region I zzso and wild type human DNA zzso alpha zzso were analyzed with either zzso or zzso as the metal zzso Despite the known zzso effect of zzso in causing zzso to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso we have found that two region I zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso in zzso more effectively than zzso actually have a zzso and zzso higher zzso zzso respectively, in zzso reactions than that of the wild type zzso The enhanced zzso zzso of these two zzso in zzso reactions is due to zzso discrimination of the incorrect zzso where the zzso and zzso had a zzso and zzso higher zzso for zzso of incorrect than correct zzso zzso In zzso zzso all of the region I zzso exhibited similar zzso efficiencies as the wild type zzso Study of zzso extension showed that in zzso zzso the wild type zzso alpha zzso readily extended zzso zzso In contrast, the two region I zzso zzso and zzso were unable to extend the zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that the side chains of region I zzso acids play an essential role in the zzso zzso during DNA synthesis by human DNA zzso zzso The effects of the metal zzso on the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the region I zzso were also zzso
