zzso zzso sequences related to those of the family zzso were amplified from trees affected with the following zzso cherry twisted zzso apricot ring zzso cherry zzso rusty zzso cherry rusty zzso and cherry green ring zzso zzso analysis of virus sequences obtained from these diseased trees from western North America, along with published sequences of Cherry green ring zzso virus zzso and Cherry zzso rusty zzso virus zzso revealed four major zzso zzso into these four populations correlated with distinct symptom expression on woody zzso suggesting that each zzso represents a distinct virus species within the family zzso The viruses occupying each zzso were designated zzso I: Cherry twisted leaf associated virus, zzso II: zzso zzso zzso Cherry rusty zzso associated virus, and zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso events were predicted to occur within and between these zzso the latter being strongly supported by zzso zzso zzso of frequency distribution data derived from zzso sequence comparisons of coat protein coding sequences resulted in a proposal for alternative guidelines for species zzso for this family of zzso
