zzso of human zzso zzso on zzso is dependent on repeated transient increases in the concentration of zzso free calcium zzso A specific zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso of zzso The zzso inhibited zzso migration on zzso by interfering with the release of the cells from sites of zzso A similar reduction in zzso on zzso occurred when cells were treated with the zzso zzso which also zzso zzso when bound to its binding zzso zzso These results indicate that a rise in zzso reduces zzso zzso to zzso by a mechanism that requires zzso zzso
