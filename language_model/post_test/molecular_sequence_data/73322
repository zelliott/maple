zzso involving regions of zzso 10 occur in the vast majority zzso zzso of human zzso zzso A region at zzso zzso was implicated to contain a zzso zzso gene and the identification of zzso deletions in four zzso cell lines further refined the zzso We have identified a zzso designated zzso that spans these deletions and encodes a widely expressed zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein contains sequence motifs with significant zzso to the zzso domain of protein zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in a number of zzso zzso kidney and breast zzso cell lines or zzso zzso Our results identify a strong candidate zzso zzso gene at zzso zzso whose loss of function appears to be associated with the zzso of multiple human zzso
