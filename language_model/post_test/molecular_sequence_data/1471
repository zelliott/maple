The genetic structure within and between USA and European populations of the emerging zzso zzso zzso was zzso Four primer combinations were used for amplified zzso length zzso zzso zzso of 67 USA zzso from California and Oregon, and 18 European zzso from Belgium, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and the zzso In addition, three DNA regions zzso zzso II, and zzso 5) of additional zzso species were amplified by zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso to provide better zzso understanding of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns indicate that the 85 zzso form two distinct lineages within a zzso group, distinct from the closely related zzso species zzso zzso With the exception of two zzso from an Oregon zzso European and USA zzso clustered separately within individual zzso The zzso profiles also indicate that a single zzso lineage dominates the North American population, while the European population consists of an array of mainly unique, closely related zzso zzso zzso from the three DNA regions were identical among all zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
