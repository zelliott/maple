We have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in zzso excluding the zzso tail, and has zzso and 3' zzso regions of 174 zzso and 186 zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 453 zzso zzso including the first zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is zzso and zzso similar to the rat and human zzso zzso respectively, zzso identical to the rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2' zzso Surprisingly, in contrast to the rat gene that is expressed in both cell cultures and the intact liver, the zzso zzso gene is zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso in cell cultures but not in liver of the intact adult or newborn zzso Southern zzso analysis of mouse DNA zzso with the full-length zzso reveals that the zzso gene is likely to span less than a total of 15 zzso and was mapped to zzso zzso 11 between the zzso and zzso zzso by analysis of two zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are zzso elevated in the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso line zzso lacking zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso activity and in the zzso zzso mouse cell line having a zzso deletion of about zzso zzso on zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso gene in zzso cell cultures is regulated by three distinct zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso or zzso zzso zzso repression, and zzso zzso putative zzso
