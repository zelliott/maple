We previously have shown the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso Although zzso is known to facilitate tumor cell zzso the mechanism that zzso its zzso expression has remained zzso zzso the downstream target of zzso often has been reported to be zzso and subsequently silenced in certain zzso however, its zzso zzso has not yet been zzso In this study, we investigated the DNA zzso status of the zzso promoter region using 8 lung cancer cell lines and 32 specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that although both normal lung tissue and zzso in zzso bore a completely zzso zzso promoter, the promoter region in almost all invasive zzso was at least partially zzso The expression of zzso and its level of zzso were correlated zzso Furthermore, statistical analysis revealed that the level of zzso became reduced with progression of the zzso stage, although no clear relationship between zzso level and zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso occurs in both normal lung zzso and zzso in zzso and that zzso of the zzso promoter zzso in the zzso expression of zzso in invasive zzso cells, independently of zzso zzso This novel finding might be zzso for clarifying the mechanism that zzso the progression of early lung zzso
