The zzso cycle is a new zzso zzso fixation zzso in zzso zzso and some zzso The initial step is zzso A zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso followed by zzso reduction of zzso to zzso This reduction step was studied in zzso zzso A new zzso was zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso reduction zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso and zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and alcohol zzso had a native molecular mass of 300 zzso and consisted of a single large zzso of 145 zzso suggesting an zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was determined, and the incomplete gene was identified in the zzso zzso Obviously, the zzso consists of an zzso zzso alcohol zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso No indication of the presence of a prosthetic group was zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso The zzso was highly specific for its zzso with apparent zzso values of 30 zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso and a turnover number of 25 zzso zzso The specific activity in zzso grown cells was zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso grown cells, indicating zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso is not required in any other known zzso and therefore can be taken as a characteristic zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso may be useful for production of zzso and for a coupled zzso zzso for activity screening of zzso zzso a target zzso of potent zzso
