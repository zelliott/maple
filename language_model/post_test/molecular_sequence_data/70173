The zzso refinement of zzso has been performed at zzso A zzso The crystal and molecular structure of zzso is described in detail in this zzso On zzso the zzso of the zzso acid sequences of eight kinds of zzso zzso proteins and combining with the crystal and molecular structure of zzso zzso most conservative zzso acid zzso are zzso It is found that four most conservative polar zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gather on the molecular surface on the boundary of the large and small zzso thus forming the active center of the protein zzso
