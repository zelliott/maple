We present here the first report of a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso The zzso produce 1, zzso from starch and related zzso and zzso The zzso were isolated from the red zzso zzso zzso from the Pacific coasts of China and USA, and the Atlantic Coast of zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the Chinese subspecies, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the USA subspecies and one zzso zzso from the Venezuelan subspecies were identified and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and partially zzso Based on the zzso acid sequences zzso three zzso genes or their zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned and completely zzso and two other genes zzso and zzso were partially zzso The coding sequences of the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced molecular masses of the mature zzso from the coding sequences are zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, close to those determined by mass zzso using zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence identity is more than zzso among the six zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the expression product was identical to the zzso zzso
