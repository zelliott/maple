In addition to zzso proteins and zzso which are involved in entry into zzso cells and zzso spread, respectively, zzso zzso a 110 zzso zzso designated zzso We report the zzso zzso and zzso sequence determination of the zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and construction and characterization of a zzso zzso The zzso gene is carried by the zzso zzso and codes for a 150 zzso zzso Upon zzso which does not involve accessory proteins zzso by the zzso zzso the precursor is converted to a mature protein of 110 zzso by two zzso removing an zzso signal sequence and a zzso zzso zzso similarities were detected between the sequence of the first 500 zzso of mature zzso and the zzso region of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of an avian zzso zzso coli, and the zzso protein involved in zzso and penetration of zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso which is not present in the zzso zzso exhibits sequence similarity with zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso protein of zzso zzso Construction and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso indicated that zzso is required neither for entry into cultured zzso cells nor for zzso zzso However, in the rabbit zzso zzso loop model, the zzso zzso exhibited an attenuated zzso which suggests that zzso might play a role in tissue zzso
