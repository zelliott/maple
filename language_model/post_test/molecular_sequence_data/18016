We have recently described the properties of a wheat zzso extract that is able to process, accurately and zzso artificial transcripts containing wheat zzso zzso zzso with the production of mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gray, zzso zzso zzso in zzso Such processing involves zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we show that this system also acts on transcripts containing sequences corresponding to an unusual class of short repeats zzso in wheat zzso These repeats are theoretically capable of assuming a zzso secondary structure, although stable transcripts corresponding to them are not zzso in zzso We find that zzso sequences are processed with the same specificity and with comparable efficiency as are authentic zzso zzso Because known zzso are located close to and in the same zzso orientation as active genes zzso zzso zzso in wheat zzso our results raise the question of whether zzso play a role in gene expression in wheat zzso
