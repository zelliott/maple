To identify candidate zzso zzso for the treatment of human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection and to investigate zzso zzso the zzso activities of nine species of zzso zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso C, zzso D, zzso J, zzso zzso zzso K, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated against zzso zzso cells were exposed to various zzso of each zzso and were then infected with zzso zzso effect was determined by cell viability using a zzso dye zzso zzso against zzso zzso virus zzso was assessed on zzso and zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration against zzso was 37 zzso 14 zzso for zzso A, and ranged from 15 zzso 3 zzso for zzso zzso to zzso 90,000 zzso for zzso zzso In general, relative activity against zzso was similar to relative activity against zzso on zzso zzso zzso D was notable for its decreased activity on human zzso The observations suggest that it may be possible to produce zzso with more favorable therapeutic zzso than currently available zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of zzso is not determined solely by their linear zzso acid zzso
