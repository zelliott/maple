The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a constituent of cell surface zzso that has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate whether zzso is present on human zzso and whether it plays a role in human zzso zzso 

Fluorescent flow zzso was used to zzso the binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The location of the binding site of these zzso was assessed by zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso interaction were tested utilizing both zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso and zzso zzso zzso egg binding and zzso zzso 

The mean percentage of zzso zzso which bound zzso or zzso zzso was low zzso and zzso zzso Exposure to calcium zzso zzso zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso Both zzso and zzso binding sites were localized by zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso In four experiments, the percent of zzso zzso eggs penetrated by human zzso were medium control zzso zzso irrelevant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One hundred percent zzso of human zzso were penetrated by human zzso exposed to medium control, zzso zzso following exposure to irrelevant zzso zzso zzso following exposure to zzso and 50% zzso following exposure to zzso The mean zzso zzso of tightly bound zzso to zzso eggs were medium control 57 zzso zzso irrelevant zzso 64 zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso zzso and zzso 19 zzso zzso The corresponding values for human zzso were: medium control 118 zzso zzso irrelevant zzso 61 zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso and zzso 99 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is expressed on human zzso that have undergone zzso zzso zzso to zzso was shown to inhibit significantly zzso binding and penetration of zzso zzso eggs and penetration of human zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso interaction may be zzso in part by the zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso bind zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso The binding sites were located on the zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired both the binding and penetration of zzso zzso eggs and the penetration of human zzso by human zzso
