The mechanism for efficient zzso zzso zzso into zzso particles which form by budding through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was investigated by using Murray Valley encephalitis virus as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is driven by the viral zzso proteins zzso and E independently of NC zzso We show that control of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso function of the viral zzso is critical for efficient virus zzso In zzso virus, zzso zzso of zzso remains inefficient until zzso of zzso at the zzso side of the signal sequence separating the two proteins has zzso This obligatory sequence of zzso was zzso in a zzso virus with the consequence of greatly reduced incorporation of NC into budding zzso and zzso release of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso virus resulted in partial zzso of zzso of zzso by the viral zzso zzso Our results support a model for zzso zzso involving zzso and spatial coordination of NC assembly and zzso by regulated zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso
