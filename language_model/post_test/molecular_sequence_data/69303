zzso factor zzso inhibitor is a zzso zzso zzso zzso It directly zzso factor zzso and, in a factor zzso fashion, produces feedback zzso of the factor zzso factor zzso complex which is responsible for the initiation of zzso Human zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli was used to define the kinetic zzso describing the human factor zzso zzso The zzso of factor zzso by zzso zzso is indistinguishable from that of zzso produced in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso modifications such as zzso and zzso do not play a major role in the zzso zzso The slow, zzso zzso of factor zzso follows the zzso zzso see zzso Where the zzso zzso and inhibitor zzso form an initial, immediate collision complex zzso that then zzso slowly to a tightened final zzso zzso In the absence of other additions, the initial Ki zzso and final zzso for the zzso of factor zzso by zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the presence of calcium zzso (5 zzso the interaction between factor zzso and zzso is substantially weaker, with a Ki of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The addition of other components of the zzso complex produces enhanced factor zzso zzso predominantly through an effect on the initial zzso In the presence of calcium zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and factor zzso the Ki and zzso for factor zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso The enhancing effect of zzso on the zzso process is concentration dependent and exhibits an zzso reminiscent of the zzso model for zzso acceleration of zzso and factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso At optimal zzso the major mechanism of zzso action is also a reduction in the Ki of the initial encounter complex between factor zzso and zzso
