Six strains of zzso zzso examined by electron zzso were found to carry zzso The zzso of these strains were extracted and the zzso sequences of the zzso proteins were zzso Four of the strains carried the zzso sequence zzso exhibiting up to zzso identity to numerous zzso Using zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence and the zzso zzso sequence of several zzso the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso from two virulent zzso The two gene sequences exhibited zzso zzso zzso The gene consists of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 290 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of 31 zzso while the extracted zzso has an apparent molecular mass of 39 zzso on zzso The zzso protein displays a high degree of identity in the zzso and zzso zzso acids whereas the central region is zzso A second zzso is present downstream of zzso displaying zzso to zzso The zzso gene was expressed in fusion with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso do not play a role in zzso since the zzso raised against the zzso protein did not inhibit adherence to cultured zzso zzso analysis of amplified zzso gene products and Southern analysis revealed zzso zzso this could be useful for zzso and zzso studies of this zzso
