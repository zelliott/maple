We cloned a zzso full-length zzso based on a reported human zzso clone containing a partial open reading frame zzso coding for a novel zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso codes for the zzso of type zzso zzso Assembly of the zzso data reveals a complete sequence of the human gene zzso zzso is localized to zzso zzso spanning 337 zzso in zzso The gene contains 31 zzso in which the zzso zzso 1 and zzso are alternatively zzso The zzso organization of zzso resembles that of the reported zzso collagen zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that these genes may have derived from the same zzso zzso gene by zzso The expression of zzso in human zzso is zzso zzso with a higher level at fetal zzso Type zzso collagen is an zzso zzso component of the blood vessel walls, zzso by zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso has a pronounced effect on the stimulation of zzso expression in cultured zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso collagen may contribute to the zzso zzso assembly of the vascular network during blood vessel zzso
