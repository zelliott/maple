A global alignment of zzso sequences was corrected by reference to protein zzso The selection of characters eligible for construction of zzso trees was zzso by searching for regions arising from the zzso matching of sequence segments unique to different zzso zzso The zzso zzso were identified by comparing all sections of the global alignment with a comprehensive inventory of significant zzso alignments obtained by zzso probing of the DNA and protein databases with representative zzso zzso In three discrete alignment blocks (one in domain II and two in domain zzso the alignment of the bacterial sequences with those of zzso was not retrieved by database probing with zzso zzso and no zzso zzso of the zzso sequence segments was detected by using partial zzso sequences as zzso in zzso zzso The two domain IV regions (one of which comprises the zzso site of zzso are almost certainly due to the zzso alignment of zzso segments that are unique to zzso and to zzso zzso trees have been constructed from the global alignment after zzso positions encompassing the zzso zzso aligned regions, as well as positions arising from zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso segments zzso the zzso consensus motif of the G domain zzso zzso zzso The results show inconsistencies between trees zzso by alternative methods and alternative zzso and zzso data sets with regard to zzso being a zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso methods do not allow discrimination (by zzso difference and difference in number of zzso zzso between the conflicting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No specific zzso insertions (or terminal zzso supporting a zzso zzso are zzso in the new zzso sequence zzso
