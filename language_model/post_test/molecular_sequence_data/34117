zzso are often the marker of choice for population genetic studies at intermediate spatial and zzso zzso zzso large numbers of markers has traditionally been technically difficult, and this has limited our ability to investigate evolutionary phenomena that emerge across short zzso zzso Moreover, few markers tend to successfully amplify across species zzso As rapid zzso in zzso sequencing make zzso development zzso and zzso new avenues for zzso population genetic and zzso linkage mapping research are zzso We used a published zzso script and second-generation sequencing to rapidly and affordably develop zzso zzso for a widespread zzso bat, zzso zzso for which no markers were previously zzso We used Roche zzso zzso Genome zzso to randomly sequence zzso zzso zzso unique zzso of zzso DNA for zzso zzso within which we discovered zzso zzso zzso We designed zzso for zzso zzso that contained suitable zzso zzso We ordered zzso for 96 zzso 90 of which produced a single zzso product in zzso zzso We zzso 52 zzso and 45 were zzso in zzso zzso We tested zzso amplification for 96 zzso in six additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso amplification was successful for at least one species for 87 zzso zzso zzso and in all species, at least 66 zzso were zzso These markers will not only facilitate future work on these seven species, but also illustrate the utility of this zzso method for development of zzso across many species zzso
