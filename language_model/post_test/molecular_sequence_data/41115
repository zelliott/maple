zzso contribute to the evolution and zzso of most bacterial zzso but their role in zzso zzso is zzso Here we describe the isolation of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were recovered as free viral particles in the zzso stool zzso of patients suffering from zzso zzso infection zzso Furthermore, identical zzso were found in the zzso of zzso zzso isolated from the corresponding zzso zzso We therefore zzso for the first time, evidence of in zzso zzso induction during zzso We completely zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso analyses did not reveal the presence of zzso factors but zzso the unique character of zzso We also studied the mobility of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso were spontaneously zzso with 4 to 5 log zzso detected in the culture zzso of the corresponding zzso When zzso were grown in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso C, the zzso zzso further increased, reaching 8 to 9 log zzso in the case of zzso In zzso our study highlights the extensive genetic diversity and mobility of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, antibiotics known to represent risk factors for zzso such as zzso can stimulate zzso mobility in zzso and probably in zzso as well, which underscores their potential impact on zzso horizontal gene transfer events and the evolution of zzso zzso
