zzso zzso involved in the zzso of fatty acids and zzso exhibit extensive sequence similarity and share a common reaction zzso in which the zzso participating in the zzso reaction is generated by zzso of a zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso step does not take place readily unless an zzso zzso is positioned on the zzso zzso zzso in readiness for the ensuing zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso animal fatty acid zzso completely zzso the zzso reaction but increases the zzso rate of zzso zzso by more than 2 orders of zzso On the other hand, replacement with zzso Ala, zzso zzso and zzso compromises the zzso reaction without having any marked effect on the zzso zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso is significantly increased in the zzso zzso compared to that in the wild type and is similar to that exhibited by the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso These results, together with modeling studies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the crystal structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso II zzso suggest that the side chain zzso group of the zzso can mimic the zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso intermediate so that the zzso adopts a zzso analogous to that of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso requires the zzso form of the zzso fatty acid zzso and involves prior transfer of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso carrier protein domain and subsequent release of the zzso product by transfer back to a zzso zzso These results suggest that the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found in the loading zzso of some modular zzso zzso likely is to act as zzso or zzso zzso that provide a source of primer for the chain extension reactions zzso by associated zzso containing fully competent zzso zzso
