zzso zzso proteins play a role in linking activated cell surface receptors to the Ras signaling zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While the function of zzso in the zzso of the Ras zzso via binding to zzso has been well zzso it is becoming increasingly apparent that zzso zzso in additional signaling pathways through interactions with other zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we have identified a unique zzso binding protein designated PAL zzso expressed in zzso zzso with no similarity to other known zzso zzso binds specifically to the zzso zzso domain and unlike previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso the association of zzso and zzso is zzso Both zzso zzso and protein expression are restricted to zzso containing actively dividing cells and zzso cells in zzso zzso expression is induced upon growth factor stimulation and is zzso upon growth zzso This pattern, and timing of zzso expression and its association with the zzso zzso zzso suggests a role for this protein in signaling pathways governing cell cycle zzso
