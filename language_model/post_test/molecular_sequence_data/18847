In an ongoing survey for zzso potential of zzso from different zzso zones of India, a promising zzso zzso strain zzso was identified which produced an zzso zzso as zzso exhibiting in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was characterized as a zzso with repeating zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid with an average molecular mass of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complement component zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Furthermore, it inhibited the zzso proliferation of human peripheral blood zzso cells with zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the classical and alternative zzso zzso zzso was also inhibited with zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso and the binding of zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso does not neutralize the zzso zzso These results demonstrate the in zzso suppression of zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso and complement zzso zzso indicating its in zzso zzso zzso
