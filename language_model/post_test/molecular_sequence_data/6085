zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso was examined by determining their status in 15 human cell lines representing four zzso zzso zzso No abnormalities of zzso zzso and zzso were detected in cell lines containing DNA zzso virus proteins known to bind to the protein products of the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in all other cell lines from each of the four groups either zzso was zzso or zzso protein was zzso and there were cell lines containing zzso zzso in three of the zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso lines, including some of the zzso zzso lines and in some lines from each zzso Since none of these changes correlated with zzso group, other genetic changes must be required for zzso
