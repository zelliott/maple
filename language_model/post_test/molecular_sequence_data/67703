zzso zzso strain zzso is a zzso soil zzso capable of inducing tumors zzso zzso on many zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso based on the zzso zzso First, all the zzso zzso were zzso and 29 originally zzso zzso zzso were recognized to be zzso open reading frames zzso zzso evidence obtained from principal component analysis, clusters of zzso groups of proteins occupation, and average length distribution showed that these zzso zzso were highly unlikely to zzso zzso zzso from the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso experiments on three different growth stages of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that 23 zzso of the identified zzso zzso have no transcripts in these growth zzso In addition, using theoretical zzso 19 potential zzso genes were predicted to be new zzso zzso Fifteen zzso of these genes were verified with zzso zzso The zzso experimental results confirmed the reliability of our theoretical zzso indicating that zzso prediction and missing genes always exist in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The improved zzso will serve as a valuable resource for the research of the lifestyle, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso can be obtained from zzso
