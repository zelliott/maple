The zzso gene has been cloned in several species, but the location of the promoter and the exact start of zzso have not previously been zzso To characterize the low abundance human zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso we have employed the zzso chain zzso The zzso was found to have a zzso pair first zzso and its zzso start site was zzso The human zzso zzso zzso isolated thus far have all contained a short zzso untranslated region which would zzso to this start zzso However, all human zzso zzso zzso reported to date have a long zzso untranslated region, which extends more than zzso pairs zzso to this start site in the zzso suggesting the zzso of an alternative promoter in the zzso In addition, the human zzso gene zzso differential zzso in these zzso The first zzso is removed from the zzso but retained in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso has a very long first zzso while the zzso has a comparatively short first zzso followed by a long first zzso This characterization of the human zzso gene will now allow hormonal regulatory studies to be performed using gene transfer zzso
