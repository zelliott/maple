zzso protein of zzso zzso possesses two activities, a DNA zzso and a highly zzso zzso DNA zzso which are essential for bacterial zzso zzso of the functional zzso of the zzso is poorly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA with site and strand specificity in zzso but fails to initiate unwinding from this site zzso The zzso requires an extended region of adjacent zzso DNA to enter the duplex, yet interaction of zzso zzso with zzso DNA alone or as an integral part of the zzso zzso does not melt sufficient duplex to load the zzso This study aims to gain insights into the controlled initiation of both zzso zzso Linear zzso DNA zzso with a central region of sequence zzso were used to trap defined lengths of zzso zzso sequence in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso and zzso activities was zzso zzso zzso activity was measured on zzso containing 60 bases of open duplex but not on zzso containing zzso or zzso bases in open zzso The additional presence of auxiliary zzso proteins zzso and zzso coli integration host factor did not stimulate zzso activities on these zzso This model system offers a novel approach to investigate factors controlling zzso loading and the zzso of DNA unwinding from zzso
