The zzso gene of bovine zzso type 1 has been shown to zzso a zzso protein and to zzso the viral zzso We have localized the zzso domain of the zzso protein to the zzso 126 zzso acids of the zzso open reading zzso The zzso domain has been expressed in zzso coli and partially zzso zzso zzso and zzso I zzso on the bovine zzso type 1 zzso identify the sequence motif zzso (in which N zzso any zzso as the zzso binding zzso Using zzso methods we have shown that the zzso domain changes zzso of the zzso by inducing significant DNA zzso
