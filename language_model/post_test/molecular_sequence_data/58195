The mechanism by which the zzso fusion protein of zzso virus zzso is anchored in the envelope of zzso naked zzso zzso is not zzso In this investigation, we demonstrate that the zzso protein interacts with another virus protein with an apparent molecular mass of 21 zzso zzso analysis of the N zzso of the zzso protein revealed that this protein is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is processed from a zzso zzso by zzso at zzso acid position 16, at the consensus motif zzso previously identified as a zzso site for several zzso structural zzso The zzso protein contains two large internal zzso zzso characteristic of membrane zzso zzso analysis showed that within 1 h after zzso the zzso protein forms a stable complex with the zzso zzso zzso of the complex was not inhibited by zzso indicating that the interaction between these two proteins occurs prior to zzso zzso zzso analysis of disrupted zzso showed the presence of the zzso protein in the viral zzso zzso of the zzso protein complex from zzso required treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a reducing zzso The protein complex consisted of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso Since the zzso fusion protein lacks a signal sequence and a large zzso domain characteristic of membrane zzso our findings suggest that the zzso protein serves to anchor the zzso protein to the envelope of zzso
