The role of zzso zzso zzso in the active site of zzso pancreatic zzso zzso was studied by zzso DNA zzso two zzso proteins were constructed containing either zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso at position zzso zzso characterization indicated that the presence of zzso is essential for effective zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to either zzso or zzso strongly reduces the binding of zzso zzso in particular for the zzso zzso but the affinity for zzso zzso is hardly zzso zzso zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso yielded a protein that was nearly zzso zzso studies showed that this residual activity was due to a small amount of zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso itself has no zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is essential for the zzso action of zzso zzso The importance of zzso was further evaluated by comparison of the primary sequences of 53 zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing that zzso at position 49 are accompanied by structural variations of otherwise zzso zzso The occurrence of several zzso zzso appeared to be a general characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso
