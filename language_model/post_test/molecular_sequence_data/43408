The emergence of zzso organisms and the failure to eradicate infection by a number of important pathogens has led to increased efforts to develop vaccines to prevent infectious zzso However, the nature of the immune response to vaccination with a given zzso can be complex and zzso An example is the zzso and zzso zzso a surface zzso of zzso zzso that has been identified as a major candidate in a vaccine to prevent zzso zzso with the zzso can induce protective immunity to zzso liver zzso in some animals, but others of the same species exhibit zzso of disease after zzso To better understand this phenomenon, we used zzso proteins corresponding to four distinct zzso of the zzso and synthetic peptides to zzso both protective and zzso zzso of the heavy chain zzso of the zzso We show that protective immunity after vaccination can be correlated with the development of an zzso response to a region of 25 zzso acid zzso of the zzso and have confirmed the importance of the zzso response to this region by passive zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso of disease can be linked to the development of zzso that bind to an zzso domain of the zzso These findings are clinically relevant, as individuals who are zzso with zzso zzso but are resistant to invasive disease have a high prevalence of zzso to the protective zzso compared to individuals with a history of invasive zzso These studies should enable us to develop an improved vaccine for zzso and provide a model for the identification of protective and zzso zzso of complex zzso
