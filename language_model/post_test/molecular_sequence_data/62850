The 22 members of the zzso family have been implicated in cell zzso zzso survival, and zzso They are required for both development and maintenance of zzso demonstrating an exquisite pattern of affinities for both protein and zzso zzso zzso one of the most divergent human zzso is unique in binding solely to one zzso zzso We have used molecular replacement to solve the crystal structure of zzso at zzso A resolution using five superimposed zzso structures as the search zzso The structure shows that two novel zzso bonds found in zzso one of which appears to be zzso among several of the other zzso stabilize extended zzso The key zzso zzso of zzso have radically different zzso and charge patterns, compared to other zzso zzso with the unusually low affinity of zzso for zzso A model for the complex of zzso with zzso demonstrates that unique sequences in both zzso and zzso are key to the formation of the zzso The structure therefore offers a clear explanation for the unusual affinity of zzso for zzso zzso
