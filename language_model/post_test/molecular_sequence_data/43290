Thousands of proteins may be zzso on a two-dimensional zzso zzso but only hundreds are present at levels sufficient for chemical zzso zzso zzso of protein samples prior to zzso zzso gel zzso zzso will be important for the investigation of proteins that are present at zzso levels in zzso zzso We describe an approach to zzso protein samples prior to zzso PAGE using the zzso which is a new zzso zzso membrane apparatus designed to zzso proteins in a number of different zzso We have zzso human serum under zzso conditions using the zzso mode, in which proteins are zzso according to their relative mobility under controlled zzso conditions, where the current is periodically zzso We describe how zzso occurs and present examples of enrichment of specific zzso
