zzso necrosis factor zzso is zzso as a zzso with an unusually long and zzso signal sequence which is absent from the mature zzso zzso In addition to mature 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at least seven zzso proteins zzso of differing zzso mobility which appear as a zzso on zzso We here present data indicating that these zzso derive not from sequential clipping of zzso fragments, but rather from differential zzso at sites on the mature zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and zzso by sequential zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of two of these zzso reveal sequences identical to that of mature 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso products of zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso complex reflects differential zzso of mature 17 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with a battery of zzso zzso indicate that zzso forms of zzso zzso contain both zzso acid and zzso zzso The biological significance of this zzso is not zzso
