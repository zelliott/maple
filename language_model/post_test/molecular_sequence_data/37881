It has been argued that zzso zzso play important roles in cellular differentiation and zzso in certain zzso While studying changes in gene expression associated with the phenomena of zzso zzso zzso zzso which takes place in the zzso of zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso B zzso The open reading frame is zzso to other zzso B genes identified in other species and encodes all of the zzso characteristic of this zzso zzso zzso B zzso is first expressed during early zzso stages in a subset of zzso cells scattered throughout the zzso zzso is also seen in the peripheral zzso of the developing liver zzso the zzso and the paired zzso zzso and its zzso branch in the zzso zzso Given the significant role of zzso zzso in degrading components of the zzso zzso zzso expression may be important in the zzso of these zzso zzso expression was also examined during the processes of zzso zzso zzso wound healing, and limb zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed very early during zzso zzso expression is restricted to the site of the peripheral wound created by removal of the original zzso which triggers zzso zzso was not found in the central, zzso area of the cornea where zzso takes zzso zzso zzso does not appear to play an important role in zzso zzso zzso expression is associated with other zzso wounds, indicating that zzso B is expressed in the general context of wound healing in zzso Finally, zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso at the tip of the zzso zzso very early during limb zzso where it is argued to play a role in this zzso
