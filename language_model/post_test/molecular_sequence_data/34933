Holliday zzso zzso are ubiquitous proteins that play a key role in DNA repair and reorganization by zzso zzso The Holliday zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso is a member of this zzso The first zzso zzso were obtained by conventional zzso zzso They exhibited an unusually zzso unit cell and their X-ray characterization required special care to avoid spot zzso along the zzso zzso The use of an arc appended to the zzso head allowed proper orientation of zzso zzso grown in zzso gel by zzso Thus, complete zzso data were collected at zzso A resolution using zzso zzso They belong to space group zzso or zzso with zzso parameters a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso
