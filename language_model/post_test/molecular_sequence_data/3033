In order to clone the novel zzso of the zzso for the human zzso zzso zzso the human zzso zzso library was screened by the zzso zzso corresponding sequence of the human zzso zzso As a result, a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso S zzso which consists of a previously unidentified zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been zzso The structure of the zzso zzso S zzso is essentially similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso S zzso that was identified in our recent zzso Analysis of the zzso DNA revealed that the zzso of the zzso zzso S zzso originated from a novel zzso zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was carried out using the zzso specific to the zzso zzso S zzso on the total zzso from the human zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso S zzso was detected in the zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, the molecular size of the zzso zzso S zzso by the zzso zzso S zzso which was analyzed by the zzso of the expression zzso with zzso zzso S zzso into the zzso cell, was approximately zzso It was indicated that the one of the zzso in the zzso S could be used as the translation initiation zzso This is the first report on the zzso zzso zzso that is not caused by zzso or alternative zzso of the untranslated zzso
