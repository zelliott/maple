To zzso the chemical modifications in zzso zzso of zzso human insulin induced by metal zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was exposed for 3 h at room temperature to the zzso system zzso Chemical zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso was performed to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to zzso the zzso acids targeted by zzso and the zzso involved in insulin zzso zzso at different pH and temperature was monitored with size exclusion zzso zzso and zzso analysis to further investigate the chemical zzso to estimate the zzso content and to zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The results zzso the formation of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso followed by Michael addition, as responsible for new zzso resulting in zzso zzso of insulin during zzso Michael addition products were detected between zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso and free zzso groups of the zzso zzso acids zzso B1 and zzso zzso and side chains of zzso zzso His B5 and His zzso zzso originating from zzso bond zzso were also zzso 

zzso of insulin leads to zzso zzso through zzso via Michael addition to zzso zzso zzso
