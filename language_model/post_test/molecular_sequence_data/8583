The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the zzso zzso effects of zzso beta zzso zzso 1 zzso on insulin release from mouse pancreatic zzso For this purpose, mouse zzso were exposed for zzso zzso to zzso beta and their function and metabolism characterized during this zzso The zzso did not increase insulin release in the presence of zzso zzso zzso but both in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso + 2 zzso zzso it induced a zzso increase in insulin zzso Moreover, zzso beta also enhanced the effects of 1 zzso zzso on insulin release, but failed to increase insulin release induced by 30 zzso zzso or by zzso plus zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso These early zzso effects of zzso beta on insulin release were neither accompanied by major increases in zzso or zzso acid zzso nor by modifications in zzso zzso content, and they were prevented by zzso zzso or zzso zzso beta zzso of zzso insulin release was not accompanied by modifications in zzso but the zzso increased zzso production and induced protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso of zzso completely prevented the zzso effects of zzso beta on zzso insulin zzso In conclusion, zzso beta zzso an early stimulation of insulin release in mouse zzso by a mechanism independent of zzso zzso zzso generation or modifications in zzso This effect is probably related to zzso formation and stimulation of zzso
