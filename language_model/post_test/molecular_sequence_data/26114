Three zzso zzso 6 zzso genes of rice zzso were isolated, one from normal and two from zzso zzso zzso in order to determine whether the extra zzso gene in zzso rice plays a role in zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of all three genes were determined and analysis showed a zzso zzso gene zzso as well as a normal zzso gene in zzso zzso but only the normal zzso gene in normal zzso The zzso gene is completely zzso to the normal zzso gene from at least position zzso in the zzso zzso region to position zzso downstream from the initiation zzso zzso however, the following downstream sequence shows no zzso with the normal rice zzso zzso or any other reported zzso Introduction of the zzso of fertility gene altered zzso of the zzso gene but not the zzso zzso indicating participation of the zzso gene in the expression of zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was generated by an zzso zzso event in zzso DNA, and the zzso zzso point between the zzso gene and the opposite ancestral sequence was identified as zzso
