zzso zzso is an emerging zzso pathogen responsible for vascular zzso infections, prosthetic zzso and zzso The treatment of zzso zzso infections is complicated by the zzso of clinical zzso to zzso in particular to zzso the most broadly used class of zzso To gain insight into the mechanism of zzso resistance, we have determined the structure of the zzso and shown that zzso zzso has the dual capacity to zzso formation of zzso generated by zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were identified, zzso a member of the active site zzso zzso family, and zzso a zzso class B zzso protein zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso and the zzso contributed to the formation of zzso and 38% of the zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso were not inhibited by zzso the participation of the zzso to zzso zzso decreased in the presence of the zzso The specificity of zzso for zzso donors containing a zzso stem accounts for this effect of zzso since the essential zzso of zzso was produced by an zzso zzso zzso Acquisition and zzso zzso of zzso accounted for high-level zzso resistance in zzso zzso
