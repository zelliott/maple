Metal zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso is dependent on the presence of metal regulatory elements zzso which are present in five zzso copies zzso through zzso in the promoter of the mouse zzso gene and on the capacity of metal zzso zzso zzso to bind to the zzso in the presence of zzso We detected a zzso distinct from zzso specifically binding to the zzso zzso DNA binding competition experiments using synthetic zzso and specific zzso zzso showed that this protein binds to an zzso site overlapping the zzso element as well as to a second site upstream of the zzso site and zzso to zzso or a related zzso zzso experiments showed that loss of the two zzso sites decreased zzso zzso promoter activity by zzso in zzso zzso cells and almost completely zzso metal and zzso zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, expression of an inactive zzso protein strongly inhibited zzso promoter zzso Using synthetic promoters containing zzso and zzso sites fused to a minimal zzso promoter, we showed that these zzso sites did not zzso metal induction but enhanced zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso binds to the mouse zzso promoter in zzso and showed that zzso binding is zzso In addition, zzso zzso DNA binding was zzso Taken together, these studies show that zzso acts zzso with zzso to activate the mouse zzso promoter in response to metal zzso and zzso and contributes to zzso zzso of the zzso
