The method of zzso zzso display was used to select a preferred zzso from three zzso display libraries using the zzso zzso The display libraries consisted of four random zzso zzso six random zzso zzso and a biased library containing four zzso acids from the P side of the zzso maturation site followed by four random zzso zzso A series of consensus peptides was zzso based upon the results from these screens and tested in zzso zzso zzso An eight zzso acids consensus zzso zzso derived from the zzso results was zzso as efficiently as a zzso maturation site zzso The selected zzso acid sequences also allowed the design of a four zzso acid zzso zzso for continuous zzso of zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso these results define zzso to zzso as a minimal zzso recognition domain for the zzso zzso and suggest that zzso to zzso is the minimal zzso domain which all zzso zzso zzso
