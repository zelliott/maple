zzso zzso zzso facilitate the cellular zzso of zzso attached zzso proteins and other zzso but the mechanism of their zzso is zzso Two models are zzso direct movement through the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are a good model system to distinguish between these possibilities, since they have no zzso transport zzso Furthermore, zzso delivery of zzso to the zzso zzso would be a significant breakthrough in the study of zzso function and dysfunction, and could also lead to new therapies for diseases caused by zzso zzso Therefore we investigated whether two zzso zzso and zzso could act as zzso delivery zzso We also determined whether zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso facilitated their zzso into zzso since zzso leads to zzso of attached molecules into zzso driven by the membrane zzso Neither zzso nor zzso nor their zzso zzso are zzso by isolated zzso indicating that these zzso cannot cross zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are taken up by cells, but they accumulate in zzso and do not reach zzso We conclude that zzso cannot cross zzso zzso zzso and therefore cannot deliver zzso directly to zzso Our findings shed light on the mechanism of zzso of zzso by zzso The lack of direct movement of zzso through zzso zzso zzso along with the observed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in cells, makes it unlikely that zzso enter cells by direct membrane passage, and instead zzso cellular zzso via an zzso zzso
