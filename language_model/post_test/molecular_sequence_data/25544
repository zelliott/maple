We have studied the expression of zzso in cultured zzso and determined its primary structure by zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is a zzso zzso that becomes incorporated into a zzso zzso zzso when expressed by cultured cells or added zzso to cell zzso In addition, we find that zzso is present in plasma at a level of 33 zzso 3 zzso zzso of multiple zzso zzso indicates that a process of alternative zzso results in the expression of three zzso zzso The transcripts zzso overlapping zzso differing only in zzso zzso Common to the three predicted forms of zzso is a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso signal zzso The zzso portion of zzso contains a repeated element with potential zzso loop structure resembling that of the complement component zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as proteins of the zzso gene zzso The bulk of the remaining portion of the zzso is a series of nine zzso zzso
