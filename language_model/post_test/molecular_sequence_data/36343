Most zzso zzso zzso are characterized zzso by a zzso It is reasonable to assume that this zzso zzso to the consistent zzso of one or two genes in zzso and/or zzso and that the zzso thus affected are important in the normal control of fat cell differentiation and zzso We have used Southern zzso technique to test whether a gene of the zzso binding protein zzso family, zzso which maps to zzso and is assumed to be involved in zzso zzso could be the zzso gene in zzso Using a zzso probe that spans the zzso coding region, we detected one rearranged and one wild type zzso in nine of nine zzso with zzso Using zzso generated, zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso 1 and 2 and zzso 2 of zzso zzso in five of seven tumors mapped to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments that contain the first two zzso and zzso of the gene and the upstream promoter zzso In contrast to the findings in zzso no tumor without a zzso exhibited zzso zzso restriction digest zzso These tumors included one highly differentiated zzso with abnormal zzso but no involvement of zzso seven zzso with various zzso aberrations of zzso two zzso zzso with zzso zzso and one zzso and one zzso both of which also had zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
