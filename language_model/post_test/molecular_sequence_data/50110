zzso was isolated in a screen for proteins interacting with zzso a regulator of zzso translation in early zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor and activates zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into stage VI zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso maturation and prevents the zzso and translation of zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso these zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation and the zzso and translation of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso exchange deficient version of zzso which retains the ability to interact with zzso no longer zzso zzso maturation or zzso zzso suggesting that zzso exchange factor activity is required for the influence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso continues to accelerate zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso but does not stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating that zzso may function through the zzso zzso to influence zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an early acting component of the zzso zzso maturation zzso
