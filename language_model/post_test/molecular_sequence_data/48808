zzso zzso zzso Tinsley, is a zzso zzso zzso It is an agricultural zzso that is now widely distributed in zzso In this study we report the presence of zzso from zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso gene library to study the bacterial diversity associated with this insect and we found that all the clones from the library were only of zzso zzso zzso This study also highlights that the normal protocol adopted to study the bacterial diversity from environmental sample, by preparation of a zzso zzso gene library, does not work when the bacterial population is highly skewed in favor of one bacteria zzso zzso in this zzso zzso we used bacterial zzso specific zzso chain reaction zzso to test the presence of any of the widely known secondary zzso associated with zzso We tested for the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso collected from 10 different locations across zzso Only zzso was detected from four locations while we were not able to find any other zzso We confirmed the presence of these bacteria by zzso zzso and the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso using fluorescent in zzso zzso
