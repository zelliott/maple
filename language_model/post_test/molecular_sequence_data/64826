zzso remain major agents of global zzso and vaccination against these zzso zzso may be an attractive complement to conventional control zzso Here we describe the cloning of zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso a novel zzso protein produced by adult zzso Native zzso was zzso from zzso zzso products by zzso zzso liquid zzso subjected to zzso sequencing, and cloned from adult zzso zzso by using reverse zzso The translated zzso zzso predicts that the mature protein consists of 102 zzso acids and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso reacted strongly with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with native zzso products zzso to zzso induced zzso that recognized zzso while zzso vaccination resulted in zzso that reacted with a single protein band in zzso products that closely zzso the size predicted for the native zzso zzso zzso that were passively zzso with zzso rabbit zzso serum exhibited more rapid and complete recovery from anemia than controls that received normal zzso zzso zzso with zzso was associated with significantly reduced anemia upon challenge, an outcome similar to the outcome observed in zzso that were orally vaccinated with soluble zzso extract (the latter animals were also resistant to weight zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role in the zzso interaction and that vaccination against this protein may represent a useful strategy for controlling zzso zzso
