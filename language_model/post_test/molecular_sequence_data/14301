zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as human zzso 8, is closely associated with several zzso including zzso zzso primary zzso lymphoma, and zzso zzso zzso zzso can establish lifelong zzso in the host, but the mechanism is not fully zzso Previous studies have proposed a feedback model in which the viral replication and zzso zzso zzso can induce the expression of the zzso nuclear zzso zzso during early zzso zzso in turn, zzso zzso and zzso function to establish and maintain zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and the zzso signal sequence binding protein zzso zzso also called zzso a major zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, is essential for zzso zzso In the present study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso are responsible for the zzso interaction with zzso The secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso resembles the zzso module zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of the region of zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulted in zzso expression of zzso leading to elevated viral zzso zzso For the first time, we dissected a zzso zzso binding domain in zzso and demonstrated that this domain was indispensable for zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso thus helping the virus maintain zzso and control viral zzso
