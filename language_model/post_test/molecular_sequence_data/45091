The structure of the zzso zzso from the first module of the zzso zzso with zzso bound was solved to zzso A zzso The 51 zzso domain has two zzso each similar to a zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso has a truncated zzso fold and serves a purely structural role stabilizing the other zzso which zzso the reduction of the zzso of a zzso and possibly the zzso of an zzso The structure enabled us to define the domain boundaries of zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso It also zzso the three-dimensional organization of these zzso within a zzso revealing that zzso does not make zzso contacts across the zzso axis of the zzso The zzso structure zzso how zzso are shuttled between the active sites of zzso zzso zzso as well as related fatty acid zzso zzso and suggests how zzso can be swapped to make hybrid zzso that produce novel zzso
