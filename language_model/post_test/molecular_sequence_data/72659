By means of sequence analysis, zzso fetal zzso 1 zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso fluid was shown to be the circulating protein of the zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso factor 1 zzso gene zzso The protein contains 36 zzso zzso arranged in six zzso zzso The zzso of several zzso peptides of varying lengths showed zzso to be zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso type were present on all zzso peptides at zzso zzso zzso and zzso although zzso on zzso was only zzso Three zzso zzso were localized in zzso zzso zzso and zzso two of which zzso and zzso were in the unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small amounts (less than zzso of zzso zzso structures were identified on the zzso zzso zzso using sequential zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso attached to zzso zzso and zzso at zzso was tentatively zzso by combining zzso degradation and zzso The results presented shows zzso to be the circulating zzso zzso products of the zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
