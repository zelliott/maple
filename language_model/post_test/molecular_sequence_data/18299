The structure, zzso organization, and zzso pattern of zzso of a gene zzso a zzso protein zzso in potato zzso zzso have been zzso The gene is rapidly activated in leaves from the potato zzso zzso containing the resistance gene zzso in both compatible and incompatible interactions with appropriate races of the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso is also observed in leaves treated with zzso zzso The gene occurs in zzso very similar copies and encodes a zzso (Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is classified as a zzso protein by several zzso Small fragments with great sequence similarity to portions of the two zzso were found closely linked to the expressed zzso which altogether represents a simple case of zzso organization in zzso The coding sequence of the zzso gene and the deduced zzso acid sequence are zzso similar to the corresponding sequences of a zzso heat shock protein from zzso
