The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulates expression of the zzso zzso zzso genes in response to changes in zzso levels of free zzso in many zzso zzso When activated by binding zzso zzso binds to the zzso of several genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso or translation of these zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso that binds to zzso zzso and prevents it from binding to its zzso targets, and thereby zzso zzso gene zzso The crystal structure shows that AT is a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of the three zzso assembled at the zzso of the cone and that these zzso can further assemble into a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we found four zzso all located on the zzso region of zzso that are essential for binding to zzso Fluorescent labeling experiments further suggest that the top region of AT is in close juxtaposition to zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso studies confirmed the importance of these zzso on the top of AT in regulating zzso zzso gene zzso
