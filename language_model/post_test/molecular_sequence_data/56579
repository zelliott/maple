zzso channels play a crucial role in generating action zzso in zzso and other excitable zzso zzso composed of four zzso repeats, are responsible for most of the zzso channel zzso The combination of molecular biology with zzso tools has proved useful for understanding the molecular mechanism of the channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso occur, based on zzso 4, zzso zzso the region intervened by zzso 5 and 6, zzso zzso in a human skeletal muscle zzso channel gene cause zzso muscle disorders, zzso periodic paralysis and zzso zzso Future directions in zzso channel studies may include gene regulation of the zzso channel related to neural cell fate and zzso zzso of channel molecules concurrent with plasticity or zzso
