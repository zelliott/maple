zzso zzso receptors are zzso structures resulting from the association of at least two zzso related zzso types, zzso and one of the four zzso zzso zzso When associated with zzso the zzso zzso impose specific properties to the zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso are expressed in the majority of central zzso the zzso zzso display distinct patterns of expression in the developing and adult rat zzso The zzso zzso is barely expressed in the rat zzso whereas its expression increases substantially in the zzso cells in the course of zzso zzso We have identified novel zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso cells as well as in the developing zzso When compared with the zzso zzso zzso these zzso carry one zzso or two zzso insertions or a deletion zzso and zzso putative zzso zzso that terminate between the third and fourth membrane segments or between the first and second membrane zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso show that expression of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso both in the zzso and in the zzso zzso recordings and zzso emissions in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells indicate that the zzso zzso when expressed in combination with zzso does not contribute to the formation of functional zzso zzso The significance of zzso findings is zzso
