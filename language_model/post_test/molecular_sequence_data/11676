zzso is a zzso disease characterized by the zzso of activated T cells in the zzso We previously showed that zzso patients expressing the zzso zzso zzso had increased numbers of lung zzso T cells using the T cell zzso zzso variable region zzso alpha zzso gene segment zzso In the present study, the composition of both the zzso zzso and zzso of the expanded zzso lung T cells from four zzso zzso patients was zzso 

zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso cloning and zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for V beta usage by flow zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso or by the zzso chain reaction zzso using V zzso and C zzso zzso J beta usage was analyzed by Southern zzso of zzso products and subsequent zzso with zzso J zzso zzso 

Evidence of biased J alpha gene segment usage by the zzso of V alpha zzso zzso lung T cells was found in four out of four zzso Both different zzso zzso sequences coding for identical zzso acid sequences and a number of zzso repeated zzso sequences were zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso V alpha zzso zzso lung T cells were found, with one exception, to have a zzso zzso V beta zzso 

The finding of V alpha zzso zzso lung T cells with identical zzso zzso zzso acid sequences but with different zzso sequences strongly suggests that different T cell clones have been selected to interact with a specific zzso associated zzso The identification of T cells with restricted zzso zzso which may play an important role in the development of zzso and the possibility of selectively manipulating these cells should have important implications for the treatment of the zzso
