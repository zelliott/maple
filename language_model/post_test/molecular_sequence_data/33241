A zzso zzso designated zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso symbiotic zzso isolated from the gut of zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso in zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso containing a predicted signal zzso of 24 zzso and a zzso domain belonging to zzso zzso family 10 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is most similar zzso zzso to an zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso 10 zzso zzso indicated that zzso 10 zzso from zzso were separated into two zzso and zzso is more closely related to the zzso of zzso from gut or rumen than to those of zzso and zzso from other zzso zzso zzso zzso showed apparent optimal activity at pH zzso and 45 degrees zzso Compared with zzso and zzso counterparts, zzso was more active at low temperatures, retaining zzso of its maximum activity at zzso degrees C and approximately zzso even at 10 degrees C, and modeling indicated that zzso has fewer hydrogen bonds and salt zzso These properties suggest that zzso has various potential applications, especially in aquaculture and the food zzso
