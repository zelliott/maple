The objective of this study was to assess whether there is zzso evidence for zzso zzso DNA in zzso zzso zzso specimens collected in an academic institution in the zzso This was a retrospective, zzso study of patients from 1994 - zzso We used 28 zzso zzso zzso biopsy specimens from adult patients, 16 control zzso specimens from patients with systemic zzso not involving the zzso zzso and five control benign zzso tissue zzso The presence of zzso zzso DNA was investigated by zzso chain reaction zzso in each zzso Two different zzso were zzso zzso conventional zzso based zzso targeting a zzso zzso of the zzso gene and zzso a real-time zzso zzso amplifying a zzso portion of the zzso gene with detection via a specific fluorescent zzso zzso was carried out to 60 zzso Positive controls consisted of isolated DNA from zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso A human DNA internal control was used to assess sample DNA quality and amplification zzso Mean outcome measure was the presence of zzso zzso zzso Using both zzso all patient samples in all categories yielded negative zzso Both zzso detected zzso zzso DNA from isolated zzso Internationally, zzso zzso has been associated with zzso zzso zzso with great zzso Similar to several other recent studies in the USA, our study could not confirm the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the prevalence of zzso zzso infection in various geographic regions or technical differences in the application of the zzso may zzso the zzso in the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
