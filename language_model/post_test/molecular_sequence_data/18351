The structural organization of the upstream regulatory regions of the zzso genes is discussed in relation to zzso gene zzso zzso of the sequences of the regulatory and coding parts of the genes that make up this zzso family shows that some members of the family with zzso coding regions may differ in the organization of their regulatory regions zzso compared with zzso zzso or zzso On the other hand, some zzso genes with different primary structures of their coding regions and different zzso organization show similarities in the structural organization of their regulatory regions zzso zzso and zzso
