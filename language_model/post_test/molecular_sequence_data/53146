zzso zzso libraries were used to map zzso relevant zzso on the surface zzso zzso of a zzso zzso coronavirus zzso Three in zzso zzso and in zzso protective zzso against either continuous or zzso zzso on the S zzso were used to screen 12 different zzso libraries expressed on the zzso major coat protein of the zzso zzso zzso Consensus sequences that matched short sequences within the S zzso were zzso The sequence of a zzso zzso zzso suggested the location of a zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso Several tightly binding zzso were amplified and used directly as zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso protection of zzso mice against a lethal acute virus infection was achieved with a zzso preparation that displayed a linear zzso Protection correlated with the presence of sufficient levels of specific zzso zzso recognizing the same zzso domain and zzso zzso located within the zzso zzso zzso as the selecting zzso Thus, the direct use of zzso peptides to evaluate protective zzso immune responses zzso their use to characterize zzso zzso This is the first evaluation of protective zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso
