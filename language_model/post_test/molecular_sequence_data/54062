DNA zzso with zzso zzso zzso formed by ultraviolet radiation are implicated in zzso and cancer, particularly skin zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso specific to DNA zzso zzso is determined as a complex with zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso A resolution to a zzso zzso of zzso and an zzso value of zzso The zzso zzso zzso is in an extended arrangement with an elbow angle of 174 degrees, and its five zzso regions, except zzso are involved in the zzso zzso The bound zzso zzso adopting a ring structure with zzso linked zzso zzso zzso bases is fully zzso in an zzso pocket of about 15 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso bases are in zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and are nearly perpendicular to each zzso The zzso base is zzso to zzso and zzso and is in van der zzso contact with zzso The zzso base is zzso to zzso and is in contact with zzso Three water molecules are located at the interface between the bases and the zzso zzso zzso bonds involving these water molecules also contribute to zzso recognition of the zzso zzso The zzso backbone connecting the bases is surrounded by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but is not zzso to these zzso
