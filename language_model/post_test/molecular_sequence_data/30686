The zzso basic proteins zzso are a group of three (Mr zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso basic zzso zzso by the zzso zzso under the influence of zzso zzso which exist as zzso (Mr zzso zzso with the zzso acid zzso zzso Several zzso zzso clones from a zzso pregnant pig zzso zzso zzso library have been cloned and zzso The zzso zzso is approximately zzso bases long and has a single open reading frame of zzso bases with two start zzso at positions 64 and 79 from the zzso zzso zzso content of the zzso increases as pregnancy zzso reaching maximum levels around day 70 and then remaining relatively constant in late gestation zzso 70 to zzso The zzso of the zzso minus signal sequence appears to be zzso zzso acids in length and has four potential zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of the individual zzso zzso with the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso has indicated a series of at least four zzso zzso processing steps which generate the various molecular forms of the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shares considerable identity with several zzso zzso and zzso proteins that are members of the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence also exhibits about zzso sequence identity with the zzso zzso milk proteins zzso of the zzso Since the zzso and zzso share many zzso and structural features that include site of zzso in the zzso zzso the presence of the zzso zzso zzso recognition marker, and considerable sequence zzso the zzso and the zzso may have zzso function which for both still remains zzso
