The gene for the putative zzso for zzso and zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated by functional zzso of zzso coli strains lacking either zzso or zzso transport zzso The same two zzso clones were isolated from each zzso These clones restored zzso and zzso transport to the respective zzso coli zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso overlap between these two plasmids was zzso A zzso zzso zzso whose disruption eliminated zzso of both zzso coli strains showed zzso identity with the zzso coli zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso These two zzso are members of the major zzso zzso in which they represent a previously zzso zzso In addition, an incomplete gene similar to zzso coli zzso was zzso One of the plasmids zzso zzso coli zzso zzso
