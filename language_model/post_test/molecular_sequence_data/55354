zzso zzso zzso are hybrid proteins used to treat zzso These proteins are composed of an zzso that zzso with cancer cells joined to a portion of zzso zzso A, which kills the zzso Because the toxin is a foreign zzso it can induce zzso zzso and thereby limit the number of doses a patient can zzso We previously identified seven major mouse zzso zzso in the zzso and subsequently silenced them using point zzso that converted large zzso zzso acids to zzso yet retained full zzso zzso Here we present results in which we identify and silence human zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We obtained B cells from patients with zzso to zzso isolated the corresponding variable fragments zzso and constructed a zzso library containing zzso that bind to the zzso We then used zzso scanning zzso to locate the zzso We found that human and mouse zzso frequently overlap but are not zzso Most zzso that remove mouse zzso did not remove human zzso Using the zzso information, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso which has low zzso with human zzso yet has high zzso and zzso activity and can be given to mice at high doses without excess zzso The toxin portion of this zzso zzso can be used with zzso targeting other cancer zzso and is suitable for clinical zzso
