zzso zzso in zzso DNA zzso have been long proposed to drive the zzso and progression of human zzso Previous investigations have revealed a high frequency of zzso zzso in the zzso control region of zzso in zzso However, little is known with regard to whether or not zzso zzso also occur in the coding regions of zzso in zzso To test this possibility, in the present study we screened zzso zzso over the full-length zzso zzso of 31 zzso zzso tissue samples, and corresponding peripheral blood samples from the same cohort of zzso We detected a sum of 11 zzso zzso in the zzso coding regions in our zzso Nine of them were zzso or zzso zzso that have the potential to hamper zzso respiratory zzso In combination with our earlier observations on the zzso fragment, zzso zzso of patients with zzso carried at least one zzso zzso zzso and a total of 40 zzso zzso were zzso zzso them, 29 zzso were located in the zzso region, two zzso were in the sequences of the zzso zzso two zzso were in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 gene and seven zzso occurred in genes zzso components of the zzso respiratory zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso was not closely associated with the zzso characteristics of zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso are highly prevalent events in both coding and zzso regions of zzso in zzso Some zzso and zzso zzso are zzso harmful to proper zzso activity and might play vital roles in zzso zzso
