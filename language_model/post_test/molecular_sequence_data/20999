zzso Growth zzso zzso and their receptors are well known for having major implications in cell zzso controlling embryonic zzso Recently, a gene coding for a protein closely related to zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso called zzso or zzso 1 zzso has been described in zzso An zzso gene was also found in the zzso zzso but no zzso genes were found by the authors in other zzso species, even if a zzso gene was identified in the sea zzso zzso as well as a closely related zzso named zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These intriguing data of a zzso gene that might be implicated in zzso zzso prompted us to search for putative zzso zzso in the completely zzso zzso of zzso 

We found zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso as well as in many zzso zzso Our analysis also shows that zzso zzso genes are linked in the zzso with other members of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso To better understand the implication of zzso genes in zzso embryonic development, we have analyzed expression patterns of the zzso and the mouse genes by whole mount in zzso zzso We show that some zzso expression territories can be zzso and we propose that zzso and zzso were already zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso 

Our work sheds light on the existence of a putative zzso zzso zzso actor present in the zzso of probably all zzso the function of which has received little attention until zzso
