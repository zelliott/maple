zzso acid zzso is produced commonly by plants and many bacteria, however, little is known about the genetic basis involving the key zzso of zzso zzso pathways from zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated, which showed the existence of only an zzso acid zzso zzso for zzso zzso from the zzso Four open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and putative zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso synthetic pathway, were found on the zzso sequence database of zzso zzso and cloned in zzso coli zzso One of the zzso zzso was assigned as probable zzso zzso The zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids with a deduced molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso studies of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso with known zzso sequences revealed conservation of several zzso acids in zzso essential for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene product of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso to zzso using affinity zzso The molecular mass of the zzso zzso showed about 63 zzso corresponding closely to the expected molecular mass of zzso The zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso detected by zzso using zzso zzso in the zzso reaction confirmed the identity and functionality of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
