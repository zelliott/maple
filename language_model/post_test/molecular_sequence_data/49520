zzso zzso zzso zzso from the seeds of jack fruits has attracted considerable attention for its diverse biological activities and has been recognized as a zzso zzso specific zzso In previous studies, the information of its binding was limited to the zzso results of zzso and several T related zzso but its interaction with other zzso structural units occurring in natural zzso has not been zzso For this reason, the binding profile of this zzso was studied by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso with our zzso zzso Among zzso zzso tested for zzso high density of zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso reacted most avidly with zzso As zzso expressed as zzso yielding 50% zzso these zzso and zzso containing zzso were about zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso times more potent than zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of the zzso tested and expressed as zzso for 50% zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and the human P blood group active zzso zzso zzso were the best and about 283 times more active than zzso We conclude that the most potent zzso for this zzso are zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were poor zzso Thus, the overall binding profile of zzso can be defined in decreasing order as high density of zzso and zzso zzso simple zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso Gal zzso zzso zzso Man and zzso zzso Our finding should aid in the selection of this zzso for biological zzso
