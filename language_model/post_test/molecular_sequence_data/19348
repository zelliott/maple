A slightly zzso strain, strain zzso was isolated from single cells of the marine zzso zzso zzso and was found to contain the genes zzso two proteins of the zzso reaction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the novel strain belonged to the zzso zzso of the zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso marina zzso zzso zzso cells of strain zzso contained small amounts of zzso a zzso a) and a zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in size and zzso by means of a single, zzso inserted zzso The novel strain was strictly zzso and zzso a wide range of organic carbon sources, including fatty zzso zzso acid cycle zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were required as growth zzso Growth was obtained at sea salt zzso of between 1 and 10 % zzso at a pH between 6 and zzso and at a temperature of up to 33 degrees C zzso 26 degrees zzso zzso was not reduced and zzso was not produced from zzso zzso zzso was resistant to zzso zzso and transformed it to zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso 10 zzso The polar lipids comprised zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and the zzso zzso The fatty acids comprised 16 : 1 zzso 16 : 0, 18 : 1 zzso 18 : 0, zzso 18 : 1 zzso zzso 20 : 1 zzso 20 : 1 zzso 22 : 0, 22 : 1 and the zzso fatty acids zzso 14 : 0, zzso 16 : 0 zzso zzso 18 : 0, zzso 20 : 1 and zzso 20 : 0, all of which are zzso The DNA zzso value was 56 zzso Comparative analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the type species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is only zzso related to zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso Based on the combination of the zzso zzso gene sequence data, a detailed zzso study and the zzso and zzso properties of members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marina are transferred to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso marina zzso zzso The type species of the new zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso The zzso genes of the photosynthesis reaction zzso were shown to be present in some, but not all, species of the new zzso zzso and they were identified for the first time in zzso zzso In accordance with the new data collected in this study, zzso descriptions are provided for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso
