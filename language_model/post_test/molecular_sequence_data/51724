We have developed a zzso virus 40 zzso zzso immortalized human cell line, zzso zzso in which the expression of zzso is controlled by the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso promoter and thus regulated by steroids such as zzso Studies on the regulation of proliferation by zzso led to the zzso of a zzso model for human cell zzso in which a mortality stage 1 mechanism zzso was the target of zzso action, and an independent mortality stage 2 mechanism zzso produced crisis and prevented zzso from directly zzso zzso zzso a cell expressing zzso escaped crisis zzso zzso and was capable of indefinite zzso This model predicted that the zzso of zzso in zzso cells would lead to the zzso of the zzso zzso and thus a zzso of the zzso zzso Our study confirms the prediction that, in the absence of steroids, zzso cells express a variety of zzso and zzso markers characteristic of normal zzso human zzso
