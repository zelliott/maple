Increased drug resistance to zzso highlights the need for the development of new zzso for the treatment of zzso To this end, the zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and zzso from zzso DNA of zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso region of the zzso gene was inserted into the zzso expression zzso zzso and a 34 zzso protein with zzso activity was expressed in zzso zzso zzso differences between human zzso and zzso make the latter an attractive target for zzso leading to novel zzso zzso The sequence similarity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso identity and no insertions or zzso indicate that the same approach could be applied to zzso zzso the most common human malaria zzso in the zzso
