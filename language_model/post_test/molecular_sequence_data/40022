The zzso membrane proteins that promote their zzso by zzso host cells are zzso To identify zzso zzso that bind host cell surface zzso zzso zzso cells were used to probe a zzso membrane containing zzso extracts separated by zzso This overlay zzso revealed that two close zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso were recognized by host zzso Both proteins were identified using high resolution zzso coupled with mass zzso zzso One protein was identified as the zzso zzso of zzso called the zzso The second interacting protein was identified as a protein of unknown function zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso respectively, that shares strong similarities with other bacterial zzso Both proteins are highly zzso within the zzso zzso and might play a critical role in their zzso These data may have important implications for the development of future vaccines against zzso zzso
