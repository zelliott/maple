We have developed a zzso and zzso solution zzso for the measurement of zzso activity in complex zzso This technology can accelerate research in functional zzso and enable biologists to carry out zzso zzso inhibitor screens on a large zzso The zzso zzso is based on zzso universal zzso zzso The zzso sequences that serve as zzso zzso are zzso to zzso sequences complementary to the zzso tags on randomly assembled and zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion is zzso labeled with a zzso zzso and contains a sequence of five zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The unique zzso part of each zzso zzso is attached to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso the zzso zzso is zzso from the zzso zzso Following the reaction, all zzso species are captured and removed by incubation with zzso zzso The zzso zzso that remain in solution are captured by zzso of their zzso sequence to zzso zzso and detected using a labeled zzso against zzso tag of the zzso or by an zzso sandwich zzso We have generated multiple sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso of varying complexity zzso to 1000 zzso in a zzso and show that the response of individual zzso is independent of the complexity of the zzso Our initial results demonstrate the feasibility of zzso zzso in a zzso environment with high zzso
