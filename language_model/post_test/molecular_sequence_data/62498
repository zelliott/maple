Currently zzso membrane zzso zzso is showing promise both as an imaging and therapeutic target for zzso prostate cancer zzso First generation zzso against zzso are used for the zzso approved zzso trade mark zzso zzso scan and second generation zzso are being developed for therapeutic targeting as well as imaging zzso However, there have been reports describing zzso expression in zzso zzso including zzso liver, and zzso As we had previously showed the existence of a human zzso zzso we set out to determine if this zzso expression was due to expression of the zzso or another zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by screening a liver zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso and zzso genes was determined via Northern zzso analysis using two different zzso and protein expression confirmed in some zzso via Western zzso zzso zzso regulation of the two genes was examined using reporter zzso driving zzso zzso 

The zzso gene possesses zzso identity to the zzso gene at the zzso level and is expressed in kidney and liver under the control of a different promoter to the zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed in several human zzso and is most abundant in the nervous system and the zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso should be taken into consideration when designing clinical strategies targeting zzso
