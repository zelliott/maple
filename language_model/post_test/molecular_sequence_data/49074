A new method to find novel protein targets for zzso of interest is zzso The principle of this approach is based on affinity zzso and zzso zzso The proteins within a crude rat liver zzso were allowed to interact with a zzso library of zzso zzso immobilized on affinity zzso zzso homocysteine zzso zzso was one of the proteins that was retained and subsequently zzso from these zzso The zzso zzso which served as immobilized zzso for the isolation of rat zzso were then tested for their ability to inhibit human zzso zzso in zzso The most potent inhibitor also behaved as a selective zzso for the affinity zzso of zzso from a complex zzso Further zzso uncovered zzso as a potent zzso inhibitor that has an zzso of about 1 zzso
