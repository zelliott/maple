To discover genes involved in tomato resistance to Tomato yellow leaf zzso virus zzso we previously compared zzso libraries from susceptible zzso and resistant zzso tomato zzso Among the genes zzso expressed in R plants and zzso by zzso infection was a gene zzso a zzso zzso This gene was termed zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso The zzso structural gene sequence of R and S plants was zzso zzso was expressed in leaves during a 15-day window starting about 40 days after zzso (20 days after zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso (the zzso zzso feeding on R plant leaves, and even more strongly zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in R plants led to the collapse of resistance upon zzso zzso and to a zzso response along the stem and zzso accompanied by zzso zzso zzso to previously identified tomato zzso gene zzso zzso was not regulated by cold, nor was it regulated by heat or zzso The expression of zzso was inhibited in R plants in which the zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso was not inhibited in zzso R zzso zzso in the hierarchy of the gene network zzso zzso resistance, zzso is downstream of zzso zzso of another gene involved in resistance, a zzso like zzso did not affect the expression of zzso and zzso expression of the zzso was not affected by zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that it does not belong to the same zzso The triple zzso of zzso zzso and zzso provoked an immediate zzso of growth of R plants upon infection and the zzso of large amounts of zzso zzso is the first zzso gene shown to be involved in resistance to a plant zzso
