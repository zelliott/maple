Six derivatives of the human zzso type 16 zzso gene were constructed, each of which zzso a zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso protein capable of zzso metal zzso for use in subsequent zzso of the proteins by zzso zzso metal zzso affinity zzso zzso Five of the six zzso peptides examined contained six zzso zzso and each varied in the number of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso were blocked in the form of zzso zzso This series of zzso proteins was zzso in a single zzso step using zzso The efficiency of zzso correlated with the number of zzso and zzso zzso present in the zzso The zzso zzso proteins bound to the human zzso gene product, zzso in in zzso zzso zzso and immobilized zzso binding zzso The efficiency of zzso binding was not altered by the presence of a zzso at the zzso of zzso nor by the zzso groups within zzso
