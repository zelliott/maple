zzso of zzso zzso is common in multiple human zzso including prostate cancer, and zzso 6 transferred into cancer cells zzso zzso and reduces cell growth, zzso and zzso indicating the existence of one or more zzso genes in zzso To identify the zzso zzso zzso we first narrowed the common region of deletion to a zzso zzso zzso at zzso Of the 11 genes located in this minimal deletion region and expressed in normal zzso only zzso zzso was zzso demonstrated zzso zzso and inhibited colony formation in prostate cancer zzso The zzso a zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso was found in two of 30 prostate cancer cell zzso and nine of 89 localized prostate zzso zzso of 119 or zzso zzso Two of 89 zzso patients with prostate cancer also showed the same zzso in their zzso DNA, but none of 104 zzso control men zzso The zzso deletion abolished zzso function in a colony formation zzso Analysis of zzso prostate cancer cases and zzso matched control men from a zzso study zzso in a prospective cohort showed that, although a zzso zzso zzso of the deletion was detected in both patients and controls at similar zzso the zzso of the deletion was significantly associated with clinically significant prostate cancer zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso These findings establish zzso zzso as a reasonable candidate for the zzso zzso gene in prostate cancer and likely in other types of zzso
