zzso association with its zzso zzso zzso and recruitment by the latter of an zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling through at least two distinct pathways zzso and zzso zzso and zzso help determine the signaling zzso Our previous work has shown that zzso links at least one zzso family member zzso to zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso through both a classical zzso zzso motif and a so-called zzso zzso We report here the crystal structure of a zzso protein that mimics the zzso zzso The zzso domain binds at one end of the zzso zzso domain of zzso This zzso interface shows that parts of the zzso surface distinct from the zzso site can help recruit specific receptors or zzso into a zzso coated zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso contact or in the zzso motif reduce affinity of zzso for zzso and block efficient zzso of zzso in response to zzso by zzso The crystal structure has thus allowed us to identify the specific interaction that leads to zzso zzso and to zzso zzso signaling zzso
