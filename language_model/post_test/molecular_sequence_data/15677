A novel strain, zzso of zzso zzso zzso bacteria was isolated from the surface layer of bottom sediments from the soda lake zzso zzso zzso Eastern zzso zzso The lake water has a total zzso of zzso zzso and a pH of zzso The cells of strain zzso are zzso or short zzso which reproduce by uniform zzso The cells are zzso by means of zzso The cell wall structure is of the zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso are located close to the cell zzso The new isolate is an zzso zzso and zzso zzso which grows in a pH range of zzso (with an optimum at pH zzso The best growth of strain zzso occurred at zzso zzso zzso and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso are represented by zzso zzso with the maximum zzso at zzso zzso in the in zzso spectrum, and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences demonstrated that strain zzso is closely related to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso % zzso The DNA G + C base content is zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso strain zzso grows well on zzso and zzso and is not capable of utilizing zzso as an energy zzso The new isolate is a zzso zzso and reduces zzso to zzso On the basis of its zzso and genetic zzso strain zzso was described as a new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
