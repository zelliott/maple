The existence of a zzso for salvaging the zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso from the environment was established by genetic and zzso zzso The zzso requires the function of a previously unidentified zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso acid, a bona fide intermediate of the de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso was zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso protein was isolated to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data established zzso as the zzso product of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso blocked the ability of this zzso to salvage zzso zzso function restored zzso salvaging in a strain of the zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso was zzso The salvaging of zzso through the zzso zzso appears to be an zzso strategy because all of the zzso of zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso for the evolution of two distinct pathways for zzso salvaging in zzso are zzso
