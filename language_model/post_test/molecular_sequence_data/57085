When steroid hormone zzso have inappropriate zzso effects, the clinical consequences are zzso zzso zzso bind to two naturally occurring zzso of human zzso receptors zzso zzso and the zzso truncated zzso and usually inhibit zzso zzso It is shown here that zzso of zzso levels in a human breast cancer cell line leads to the functional reversal of zzso zzso zzso While zzso occupied by the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso the zzso receptors become strong zzso of zzso in the presence of zzso However, this functional switch does not occur with the zzso zzso zzso which, unlike zzso and zzso is unable to induce zzso binding to zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso reversal requires that the zzso receptors be bound to zzso Even with zzso zzso addition of zzso results in a synergistic increase in zzso zzso When zzso alone are zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso of a reporter gene is zzso by the zzso zzso and by zzso and is synergistic when both are zzso but the zzso component of zzso proceeds in the absence of zzso in the absence of the zzso response element, and in the presence of a zzso domain zzso of zzso that cannot bind to the zzso response zzso Additionally, under the zzso conditions in which zzso activates zzso complexes, there is no protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso We discuss a model in which a gene that is independently transcribed by zzso factors and by zzso can be selected for positive or negative regulation on the zzso complex due to additive or cooperative interactions between the two zzso zzso
