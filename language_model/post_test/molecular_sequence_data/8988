zzso data indicate that bats harbor diverse zzso some of which cause severe human zzso In this study, zzso amplification and zzso sequencing zzso were applied to the zzso analysis of viruses in bat zzso samples collected from 6 locations in zzso A total of zzso reads with a length of zzso zzso were zzso Among these reads, zzso zzso had similarity to zzso sequences and zzso zzso had similarity to zzso virus zzso A total of 129 assembled zzso zzso zzso were constructed and compared with zzso 32 zzso were related to zzso and 97 were related to zzso zzso The most frequent reads and zzso related to zzso viruses were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a range that includes viruses from zzso zzso and zzso Most of the zzso had low identities to known viral zzso or protein zzso suggesting that a large number of novel and genetically diverse insect viruses as well as putative zzso viruses are transmitted by bats in zzso This study provides the first preliminary understanding of the zzso of some bat populations in China, which may guide the discovery and isolation of novel viruses in the zzso
