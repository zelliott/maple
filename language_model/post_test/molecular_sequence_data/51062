The muscle and heart zzso zzso zzso of rabbit and pig are specifically zzso at a single position by zzso zzso resulting in the conversion of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso and zzso protein bands as analyzed by zzso While the zzso was observed at neutral zzso it became more pronounced at pH zzso and zzso The time courses of the zzso of the zzso zzso were commensurate with the zzso loss of both zzso structure and zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso of rabbit muscle zzso at zzso pH rendered its zzso more susceptible to zzso suggesting that a partially zzso form of the zzso was the actual zzso zzso zzso of the rabbit muscle zzso occurred at a zzso zzso zzso zzso bond zzso throughout by an zzso which constitutes a zzso element in the muscle and heart zzso structures and contains the active site zzso zzso zzso The kinetic parameters zzso zzso and zzso for rabbit muscle zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso were nearly zzso suggesting that the zzso within the protein zzso is zzso mobile, as would be expected for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of part of this zzso sequence into bacterial zzso likewise rendered this protein susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso in zzso revealed that the zzso zzso at the zzso was important to binding to zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso analogue inhibitor derived from this zzso sequence revealed that the zzso structure of the protein zzso must adopt a zzso structure upon binding to the zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso position of the inhibitor likely forms zzso interactions with both the zzso and zzso groups of zzso in the zzso binding zzso
