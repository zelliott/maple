A zzso island consisting of 14 open reading zzso zzso to zzso was previously identified in zzso zzso strain zzso and shown to be essential for zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis of a number of zzso zzso strains from diverse origins showed that this island is zzso zzso and sequence analysis confirmed that many zzso zzso strains carry an zzso version of the island (short zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso To ascertain whether there was a relationship between the inheritance of the short island and specific zzso sequence zzso complete or partial zzso sequences of zzso genes from 24 zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso Two distinct zzso zzso designated A1 and zzso were zzso zzso with the complete zzso island zzso zzso were almost exclusively of the A1 type, whereas strains carrying the short island were associated with both zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso possesses a relatively low number of distinct zzso types and probably has the capacity to further diversify this zzso surface protein by zzso
