zzso zzso in the coding region of the zzso zzso 4 zzso are the most common genetic cause of human obesity described to zzso There are still conflicting data regarding the overall prevalence of such zzso in obesity and limited information is available on the functional defects caused by most zzso zzso zzso We report here the screening for zzso in the coding region of the zzso of a new cohort of zzso patients presenting with severe childhood obesity and a family history of zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in three patients of this cohort zzso confirming that such zzso are implicated in a significant number of childhood obesity zzso A functional analysis of these zzso zzso in addition to 11 other childhood zzso zzso zzso indicates that they all alter the zzso of the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso To further examine the functional defects caused by childhood zzso zzso zzso we developed a novel, sensitive technique to zzso analyze the effect of a zzso on zzso cell surface zzso Using this method we analyzed the cell surface expression of all the 14 described childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso of childhood zzso zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso retention of the zzso This result has implications for the potential zzso rescue of childhood zzso zzso zzso and for the treatment of patients presenting with this zzso
