In response to zzso zzso loss, conservation zzso has established itself as an important branch of zzso Historically concentrating on assessing zzso processes using neutral zzso there has been a recent surge of interest in understanding and zzso variation at zzso underlying ecologically important zzso To this end, patterns of selection and zzso at these zzso must be zzso zzso underlying immunity make good candidates in this zzso they are expected to be important for population persistence and may exhibit diversifying or divergent zzso zzso regarding the pattern of selection expected at immune system zzso have been based on their interactions with zzso however, published studies report mixed results as to whether these are borne out or zzso Here, zzso and selection is examined for three innate immune system zzso in zzso a zzso recognition zzso a putative zzso and scavenger zzso Both zzso and zzso sequence variation is zzso Very little zzso was encountered, zzso robust tests of zzso However, the lack of zzso zzso suggests a lack of positive selection for the regions zzso zzso are discussed with respect to population genetic predictions and generation of a specific immune response in zzso Alternative zzso and methods for studying zzso genetic variation in a conservation context are zzso
