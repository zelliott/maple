Many reports have suggested that zzso zzso hold potential value as detection zzso We show that a zzso zzso is activated similarly by three zzso zzso representing the major sequence zzso of a zzso C virus zzso region zzso target and by a structured zzso corresponding to the entire zzso zzso zzso product was detected both in an zzso zzso and in an optical zzso through the use of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso formats afford a limit of detection of approximately 1 zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso 330 zzso a sensitivity which compares favorably to that provided by standard zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso systems are a viable approach for the sensitive detection of viral zzso acids using zzso zzso
