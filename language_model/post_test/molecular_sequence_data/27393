zzso signaling drives zzso processes in all zzso The zzso binding region of the human zzso zzso zzso is made of a zzso zzso domain and two zzso zzso growth factor zzso repeats zzso by two zzso zzso 5 and 6, which are out of phase with respect to the zzso domain zzso 

We determined the zzso solution structure of the zzso zzso by zzso 6 of zzso and spanning the zzso region of zzso and the entire zzso We show that this single, evolutionary zzso zzso defines an autonomous structural unit that, despite the minimal structural context, closely matches the structure of the same region in the entire zzso binding zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso and domain boundaries usually zzso We report a case study where this assertion does not hold, and show that the autonomously zzso structural unit is zzso by zzso zzso rather than by predicted domain zzso
