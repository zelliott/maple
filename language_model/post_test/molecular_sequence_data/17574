A bovine zzso library was constructed using a zzso zzso zzso and bovine DNA partially zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a probe for screening the zzso zzso Ten clones carrying zzso zzso zzso DNA were isolated from 8 zzso zzso colonies and classified into five groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso according to differences in the restriction zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso acid coding regions of the five clones were determined by the zzso sequencing method using synthetic zzso corresponding to various parts of the zzso as zzso The zzso sequences revealed that three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso acid sequences coded by the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identical with that coded by a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso 104, zzso The promoter regions of the five clones were introduced in front of zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso and used to examine zzso zzso gene regulation in cultured zzso The five zzso plasmids showed zzso zzso activities in zzso cells, a cell strain derived from adrenal zzso The induction rates of the zzso plasmids carrying the promoters of normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were larger than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities expressed by the promoter regions of the normal genes in the presence or absence of zzso in zzso cells were almost equal to that by the promoter region of human zzso zzso Though the promoter of the zzso gene also showed zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, a cell strain derived from zzso cell zzso zzso zzso gene promoter did not express the activity in zzso zzso
