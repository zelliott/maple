A restriction zzso length zzso within the human alpha zzso inhibitor gene has been detected by Southern zzso zzso using an alpha zzso inhibitor zzso zzso This restriction zzso length zzso can be attributed to the presence of two zzso A and B, that are distributed in zzso equilibrium with zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, in 66 unrelated Caucasian individuals or with zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, in 50 unrelated Japanese zzso The minor zzso B, is due to a deletion of about zzso base pairs in zzso 8 of the alpha zzso inhibitor zzso zzso analysis of the deletion junction in zzso B and the corresponding regions of zzso A demonstrated the presence of zzso oriented zzso sequences at the zzso and 3' deletion zzso These data suggest that this restriction zzso length zzso was caused by zzso zzso between zzso zzso
