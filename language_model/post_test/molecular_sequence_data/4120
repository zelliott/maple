zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene occur in patients with both zzso and zzso zzso but the effects of these zzso on expression and function are largely zzso zzso zzso TM complementary DNA zzso was incorporated into zzso zzso for zzso into zzso cells for transient zzso zzso was performed to create 7 TM zzso with natural zzso either previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or reported here (an zzso pair zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Four zzso were found to zzso affect the level of expression of the TM zzso Of the zzso zzso 3 had reduced expression compared to zzso TM zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso No TM protein expression could be detected on the cell surface for zzso zzso The zzso activity of TM in protein C zzso was also zzso The zzso constant zzso for zzso zzso complex was zzso zzso 6 zzso Two zzso with zzso and zzso had increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 283 zzso and zzso zzso 219 zzso respectively, demonstrating impaired function of the zzso zzso This work presents zzso evidence that certain (but not all) natural zzso in the TM gene reduce expression and impair function of the protein on the cell surface, and helps clarify the suggested contribution that these zzso might make to the risk of zzso zzso
