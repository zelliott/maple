zzso gel zzso zzso in conjunction with mass zzso was zzso to unravel the changes in zzso proteins of zzso rice zzso For this purpose, the zzso were dissected at 1 and 2 days after zzso and zzso of mature dry zzso zzso were extracted and their expression patterns were analyzed by zzso zzso A total of zzso silver nitrate stained protein spots were detected on zzso gels, subjected to image analysis using the zzso zzso zzso Platinum software, resulting in the identification of 109 zzso expressed protein spots compared with zzso zzso zzso analysis resulted in the identification of 60 zzso including 6 redundant and 54 zzso zzso The identified proteins were classified according to their functional groups: metabolism (15 zzso zzso (11 zzso protein zzso (8 zzso zzso (5 zzso and energy (3 zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated a good correlation between the zzso expression profile and zzso results for 27 zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis was used to confirm the high expression patterns of zzso zzso b zzso spot zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso spot zzso in the zzso as compared with the zzso of dry zzso Present results suggest that seed zzso is related with multiple regulations of functional zzso For example, proteins related to metabolism zzso zzso and zzso zzso are essential for the energy zzso On the other hand, zzso proteins and zzso related proteins may take part in an important role in adaptation to environmental conditions during seed zzso
