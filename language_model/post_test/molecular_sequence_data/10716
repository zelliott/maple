zzso zzso is normally expressed in zzso and promotes progression through zzso of the cell zzso From a zzso zzso library constructed with zzso DNA, two overlapping zzso clones of zzso zzso were zzso These clones contain most of the zzso of zzso zzso except zzso zzso zzso of these clones revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso spans over 18 zzso and 5 zzso ranging from 149 to approximately zzso zzso in zzso and suggested that zzso 5 may be at least zzso zzso downstream from zzso zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso activated T cells detected 5 putative sites of zzso zzso These are located at - zzso - zzso - zzso - zzso and - zzso relative to the translation start site, which is given as + zzso No consensus sequence for zzso box existed at an appropriate position within the zzso zzso Instead, several putative zzso factor binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso gene up to zzso - 945 shared about zzso sequence zzso between mouse and zzso zzso analysis of promoter activity of the zzso region of zzso zzso suggested that the region - 1,100 to - 805 including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have a major positive regulatory activity for expression of zzso zzso
