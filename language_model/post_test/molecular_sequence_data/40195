In early 2005, several groups of investigators studying zzso zzso described a novel zzso point zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso which plays an important role in normal zzso growth factor zzso The zzso zzso is present in blood and zzso from a large proportion of patients with classic zzso chronic zzso disorders and of a few patients with other zzso zzso diseases such as zzso syndrome, zzso zzso disorders, and acute zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso causes zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso signaling that mimics continuous zzso growth factor zzso Within 7 months of the first electronic publication describing this new zzso clinical molecular diagnostic laboratories in the United States and Europe began offering zzso zzso testing on a zzso zzso Here, I review the various techniques used by research groups and clinical laboratories to detect the genetic zzso underlying zzso zzso including fluorescent dye chemistry sequencing, zzso zzso chain reaction zzso real-time zzso zzso curve analysis, zzso and zzso I also discuss diagnostic sensitivity, performance, and other practical concerns relevant to the clinical zzso in addition to the potential diagnostic utility of zzso zzso zzso
