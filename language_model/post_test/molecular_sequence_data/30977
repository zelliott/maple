Although rise of zzso immunity in the course of zzso B virus zzso infection is generally followed by clearance of the infectious zzso ongoing chronic liver disease with circulating zzso has been repeatedly observed in a significant number of zzso patients, especially in Mediterranean zzso To investigate the possible role of zzso zzso we cloned zzso DNA from the serum of three such zzso zzso Comparative restriction mapping of zzso clones suggested circulation of different zzso zzso in the three zzso DNA sequencing revealed an inactive zzso region in all 11 zzso clones derived from the three cases, either as one or two point zzso in the 3' zzso generating an zzso zzso stop zzso or a 1 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso Furthermore, for one clone the complete zzso zzso sequence was determined and no significant zzso was found in the remainder of the zzso We conclude that chronic zzso cases positive for zzso are associated with zzso zzso containing an inactive zzso region and hence cannot zzso zzso zzso zzso This finding may provide a molecular explanation for the continued viral replication despite presence of zzso zzso
