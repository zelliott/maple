zzso bacteria harboring zzso a class A zzso are resistant to all zzso antibiotics and pose a major public health zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in all class A zzso and is located in the zzso zzso of zzso To probe the role of this zzso acid in zzso we performed zzso zzso When compared with wild type, 11 of 19 zzso at position zzso in zzso zzso increased resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso of zzso as a representative zzso for more detailed analysis, we observed only a modest zzso increase in zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso we determined that zzso is zzso for zzso zzso by zzso whereas zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso at zzso CD zzso revealed that a zzso change occurred in the turnover of zzso by zzso but not the zzso zzso providing evidence for a different form of the zzso at steady zzso zzso models constructed to explain these findings suggest that zzso adopts a unique zzso despite preservation of zzso zzso We propose that the zzso substitution in zzso enhances zzso resistance by proceeding through zzso zzso of the zzso by a zzso impaired zzso with a lower zzso Future zzso design must consider the distinctive behavior of the zzso of zzso
