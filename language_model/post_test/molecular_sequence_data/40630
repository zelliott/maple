A number of zzso have been identified that target the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that these zzso zzso represent a remarkably diverse set of zzso belonging to three zzso families, including zzso and zzso Genome analysis facilitated the further zzso of these zzso and highlighted aspects of their independent zzso zzso a zzso protein domain carrying an zzso zzso was found to be associated with at least one tail fiber gene for all zzso zzso and the presence of this domain was confirmed in representative zzso particles by mass zzso zzso Thus, we provide a simple explanation and paradigm of how a diverse group of zzso target a single key zzso zzso associated with this important zzso zzso
