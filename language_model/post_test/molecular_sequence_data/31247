The sequence of the zzso region of the zzso gene of an influenza virus has been determined without growing the virus in eggs or in cultured zzso The virus used was an zzso strain of influenza A from a clinical zzso taken from a patient in zzso zzso was extracted directly from virus that had been zzso out of the transport medium in which the sample had been zzso DNA copies of the zzso zzso obtained by reverse transcription, were then amplified by the zzso chain reaction and were zzso by the zzso termination zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is highly similar to that of other zzso viruses that had been isolated at about the same time and cultured for a limited number of passages in zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequence of progeny virus from this isolate obtained after one passage in chicken zzso is identical to that of the virus obtained directly from the zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso that have been grown for a limited number of passages in zzso eggs have zzso zzso that faithfully represent the virus population in the clinical samples from which they were zzso
