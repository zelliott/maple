We have recently identified an zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulates the expression of the zzso iron transport gene zzso the outer membrane zzso for the zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso alpha also zzso the expression of zzso which encodes a 35 zzso iron transport protein and has zzso zzso to other zzso transport zzso The expression of zzso and zzso is zzso under zzso conditions, in which zzso alpha is zzso zzso alpha is zzso to two-thirds of the coding region of zzso By cloning zzso alpha coding sequences immediately downstream of a zzso promoter, we were able to obtain zzso expression of the zzso zzso The cloned region contains approximately zzso of the 650 zzso zzso alpha and is complementary to only 51% of the zzso zzso but is still capable of causing a repression of the expression of the zzso zzso Our results in this work demonstrate that zzso alpha probably affects the stability of the zzso zzso
