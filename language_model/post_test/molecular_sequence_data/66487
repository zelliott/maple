Whereas evolutionary zzso derived from zzso DNA sequences are by necessity zzso ancient DNA sequences provide a direct view of past genetic zzso However, base zzso that accumulate in DNA over time may cause zzso zzso when ancient DNA sequences are zzso By repeated zzso of zzso DNA sequences from a large number of ancient wolf remains, we show that zzso transitions are the zzso type of such zzso Using a zzso parallel sequencing method that allows large numbers of single DNA strands to be zzso we show that modifications of C, as well as to a lesser extent of G, zzso cause such zzso zzso where zzso containing modified bases are used as templates in amplification reactions suggest that both of these types of zzso can be caused by zzso of the template zzso New DNA sequencing methods in conjunction with knowledge of zzso processes have now, in principle, opened the way for the determination of complete zzso from organisms that became extinct during and after the last zzso
