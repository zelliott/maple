Recent experiments suggest the existence of a zzso network that functions in parallel to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso network, our understanding of this network is still in its zzso At the center of this network is a zzso protein called zzso hence we have called this network the zzso zzso Like Max, Mix interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso namely the Mad family and the zzso family, zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso targets of these two networks may zzso Supporting this hypothesis, we have observed genetic interactions between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In higher zzso two zzso zzso and zzso constitute the zzso zzso At present little is known about the zzso targets of zzso however, zzso zzso is a putative target of zzso suggesting a function for the zzso family in zzso and/or zzso zzso Finally, unlike the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso family zzso both zzso family members zzso to the zzso zzso while the zzso and zzso families may share some biological functions, it is likely each family is under distinct regulatory zzso
