The zzso attachment of zzso to cellular proteins is zzso by members of a family of zzso zzso These zzso participate in a variety of cellular zzso including selective protein degradation, DNA repair, cell cycle control, and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso two closely related zzso zzso zzso and zzso have recently been shown to mediate the selective degradation of short-lived and abnormal zzso We have now identified a third distinct member of this class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are functionally overlapping and constitute an zzso family essential for cell growth and zzso All three mediate selective protein degradation, however, zzso appears to function primarily in the early stages of growth after zzso of zzso zzso zzso generated by gene disruption display only a moderate slow growth zzso but are markedly impaired in growth following zzso Moreover, zzso carrying the zzso double zzso are viable as zzso cells, however, these cells fail to survive after undergoing zzso and zzso This specific requirement for zzso after a state of zzso suggests that degradation of certain proteins may be crucial at this transition point in the zzso life zzso
