zzso is a protein that associates with the zzso form of zzso a small zzso that controls a late step in zzso zzso zzso is found only in neuroendocrine cells where it zzso with zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding domain zzso 45 to zzso located in the zzso part of zzso includes a zzso region with two zinc finger motifs that are required for efficient interaction with the small zzso To determine whether binding to zzso is necessary for the zzso zzso of zzso we zzso point zzso within the zzso zzso We found that two unique zzso zzso and zzso within an zzso zzso of this region abolish zzso binding to zzso zzso but only partially impair the zzso of the protein to zzso zzso in zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso in the zzso beta cell line stimulate zzso zzso to the same extent as zzso zzso Surprisingly, another zzso zzso zzso which possesses a zzso affinity for zzso and targets efficiently to zzso does not zzso regulated zzso High affinity binding to zzso is therefore zzso for the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and for the zzso of zzso zzso The effects of zzso on zzso may be zzso through interaction with another, unknown, factor that recognizes the zzso binding zzso
