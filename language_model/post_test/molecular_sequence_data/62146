In this report we describe the zzso organization, and promoter analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes and their zzso in response to changes in oxygen concentration and to zzso stress zzso Northern analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were transcribed equally well in zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso stress compounds were found to rapidly induce zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The most pronounced effects were seen with zzso a zzso zzso that promotes zzso bond zzso zzso a zzso cycling zzso and zzso zzso an organic zzso In each case the induction was independent of the general stress zzso factor zzso These studies show that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso following exposure to these zzso stress agents, resulting in increased zzso bond zzso In contrast, no effect of hydrogen zzso on induction of the zzso and zzso genes was zzso We also show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be essential for zzso This zzso coupled with structural differences between the bacterial and zzso zzso zzso suggests that it may serve as a target for the development of new zzso
