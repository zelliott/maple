In order to zzso the zzso regulatory elements in the promoter region of bovine zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the promoter region using zzso zzso zzso gene as the zzso Various deletion plasmids were constructed using the promoter region of zzso zzso which is one of the two normal zzso zzso of the effects of zzso on the zzso activities of mouse adrenal tumor cells zzso zzso zzso with these deletion plasmids suggested that two elements named zzso and zzso play major roles in the induction by zzso zzso is located at zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso is located at zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso resulted in a large decrease of the induction ratio from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is essential for their function, because any zzso introduced into either one of them resulted in a decrease of the zzso induction zzso These two elements are highly zzso among zzso zzso and human zzso zzso genes and have no similarity with known zzso regulatory zzso zzso I footprint analysis indicated that factors which specifically bind to the two elements exist in the nuclear extract of bovine adrenal zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed different patterns in gel shift analysis using zzso which contained zzso or zzso zzso suggesting their interaction with different nuclear zzso We also found two other protected regions by zzso I footprint analysis of the promoter regions of zzso zzso zzso and named them zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
