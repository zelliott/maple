zzso zzso the transport of zzso across the cell membrane control the zzso conditions in which life can zzso Because of the particular arrangement of spanning a zzso zzso and the many zzso required for their function, transport proteins pose significant obstacles for the investigation of their zzso zzso zzso studies, if available, define the zzso segments in a zzso state and do not provide information on the dynamics of the zzso zzso which are similarly evolutionary zzso and thus as functionally important as the other parts of the zzso The current review presents zzso methods that can shed light on the dynamics of zzso in the zzso The techniques that are presented in some detail are zzso recognition atomic force zzso and zzso zzso which can report on the positioning of the zzso and on zzso changes at the outer zzso Studies on a variety of zzso are discussed, which use zzso of sodium or zzso as energy source to zzso zzso zzso zzso against their concentration zzso into or out of the zzso zzso investigations of the zzso zzso zzso are used as examples for this zzso approach to understand zzso zzso
