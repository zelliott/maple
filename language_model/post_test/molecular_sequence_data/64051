To characterize the active domain of the zzso zzso virus zzso surface unit zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso loop of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and examined for zzso activity, zzso structure, and zzso with model zzso zzso and zzso induced a zzso zzso in zzso mouse zzso similar to full-length zzso The peptides mobilized zzso in zzso cells with distinct zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed the peptides were predominantly random zzso in zzso but increased in zzso content when placed in a zzso environment or with zzso membrane zzso that are rich in zzso zzso None of the peptides underwent significant secondary structural changes in the presence of neutral zzso indicating zzso interactions were zzso These data show that the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso in part to the zzso loop region and interacts with zzso membrane zzso on the host cell zzso
