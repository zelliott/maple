zzso zzso by zzso requires crucial zzso embedded in a zzso zzso as sequence motifs zzso However, in some of the recently identified zzso the motif order is zzso zzso All possible circular permutations were identified after artificially zzso the classical zzso and subjecting them to profile Hidden zzso Model zzso This revealed zzso as the only possible circular zzso that can exist in zzso It was also possible to recognize a structural rationale for the absence of other permutations, which either destabilize the zzso zzso fold or disrupt regions that provide critical zzso for zzso binding and zzso such as zzso and zzso The circular zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and leaves it zzso thus affecting zzso binding and zzso zzso this region would require the presence of an additional domain following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conform to such a requirement and always possess an zzso zzso zzso There are four zzso of zzso of which three possess an additional domain zzso to the zzso The zzso function of these zzso based on available experimental reports and domain recognition analysis carried out here, are suggestive of zzso zzso The features that dictate zzso binding are unique to each zzso It is possible that zzso zzso zzso binding or vice zzso In addition, zzso analysis indicates a closer evolutionary relationship between zzso and a set of universally zzso bacterial zzso that bind the zzso It appears that zzso are zzso proteins possessing a means to relate zzso binding to zzso zzso
