Land plants contain a large family of genes that zzso for zzso zzso zzso To date, few of these zzso proteins have been functionally zzso In this study, we have analyzed an zzso zzso zzso which exhibits slow growth and delayed zzso In addition, zzso shows an enhanced response to zzso and increased tolerance to drought zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that is localized in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso editing in a single site of the zzso transcript zzso is zzso zzso is a zzso of complex I of the electron transport chain in zzso As a consequence, the zzso zzso activity of complex I in zzso is strongly impaired and production of zzso is zzso When responding to zzso treatment, zzso accumulates more zzso zzso in its guard cells than the wild zzso The zzso zzso also has an increased expression of genes involved in the alternative respiratory pathway, which may compensate for the disrupted function of complex I and help zzso the excess zzso of zzso zzso Our functional characterization of the zzso zzso revealed a putative link between zzso zzso editing and plant responses to zzso zzso
