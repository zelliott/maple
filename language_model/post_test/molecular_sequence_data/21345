In order to investigated composition and diversity of bacterial in a cold sulfur spring in Xinjiang zzso zzso 

Environmental total DNA was directly extracted from the water of the zzso 10 cold sulfur zzso The zzso zzso genes were amplified from the total DNA by zzso with zzso zzso and construction a clone zzso Positive clones were randomly selected from the library and identified by restriction zzso length zzso zzso The unique zzso pattern corresponded sequences were zzso zzso and then constructed zzso zzso 

In total, zzso positive clones were screened and grouped into 33 zzso zzso Units zzso The clone coverage C value was zzso 33 zzso zzso Units were divided into 3 zzso with zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the absolutely dominant group, of which zzso of the clones were highly related to the known zzso and zzso bacteria ( zzso zzso sequence zzso Besides, zzso of the clones showed less than zzso of sequence similarity with sequence deposited in zzso database, of them zzso sequences were affiliated to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso diversity in zzso 10 cold sulfur spring was low, but maybe have a diversity of novel species and zzso In addition, large number of novel species of zzso were detected in the spring water may suggest the water potentially a source of zzso disease and may constitute a menace to the health of human and livestock that lived down the zzso
