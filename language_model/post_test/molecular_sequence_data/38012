Three new zzso strains were isolated from zzso By zzso profiling they were recognized as zzso different from each zzso zzso of the genes for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of total DNA against DNA of all type strains of zzso identified zzso strains zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso strain zzso as zzso zzso In contrast to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not require zzso acid for growth and can be successfully transferred between media with and without zzso zzso This zzso characteristic enables convenient handling of both strains in genetic zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was used as the basis for shuttle zzso construction with the aim of developing an efficient zzso system for these zzso The entire zzso sequence of zzso was zzso High zzso acid identities were found for three open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso damage zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of the entire zzso zzso and the entire zzso zzso was successfully used in transformation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed from zzso with the aim of zzso the zzso zzso
