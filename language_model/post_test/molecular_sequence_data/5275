A new procedure is described for the zzso of zzso hormones zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso rainbow zzso The procedure zzso immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso zzso on a column containing immobilized zzso acid zzso zzso zzso charged with zzso zzso as a critical step for the efficient separation of zzso I and zzso zzso Further zzso of both zzso zzso on zzso Blue zzso immobilized on zzso was followed by zzso zzso for zzso zzso The resulting zzso homogeneous preparations possessed a characteristic range of biological activity in the stimulation of zzso in zzso zzso sequences of the zzso I and zzso II zzso zzso using zzso zzso revealed a high level of zzso with those of zzso zzso found in three other zzso fish zzso In contrast to salmon zzso II, two different zzso were observed in trout zzso zzso The zzso between zzso I and zzso II was studied in zzso using zzso against zzso salmon zzso II zzso and rainbow trout zzso I zzso
