The interactions of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso trigger a barrage of zzso changes in zzso that drive the membrane fusion zzso Various regions of zzso have profound effects on zzso entry and zzso However, the precise interactions between zzso and the membrane have not been zzso To examine portions of membrane proteins that are embedded in membrane zzso we have studied zzso chemical reactions in zzso using the zzso zzso specific probe zzso zzso zzso Here we show that in addition to the zzso anchor, zzso sequences in the zzso tail zzso of zzso zzso are labeled by zzso zzso labeling of the zzso zzso CT was similar whether zzso or a zzso zzso was used with zzso zzso zzso which does not allow zzso These results shed light on the disposition of the zzso zzso CT with respect to the zzso Moreover, our data have general implications for zzso of membrane proteins and their in zzso interactions with the zzso zzso
