zzso binds to promoter elements governing zzso silk zzso expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso We zzso zzso and showed that zzso contains at least four gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and the silk protein zzso zzso Using zzso of these factors in zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso as a zzso complex that bound to the zzso sequence in zzso zzso interacts with zzso as well as zzso through the zzso regions to mediate zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene in the middle silk zzso where zzso and zzso are zzso Taken together, this study demonstrates that zzso is a zzso zzso complex containing zzso Moreover, our results suggest that the zzso protein complex serves as a scaffold to facilitate communication between zzso control zzso
