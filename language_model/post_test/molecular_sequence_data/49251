zzso are an excellent genetic model system for studying zzso and zzso zzso zzso patterns in zzso are affected by zzso in three types of zzso The behavior of these cells is influenced by zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso have five zzso receptors zzso zzso and one or two zzso zzso We have identified the full complement of zzso and zzso receptors in both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have six zzso zzso including two zzso zzso while zzso lacking zzso has only zzso We also demonstrate that zzso and zzso have two and three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are physically linked in all species zzso Unlike other species, we find the zzso genes contain zzso one of which is in a zzso location and is probably zzso We also detail the differential expression of the zzso genes throughout zzso
