An zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso of IS circles containing a 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso or deletion of 25 zzso at the left zzso repeat zzso between the zzso IS ends of the zzso junction region zzso zzso was also discovered in the zzso and zzso coli system zzso We found that the promoter formed by the complete junction zzso was more active than that formed by the 25 zzso deleted junction zzso or the indigenous promoter zzso The corresponding zzso start sites for both promoter zzso and zzso as well as zzso were subsequently determined using a primer extension zzso The activity of zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso using an in zzso zzso It was found that this zzso preferred to cleave a single DNA strand at the zzso over the zzso end in the zzso process, suggesting that attack of one end by the other was oriented from zzso to zzso
