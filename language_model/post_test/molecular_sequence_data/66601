The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso an environmental zzso known to have zzso activity, on zzso zzso Juvenile and adult physiology was monitored by the expression of zzso zzso which is commonly induced by zzso pollutants, and zzso zzso as a first signal of zzso The zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso 100, 1000 zzso on zzso zzso transcript and plasma protein levels, as well as on zzso zzso and its associated zzso zzso zzso activity, were assessed in juvenile zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso treatment for 1 week served as positive zzso In addition, we investigated zzso and zzso expression in adult males injected with two zzso at zzso or 250 zzso body weight relative to zzso zzso of zzso as a positive zzso Juvenile exposure to zzso failed to induce a measurable zzso zzso In the adult fish, zzso exerted zzso effects only at the highest dose zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso induction only in adults in a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment induced a zzso decrease in zzso response in both juveniles and zzso An zzso effect of zzso on zzso was evident in all treatment groups as zzso These data suggest that, in zzso studies, testing the expression of different zzso may provide a more realistic picture of the environmental zzso
