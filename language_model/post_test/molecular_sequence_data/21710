zzso are ubiquitous zzso that can zzso zzso in response to various zzso In the present study, full-length zzso of two zzso genes were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are zzso and zzso in length with zzso of 675 and zzso zzso 225 and 156 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso domain in zzso and a zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso while zzso expression of zzso is zzso Although their expression zzso in a wide range of zzso zzso zzso expression is high in zzso while zzso is strong in zzso zzso After infection by zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 5 fold zzso at zzso but returned to normal level zzso zzso The expression of zzso gene showed a slight delay to the infection challenge and was elevated roughly 4 fold after zzso zzso returning to normal at zzso zzso The elevated transcript levels of the two zzso genes in response to zzso infection highlights their important functions in eliminating toxic zzso oxygen species zzso and protecting organisms from bacterial invasion in zzso
