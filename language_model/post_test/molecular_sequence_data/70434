We surveyed human zzso virus zzso zzso distribution from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso collected in 1995 from 24 zzso Kenyan residents zzso from predominantly male truck drivers and female sex workers near zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso samples were used for zzso amplification, directly zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso zzso amplification products were also used for analysis in a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso called the zzso melting zzso zzso zzso of the two tests were compared for assignment of zzso for this Kenyan zzso The zzso a zzso capture technique with zzso signal zzso was used with zzso reference zzso strains as well as regional (East zzso zzso strains for zzso zzso Performance of the zzso was at zzso zzso (24 of 24) as compared with DNA sequencing zzso zzso analysis showed 17 zzso to be zzso A, 3 zzso D, and 4 zzso C zzso This may represent an increase in zzso C presence in Kenya compared with previously documented zzso The zzso can offer advantages for rapid zzso zzso screening of large zzso with the use of previously identified regional strains to enhance the identification of local zzso When more detailed genetic information is zzso DNA sequencing and analysis may be zzso
