Gas zzso are zzso microbial zzso devices that consist of mainly one zzso zzso The formation of zzso gas zzso occurs along a complex zzso involving 14 different zzso genes that are clustered in a zzso region termed the zzso zzso Various zzso regions found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Except for the latter zzso region, the arrangement of the zzso genes is zzso Single zzso genes have been zzso to study the effect on gas zzso synthesis in zzso and to determine their possible zzso Each zzso region exhibits a characteristic zzso pattern, and regulatory steps have been observed at the DNA, zzso and protein level, indicating a complex regulatory network acting during gas zzso gene zzso
