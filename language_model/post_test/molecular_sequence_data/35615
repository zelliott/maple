In zzso zzso is costly and zzso and presents a major bottleneck in zzso drug zzso Conventional methods rely on the zzso of bacterial zzso and it can take up to 4 weeks for zzso tuberculosis to grow on zzso zzso Light produced by zzso bacteria expressing zzso zzso can be used as a marker of bacterial load, and disease progression can be easily followed zzso in live animals by using the appropriate imaging zzso The objective of this work was to develop a zzso mouse model of tuberculosis to assess zzso efficacy against zzso tuberculosis in zzso 

We used an zzso tuberculosis strain carrying a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso to zzso mice, and monitored disease progression in living animals by zzso imaging before and after treatment with the frontline zzso drug zzso The resulting images were zzso and the zzso was correlated with bacterial zzso 

Using zzso imaging we detected as few as zzso and zzso reporter bacteria ex zzso and in zzso respectively, in the lungs of zzso A good correlation was found between zzso and bacterial load in both zzso Furthermore, a marked reduction in zzso was observed in living mice given zzso zzso 

We have shown that an improved zzso strain of zzso tuberculosis can be zzso by zzso imaging in live mice during an zzso progressive infection and that this technique can be used to rapidly zzso and zzso the effect of zzso zzso We believe that the model presented here will be of great benefit in early drug discovery as an easy and rapid way to identify active compounds in zzso
