The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso (representing zzso of the total zzso with an average gap size of 100 zzso and zzso coverage, are reported, giving insights into the zzso of zzso zzso Genome analysis and zzso studies enabled us to reconstruct its central zzso zzso zzso zzso uses a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and two different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso for zzso zzso For the zzso zzso some new, unexpected zzso were zzso The zzso zzso pathway, zzso supposed to be active only in zzso is found in zzso zzso No evidence for a functional zzso zzso pathway, which is essential for the generation of zzso and zzso for anabolic purposes in bacteria and zzso is found in zzso zzso Most genes involved in the zzso zzso acid cycle were identified, suggesting the presence of a functional zzso cycle under zzso growth conditions and a reductive cycle for CO2 fixation under zzso growth zzso Almost all genes necessary for zzso and zzso metabolism were identified in the zzso zzso zzso
