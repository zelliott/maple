zzso zzso virus zzso establishes zzso in sensory zzso following primary infection zzso and may reactivate decades later to produce zzso zzso The presence of zzso DNA in zzso infected zzso has been demonstrated by Southern zzso zzso as well as by zzso chain reaction of DNA extracted from zzso infected zzso zzso results have been obtained by in zzso zzso studies to determine the cell type in the zzso harboring the zzso zzso To address this controversy we have zzso a more sensitive method than the previous zzso We have applied the technique of zzso chain reaction to sections of zzso from zzso infected individuals and combined this with in zzso zzso to detect the amplified zzso zzso specific for zzso were used to amplify zzso DNA in zzso infected human zzso zzso and demonstrated the presence of zzso DNA in zzso zzso Sections from human kidney and zzso from zzso as well as monkey zzso served as controls and did not show amplification of zzso zzso zzso using zzso for human zzso alpha zzso and the zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of these sequences in nearly all cells in the human zzso while only weak signals were seen in the monkey zzso This is the first report where in zzso amplification has been zzso to detect zzso zzso in human zzso
