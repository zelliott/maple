Comparative sequence analysis has successfully predicted secondary structure and zzso interactions in zzso and other zzso zzso presented here ask whether the scope of comparative zzso predictions can be extended to specific interactions between proteins and zzso using as a system the zzso zzso zzso binding domain of zzso protein zzso zzso and its 58 zzso binding region in zzso zzso The surface of zzso zzso 3 is known to contact zzso position 69 in this zzso is zzso as zzso in most organisms but varies to zzso (all zzso or zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso unique to these groups of organisms occur at base pairs zzso or zzso zzso The possibility that zzso base pair zzso compensate for zzso in zzso zzso 3 has been tested by measuring binding affinities between sets of protein and zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso structure, as measured by zzso melting experiments, was unexpectedly affected by a zzso base pair zzso additional zzso were required to restore a zzso folded structure to this zzso The results show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 69 has been compensated by substitution of a zzso base pair, and zzso suggest a direct contact between the zzso acid and base zzso For some of the protein and zzso zzso zzso changes in binding affinity probably reflect zzso adjustments of the zzso contact zzso
