Alternative zzso of precursor zzso is often regulated by zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and varying their concentration in the nucleus can be a mechanism for controlling zzso site zzso To understand the zzso transport mechanism of zzso regulators is of key zzso zzso proteins are delivered to the nucleus by zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso Here we identify and characterize a zzso zzso zzso motif protein 4 zzso as a novel zzso of zzso zzso interacts specifically with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso indeed mediates the nuclear import of a zzso protein containing the zzso zzso zzso This domain serves as a signal for both nuclear import and export, and for nuclear zzso zzso Finally, both in zzso and in zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso not only zzso alternative zzso zzso but also acts zzso to authentic zzso proteins in zzso site and zzso zzso Thus, a novel zzso regulator with opposite activities to zzso proteins shares an identical import zzso with zzso proteins to the zzso
