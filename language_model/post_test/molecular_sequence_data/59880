zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulate insulin and zzso release from the zzso and evoke insulin zzso from the rat zzso cell line, zzso To determine which zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells, we used zzso with zzso zzso to two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso and OT receptors zzso The single zzso zzso identified was used to obtain a full length zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of this clone with zzso zzso sequences from several species zzso zzso zzso and to the pig kidney zzso cell zzso zzso reveals a very high degree of zzso After the zzso cell zzso zzso was zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso the cell zzso bound zzso zzso zzso with an apparent zzso comparable to that of zzso cell zzso and those from other OT target zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells zzso showed that the relative Ki values of a series of OT zzso were approximately equivalent in both zzso The rank order of apparent Ki values also corresponded to published values for the rat zzso where OT elicits zzso calcium zzso and increases zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells, OT stimulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with OT caused an increase in zzso calcium concentration originating from both zzso and zzso sources, and a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid release and zzso synthesis were also zzso by zzso These findings zzso acid sequence zzso binding zzso and signal zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso from zzso cells are indistinguishable from zzso that have been described in other zzso The expression of zzso in pancreatic cells implies that OT plays a role in pancreatic zzso
