zzso is a zzso zzso that is found on the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso contains high levels of terminal Gal zzso zzso Thus, magnetic zzso with immobilized zzso can be used as affinity zzso for zzso zzso functioning via the recognition of zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso onto the surface of zzso magnetic iron zzso zzso via zzso zzso We then used the generated zzso to probe target bacteria from complex zzso The trapped bacterial cells were characterized based on their mass peak profiles obtained from zzso zzso zzso In addition, we confirmed the determination of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso combining the zzso zzso zzso zzso of its zzso digest with protein database zzso The feasibility of using this approach to rapidly characterize zzso zzso from clinical samples without the need to perform zzso steps was also zzso
