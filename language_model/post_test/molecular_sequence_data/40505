Human zzso zzso type 16 is the most significant type in the zzso vaccine field because zzso of cervical cancer cases are caused by infection with zzso type zzso The zzso zzso which is the highly zzso major zzso protein of zzso is the major component of the zzso zzso To enhance zzso protein expression in zzso zzso we used a strategy involving the modification of the zzso zzso gene zzso to reduce the amount of predicted zzso secondary structure, rather than a strategy aiming at zzso zzso bias as has often been used to enhance the expression of foreign zzso The mean expression level of zzso protein in zzso candidates was zzso higher than in cells transformed with the wild type zzso zzso gene zzso while the fraction of zzso zzso transcribed from zzso in total zzso was zzso lower than with zzso zzso transcribed from zzso This demonstrates that zzso protein expression in zzso cells was increased by a zzso zzso The zzso protein produced in zzso cells zzso into zzso particles zzso with features similar to those of the native zzso These results indicate that the strategy of zzso the secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso was successful in increasing zzso protein expression in zzso zzso
