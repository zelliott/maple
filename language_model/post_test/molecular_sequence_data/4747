The tendency for gastric zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso around zzso zzso zzso both in the zzso and regional zzso zzso coupled with their zzso has led to the proposal that the normal cell counterpart of this zzso is the marginal zone B zzso In keeping with this proposition, zzso expressing the zzso zzso have been detected in the zzso marginal zone in a single case of gastric zzso zzso To confirm that this truly represented preferential zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso marginal zone, we have now zzso this case, together with 17 other cases, using both zzso and molecular methods in an attempt to establish zzso identity between the gastric zzso and cells in the zzso marginal zzso In three cases, the zzso was characterized by marked expansion of marginal zones by cells showing the same pattern of zzso light chain restriction as the gastric zzso None of the remaining 15 cases showed zzso evidence of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso genes by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and sequencing confirmed zzso identity between the zzso marginal zone infiltrates and the gastric zzso in the zzso involved zzso zzso DNA could be extracted from only 5 of the remaining 15 zzso In 3 of these cases, including the case previously studied using an zzso involvement of the zzso marginal zone could be confirmed using zzso and zzso zzso No involvement could be detected in the remaining 2 zzso In addition, we have shown that zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the primary zzso zzso of zzso for zzso was strongly expressed by the zzso lining cells of the zzso marginal zzso These results provide strong evidence for preferential involvement of the marginal zone when gastric zzso zzso zzso to the zzso which is in keeping with the notion that the marginal zone B cells are the normal counterparts of zzso zzso zzso
