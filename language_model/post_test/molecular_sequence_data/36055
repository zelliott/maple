We have isolated and characterized the gene zzso the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso with seven putative zzso zzso The gene exists as a single copy of the bovine zzso and extends over 36 zzso The coding region is divided into seven zzso separated by six zzso the first zzso encodes the first and second zzso zzso and each of the following zzso zzso is zzso by a separate zzso The zzso region of the transcript was examined by the zzso protection zzso multiple start sites were deduced with no apparent zzso box in the expected upstream zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated a widespread but zzso distribution of the zzso zzso in bovine zzso
