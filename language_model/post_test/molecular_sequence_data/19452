zzso disease is an zzso disorder triggered by zzso of wheat zzso and related proteins in genetically susceptible zzso In addition to the characteristic zzso zzso disease is associated with various zzso manifestations, including zzso complications such as zzso zzso seizures, and zzso zzso The cause of the zzso manifestations is unknown, but zzso resulting from molecular mimicry between zzso and nervous system proteins has been proposed to play a zzso In this study, we sought to investigate the immune zzso of the zzso zzso response toward neural zzso We characterized the binding of zzso zzso zzso from zzso animals to brain proteins by one- and two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso The major zzso protein was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso disease also bound to the zzso Such zzso may provide clues into the zzso mechanism of the zzso deficits that are associated with zzso zzso
