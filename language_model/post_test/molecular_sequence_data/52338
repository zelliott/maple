Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso we confirmed the identity of normal rat kidney zzso zzso zzso major zzso as zzso zzso We then zzso a zzso pair zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso library prepared from Kirsten zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso using rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this zzso revealed the presence of a zzso insert in the zzso region, which was absent in zzso zzso cloned from the zzso library of zzso zzso rat zzso zzso The insert sequence is flanked by putative zzso zzso junctions and is located zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso An zzso zzso zzso probe zzso to a single zzso zzso species from both zzso and zzso cells, but not from zzso zzso zzso However, Southern analysis showed the presence of this insert sequence in the zzso DNA of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso amplification of the zzso region using zzso zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso cells gave products of identical size and zzso Since zzso is a single copy zzso these data provide strong evidence for differential cell zzso processing of zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that, in contrast to most transformed cells, levels of zzso expression are significantly reduced in zzso cells as compared to zzso zzso
