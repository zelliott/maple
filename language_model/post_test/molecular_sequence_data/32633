The advances made in statistical methods to detect selection from DNA sequence variation has resulted in an enormous increase in the number of studies reporting positive zzso However, a disadvantage of such statistical tests is that often no insight into the actual source of selection is zzso zzso understanding of evolution can be obtained when those statistical tests are combined with field observations on zzso zzso We assessed whether the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso which codes for a zzso zzso is subject to selection, by investigating zzso and zzso zzso among European zzso and reference zzso Eight highly divergent zzso were resolved in Northwest zzso At the zzso level, a total of 51 zzso sites (five of them zzso zzso zzso were zzso Although statistical tests applied to the sequences alone showed no indication of selection, a zzso rejected the zzso hypothesis that zzso are zzso distributed over zzso and reference zzso Analysis of molecular zzso assigned a small, but significant amount of the total zzso to differences between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, it was shown that zzso populations tend to be more genetically diversified at this locus than zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene and its surrounding DNA region are affected by environmental metal zzso This study illustrates that, in addition to statistical tests, field observations on zzso zzso are needed to gain understanding of selection and zzso zzso
