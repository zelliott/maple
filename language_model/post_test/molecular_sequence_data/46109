The development of zzso zzso zzso has provided great hope for therapeutic targeting of specific genes responsible for pathological zzso However, the poor cellular zzso of zzso together with the low zzso of the cell membrane to zzso charged zzso remain major obstacles to clinical zzso So far there is no universal method for zzso delivery as they all present several zzso Several zzso strategies have been proposed to improve the delivery of synthetic zzso in both cultured cells and in zzso zzso peptides zzso or protein zzso zzso zzso constitute very promising tools for zzso cellular import of zzso and zzso zzso strategies have been successfully applied for ex zzso and in zzso delivery of therapeutic zzso zzso We recently described a new zzso system, zzso for efficient delivery of zzso in both primary and suspension cell zzso zzso is a secondary zzso zzso able to form stable zzso complexes with zzso and to improve their cellular zzso independently of the zzso zzso This chapter describes easy to handle protocols for the use of the zzso technology for the delivery of zzso into both adherent and suspension cell zzso It will also highlight different critical points in the zzso complex preparation and zzso zzso in order to obtain zzso interfering response at low zzso zzso
