The most common form of systemic zzso originates from zzso light zzso The large number of zzso acid variations that distinguish zzso from zzso light chain proteins has zzso our understanding of the structural basis of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, even among the subset of human light chains that are zzso many primary structure differences are zzso We compared the zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso variable zzso zzso derived from zzso light chains with a zzso from a benign light zzso The zzso zzso were significantly less stable than the benign zzso Furthermore, only the zzso zzso formed zzso under native conditions in an in zzso zzso formation zzso We used zzso zzso to examine the consequences of individual zzso acid zzso found in the zzso zzso on stability and zzso formation zzso Both stabilizing and zzso zzso were zzso however, only zzso zzso induced zzso formation in zzso We found that zzso formation by the benign zzso could be induced by low zzso of a zzso This indicates that there are no structural or zzso features of the benign zzso that are incompatible with zzso formation, other than its greater zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso structure is vulnerable to zzso zzso at a number of sites, including zzso determining regions zzso and that loss of variable domain stability is a major driving force in zzso zzso
