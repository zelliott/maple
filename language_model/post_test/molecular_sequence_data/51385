A new zzso for simulation of two-dimensional zzso zzso of DNA segments has been zzso For any given structure, zzso zzso are calculated using the relaxation zzso approach and a new realistic procedure is suggested for zzso comparison of calculated and experimental zzso The procedure involves a novel method for zzso of calculated zzso zzso to represent volumes of zzso cross zzso in zzso zzso A data base of fine structures of all the relevant cross zzso with zzso line shapes and zzso zzso is generated in a zzso manner by two-dimensional zzso transformation of simulated time domain data, assuming a total intensity of zzso for each of the cross zzso With this zzso it is shown that the integrated volumes of these zzso cross zzso above any given threshold scale exactly as the total intensity of the respective zzso This procedure eliminates the repetitive generation of zzso cross zzso by two-dimensional zzso transformation during the zzso process of structure zzso and zzso intensity calculation and thus enhances the speed of DNA structure zzso zzso fits of experimental and calculated zzso obtained using the new procedure are zzso
