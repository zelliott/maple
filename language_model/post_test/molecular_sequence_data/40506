zzso is an zzso zzso that can be reduced at either of two zzso groups to form zzso zzso We describe here two efficient and previously zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which reduces zzso exclusively at the zzso position, and zzso from zzso zzso which zzso reduces the zzso zzso zzso these novel zzso together with three previously characterized zzso we demonstrate that the zzso coli zzso zzso can zzso detect the zzso versus zzso reduction products of zzso following deletion of the zzso zzso repair gene zzso but not mismatch repair zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings may hold significance for identification and selection of zzso for zzso gene therapy, particularly when targeting tumors that are deficient in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that comparative zzso zzso analysis in wild type and zzso zzso strains can be used to determine whether or not zzso zzso repair plays a significant role in processing DNA damage resulting from zzso of different zzso zzso
