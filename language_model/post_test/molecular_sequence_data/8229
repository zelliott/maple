The zzso 28 zzso acids of rabbit zzso zzso zzso are markedly different from those of other rabbit zzso zzso zzso family members and, substitution of the equivalent zzso acids of other zzso zzso can zzso novel steroid zzso activity to zzso zzso while the normal zzso acid zzso activity is zzso To determine the basis for the novel steroid zzso activity, zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso were zzso for those of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were expressed in zzso zzso There are 13 differences between the sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this region, including five zzso exchanges of charged and zzso zzso zzso However, only substitution of zzso for zzso increased steroid zzso activity to the maximum level expected in a modified zzso zzso zzso which contained additional zzso in the zzso region to maximize zzso zzso zzso Introduction of this single substitution into zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso activity similar to that resulting from substitution of all 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso with one exception, substantially affected either zzso acid zzso activity or the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso that was zzso A zzso substitution for zzso reduced activity of both zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso and altered the zzso of the zzso for zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso bacterial zzso zzso indicated that the side chains of zzso zzso and the other five zzso previously shown to affect zzso specificity face the zzso zzso For four of the six zzso smaller and more zzso zzso increased zzso relative to zzso acid zzso
