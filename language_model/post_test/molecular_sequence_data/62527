The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli DNA zzso III form a zzso that is associated with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso coli, the zzso zzso serves as a bridge between the zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso We determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso at zzso A zzso Although neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso the fold of each protein is similar to the folds of zzso or zzso binding zzso without marked similarity to the structures of the zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso and zzso proteins are found to be readily identifiable in several bacterial zzso and sequence alignments showed that zzso at the zzso interface are highly zzso in both zzso suggesting that the zzso interaction is of functional zzso The conservation of zzso zzso is restricted to the zzso region and to just two other regions in the zzso zzso One of the zzso regions was found to be located on zzso zzso to the zzso interaction region, and we identified this as the binding site for a zzso segment of the zzso zzso zzso The other region of sequence conservation is localized to an zzso segment of zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in the crystal zzso We speculate that zzso is linked to the zzso complex by this flexible, but zzso zzso segment, and that the zzso unit is linked to the zzso zzso protein via the zzso surface of zzso The base of the zzso complex has an open zzso structure, and the shape of the zzso complex is suggestive of a loose zzso within the zzso formed by the open faces of the delta and zzso zzso of the zzso
