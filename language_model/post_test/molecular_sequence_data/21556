zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso of the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso Each zzso consists of two structural zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso or a clip domain zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso are connected with a zzso zzso The knowledge about the structure and function of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is limited mainly to their zzso acid zzso We constructed 3-D models of the two zzso using their zzso acid sequences and zzso coordinates of related zzso The models of the zzso zzso were built using the structure of the zzso factor zzso as a zzso For zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain the coordinates of zzso zzso zzso were zzso The models revealed the zzso and zzso sites and the zzso charged zzso responsible for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso sites in the two zzso were predicted using the models and programs based on the structure of known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show structural and functional similarity to the members of the zzso zzso Most probably, they are part of the zzso system of zzso zzso
