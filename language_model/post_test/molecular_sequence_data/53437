zzso zzso forma zzso zzso has a unique locus called the zzso which controls surface zzso variation by acting as the expression site for a family of genes zzso zzso of the major surface zzso zzso Every zzso zzso begins with 380 zzso copied from the zzso zzso This zzso leader sequence is necessary for initiation of translation and for protein zzso Given the zzso importance in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was of interest to examine the zzso locus in the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The first 380 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were 59% identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the DNA zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not unique in the zzso Instead, only the first 97 zzso came from a unique locus and the remainder from zzso zzso These data suggest that the two organisms may use different mechanisms to generate surface zzso
