zzso factor zzso is a zzso protein that was first identified as a member of the zzso zzso signaling complex, but later found to be involved in various biological zzso Although the exact mechanisms are not clear, zzso seems to play an important role in cancer, zzso zzso and Parkinson's zzso It interacts with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in addition to the proteins of the zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso and examined its interaction with zzso and zzso proteins using nuclear magnetic zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso bundle that selectively binds to zzso and zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso modifier 1) or zzso zzso precursor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso involves zzso interaction accompanied by a transition in the zzso zzso These results provide structural insight into the mechanism of zzso recognition by zzso
