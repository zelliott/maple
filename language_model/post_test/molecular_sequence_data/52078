The zzso and pharmacological properties that result from zzso bond reduction as well as the use of secondary zzso acids in a series of zzso peptides related to the zzso zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso that contain zzso and zzso zzso bonds (in primary and secondary zzso zzso zzso were zzso on a solid zzso zzso of zzso in IV by the zzso secondary zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and of zzso with zzso gave peptides 4 and 1, zzso Both zzso displayed reduced affinities for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on extensive zzso investigations demonstrated that the backbone zzso of 1 and 4 are similar to those of the potent and selective analogue zzso zzso while the zzso properties of the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in topographical properties that were not well recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso bond modifications were made including zzso 3; zzso 2; and zzso zzso These zzso showed decreases in their zzso zzso zzso affinities relative to the parent compounds IV, 1, and 4, zzso zzso zzso based zzso analysis in conjunction with zzso binding data led to the conclusion that the reduced zzso bonds in 2, 3, 5, and 6 do not contribute to the process of discrimination between zzso and delta zzso zzso and in spite of their different dynamic behaviors zzso to 1 and zzso they are still capable of attaining similar zzso bound zzso possibly due to their increased zzso
