zzso plasmids for expression of bovine zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma 1), zzso zzso fused zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso and zzso zzso fused zzso zzso gamma 1 and zzso gamma 2) were constructed by using expression zzso zzso The plasmids were each introduced into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains zzso gamma 2 zzso and zzso gamma 1 zzso produced 2-3 X zzso molecules of zzso per zzso The cultures of both strains converted zzso and 17 zzso into zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity per cell of the strain zzso was about three times higher than that of the strain zzso probably due to overproduction of zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso zzso produced about zzso X zzso molecules per cell of the corresponding zzso zzso fused zzso The specific zzso activity toward 17 zzso per cell of the strains zzso zzso and zzso was about 21, 28, and 49 times higher than that of the strain zzso zzso Thus, the fused zzso were superior to zzso in the specific activity and in the expression level in the zzso The zzso values for 17 zzso of zzso in the strains zzso and zzso and of the fused zzso in the strains zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso in the strains zzso and zzso and of the fused zzso in the strains zzso and zzso were 28, zzso zzso and 222 zzso zzso or fused zzso zzso These results indicated that the fused zzso showed lower affinity for the zzso probably due to structural modification and higher reaction rates through efficient zzso electron transfer as compared with those of zzso While the strain zzso gamma 2 zzso produced about 3 X zzso molecules per cell of the zzso fused zzso the specific zzso activity of the fused zzso toward 17 zzso was extremely low, suggesting that the structure of the fused zzso might not be suited for electron transfer in zzso zzso
