zzso zzso tumors zzso the most common zzso tumors of the zzso zzso are believed to arise from the zzso cells of zzso zzso are characterized by zzso in the zzso zzso that lead to zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso active against the zzso fusion protein in chronic zzso zzso was recently shown to be highly effective in zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to define the expression patterns of 13 zzso zzso zzso and compared them with the expression profiles of a group of zzso cell tumors from locations outside the gastrointestinal zzso Our results showed a remarkably distinct and uniform expression profile for all of the zzso In particular, zzso zzso of a subset of 113 zzso placed all of the zzso samples into one branch, with a zzso correlation zzso This zzso suggests that the molecular zzso of a zzso results from expansion of a clone that has acquired an zzso zzso in zzso without the extreme genetic instability found in the common zzso zzso The results provide insight into the zzso of zzso and the clinical behavior of this zzso responsive zzso
