The zzso zzso zzso shape zzso zzso produces a single zzso instead of the two zzso seen in zzso zzso Cellular anatomy and patterns of marker gene expression indicate that the single zzso results from zzso fusion of the two zzso of the wild zzso Isolation of the ATS locus showed it to zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of putative zzso factors, previously referred to as zzso ATS was expressed at the border between the two zzso at the time of their zzso with expression later confined to the zzso layer of the inner zzso In an inner no outer zzso zzso background, where an outer zzso does not form, the zzso zzso led to zzso inner zzso zzso The zzso double zzso exhibits a similar zzso growth of the outer zzso without affecting inner zzso zzso We zzso that ATS and zzso play similar roles in the zzso of polarity in the inner and outer zzso respectively, that parallel the known roles of zzso proteins in promoting zzso identity during leaf zzso zzso and other members of the zzso gene family have been hypothesized to have similar parallel roles in outer zzso and leaf zzso Together, these two hypotheses lead us to propose a model for normal zzso growth that also explains the described zzso zzso
