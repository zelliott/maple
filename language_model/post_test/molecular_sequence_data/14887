Limited studies have been performed on the characterization of small size plasmids of zzso zzso with the intention of evaluating the strength of their promoters in zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso and structural organization of zzso zzso zzso cryptic zzso zzso is zzso Seven promoter sequences from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso The regions coding for the putative promoters were either amplified using zzso based techniques or chemically zzso as zzso of different zzso These were subsequently cloned in the zzso zzso at the zzso II zzso The efficiency of putative promoter fragments were measured using the intensity of zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso among which zzso exhibited moderate to strongest promoter activity at temperatures of 30, 37, and zzso
