To detect interactions between proteins of zzso virus, we carried out a comprehensive zzso analysis to zzso every zzso zzso We constructed an array of zzso zzso that contained each of the zzso predicted viral zzso as zzso zzso domain hybrid zzso The array was individually zzso to zzso containing each zzso as a zzso domain hybrid, and zzso expressing the zzso reporter gene were zzso Of the approximately 70,000 combinations, we found 37 zzso zzso including 28 that were previously zzso In some cases, zzso late zzso factors, both proteins were known to have related roles although there was no prior evidence of physical zzso For some other zzso neither protein had a known zzso In the majority of cases, however, one of the interacting proteins was known to be involved in DNA zzso transcription, zzso structure, or host zzso thereby providing a clue to the role of the other zzso protein in a specific zzso
