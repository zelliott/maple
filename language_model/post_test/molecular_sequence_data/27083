Resistance to bacterial speck disease in tomato zzso zzso is activated upon recognition by the host zzso zzso of either one of two zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso from zzso zzso zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity by acting in concert with the zzso zzso The recently reported structure of the zzso complex revealed that interaction of zzso with zzso appears to relieve an zzso effect of zzso allowing zzso to activate zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso 121 to zzso at a resolution of zzso and of the zzso complex at a resolution of zzso zzso zzso exhibits a zzso fold that is completely different from that of zzso and its zzso remains largely unchanged upon binding to zzso In common with zzso the zzso complex relies on two zzso One of these zzso is similar in both complexes, although the primary zzso acid sequences from the two zzso proteins are very zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso at the other interface disrupt the interaction of zzso but not that of zzso Interestingly, zzso in zzso affecting this unique interface also cause zzso to induce zzso host cell death independently of either zzso zzso
