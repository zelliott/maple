We describe a line of zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells, designated zzso that cannot cleave zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso at site 1, due to zzso in the gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso cells were obtained by two rounds of zzso followed first by selection for a zzso of low density zzso receptors and second for cholesterol zzso In the zzso cells, the only zzso zzso zzso encodes a truncated zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the site 1 zzso fails to cleave zzso and their zzso active zzso fragments cannot enter the zzso As a result, the cells manifest a marked reduction in the synthesis of cholesterol and its zzso from low density zzso The zzso cells grow only when cholesterol is added to the culture zzso zzso zzso is restored and the cholesterol requirement is abolished when zzso cells are zzso with expression zzso zzso zzso These results provide formal proof that zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso at site zzso
