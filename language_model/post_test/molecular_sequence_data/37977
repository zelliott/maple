The binding of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins to zzso zzso receptors allows zzso of these organisms by cultured zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for zzso recognition, while a region located outside, and zzso to, this zzso strongly enhances the efficiency of bacterial zzso Within the zzso region is a domain called zzso that allows zzso zzso To investigate the role of the zzso region, bacterial cell binding and entry zzso by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was compared to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be unable to promote zzso using the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso as a zzso Furthermore, two genetically engineered zzso deletion zzso that removed zzso from zzso were significantly less zzso than zzso zzso at promoting zzso although the amount of zzso zzso as well as the cell binding capacity of the zzso zzso coli strains remained zzso Competitive zzso zzso showed that zzso coli cells expressing zzso had a significant advantage in the zzso process versus either zzso coli cells expressing zzso or the zzso derivatives deleted for zzso further demonstrating the importance of zzso zzso for the efficiency of zzso zzso
