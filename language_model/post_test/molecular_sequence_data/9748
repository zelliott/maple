In zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is found in any cell undergoing sustained zzso zzso but this zzso also displays a zzso pattern of expression in differentiated zzso It is now reported that the steady state levels of zzso zzso in normal and zzso cells reflect these patterns, supporting the concept that the control mechanisms underlying this distribution are zzso To initiate an understanding of these interacting levels of control, we have determined the position and properties of the minimal zzso promoter controlling zzso of the zzso gene in human zzso leukemia cells, a line which expresses high levels of this zzso and its zzso The zzso region immediately upstream of the major zzso start site previously mapped in human tumor cells, which includes several zzso and zzso functioned as a remarkably efficient promoter when used to drive expression of a zzso reporter in transient expression studies in zzso zzso The minimal region of the zzso promoter required for zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells included the 80 base pairs over which the multiple zzso start sites were located, and the 43 base pairs immediately zzso zzso I footprint analysis detected the binding of zzso at all seven of the consensus sites within the probe used, two of which are contained within the minimal promoter zzso The several zzso sites immediately upstream of the first major zzso start activated zzso in zzso cells when zzso with an zzso zzso including those in the region which functioned as a minimal promoter in zzso zzso An additional region of the minimal promoter, situated between the two zzso start zzso of the zzso zzso was bound by zzso from zzso cell nuclear zzso We conclude that zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells involves zzso events over a limited upstream DNA sequence and that the zzso promoter used in zzso human zzso cells has strong similarity to other zzso promoters that zzso tandem, closely spaced zzso sites to initiate zzso
