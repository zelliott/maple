The zzso zzso system is broadly similar to that of higher zzso as proteins enter the system via the zzso zzso and are transported to the zzso complex for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso processing is stage specific with only the zzso form zzso processing beyond the zzso zzso Increased complexity of the zzso zzso apparatus, as evidenced by zzso studies, may zzso this higher activity, but few zzso zzso proteins have been described that may play a role in this zzso zzso Here we describe a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso which is zzso and highly expressed in the zzso whilst barely zzso in the insect zzso This zzso expression suggests the presence of a zzso transport zzso required for survival in the zzso zzso Furthermore, data indicate that zzso zzso to zzso in close juxtaposition to structures stained with zzso a zzso zzso Wild type zzso zzso expressed in insect stage cells zzso with zzso and hence is targeted to the zzso complex, consistent with the location of the zzso protein in the zzso form, whilst zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate distinct zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso is zzso zzso We also find that zzso expression of zzso wild type and zzso zzso has no zzso effect on the synthetic zzso trafficking probe, zzso Finally, the location, and hence function, of zzso are distinct from the closest zzso zzso zzso zzso the latter protein is involved in zzso transport pathways whilst clearly zzso is zzso Our data indicate further complexity in the evolution of small zzso and highlight the need for robust functional data prior to assignment of members of complex gene zzso
