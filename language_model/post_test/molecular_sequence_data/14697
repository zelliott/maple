Alternative zzso of the zzso zzso M gene zzso can generate the zzso zzso and promote zzso zzso and tumor zzso However, the zzso alternative zzso regulation of zzso is not completely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is regulated by zzso effects on the mutually exclusive zzso 9 and 10, such that zzso 9 is zzso and zzso 10 is activated in cancer zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso are key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a systematic zzso zzso approach, we identify a potent zzso zzso zzso in zzso 10, which differs from its zzso counterpart in zzso 9 by only two zzso We identify zzso as one of the zzso factors, and show that this zzso protein activates zzso 10 and mediates changes in zzso zzso These findings provide zzso insights into the complex regulation of alternative zzso of a key regulator of the Warburg effect, and also have implications for other genes with a similar pattern of alternative zzso
