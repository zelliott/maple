We have found an zzso zzso gene and an zzso site in zzso zzso as part of a small zzso zzso We have cloned this gene and tested the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso from various zzso Most zzso flanked by two zzso sites are readily zzso while zzso in the zzso position, with an zzso or zzso site on one end, are not zzso An exception is a cassette with zzso on one zzso The zzso site, from zzso has greater similarity to the zzso site adjacent to the zzso of zzso zzso than do zzso or zzso We cloned the zzso site of zzso zzso and observed the integration of two different zzso We have, therefore, demonstrated the function of this zzso zzso
