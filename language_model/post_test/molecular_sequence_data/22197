The zzso gene is specifically expressed in zzso cells and its zzso is induced by the zzso zzso zzso We have zzso a novel zzso zzso factor, zzso by affinity zzso on two zzso separated zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso site (the zzso zzso greatly decreases zzso expression in the zzso cells, which comprise the rear half of the zzso zone, and also in the zzso zzso which lie scattered throughout the zzso zzso However, zzso is not essential for normal expression of the zzso zzso instead it zzso limits its zzso zzso is relatively highly expressed in the subset of zzso cells that coats the zzso zone, but in zzso of a zzso strain, zzso is highly expressed throughout the zzso zzso Because the zzso site is required for correct zzso zzso we zzso a separate zzso protein that competes with zzso for binding to the zzso zzso zzso rapidly accumulates in the nucleus when cells are exposed to zzso and zzso analysis shows that, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso causes zzso to associate with the zzso promoter in zzso Thus, zzso regulates zzso activity to generate a zzso of zzso expression in the zzso zone of the zzso
