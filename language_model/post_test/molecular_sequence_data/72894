We have cloned the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to provide us with a tool to study normal vascular pattern formation in the developing zzso zzso and to compare it to zzso in which vascular pattern is zzso We find that during normal development the first zzso arise zzso in the zzso and then migrate zzso to form the zzso of the large zzso vessels, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso formation occurs shortly before onset of circulation at 24 zzso zzso We examined the zzso of vascular zzso in the zzso zzso which fails to form both vessels and zzso zzso lacks all zzso cells and therefore appears to lack zzso The zzso vessels of the trunk form in close proximity to zzso and zzso which may provide cues for their zzso The zzso zzso is normally just zzso to the zzso the zzso vein is just below the zzso zzso and above the zzso floating head zzso and no tail zzso zzso both have defects in the formation of zzso Both are zzso zzso zzso abolishing zzso and zzso preventing its zzso In both zzso the zzso zzso fails to form, while formation of the zzso vein is less zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso shows that transplanted zzso cells can become zzso in zzso zzso zzso In these mosaic zzso zzso cells expressing zzso assemble at the zzso beneath the zzso zzso and form an zzso zzso This suggests that signals from the zzso may guide zzso in the fashioning of the zzso zzso The zzso seems to be less important for the formation of the zzso
