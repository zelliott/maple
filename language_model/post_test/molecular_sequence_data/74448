We have developed a novel method that uses zzso zzso for real-time zzso analysis of protein zzso The zzso have been designed so that they assume one secondary structure in the absence of a protein zzso and a different secondary structure in the presence of a protein such as zzso or zzso growth factor zzso The zzso structure in turn assembles a zzso junction for the addition of a real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso could be specifically detected into the zzso range, even in the presence of cell zzso The method has advantages relative to both zzso (because no signal is produced by background zzso and the proximity zzso zzso zzso (because only one zzso rather than two zzso on a protein surface must be zzso
