Surface proteins of zzso bacteria are linked to the bacterial cell wall by a mechanism that involves zzso of a zzso zzso zzso motif and that occurs during assembly of the zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso defective in the zzso of surface proteins was isolated and shown to carry a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the rate of surface protein zzso and zzso of zzso were found in other zzso zzso zzso The protein specified by zzso zzso may be a useful target for the development of new zzso zzso
