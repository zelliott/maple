The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performs all steps of transcription, including promoter recognition, zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses three zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or presumably both zzso zzso Their specific functions are as yet zzso We have established an in zzso zzso system to examine the abilities of the three zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and to recognize zzso zzso All three zzso genes were shown to zzso zzso active zzso zzso displayed no significant promoter zzso whereas zzso and zzso were able to accurately initiate zzso from overlapping zzso of zzso and zzso promoters without the aid of protein zzso Our study strongly suggests zzso to be the zzso that transcribes most, if not all, zzso genes in zzso zzso promoter zzso a feature that zzso and zzso share with the zzso zzso appears to have been zzso over the long period of evolution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Selective promoter recognition by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso implies that auxiliary factors are required for efficient initiation of zzso in zzso
