For the development of a scheme for quantitative experimental zzso of internal motion in the complex human milk zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso we measured a large number of experimental residual zzso zzso in liquid crystal zzso zzso We present a total of 40 zzso and zzso zzso zzso values, each representing distinct directions of zzso zzso The zzso data were interpreted with established methods for analysis of rigid zzso of the zzso as well as a novel method in which zzso zzso were calculated over an ensemble of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso trajectory using multiple linear zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso I assumed a single unique zzso with internal motion described by fluctuations of zzso in zzso zzso angles consistent with previous zzso Greater flexibility was observed for the remaining zzso and zzso zzso with the former zzso linkage existing in a zzso exchange among three zzso The results were also supported by similar results of calculations carried out with zzso obtained from a simple zzso Carlo simulation without explicit zzso
