We have recently cloned zzso a novel zzso zzso which, due to unique structural features, was proposed to represent the first member of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , Puente, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Murphy, zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso domain, was expressed in zzso coli, zzso and zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso has the tendency to zzso zzso the zzso zzso bond is zzso resulting in free zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso Pro and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso motif did not prevent zzso but the zzso rate was somewhat zzso Analysis of the zzso specificity revealed that the zzso domain of zzso was able to zzso the general zzso zzso zzso and, with higher efficiency, the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the interactions of the zzso domain of zzso with the natural zzso zzso the tissue zzso of zzso zzso showed strong zzso using zzso zzso and zzso while zzso was less zzso We also demonstrated that synthetic zzso zzso compounds efficiently inhibited the zzso The zzso domain of zzso was able to zzso the basement membrane components type IV zzso zzso and zzso as well as the large zzso zzso zzso and type I gelatin in zzso suggesting that zzso is a potent zzso capable of zzso a broad range of zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso domain nor the full-length zzso was able to degrade zzso zzso Finally, and in contrast to studies with other zzso zzso zzso domain was not able to activate any of the zzso zzso tested in zzso
