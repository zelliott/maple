A large family of neural zzso zzso proteins is zzso by three closely linked zzso gene clusters zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha and gamma clusters have a striking zzso zzso Specifically, each zzso zzso is spliced to a common set of downstream zzso zzso within each zzso Recent studies demonstrated that the zzso expression of each zzso gene is determined zzso combination of zzso promoter zzso and zzso of the corresponding variable zzso to the first constant zzso To determine whether there are other similarly organized gene clusters in zzso zzso we performed a zzso search and identified a large number of zzso genes containing multiple variable first zzso Here we describe several clusters that contain about a dozen variable zzso arrayed in tandem, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In all these cases, multiple variable first zzso are each spliced to a common set of downstream constant zzso to generate diverse functional zzso As an example, we analyzed the zzso expression profile of the mouse zzso repertoire and found that multiple zzso are expressed in a zzso zzso zzso this variable and constant zzso organization provides a genetic mechanism for directing distinct zzso and zzso patterns of gene zzso
