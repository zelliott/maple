The zzso virus zzso D zzso is zzso zzso in length and encodes 13 complete genes zzso Niles et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso Six of these genes are expressed only at early times after infection and one gene is expressed at both early and late times zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Niles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping by zzso zzso protection studies was carried out and compared to the results of primer extension zzso in order to locate map positions of the zzso zzso of each early zzso The lengths of the products of in zzso transcription, from DNA templates which possess the zzso start regions of each of the early zzso were determined and compared to the lengths of DNA products generated by zzso zzso protection and primer extension, in order to demonstrate that the zzso zzso identified by zzso mapping and primer extension are due to zzso initiation and not to zzso zzso For each of the early genes in the zzso D fragment, zzso starts within 25 zzso of the translation initiation zzso The precise location of the 3' zzso of each early transcript was identified by zzso zzso zzso In all but one case, the 3' ends map within 75 zzso of the putative zzso termination signal zzso zzso zzso zzso Yuen, and zzso Moss zzso
