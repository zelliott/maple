A key unresolved question regarding the basic function of zzso zzso channels is how movement of the zzso sensor is coupled to channel zzso We previously proposed that the zzso zzso couples zzso sensor movement to the zzso domain in the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The recently solved crystal structure of the zzso zzso channel reveals that the zzso zzso is the structural link between the zzso sensing and pore zzso In this study, we used zzso constructed from zzso and zzso zzso channels to identify interactions between zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso domain that were critical for stabilizing the channel in a closed zzso To verify the spatial proximity of these regions, we introduced zzso in the zzso zzso and at the zzso end of the zzso domain and then zzso for the effect of zzso The zzso channel current decreased in an zzso environment in a zzso manner consistent with formation of a zzso bond that locked the channel in a closed zzso zzso bond formation also restricted movement of the zzso zzso as measured by gating zzso Taken together, these data confirm that the zzso zzso directly couples zzso sensor movement to the zzso zzso Moreover, rather than functioning simply as a mechanical lever, these findings imply that specific interactions between the zzso zzso and the zzso gate stabilize the closed channel zzso
