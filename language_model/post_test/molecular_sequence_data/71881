zzso zzso is an important zzso pathogen in zzso A zzso zzso protein and a zzso activity have been characterized and are thought to be its major zzso zzso The zzso activity was suggested to be due to a zzso protein toxin belonging to the zzso zzso in the structural zzso zzso In the present work, two closely related zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned from zzso zzso and zzso The zzso proteins appear to be zzso and possess two structurally different zzso The zzso part shows similarity with zzso zzso especially zzso and zzso of zzso fetus and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso part zzso most of zzso and zzso is a domain with 48 and 59 zzso zzso zzso repeats, respectively, arranged in three zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides bind zzso These are characteristic traits of zzso toxin zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are separated by a zzso stretch of 48 zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso studied contained copies of either the zzso or zzso gene or zzso zzso genes were absent from all other zzso and zzso species zzso zzso of a patient with acute zzso showed a strong reaction to zzso zzso protein on zzso
