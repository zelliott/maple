A simplified and sensitive method for measuring expression levels of zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The two zzso zzso were zzso and measured by zzso chain reaction using zzso based on the corresponding zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were widely expressed in the rat zzso including adrenal zzso zzso heart, zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the rat zzso examined except adrenal zzso and zzso zzso where zzso zzso was predominantly zzso zzso depletion did not change zzso levels of zzso and zzso in the all zzso However, both zzso and zzso zzso levels in the heart and zzso were zzso by treatment with zzso specific zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in the adrenal zzso was mainly reduced by the zzso These results suggest that the expression level of zzso zzso in the adrenal zzso depends on the activity of the zzso system zzso and both zzso zzso mediate contraction and zzso of the smooth and cardiac muscles via the zzso
