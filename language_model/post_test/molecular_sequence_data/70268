Four different zzso zzso clones have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of the four zzso clones represent new zzso zzso genes that have been designated zzso zzso and zzso It is shown that the zzso gene family in zzso is more complex than originally anticipated and more complex than those in zzso In the zzso zzso gene family the zzso zzso and zzso genes are shown to represent small zzso gene zzso zzso in the abundance of the zzso zzso and zzso transcripts are seen among zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso transcripts are most abundant in zzso In zzso development, abundance of the zzso transcript increases markedly from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso whilst the levels of zzso transcript closely resemble those of total zzso transcript in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes appear to have zzso recently in the evolution of the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso gene is expressed in zzso but its transcript is most abundant in zzso zzso zzso
