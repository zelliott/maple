zzso tolerance of seeds is positively correlated with zzso family zzso zzso However, zzso role in zzso tolerance is still a matter of zzso The aim of this work was to monitor the zzso of zzso during acquisition of zzso tolerance in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso become zzso tolerant at zzso after flowering zzso and the time was zzso with an zzso of zzso and zzso A gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso was cloned and functionally zzso zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso were also zzso zzso of zzso zzso in developing zzso was zzso with dry weight deposition and the acquisition of zzso zzso and was concurrent with the formation of zzso and zzso The zzso implications of zzso expression patterns in developing seeds are discussed in light of the hypothesized role of zzso in seed zzso zzso
