Late onset zzso disease is zzso by onset of symptoms after the age of 50 and is usually associated with a milder zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso repeat within the HD gene in 133 late onset patients from 107 extended zzso The median upper zzso size for the zzso repeat was 42 with a range of 38 to 48 zzso A significant negative correlation zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was found between the length of repeat and age of onset for the total zzso However, for persons with age of onset greater than 60, no significant correlation was zzso In addition, no significant correlation was found between age of onset and size of the lower zzso and the sex of the affected parent or zzso There was no preponderance of maternal descent for late onset cases in this zzso This study shows that variation in repeat length only accounts for approximately zzso of the variation in age of onset for persons beyond the age of 50 and clearly shows how with increasing onset age the effect of the repeat length on this onset age seems to zzso
