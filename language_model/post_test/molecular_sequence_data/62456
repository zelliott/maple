zzso play a fundamental role in zzso assembly at the cell zzso Several zzso components and accessory factors contain independently folded zzso zzso that zzso in part, membrane placement at the bud zzso As the zzso assembly process zzso toward deeply zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso principally through the action of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Failure to zzso zzso zzso the zzso process and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso 1, termed zzso contains a zzso extension that harbors interaction motifs for engaging several components of the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that in addition to zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso contains a novel zzso binding zzso the zzso zzso The zzso sequence engages the independently folded zzso zzso that projects off the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso also contain functional zzso motifs in addition to two zzso repeats, whereas zzso 2 harbors three tandem zzso zzso Each of the discrete zzso zzso motifs bind to zzso relatively zzso but, as zzso arrayed within the zzso extension, can cooperate to bind zzso zzso with good apparent zzso These interactions likely contribute to the appropriate targeting of certain zzso components to zzso bud sites assembling at the cell zzso
