zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important pathogen of cattle that is responsible for respiratory disease, zzso and systemic diseases such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso A variety of zzso factors have been identified in zzso zzso including compositional and zzso variation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as one of the components of zzso zzso LOS that zzso zzso zzso In this study, five genes zzso and zzso with zzso to genes responsible for zzso expression in zzso zzso LOS were identified in the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso open reading frame zzso with zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a variable number of tandem repeats zzso However, whereas the zzso repeat zzso is present in zzso the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso Due to the propensity of zzso to vary during replication and cause the zzso to shift in and out of frame with the upstream start zzso the zzso were deleted from zzso to maintain the gene zzso zzso This construct was cloned into zzso coli, and functional zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso a zzso zzso and that the zzso were not required for expression of a functional gene zzso Variation in the number of zzso in zzso correlated with zzso variation of zzso expression in zzso zzso strain zzso However, zzso variation of zzso expression in strain zzso predominately occurred through variable zzso of the LOS outer zzso These results indicated that the zzso genes controlled expression of zzso on the zzso but that in zzso zzso there are two potential mechanisms that account for zzso variation of zzso
