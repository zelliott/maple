Two marine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso emit light in a reaction involving the zzso zzso of its zzso zzso by molecular zzso The characteristic properties of zzso zzso zzso have not been zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso which has three active zzso has been zzso A cloned partial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso encodes an active zzso corresponding to part of domain 2 and all of domain 3 of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso acid sequence between the two zzso in domain 3 is about zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso containing domain 3 (Mr zzso 46 zzso zzso the light-emitting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein was zzso by a single zzso zzso The zzso profile and the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso having a third domain are almost identical to those of an extract from zzso zzso cultured in zzso The zzso zzso is active at pH zzso although the zzso zzso derived from the second domain of zzso zzso zzso is inactive at pH zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in the third domain of zzso zzso zzso showed a decrease of activity above pH zzso suggesting that zzso zzso could be responsible for zzso in zzso zzso
