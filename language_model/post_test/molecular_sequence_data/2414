A protein sensitive to zzso zzso the fusion of transport zzso with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso By cloning and sequencing its gene from Chinese zzso zzso cells and by use of in zzso zzso we show that this fusion protein is equivalent to the zzso gene product of the zzso zzso zzso known to be essential for zzso transport from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso fusion is thus highly zzso both between species and at different stages of zzso
