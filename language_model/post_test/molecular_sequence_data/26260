Previous studies indicate that zzso zzso phase and zzso variation occur by zzso zzso gene zzso the outcome of which resembles that of gene zzso During such zzso the expressed complete zzso gene zzso acquires a novel sequence corresponding to that of a silent zzso gene zzso In the present study, we find that internal deletions of zzso can produce zzso phase zzso direct zzso repeats in the zzso portion of zzso zzso the deleted zzso A novel, zzso zzso is formed upon repair of the internal zzso with zzso sequence probably acting as a template for zzso Such zzso of zzso is suggested as a principal mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso
