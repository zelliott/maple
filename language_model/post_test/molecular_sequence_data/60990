Using zzso functional and molecular techniques, this study was performed to compare the complexity of the zzso zzso repertoire of a bone zzso transplanted patient with that of his zzso related zzso both of whom developed a chronic zzso sustained by zzso zzso zzso 3 years after zzso Although Southern zzso analysis revealed the presence of extra bands in both subjects, thus indicating the presence of at least one zzso zzso population, the study of the different zzso zzso zzso zzso usage did not demonstrate discrete zzso of any zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso analysis of zzso transcripts suggested the presence of zzso zzso expansions in the two zzso Cloning and sequencing studies demonstrated that zzso clones expressing identical zzso chains were expanded both in the donor and in the zzso Furthermore, clones with similar, but not zzso zzso regions were also found in the two zzso These data indicate that, at the time of the zzso a few cells with a zzso pattern that were present in the donor were transferred to the recipient, where they may have found the same environmental in zzso conditions and/or the zzso pressure zzso their abnormal zzso
