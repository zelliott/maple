zzso compensation is a regulatory process that zzso that males and females have equal amounts of zzso gene zzso In zzso this is achieved by a zzso enhancement of zzso gene zzso in zzso relative to zzso The enhancement of zzso is zzso by the activity of a group of regulatory genes characterized by the zzso zzso of their zzso zzso The products of these genes form a complex that is zzso associated with numerous sites on the X zzso in zzso cells of males but not of zzso zzso of the dosage compensation complex is correlated with a significant increase in the presence of a specific zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso at zzso on this zzso Experimental results and sequence analysis suggest that an additional zzso zzso on the first zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso that plays a direct role in the specific zzso zzso associated with dosage zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibits a significant level of similarity to several other zzso including the human zzso zzso interactive protein zzso the human zzso leukemia zinc finger protein zzso and the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso
