The molecular genetic basis of C1 inhibitor zzso zzso zzso in a patient with type I zzso zzso zzso was zzso This patient was found to have an zzso short C1 zzso zzso together with a normal zzso zzso zzso length zzso of the C1 zzso gene was detected by Southern zzso analysis of the patient's DNA after zzso with zzso I or zzso I, and zzso with a full-length C1 zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso with three different fragments of the full-length zzso suggested that zzso zzso and portions of both zzso zzso were deleted in the C1 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from cultured zzso using a probe corresponding to zzso zzso also indicated that the abnormal C1 zzso zzso had a deletion of these zzso To confirm the hypothesis that the short C1 zzso zzso contained a zzso the involved segment of the patient's C1 zzso zzso was amplified using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso amplification yielded two C1 zzso DNA fragments of different lengths zzso and 160 zzso Southern zzso and sequence analysis of both DNA fragments clearly revealed that the smaller zzso DNA was derived from the abnormal message and had a deletion of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso
