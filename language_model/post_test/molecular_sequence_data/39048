zzso zzso is a zzso zzso motor zzso for transport of zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso is expressed in zzso we performed reverse zzso zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso and zzso complementary to human brain zzso zzso heavy zzso A zzso chain reaction product of the expected molecular size was generated and the identity was confirmed by sequence zzso Western zzso of total zzso proteins reacted with an zzso chain zzso zzso zzso identified the appropriate 74 zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso plays a role in zzso zzso duplicate cultures were treated with zzso zzso zzso or sense zzso zzso and the cells were observed by high-resolution zzso zzso which allows zzso of zzso zzso and individual zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a strong zzso transport of zzso from the cell body into the zzso whereas zzso distribution was not affected in zzso zzso To determine whether ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures were exposed to increasing doses of zzso zzso equivalent to a mild to moderate zzso exposure for intact zzso Within 24 zzso doses of 5 and 10 zzso per zzso induced zzso zzso zzso whereas doses of 30 zzso per zzso or more were associated with decreased levels of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Our data show that zzso zzso zzso in retrograde zzso transport in human zzso and suggest that the altered zzso distribution in skin after sun exposure is due, at least in part, to decreased zzso zzso levels resulting in zzso zzso zzso
