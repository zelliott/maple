A zzso sterile zzso of the smooth locus zzso zzso was discovered in an artificial selection line for low abdominal bristle number that had been started from a zzso zzso zzso The fitness effects and extremely low bristle number zzso of the zzso could not be separated by zzso from a zzso zzso at zzso location zzso and precise zzso of the zzso at this site was associated with zzso to wild zzso The smooth gene was cloned using the zzso zzso as a zzso The gene encodes a zzso transcript derived from 10 zzso and covers a zzso region of at least 80 zzso The zzso smooth gene shares substantial sequence identity with a group of zzso binding zzso with the closest relationship being to the human zzso nuclear zzso L zzso The smooth gene is by definition an abdominal bristle number quantitative trait zzso but further work is required to discern whether naturally occurring zzso variation at this locus is a source of genetic variation for abdominal bristle number in natural zzso
