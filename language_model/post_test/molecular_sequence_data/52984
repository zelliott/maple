The binding zzso zzso transport system of zzso zzso a member of the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso is composed of two integral membrane zzso zzso and zzso and of two copies of an zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso thus energizing the zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are dependent on a signaling mechanism originating from the binding protein and traveling through zzso Thus, zzso interactions in the complex are crucial to the transport process but the chemical nature of zzso involved is poorly zzso We have investigated the proximity of zzso in a zzso sequence zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso in a zzso segment of the zzso zzso by means of zzso chemical zzso To this end, single zzso zzso were introduced into each zzso at several positions and the respective zzso and zzso zzso were individually zzso with each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared from those double zzso that contained a functional zzso in zzso and treated with zzso or zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso segment of zzso to different zzso participate in constitution of zzso interaction sites with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso in the complex are in close contact to each other through zzso and zzso These interactions are strongly modulated by zzso indicating a structural zzso of the zzso during the transport zzso These data are discussed with respect to current transport zzso
