zzso of individual zzso T cells results in differential zzso expression: zzso 2 zzso is zzso produced by T helper type 1 zzso cells, which are involved in zzso immune responses, whereas zzso is zzso by zzso cells, which are essential for zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso plays a key role in the zzso zzso of both these zzso zzso However, while zzso expression requires the contribution of zzso and protein zzso zzso signals, we report that zzso of human zzso zzso through the zzso zzso is diminished by protein zzso C stimulation in zzso T zzso This phenomenon is due to mutually exclusive binding of zzso and zzso B to the P zzso an element located 69 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso initiation zzso Human zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha and suppressed in zzso zzso In contrast, protein zzso C stimulation or zzso zzso does not affect the activity of a human zzso promoter containing a mouse P zzso which is a zzso site for zzso and a zzso site for zzso Thus, competition between two general zzso zzso zzso and zzso mediates the zzso effect of protein zzso C stimulation on zzso expression and may contribute to differential gene expression in zzso zzso
