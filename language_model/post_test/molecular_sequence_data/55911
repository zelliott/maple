zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned and the primary sequence deduced from the DNA zzso From the zzso digest of the zzso zzso five peptides were zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequences of the peptides agreed with the corresponding parts of the zzso zzso sequence obtained from the gene zzso zzso is the zzso zzso binding zzso Assisted by the sequence data, the crystal structure of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been refined to an zzso of zzso at zzso resolution using zzso radiation zzso zzso The zzso zzso has 222 zzso with one of the axes zzso with the zzso zzso symmetry axis of the crystal which belongs to the space group zzso with a zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, and c zzso zzso zzso Each zzso comprises 14 zzso and 16 zzso which fold into a small and a large zzso The zzso zzso zzso is located at the interface between the large and small zzso of one zzso and the large domain of a zzso related zzso The fold of the large, zzso zzso binding domain and the location of the active site are similar to that found in zzso Most of the zzso which participate in binding of zzso zzso in zzso are zzso in the structure of zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso each of which has a domain architecture similar to that found in zzso zzso are bound together through a zzso cluster in the center of the zzso and intertwined zzso zzso
