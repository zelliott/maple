We investigated the molecular bases for resistance to several classes of zzso that bind zzso in green zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified two zzso and two zzso genes in green zzso zzso comparison between resistant and sensitive plants revealed two zzso a zzso change at position 136 and a zzso change at position zzso in the gene zzso zzso Association of zzso at position 239 with zzso resistance was demonstrated using zzso lines derived from zzso pairings between green zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso Association of zzso at position 136 with zzso resistance was demonstrated using zzso sensitivity zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were associated with zzso cross resistance to zzso and zzso zzso no change in sensitivity to zzso and hypersensitivity to zzso Using three-dimensional zzso we found that the two zzso are adjacent and located into a region involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of three-dimensional zzso models for organisms with contrasted sensitivity to zzso zzso enabled us to propose that zzso zzso and the vicinity of the side chain of zzso 251 are critical zzso for the differences in zzso sensitivity observed between organisms, and that positions 16, 24, zzso zzso zzso and 268 are involved in modulating sensitivity to these zzso
