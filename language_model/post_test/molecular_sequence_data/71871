zzso zzso zzso are zzso storage zzso which contribute significantly to zzso zzso zzso We previously identified and cloned a locus from the zzso zzso zzso which is required for the zzso of zzso zzso of this locus revealed at least four zzso open reading zzso all of which are preceded by a common promoter region and are transcribed in the same zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the first of these open reading frames zzso revealed zzso which are highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences derived from zzso zzso and zzso also exhibit extensive similarity to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in these zzso However, Southern zzso experiments indicate that this zzso maps to a locus on the zzso zzso zzso which is separate from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose products are known zzso of bacterial zzso zzso We therefore assigned a new zzso designation to the locus which we had formerly called zzso We maintain that the zzso genes are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso however, since they complement a zzso in trans which otherwise renders zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that expression of the zzso zzso zzso genes is growth phase dependent and is modulated by carbohydrates zzso via the zzso zzso system zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed zzso when zzso zzso are provided as the sole source of zzso zzso with a role for the zzso in zzso expression is a similar zzso expression of the zzso genes in an zzso zzso zzso zzso grown in a chemically defined medium supplemented with zzso In zzso these findings support a novel role for the zzso gene products in zzso zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso expression in this oral pathogen is subject to complex mechanisms of control imposed by growth phase, dietary zzso and other factors present in the plaque zzso
