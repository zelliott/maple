zzso C zzso is a powerful zzso agent that targets the DNA sequence zzso Because it is likely that this zzso will contain zzso in zzso we have compared the zzso efficiency of zzso for DNA containing either zzso or normal zzso embedded in zzso DNA zzso We have found that zzso C displays a small but significant preference for zzso zzso zzso of an abnormal zzso pattern in the DNA of transformed cells may therefore be one mechanism by which zzso exerts its zzso zzso
