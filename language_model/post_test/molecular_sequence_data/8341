To assess whether the initial status of zzso metabolism in patients with chronic viral zzso might correlate with outcome of therapy, 52 patients (32 males and 20 zzso with chronic zzso C were zzso 44 were treated with human zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso three times per week for up to 12 zzso and 8 served as zzso At zzso zzso were tested for total and HDL cholesterol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso tumor necrosis factor, and zzso Changes in blood lipids were evaluated after 3, 30, and 90 days of zzso HDL cholesterol, zzso zzso and zzso decreased by zzso within 4 weeks of starting zzso treatment, but this effect was sustained only in patients with a primary response to zzso On zzso analysis, a primary response to zzso correlated with higher zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso for zzso In contrast, a sustained response was significantly more common in patients with low zzso or zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and lower zzso at baseline but did not correlate with any of the blood zzso Thus, in chronic zzso C, zzso treatment zzso specific changes in blood zzso The concentration of zzso zzso at baseline is a strong predictor of primary response to treatment, and the likelihood of sustained response seems to be reflected by lower zzso zzso
