zzso is a ubiquitous zzso protein that is important for rapid zzso dynamics in zzso The long zzso zzso 3 in zzso zzso forms the most highly zzso region in zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso half of this zzso have been shown to be essential for zzso binding in zzso Recent studies also suggested that the basic zzso in the zzso half of this zzso would play an important role in zzso zzso In contrast to these studies, we show here that the charged zzso in the zzso half of zzso 3 are not important for zzso filament binding in zzso zzso zzso in these zzso however, result in a small zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso can differentiate between various zzso and mapped the zzso binding site by using a collection of zzso zzso The zzso binding site of zzso zzso is a large positively charged surface that consists of zzso in zzso 3 as well as zzso in other parts of the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso proteins probably interact simultaneously with more than one zzso zzso The zzso site zzso with areas that are important for zzso zzso explaining why the zzso activities of zzso are inhibited by zzso The biological roles of zzso and zzso interactions of zzso are discussed in light of zzso of specific zzso strains carrying zzso in zzso that are important for zzso and zzso zzso
