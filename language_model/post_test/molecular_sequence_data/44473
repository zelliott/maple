DNA amplification on zzso zzso is commonly detected in breast cancer and zzso with poor zzso zzso critical target genes on this zzso have however, not yet been zzso We describe in this paper isolation of a novel gene named zzso zzso a putative member of protein zzso zzso family localized on zzso zzso that is amplified and zzso in breast tumor cell zzso zzso maps close to the critical region of amplification defined earlier on this zzso zzso zzso acid sequence shows conservation of all the zzso predicted in protein zzso super zzso Translated zzso zzso shows significant zzso with previously cloned protein zzso zzso zzso genes zzso from S zzso and aurora from zzso both shown to be functionally involved in normal zzso segregation zzso Our findings suggest that amplification and zzso of zzso may be playing a critical role in zzso transformation of breast tumor zzso
