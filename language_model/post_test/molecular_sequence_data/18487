A zzso zzso zzso dark zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a tidal flat zzso of the South Sea, South zzso zzso zzso was found to grow zzso at zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso fell within the zzso zzso zzso species, zzso with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values between strain zzso and the type strains of the other zzso species were zzso zzso zzso was found to contain zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids of strain zzso were zzso zzso and one unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso properties, together with the zzso zzso revealed that strain zzso is separated from other zzso zzso On the basis of the data zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
