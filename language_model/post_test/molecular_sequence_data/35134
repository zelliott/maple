zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso family, plays important roles in diverse cellular processes and has become a promising drug target for certain zzso However, the regulatory mechanism of zzso remains zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a zzso of human zzso that contains the zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain tightly binds to the back of the zzso domain, which may contribute to the proper zzso and activity of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso segment in the zzso domain displays a unique zzso that contains an zzso zzso zzso The structural and zzso analyses unravel the molecular mechanisms for the zzso of zzso and the dependence of its zzso activity on reducing zzso Thus, our results may provide the basis for designing specific zzso zzso for cancer zzso
