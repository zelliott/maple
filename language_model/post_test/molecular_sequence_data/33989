To clone and analysis the sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso 

The zzso were designed based on the conservative region of zzso zzso acids sequence from public zzso The target gene was obtained from root of zzso zzso by use of zzso zzso zzso on and zzso zzso The sequence alignment was performed using zzso The open reading frame was identified by use of the zzso zzso The protein zzso were defined by use of zzso zzso zzso was used to conduct multiple zzso acid sequence alignment and zzso zzso was used to conduct the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso sequence was obtained contains 1 zzso zzso contains a 1 zzso zzso ORF, zzso zzso zzso acids with zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso acid sequence had zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The cloning of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso will provide a foundation for exploring the function of zzso in zzso zzso
