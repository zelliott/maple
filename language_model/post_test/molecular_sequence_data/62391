The zzso and premature aging disease zzso syndrome is due to loss of zzso gene zzso zzso lacking zzso demonstrate zzso instability, including zzso abnormalities and undergo premature zzso suggesting defects in zzso zzso This notion is strongly supported by our finding of physical and functional interactions between zzso and zzso a zzso repeat binding factor essential for proper zzso zzso zzso binds to DNA zzso containing zzso repeats and zzso their degradation specifically by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also interact directly in the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso recruits zzso for accurate processing of zzso structures in zzso Thus, our findings link problems in zzso maintenance to both zzso and specific features of zzso
