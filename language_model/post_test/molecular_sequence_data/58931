The increasing zzso of prostate cancer demands that we give our full attention not only to the zzso and prevention of this common type of cancer, but also to the diagnosis and zzso course of this zzso In an effort to develop new zzso tumor markers that could be useful to the physician at the current state of our knowledge in the diagnosis and prognosis of this disease, our laboratories have undertaken an effort to isolate and characterize the nature of the major proteins in the normal prostate and in zzso zzso 

In this preliminary study, tissue was obtained from open zzso surgery in patients with a zzso and zzso diagnosis of benign zzso zzso The initial zzso and separation of the proteins was achieved through the use of zzso of zzso followed by zzso zzso analysis of four prominent protein bands was accomplished by zzso acid sequencing, and identified by a search in zzso data zzso 

Two proteins previously identified in zzso tissue were prostate specific zzso zzso zzso with 240 zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso A third protein was identified as human zzso rich protein zzso This protein functions as a DNA binding protein and has previously been zzso to contain four putative zinc fingers and to play a fundamental role in cellular zzso zzso the fourth major protein identified was a zzso acid zzso whose function is to target other proteins for zzso 

zzso and zzso are reported as being found in high levels in zzso tissue for the first zzso
