zzso important sites in the predicted first and fourth zzso zzso of the type zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso scanning zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso substitution or modification with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at certain sites resulted in changes to the zzso zzso dependency of the zzso mode (1 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso at pH zzso of the zzso At zzso zzso and zzso zzso complementary behavior of the zzso dependency was documented with respect to the effect of zzso and zzso zzso had a weak zzso dependency that became even stronger than that of the wild type zzso after zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso dependency that became markedly weaker after zzso zzso To zzso the underlying zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso were studied in zzso The apparent affinity zzso for zzso and zzso did not show large changes after zzso zzso However, the dependency on external zzso was changed in a complementary manner for each zzso This suggested that zzso substitution at zzso or modification of zzso had induced similar zzso changes to alter the zzso zzso of transport zzso The changes in zzso zzso dependency correlated with changes in the zzso of zzso charge movements determined in the absence of zzso which suggested that zzso transitions in the transport cycle were zzso The zzso and zzso behavior was simulated using an zzso kinetic model in which the transition rate zzso of the empty carrier and zzso of the fully loaded carrier were found to be critical zzso of the transport zzso The simulations predict that zzso substitution at zzso or zzso modification of zzso alters the preferred orientation of the empty carrier from an inward to zzso zzso for zzso zzso
