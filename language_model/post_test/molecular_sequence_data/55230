zzso plays a critical role in both normal zzso and zzso particularly in the development and maintenance of mixed lineage leukemia zzso zzso Through reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of zzso transcripts in human leukemia and normal bone zzso samples, we identified a truncated zzso of zzso namely zzso and found that both zzso and zzso zzso were highly expressed in leukemia cell lines bearing zzso zzso relative to human normal bone zzso cells or other zzso of leukemia zzso A zzso in zzso in zzso I causes a premature stop zzso upstream of the zzso domain and the zzso which leads to the generation of a zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso alone cannot transform normal bone zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cannot cooperate with zzso to transform cells, despite the presence of a zzso zzso zzso although the truncated zzso of many proteins function as zzso competitors or zzso of their full-length counterparts, this is not the case for zzso instead, zzso zzso with zzso in transforming mouse normal bone zzso zzso cells through promoting zzso and proliferation of the zzso zzso our data indicate that both truncated and full-length forms of zzso are highly expressed in human zzso zzso and the truncated zzso of zzso might also play an zzso role by cooperating with zzso zzso in cell transformation and zzso
