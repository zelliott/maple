zzso disease virus zzso zzso Iraq zzso adapted to grow in zzso zzso cells induced zzso which neutralized many zzso belonging to the A zzso zzso virus isolated from this stock also induced broadly zzso zzso showing that this property is not due to the combined response to a mixture of zzso in the original stock zzso However, viruses obtained by passage in suspension zzso cells of either the zzso zzso virus or a virus cloned from this stock resulted in the selection of virus which induced zzso with highly specific zzso zzso In addition to their zzso properties the zzso and suspension zzso viruses could be distinguished by plaque zzso tendency to zzso and ability to attach to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced with the zzso zzso virus had zzso activity almost as broad as zzso serum, showing that this property can be represented by a single zzso on the zzso These zzso zzso recognize a zzso zzso on the zzso Surprisingly, sequence analysis of the structural zzso regions of the zzso zzso of zzso and suspension zzso viruses showed no zzso acid differences in zzso the protein known to contain the major zzso zzso in zzso and to be the only protein susceptible to zzso by zzso in the virus zzso Although three coding differences were found in the zzso protein these were all located in zzso
