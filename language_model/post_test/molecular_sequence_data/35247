The zzso consist of two living groups, zzso and zzso Here we compare the structure, zzso and zzso of the beta zzso in two zzso zzso and two avian zzso to gain a better understanding of the evolutionary origin of the feather zzso Unlike zzso such as the green zzso with 40 zzso in its zzso the chicken and zebra zzso zzso have over 100 zzso genes in their zzso while the American zzso has 20 zzso zzso and the saltwater zzso has 21 zzso zzso The zzso zzso are similar to those of birds and these structural proteins have a central filament domain and zzso and zzso which contribute to the zzso material between the twisted zzso which form the 2-3 zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso genes in the zzso increases during zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that a zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso group with the avian scale and feather zzso suggesting that avian scale and feather zzso along with a subset of zzso zzso evolved from a common ancestral zzso Overall, our analyses support the view that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso used a diverse array of zzso which evolved into zzso and avian specific zzso In birds, the scale and feather zzso appear to have evolved independently in the avian lineage from a subset of zzso claw zzso The expansion of the avian specific feather zzso genes accompanied the diversification of birds and the evolution of zzso
