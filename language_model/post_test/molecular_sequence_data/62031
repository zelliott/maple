zzso proteins were extracted from eggs of the zzso coral zzso zzso and analyzed using zzso gel zzso Two major zzso named zzso and 2, were zzso and two partial zzso acid sequences of zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified, using reverse zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso designed based on the zzso acid zzso and rapid amplification of zzso zzso Upon translation of the zzso zzso was predicted to consist of zzso zzso zzso and the protein sequence exhibited similarity to zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts were already present approximately 6 months before zzso when the size of zzso was approximately zzso of the mature egg, and could be detected throughout the zzso zzso These observations suggest that detection of zzso transcripts may be useful to monitor the zzso activity in zzso zzso
