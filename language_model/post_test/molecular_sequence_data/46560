zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a frequent cause of zzso zzso affecting zzso of such patients (with higher zzso reported in zzso areas of the zzso Although zzso of human zzso zzso zzso have been described in autonomously functioning zzso zzso zzso the role of such zzso in the zzso of zzso remains zzso To search for zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso we performed zzso dye primer automated fluorescent DNA sequencing of the entire zzso domain and zzso tail of zzso zzso using DNA extracted from zzso regions of 24 patients with zzso and 7 patients with zzso Eight of the 24 patients zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the zzso tail of zzso with an zzso acid substitution of zzso acid to zzso zzso Three of 24 zzso patients with zzso were found to carry a zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulting in substitution of zzso with zzso One patient had multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso Two patients exhibited silent zzso of zzso 460 and zzso We found no zzso of the zzso in 7 patients with zzso except for a silent zzso of zzso 460 in zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso using restriction zzso zzso and zzso DNA confirmed the sequencing results in all cases, indicating that the sequence zzso were not zzso in zzso This technique was also used to examine peripheral blood zzso DNA from 52 normal individuals and 49 patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso of zzso disease patients zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso and zzso of normal individuals were zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso resulted in an exaggerated zzso response to zzso stimulation compared to that of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso is associated with zzso suggesting that its presence is an important zzso genetic factor in the zzso of zzso
