zzso zzso is considered to be an opportunistic zzso implicated in food borne diseases causing meningitis or zzso especially in zzso and zzso Cultural standard identification procedures for zzso zzso include the observation of yellow pigmentation of colonies and a positive zzso zzso Up to now, only one zzso system based on a single available zzso zzso gene sequence has been published for zzso zzso zzso However, in our hands a preliminary evaluation of this system to a number of target and zzso strains showed significant specificity problems of this zzso In this study full-length zzso zzso genes of thirteen zzso zzso strains from food, environment and human origin as well as the type strain zzso zzso were zzso Based on this sequence data a new specific zzso system for zzso zzso was developed and zzso 

By zzso analysis of the new full-length zzso zzso gene sequence data obtained we could show the presence of a second zzso distinct lineage within the zzso zzso zzso The newly developed zzso zzso gene targeting zzso system allows identification of zzso zzso strains from both zzso The zzso ability to correctly identify different zzso zzso zzso as well as to differentiate zzso zzso from other closely related zzso species and other zzso was shown on 75 target and zzso zzso 

By this study we are presenting a specific and reliable zzso identification system, which is able to correctly identify zzso zzso zzso from both zzso distinct lines within the zzso zzso zzso The impact of this second newly described zzso line within the zzso zzso species in view of clinical and food safety aspects need further zzso
