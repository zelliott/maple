Previous studies have shown that core zzso the most zzso group of extant zzso zzso have a distinct zzso zzso zzso organization pattern from zzso zzso zzso However, the details of zzso structure transformation from ancestral zzso to core zzso remain unclear because of limited zzso data zzso Here, we have determined the complete zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a representative of zzso zzso zzso The two species represent the sister and the zzso lineages of core zzso respectively, for which the zzso sequences are currently zzso Comparative zzso analysis of all zzso zzso zzso reveals that the gene order of zzso zzso zzso occupies an intermediate position between that of zzso zzso and core zzso The two zzso of the zzso zzso gene have a unique pattern of zzso copy number zzso Specifically, the substitution rate zzso between the two zzso is zzso with their copy number changes, confirming the constraint role that zzso repeats may play on the substitution rate of zzso gene zzso
