The zzso regions zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play important roles in the zzso of zzso To zzso the mechanisms regulating human zzso gene zzso it is necessary to determine its zzso organization and the roles of the multiple zzso We therefore examined the zzso and expression profiles of the human zzso F zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso of the human zzso gene and six F zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso revealed the preferred expression zzso zzso regulation was also zzso The zzso of the F zzso decreased the translation efficiency but had no effect on zzso zzso The results indicate that the organization and zzso patterns of the human zzso gene are more complex than previously reported, and that the zzso of the F zzso contribute to the zzso control of human zzso gene expression through translation zzso
