zzso proteins play important roles in plant defense zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso nominated as zzso was isolated from cotton zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso in length and encodes a protein with zzso zzso acids containing two typical zzso zzso and two zinc finger zzso zzso acid sequence alignment revealed that zzso shares a high degree of identity with other higher plant zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is localized to the zzso Analysis of zzso region of zzso revealed a group of putative zzso zzso The results of expression analysis indicated that zzso is zzso expressed in roots, stems and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is zzso by application of various zzso including salicylic acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the transcripts of zzso are enhanced after infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso can be induced by wounding treatment, but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drought, zzso and cold zzso These data suggested that zzso might play an important role in plant defense responses and fulfill a pivotal role in plant zzso
