The sequence of zzso I, the first de zzso zzso zzso was revised according to several criteria, among others the symmetry of the zzso zzso volume and zzso and charge zzso These considerations and the overall conclusions drawn from the first design led to two new zzso corresponding to zzso II and zzso zzso II retains perfect zzso zzso zzso III has the same sequence as zzso II, except for the zzso which exhibit a zzso zzso The two proteins were produced in zzso zzso zzso and CD spectral analyses of zzso II and III reveal a high secondary structure zzso zzso gel zzso molecular sieve zzso and zzso zzso suggest that both of these second-generation artificial zzso exist as a mixture of a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso II and III are at least 10 times more soluble than zzso zzso zzso unfolding followed by zzso zzso suggests that the zzso zzso designed to be buried in the zzso are indeed packed in the zzso core of both zzso However, zzso III displays a higher stability towards zzso zzso indicating that introducing zzso symmetry into the zzso might be important for stability of the overall zzso
