The region between the open reading frames of the adjacent zzso genes zzso and zzso consists of zzso base pairs zzso zzso of zzso zzso and initiation of zzso zzso has to take place within this zzso because both genes are transcribed into the same zzso We show that the zzso zzso and the zzso promoter are zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso includes 84 zzso of the zzso zzso region with several redundant zzso 3' end processing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso does reduce but not completely shut down its zzso The adjacent region of 40 zzso is neither required for correct zzso 3' end formation nor for zzso initiation but contains the zzso corresponding to the wild type zzso 3' zzso The following 280 zzso are required for the zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso promoter by the stronger zzso promoter leads to reduced zzso expression due to zzso zzso This zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso carrying virtually no zzso regions between adjacent zzso
