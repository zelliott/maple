By weighting the zzso reaction in favor of specificity for the target sequence in the beginning cycles and for continued efficient amplification of the sequence into later cycles, we were able to show an improvement in the specificity and quantity of amplified zzso and zzso zzso Increased purity and yield of specific products favorably enhanced zzso evaluation and interpretation of results using direct sequencing and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis when point zzso were present in DNA from tumor cell lines and zzso
