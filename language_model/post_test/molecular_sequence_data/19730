In cultivated barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spikes produce three times as many seeds per spike as do zzso zzso The zzso of this trait is the zzso gene zzso located on zzso zzso which is zzso with rice zzso zzso zzso 4 and zzso We exploited zzso zzso to increase marker density in the zzso region as a prelude to its zzso zzso The rice zzso zzso covering a zzso zzso zzso identified barley zzso linked to zzso A high level of conservation of gene sequence was obtained between barley zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso A total of 22 zzso zzso markers were placed within the target region, and the linear order of these markers in barley and rice was zzso The genetic window containing zzso was narrowed from zzso to zzso zzso which facilitated covering the zzso region by a 518 zzso barley zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso sequence revealed that a rice zzso zzso is present on zzso 7, suggesting a zzso of the zzso segment containing zzso within barley zzso zzso The breakdown of zzso illustrates the limitations of zzso zzso and stresses the importance of implementing zzso studies directly in the target zzso
