Studies involving the zzso of DNA sequences by modified zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso have revealed potential applications for functional zzso zzso of a replacement, zzso or zzso zzso has already been achieved with molecules having lengths between 25 and 74 zzso But, other zzso parameters still remain to be zzso Here, the position of the single base in the zzso directing the zzso was examined and the optimal site was found to be at or near the center of the zzso If that position is staggered 3' or zzso the zzso of gene repair in zzso zzso The potential of a single zzso to direct two zzso changes at a specific site in a target sequence was also zzso Both targeted bases are corrected together at the same frequency if the sites are separated by three zzso but conversion linkage decreases zzso when the distance is expanded to 15 and 27 zzso zzso These results suggest that single zzso can be used to direct zzso exchange at two independent sites, a reaction characteristic that may be useful for many zzso zzso
