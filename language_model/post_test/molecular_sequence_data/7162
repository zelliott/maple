The vast majority of surface molecules in such zzso zzso as members of the zzso zzso contain zzso and are either zzso zzso zzso or zzso that are zzso to the external surface of the plasma membrane by zzso zzso We have shown that the zzso precursor for these abundant zzso zzso is zzso across the zzso plasma membrane by a specific zzso that is structurally related to zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso has been expressed and characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp experiments demonstrate that this protein is a zzso zzso zzso that appears to zzso a zzso zzso to concentrate zzso within the zzso zzso experiments with a zzso zzso zzso reveal the presence of this protein in the zzso plasma zzso
