A series of zzso acid zzso were carried out in the zzso loop of zzso zzso to investigate their effects on binding of the envelope to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso replacement of two adjacent zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso that bound neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A similar substitution of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso half of zzso disrupted binding to zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the envelope gave rise to a zzso that was not zzso These data suggest a close linkage between zzso and zzso binding zzso of zzso although zzso zzso directed to zzso do not block binding of zzso to zzso We propose that differences in the modes of interactions of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso and zzso may be responsible for the observed different zzso properties of the two zzso zzso
