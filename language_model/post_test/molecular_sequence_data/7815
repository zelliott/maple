The zzso (also known as zzso gene of zzso zzso has previously been identified as being necessary for zzso production at 37 degrees zzso We have cloned two zzso from a zzso library of zzso coli, which can restore zzso to an zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso regions of both zzso were localized by zzso restriction zzso One of the zzso coli genes identified here has not previously been zzso we have named this gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso It encodes a zzso zzso protein with no zzso to any other zzso The other zzso zzso is a regulator involved in zzso regulation in zzso zzso Either gene will restore zzso to an zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to regulate at least two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which form a complex in zzso zzso When we examined the ability of the zzso coli zzso to regulate zzso we found that zzso but not zzso was able to restore zzso activity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to restore growth of the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso 20, which zzso other zzso zzso
