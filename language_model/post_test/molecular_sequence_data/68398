We have investigated the DNA zzso patterns in zzso imprinted genes of the zzso Both zzso and zzso are associated with clear-cut regions of zzso paternal modification in late embryonic and adult zzso By using a sensitive zzso zzso it was possible to follow the zzso state of individual zzso sites in these genes through zzso and zzso Most of these zzso zzso are not zzso modified in the mature zzso and also become totally zzso in the early zzso in a manner similar to zzso zzso zzso Thus, the overall zzso zzso pattern at these sites must be established later during zzso after the zzso zzso In contrast, sites in an zzso gene zzso and one zzso zzso in the zzso upstream region have zzso modification patterns which are established either in the zzso or shortly after zzso and are preserved throughout zzso zzso These studies suggest that only a few DNA modifications at selective positions in imprinted genes may be candidates for playing a role in the maintenance of parental identity during zzso
