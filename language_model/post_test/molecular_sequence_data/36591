The zzso represent a highly diverse zzso of zzso zzso proteins that can be divided into several distinct zzso One of the families, called zzso zzso zzso with interrupted zzso family, contains molecules that appear to be associated with zzso zzso composed of members of the zzso collagen zzso We have determined a portion of the primary structure of a recently discovered member of the zzso family, chicken alpha zzso zzso based on cloning and sequencing zzso A synthetic zzso from within the zzso zzso domain of the alpha zzso chain has been used for generating specific zzso zzso The zzso zzso recognizes a 220 zzso zzso in zzso of extracts of chicken skin, zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso generated from zzso zzso material, gives a sequence identical to that derived from zzso sequencing, providing strong support for the type zzso of zzso We have examined the expression of type XIV collagen in developing chick zzso by zzso of sections from zzso zzso with zzso and by Northern zzso analysis of zzso from several zzso from both 12- and zzso zzso The results show that type XIV collagen is prevalent within relatively dense zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of lungs and liver, and blood zzso
