zzso detection of zzso zzso in biological specimens is rendered difficult by the extensive zzso of zzso zzso genes and the suppressed expression of some genes in many zzso The goal of the present study was to zzso define a domain of the zzso zzso sequence that is both highly zzso among zzso zzso strains and also specific to the species, and zzso to develop and validate specific and sensitive molecular methods for the detection of zzso zzso We used a combination of in zzso and molecular approaches to achieve sensitive and specific detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We zzso two zzso from patients living in different zzso and demonstrated that a zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso in those strains and in published zzso Within this zzso zzso we defined a zzso domain that is zzso zzso in most zzso zzso strains available in zzso and also is specific for zzso zzso This zzso was then used to design zzso a set of high quality zzso zzso and probe that zzso a zzso sequence and included at least two zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the approaches were then demonstrated by using gastric biopsy specimens from patients and zzso zzso This zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso sequence is highly zzso among most zzso zzso strains and allows specific zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso in biological zzso
