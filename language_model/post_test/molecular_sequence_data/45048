zzso alternatively spliced genes may provide complex targets for disease zzso zzso changes created by zzso zzso may zzso affect the activity of alternative gene products, whereas zzso silent and zzso zzso may alter zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a human gene zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium channels associated with bursting behavior in zzso and has been linked to more than 30 zzso apparently zzso to childhood absence zzso zzso and other idiopathic generalized zzso zzso zzso properties, including the effects of zzso zzso have been evaluated previously for a single zzso form of zzso expressed in transformed cell zzso We here show that zzso is alternatively spliced at zzso sites, capable of generating both functional and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso point to likely differences in gating behavior, sensitivity to zzso and interactions with zzso zzso zzso profiles of selected zzso zzso forms reveal variations in zzso and zzso gating zzso most likely to affect membrane zzso These were comparable to or larger than changes reported for previously studied zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were clustered near segments associated with anomalous zzso zzso and silent zzso were found to zzso create or change the regulatory specificity of predicted zzso zzso zzso sequences that may control zzso zzso We discuss a paradigm for zzso expression of zzso zzso which may influence future basic and clinical zzso
