zzso bite hypersensitivity zzso is an zzso allergic zzso of horses caused by bites of insects such as zzso or zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to compare the zzso pattern of zzso of zzso horses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso extracts zzso Individual zzso responses to proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated in 15 zzso and three healthy horses on zzso Fourteen out of the 15 zzso but none of the healthy horses showed individual zzso binding patterns to seven and six main protein bands in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These 14 zzso showed zzso to proteins from zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso but they reacted with fewer protein bands derived from zzso zzso than from zzso zzso zzso zzso showing zzso to a 32 zzso band from zzso zzso always bound to a 32 zzso band from zzso zzso Similarly, all zzso binding to a 70 zzso band from zzso zzso reacted with a corresponding band in zzso zzso zzso The 70 zzso bands from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified by mass zzso as heat shock zzso
