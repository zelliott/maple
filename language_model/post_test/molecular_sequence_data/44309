The zzso of the zzso of four German zzso of zzso mosaic zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The sequence data covered the 3' zzso region zzso coat protein and part of the nuclear inclusion b zzso genes of the zzso Comparisons of the sequences revealed that the investigated zzso are very closely zzso An alignment of the predicted coat protein zzso acid sequences of the German zzso with sequence data for other members of the zzso zzso in particular the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a limited degree of zzso indicating that the German zzso may represent a distinct zzso However, this is mainly due to the previously reported unexpected sequence diversity in the surface exposed zzso region of coat protein of zzso zzso Comparisons of the zzso acid sequences of the core region of the coat proteins and the zzso sequences of the 3' zzso clearly show that the German zzso are strains of zzso
