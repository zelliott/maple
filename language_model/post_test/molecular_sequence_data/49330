A reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso deduced from the zzso 1 zzso region of the zzso C virus zzso zzso was developed for zzso zzso The sensitivity and specificity of this zzso tested against two zzso reference panels containing zzso 1 through 5 zzso were similar to those of an zzso zzso from the zzso region zzso The sensitivity of the zzso typing zzso in the more variable zzso region was, however, lower than that of the zzso in the highly zzso zzso when testing multiple clinical zzso Thus, 71 zzso of 81 consecutive samples from hospitalized Danish patients positive for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were positive also in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the E1 sequences obtained by direct sequencing of zzso from two reference panels and 71 Danish patients allowed us to readily distinguish the zzso In contrast, zzso analysis of their corresponding zzso sequences was able to predict only major zzso Three different zzso and four zzso were identified among Danish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An isolate from a zzso refugee was identified as a new zzso type related to zzso zzso described as zzso zzso The most common zzso in Denmark is zzso 1 zzso which is the most difficult to zzso However, Denmark had the highest prevalence in Europe of zzso zzso which responds more favorably to zzso The described zzso zzso with sequencing is suggested as an easy routine zzso for definitive zzso and zzso of zzso
