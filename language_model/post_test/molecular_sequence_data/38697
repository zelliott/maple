We report the identification of a human zzso zzso a 25 zzso protein of relevant evolutionary and zzso interest zzso zzso was cloned by screening a B zzso zzso library with a probe generated by zzso differential zzso zzso zzso acid sequence is zzso similar to the avian zzso zzso expressed within the blood islands and in the liver during avian zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain tandem repeats zzso of the late zzso abundant zzso zzso characteristic of a group of survival molecules and originally thought to be present only in plant zzso Interestingly, zzso expression is high in the fetal liver, a major site for B cell zzso while the zzso levels in other fetal zzso such as the brain, zzso and kidney are comparatively zzso At the adult stage, zzso expression is drastically reduced in the liver but exhibits high zzso levels in the zzso brain, lung and kidney zzso suggesting that zzso expression may be important for the development of vital and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is also highly expressed in the adult zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso further stressing that at the adult stage, zzso expression may be important during secondary immune zzso zzso with this hypothesis, the expression of zzso is zzso within zzso centers zzso a stage in which B zzso are under a stressful selection zzso Taken together these zzso zzso strongly support the notion that the zzso zzso motif represents a zzso link between plants and animals, zzso reveal a novel zzso whose expression may play a role in the maturation of distinct human zzso and zzso suggest that zzso expression may be important for zzso B zzso
