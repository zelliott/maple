zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso involving in fruit zzso and stress responses are poorly zzso In the present study, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated and characterized from banana zzso The full-length zzso sequence was zzso zzso with an zzso frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso 315 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that expression of zzso gene is induced by external and internal zzso during fruit zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcript was also obviously enhanced by zzso hormones, including zzso zzso zzso acid, and hydrogen zzso zzso as well as zzso such as chilling and pathogen zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could interact with a zzso factor zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may be related to zzso and stress responses of banana fruit, and be likely functionally zzso with zzso in these zzso zzso 

zzso may be related to zzso and stress responses of banana fruit, and it also could interact with zzso zzso which expands the very limited information regarding the functions of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
