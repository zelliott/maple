Recently, we isolated a new complementary DNA zzso zzso human zzso organic zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso of human zzso The aim of this study was to isolate a rat counterpart of human zzso and examine the expression regulation of its zzso zzso zzso to clarify the molecular basis of zzso 

A rat liver zzso library was screened with human zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso expression system was used for functional zzso Northern zzso analyses were performed using the isolated zzso zzso zzso The zzso duct zzso model and the zzso zzso and puncture model were used for expression zzso 

zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso predicting at least 11 zzso zzso The overall zzso with human zzso was zzso which is the highest among all known organic zzso zzso zzso also belongs to the same new gene family as human zzso located between the organic zzso zzso family and the zzso zzso zzso preferably zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso is exclusively expressed in the zzso In both the zzso duct zzso model and the zzso zzso and puncture model, zzso expression levels of zzso were zzso 

zzso is a counterpart of human zzso and is one of the important zzso in rat liver for the clearance of zzso zzso The expression of zzso may be under feedback regulation of zzso by zzso obstruction and/or zzso
