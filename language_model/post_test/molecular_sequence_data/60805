The interaction of the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with its zzso sequences leads to a 45 degrees to 50 degrees zzso at a central zzso base step towards the major groove, as zzso zzso zzso zzso between these bases from the minor zzso The resulting broadening of the minor groove increases the accessibility of the six central zzso towards minor groove interactions with zzso from zzso It has been shown that zzso 55 of zzso makes a direct contact with the zzso base zzso directly zzso to the central zzso zzso step in the zzso zzso operator zzso We have investigated the importance of this interaction in the specificity and affinity of zzso zzso zzso for its operators and we have studied a zzso of zzso in which zzso is replaced with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with duplex DNA containing zzso operator sequences varied at position 8 were investigated zzso and binding studies were performed using zzso zzso The structures of the zzso complexes reveal a relatively zzso global zzso regardless of the identity of the zzso at position 8 or zzso zzso In all structures the combination of higher resolution and a zzso zzso operator site allowed several new zzso interactions to be observed, including contacts by zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso makes productive, though zzso interactions with the zzso zzso or zzso base at position 8 that result in equilibrium zzso zzso of zzso zzso 10 zzso and 35 zzso zzso However, the bulk of the zzso zzso apparently blocks zzso binding of operators with zzso at position 8 zzso zzso Also, the zzso binding zzso appears zzso as zzso of zzso bound to DNA with zzso at position 8 could not be zzso In complexes containing zzso the zzso zzso is too far removed to engage in van der zzso interactions with the operator, and, with the loss of the general zzso interaction between the zzso backbone and the ammonium group of zzso zzso binds each operator zzso However, the zzso leads to a swap of specificity of zzso for the base at position 8, with zzso exhibiting a twofold preference for zzso over zzso In addition to defining the role of zzso in zzso minor groove zzso these studies provide structural insight into the minor groove binding zzso of other zzso family members that have either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the comparable zzso
