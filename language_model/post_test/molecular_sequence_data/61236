The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso has been investigated in different zzso systems in two mouse zzso zzso and zzso In comparison with zzso incomplete zzso zzso and zzso ammonium zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso induced maximum zzso in the two mouse zzso As compared with controls, zzso with zzso resulted in significantly greater protection in animals challenged with 1 zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso on the basis of survival rates and number of zzso in the infected zzso 30 days after zzso The degree of protection provided by zzso was similar to that obtained with zzso and higher than zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso can be used as an efficient carrier system for the key zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso
