X protein of zzso B virus zzso is a zzso to a wide variety of viral and cellular zzso regulatory zzso Since zzso does not act on a common zzso element of a wide variety of regulatory elements nor does it bind to DNA directly, it has been proposed that zzso acts indirectly through zzso interactions with other zzso factors or signal zzso zzso In order to determine the functional domain of zzso we have constructed and analyzed a number of deletion and site specific zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso sequences were found in the zzso region of zzso and were very important for its zzso zzso In the analysis of deletion zzso seven zzso and strong basic zzso acids zzso acids zzso were essential for the zzso activity of zzso
