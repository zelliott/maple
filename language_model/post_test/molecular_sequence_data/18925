zzso zzso are frequently considered as critical zzso in protein structure and zzso Recent advances in zzso methods for DNA sequencing and zzso stability measurement have enabled effective exploration of zzso relationships in local protein zzso Using these zzso technologies, we investigated the zzso relationships of six zzso regions zzso and ten zzso zzso in the variable zzso of a model vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso variable zzso zzso whose sequence had been zzso via a zzso zzso The results show that only a handful of zzso involving long-range zzso interactions distant from the zzso site are strongly coupled with zzso zzso This implies that the zzso are passive regions in protein zzso the essential sequences of these regions are dictated by zzso zzso interactions and the consensus local zzso features contribute little to protein stability and zzso
