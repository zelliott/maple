Nuclear zzso zzso zzso induce zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso through an yet unknown rapid zzso zzso Vice versa, zzso are targets for zzso by zzso By multiple alignment of the zzso acid sequences and comparative analysis of the secondary and zzso structures we identified four peptides in zzso with similarity to bona fide zzso motifs in zzso In both zzso species, these motifs mediate selective zzso to zzso partners, zzso or zzso We therefore propose that similar motifs may direct the zzso association of zzso with zzso Based on mutual zzso interactions within a zzso complex, we discuss a novel principle how zzso may regulate zzso activity and thus expression of zzso zzso
