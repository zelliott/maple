zzso wounds are prone to infection by zzso zzso which is an opportunistic pathogen causing various human zzso During infection, the zzso senses environmental changes and regulates the expression of genes appropriate for zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was unable to replicate efficiently on burn wounds, suggesting that burn wounds are zzso zzso An in zzso expression technology based on zzso gene expression was applied to the burned mouse infection model to isolate zzso zzso genes that are specifically induced during zzso Four such in zzso zzso genetic zzso were identified, including the gene for a zzso response regulator zzso the gene for a zzso zzso G zzso zzso an zzso transcript of a putative regulator responding to copper zzso and an zzso genetic zzso zzso of zzso coli is known to regulate genes involved in protecting the zzso against zzso zzso The expression of zzso was proven to be highly zzso during the infection of burned mice and also zzso by treatment with zzso which is a zzso zzso generating zzso zzso The zzso protein functions as an zzso in the absence of zzso whereas in the presence of zzso this zzso is zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso was shown to be much more sensitive than zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In support of this zzso a zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significant delay in causing systemic infections in the burned zzso Since most mortality in burn patients is caused by systemic infection, the zzso in the ability to cause efficient zzso in burned mice suggests an important role of the zzso gene in the infection of burn zzso
