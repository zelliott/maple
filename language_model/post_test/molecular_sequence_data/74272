zzso attachment of small zzso modifier zzso to proteins regulates multiple processes in the zzso zzso In numerous cases zzso is facilitated by protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso zzso characterized by the presence of a zzso domain related to the zzso finger of many zzso zzso zzso The importance of zzso relies on its capacity to bind the zzso zzso of the zzso Additional zzso may participate in zzso zzso function and target zzso We have studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso family, and describe zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso protein interacting with zzso zzso of zzso zzso its capacity to bind zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso as other plant zzso zzso also includes a zzso zzso We found that the zzso domain binds zzso and contributes to the zzso zzso function, being partially and absolutely required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on the capacity of zzso and zzso to associate with both the zzso and zzso zzso we propose a model of interactions to explain zzso zzso of zzso and zzso function of the zzso zzso
