Point zzso were selectively introduced into a zzso for guinea pig zzso zzso zzso each construct was then expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular site chosen for study is a zzso zzso sequence that resembles the zzso zzso motif for zzso and zzso proteins and is located near the C zzso of all steroid and zzso zzso for which the primary structures are zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the zzso motif is essential for binding the activated zzso donor zzso zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to ascertain the relative importance of each individual zzso of the zzso While the zzso of a single motif zzso had little effect on the interaction between zzso and zzso as determined by kinetic analysis and zzso zzso the zzso of any two zzso in concert resulted in an approximate zzso increase in the zzso for zzso and reduced zzso zzso The zzso of all three motif zzso resulted in an inactive zzso and complete loss of zzso zzso Interestingly, several zzso also displayed a striking effect on the zzso for the steroid zzso double zzso again, demonstrated greater zzso zzso to zzso zzso than did single zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso had a negligible effect on the zzso for zzso a marked increase in the zzso for the zzso zzso ( zzso zzso was zzso On the basis of these findings, it is concluded that the sequence zzso within the zzso domain of zzso represents a critical component of the active zzso
