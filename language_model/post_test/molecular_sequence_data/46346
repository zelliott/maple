A cascade of alternative zzso factors zzso the program of zzso gene expression during zzso in zzso zzso Little is known, however, about how the zzso zzso factors are zzso and replaced by the zzso zzso Here we identify a small zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso that is required for efficient switching from zzso to zzso gene expression in the zzso compartment of the developing zzso The fin zzso which is zzso among zzso species and species of related zzso is transcribed in the zzso under the control of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso for fin are unable to fully zzso zzso and, conversely, are unable to fully activate zzso zzso with their zzso in zzso gene zzso fin cells are arrested in large numbers following the zzso stage of zzso ultimately forming zzso fewer zzso spores than the wild zzso Based in part on the similarity of zzso to the zzso factor zzso (also called zzso we speculate that zzso is an zzso factor which, by disabling zzso promotes the switch to late zzso gene expression in the zzso
