zzso zzso zzso zzso are large modular zzso responsible for the synthesis of a variety of microbial zzso zzso They consist of zzso that each zzso and incorporate one specific zzso acid into the zzso zzso A module comprises several zzso which carry out the individual reaction zzso After zzso by the zzso domain, the zzso acid zzso is zzso zzso to a zzso zzso of a zzso carrier domain zzso that passes the zzso to the reaction zzso of the consecutive zzso 

The solution structure of zzso a distinct zzso carrier protein derived from the equivalent domain of an zzso was solved using zzso zzso zzso is a distorted zzso bundle with an extended loop between the first two zzso Its overall fold resembles the zzso of zzso carrier proteins zzso from zzso coli fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso however, the surface polarity and the length and relative alignment of the zzso are zzso The zzso zzso which is the zzso site, has the same location as in the zzso and is situated within a stretch of seven flexible zzso 

The structure of zzso reflects its character as a protein zzso The fold is well defined between zzso 8 and 82 and the structural core of the zzso domain can now be defined as a region spanning 37 zzso acids in both directions from the zzso zzso The flexibility of the zzso modified site might have implications for interactions with the cooperating proteins or zzso zzso
