De zzso designed zzso motifs can fold into zzso zzso structures if zzso or groups of zzso are incorporated at the zzso boundary to form zzso sites that restrict the zzso degrees of freedom of the zzso zzso zzso the relationship between structure and function of zzso constraints therefore forms the basis for the engineering of zzso zzso This paper describes the design of an zzso zzso zzso zzso pair and the zzso stability of the folded zzso zzso 

zzso a zzso with 43 zzso acid zzso has been designed to fold into a hairpin zzso motif that can zzso to form a zzso zzso The folded motif is in slow zzso exchange on the zzso zzso and has a zzso zzso zzso spectrum, a narrow temperature zzso for zzso zzso and a zzso CD spectrum with some fine zzso The zzso stability is pH dependent with an optimum that zzso to the pH for maximum formation of a zzso zzso pair between zzso in zzso I and zzso in zzso zzso 

The formation of an zzso salt bridge is strongly suggested by the pH dependence of a number of zzso zzso to generate a zzso zzso structure in a designed zzso zzso The zzso stability of the folded motif is not increased by the formation of the salt bridge, but zzso zzso are zzso The use of this novel design principle in combination with zzso interactions that provide sufficient binding energy in the folded structure should be of general use in de zzso design of zzso zzso
