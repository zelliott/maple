Growth zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are structurally and functionally related members of the zzso zzso a group of hormones important in development, growth, and zzso Our objectives were to determine the zzso expression pattern of the zzso gene using the zzso zzso The zzso and spatial expression pattern of the zzso gene was examined by zzso and in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso transcript was expressed throughout development beginning at the transition between the zzso and zzso zzso During zzso alternative zzso resulted in the generation of a novel transcript lacking the cryptic zzso During the zzso period, expression was localized to the neural tube, developing eye, and neural zzso strong expression was found in the developing zzso Later in development, expression was localized in the zzso zzso and developing zzso zzso The zzso and spatial expression pattern of the zzso transcript suggests that these hormones may zzso patterning during zzso
