A zzso detection based on zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso of zzso zzso was developed in the present zzso zzso different ITS sequences were amplified from 6 strains of zzso zzso by universal zzso By sequencing and alignment of these sequences to the other zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso pneumoniae, zzso and zzso were designed for amplification of the ITS sequence from the zzso containing zzso and zzso Ten type strains and 21 zzso of zzso zzso were positive to the zzso zzso and all of the zzso zzso reference strains (79 zzso were zzso The enrichment was performed in this procedure with a modified growth media to enrich zzso zzso from zzso zzso g infant formula to about zzso zzso in 900 zzso of the zzso Combination of the enrichment, with the zzso zzso can detect zzso zzso g infant formula of zzso zzso within 48 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso were identified by this method in 63 infant formula zzso
