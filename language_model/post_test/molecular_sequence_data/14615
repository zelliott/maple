The minor zzso of zzso within zzso is strongly associated with reduced Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso The mechanism underlying this association is zzso Here, we report that zzso and zzso are the two primary zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso share zzso zzso but differ in zzso 1 and zzso zzso The expression of both zzso and zzso was increased in individuals with significant zzso zzso However, only zzso was associated with the zzso zzso with the minor zzso zzso zzso being associated with increased zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso are predicted to zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, we compared their zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso is present in the zzso pathway, accumulates in the zzso media, and is similar in size to zzso in human zzso Overall, we interpret these results as indicating that the zzso minor zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso appear to produce similar proteins and are increased in zzso the zzso afforded by the zzso zzso may reflect increased soluble zzso throughout zzso
