zzso zzso are a common cause of zzso respiratory tract infections and an occasional cause of zzso zzso A zzso method for the detection of zzso in respiratory samples was evaluated and was compared to zzso The procedure can be performed in 6 to 8 h with a commercially available DNA extraction kit zzso Valencia, zzso and by zzso with gel zzso zzso is performed with zzso previously determined to amplify a zzso product within the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso We can specifically detect the clinically significant zzso species including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso detects 10 zzso zzso two zzso of zzso DNA in each zzso Of 212 clinical specimens examined by culture, zzso of the zzso samples zzso of 31) were positive by this zzso By gel detection of amplification products, 12 of 181 zzso samples were positive for zzso species by zzso resulting in zzso zzso Four of the 12 samples with zzso results zzso negative, zzso zzso were confirmed to be positive for zzso species by sequencing of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso that is described demonstrates high sensitivity and high specificity for routine detection of zzso in respiratory zzso
