zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that interacts in a zzso manner to form linear filaments at low zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso ability to bind zzso and both properties depend on intact zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso of the zzso of the muscle zzso zzso can be zzso by an zzso zzso fusion in zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso fragment, corresponding to the zzso first 260 zzso plus an zzso fusion zzso zzso to a much greater extent than the corresponding full-length zzso zzso despite the absence of the zzso 24 zzso zzso This zzso is sensitive to zzso strength and is greatly reduced by the removal of the zzso zzso fusion zzso CD studies show that zzso zzso fragments, which terminate at position 260 zzso and zzso as well as zzso are able to interact with zzso a zzso zzso fragment, and that the zzso interactions observed for these zzso pairs are accompanied by a significant degree of folding of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the new zzso created by the zzso zzso in a manner similar to the full-length zzso zzso binding for fragments terminating at position 260 may be explained by the presence of a greater concentration of zzso charged zzso while, at the same time, maintaining a zzso pattern of charged and zzso zzso found in zzso zzso from a variety of zzso
