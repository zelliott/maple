A general system is described that zzso gene replacements such that the zzso strains are not zzso with zzso resistance zzso The method is based on the conditional replication of derivatives of the zzso zzso zzso which lacks the zzso gene zzso the replication initiation zzso Replacement zzso can be constructed in and isolated from zzso and zzso helper strains that provide zzso in zzso zzso formation of the integration zzso with the zzso of the target strain is selected by zzso zzso Resolution of the zzso structure is identified in the second step of the procedure by the loss of the zzso reporter gene present in the delivery zzso The second zzso event results either in gene replacement or in restoration of the original copy of the zzso As no zzso resistance marker is present in the zzso of the zzso the system can be used to introduce multiple zzso in one zzso A feasibility study was performed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso as model zzso The results indicate that the method should be zzso to any zzso gene in numerous bacterial zzso
