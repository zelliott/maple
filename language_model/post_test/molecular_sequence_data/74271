zzso zzso expressed primarily in zzso and zzso play important roles in innate and zzso immune responses to microbial zzso Six zzso zzso zzso forming three indispensable zzso bonds and one zzso zzso required structurally for an zzso zzso are totally zzso in the otherwise diverse sequences of all known zzso zzso In addition, a pair of zzso charged zzso zzso forming a salt bridge across a protruding loop in the zzso is highly zzso To investigate the structural and functional roles of the zzso zzso salt bridge in human zzso 5 zzso we chemically prepared zzso and its precursor zzso as well as their corresponding salt zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso whereas significantly reducing the zzso folding efficiency of zzso had no effect on the folding of zzso zzso zzso zzso and correctly processed zzso in zzso but spontaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso was resistant to zzso treatment, whereas zzso was highly zzso Further, degradation of zzso by zzso was initiated by the zzso of the zzso zzso bond in the loop region, a catastrophic zzso event resulting directly in quick zzso of the whole zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not alter the zzso activity of zzso against zzso zzso but substantially enhanced the killing of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso were largely inactive against both strains at the zzso zzso Our results confirm that the primary function of the zzso salt bridge in zzso is to ensure correct processing of zzso and subsequent stabilization of mature zzso in zzso
