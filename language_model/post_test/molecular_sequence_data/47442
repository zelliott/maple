zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso in the rat both in zzso and in zzso with the duration of zzso zzso determining the zzso nature of the P action, probably through zzso zzso of the anterior zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P has been also shown to regulate anterior zzso levels of zzso zzso in the zzso Although the mechanism of this action has not been determined, steroids may regulate gene expression through the binding of zzso receptors to gene sequences known as hormone response elements zzso however, it is not known whether zzso exist on the rat zzso zzso We have localized a series of zzso response elements zzso sequences on the rat zzso gene and have begun testing the hypothesis that P zzso the expression of the rat zzso gene through the direct binding of the zzso complex to these zzso zzso zzso shift zzso indicate that these zzso sequences bind zzso with high affinity and zzso In addition, when a zzso pair zzso which contains the three zzso sequences localized in the upstream region of the zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso driven by a zzso promoter and zzso zzso into anterior zzso cell cultures, zzso stimulation zzso increased zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso pair sequence zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The data further suggest that zzso synthesis in the rat is modulated by direct binding of zzso to zzso zzso
