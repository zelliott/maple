The human zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso Despite evidence that members of this protein family may be targeted by zzso zzso this has yet to be zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso is a target for zzso zzso zzso in zzso and that it is zzso from zzso zzso by zzso that recognize both zzso and zzso zzso We further observed that upon treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso the fluorescent zzso zzso to zzso structures in the cell zzso In subsequent zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso Our findings indicate the importance of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso
