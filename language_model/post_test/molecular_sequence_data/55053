zzso protein 60 zzso is ubiquitous and highly zzso being present in zzso and zzso including zzso This zzso although typically a zzso zzso can also be found in other zzso sites, zzso and in zzso Thus, it can signal the immune system and participate in the development of inflammation and immune zzso Both phenomena can be zzso by human and foreign zzso zzso bacterial zzso when released into the blood by infectious zzso zzso all these zzso proteins become part of a complex zzso response characterized by multiple cross reactions because of their structural zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso proteins from humans and two common zzso zzso zzso and zzso pneumoniae, share various sequence segments of potentially highly zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural data indicate that zzso zzso implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso could very well be zzso and/or maintained by zzso and/or bacterial zzso
