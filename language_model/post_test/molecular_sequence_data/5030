zzso from membrane receptors through zzso zzso zzso alpha and G beta zzso to zzso zzso is a highly regulated zzso zzso zzso causes exchange of zzso for zzso on G alpha and zzso of G alpha from G beta zzso Both zzso remain zzso and interact with a series of other molecules throughout the cycle of zzso The zzso binding domain of G alpha zzso interacts with the membrane by several partially defined zzso the zzso of G alpha to the more zzso G beta gamma zzso the interaction of zzso lipids zzso and/or zzso with the zzso and attachment of zzso acid regions to the membrane zzso acids zzso of Go alpha zzso zzso Boutin and zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso We characterized zzso zzso of Go alpha with known G beta zzso properties for the ability to interact with zzso zzso and zzso prepared from cultured cells zzso zzso In zzso analysis allows membrane interactions that are important to the activated and zzso state of G alpha to be zzso zzso zzso was also determined in zzso zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso proteins are zzso and differences in zzso do not account for changes in membrane zzso zzso the zzso zzso of Go alpha with a zzso point zzso at zzso zzso does not affect interactions with G beta gamma on zzso zzso but significantly reduces zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso zzso reduced G beta gamma zzso or deletion of zzso acids zzso zzso no zzso G beta gamma zzso further reduces zzso membrane zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso and zzso are localized in the membrane similar to zzso Go alpha as a result of the contribution from zzso In contrast, zzso is completely soluble in zzso cells, and no zzso is zzso The binding of Go alpha and zzso translated in zzso to zzso indicates that Go alpha zzso binds to neutral zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso zzso like Go zzso but zzso exhibits no zzso zzso Taken together, these studies suggest that interactions of the zzso of G alpha zzso with the membrane may be affected by both membrane proteins and zzso A detailed understanding of G zzso interactions may reveal unique mechanisms for regulating signal zzso
