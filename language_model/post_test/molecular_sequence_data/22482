There are few data on African children infected with zzso B zzso in endemic settings, which limits zzso about zzso and zzso zzso and zzso variations in host zzso and zzso negative factor zzso accessory protein may influence disease progression and have frequently been characterized in subjects infected with zzso B zzso 

In this descriptive study, we report zzso gene sequence variation and host genetic zzso in 32 Kenyan children, including 12 slow zzso 

zzso analysis identified zzso zzso A, C and D and a zzso zzso zzso zzso defective zzso genes or significant changes from relevant zzso reference sequences were not identified in children with delayed disease zzso 

zzso sequence variations may not be common in zzso infected African zzso Further studies are warranted in zzso subjects in settings where infection is zzso
