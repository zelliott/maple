zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso interference zzso technology can be achieved using small interfering zzso zzso or short hairpin zzso zzso However, the relative effectiveness of these two approaches is not zzso It is also not clear whether zzso zzso transcribed from an zzso zzso II zzso zzso promoter in a fusion form can disrupt the targeted gene zzso Here, we report that using both zzso and zzso zzso genes as targets, both zzso and zzso approaches significantly silenced the targeted gene expression in cancer zzso We further demonstrated that zzso transcribed from an zzso Pol zzso promoter in a green fluorescent protein zzso fusion form at the zzso region silenced zzso and zzso expression as well, suggesting that the extra zzso sequence outside of the zzso hairpin does not disrupt zzso zzso We also showed that zzso of zzso expression selectively zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, we have validated multiple approaches of zzso technology using both zzso and zzso genes as targets and demonstrated for the first time that zzso transcribed from an zzso Pol zzso promoter could mediate gene zzso which may lead to new directions for the application of zzso zzso
