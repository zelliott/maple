We have identified the zzso zzso zzso from a bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a recently described family of zzso zzso that are highly zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained two zzso zzso zzso that corresponded to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequences of two zzso zzso showed significant similarities to those of zzso typical zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli was demonstrated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirmed that zzso was expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso likely uses zzso as a way to reduce zzso as a control of its zzso zzso balance so that it can live and grow in the host zzso
