In zzso conditions are reported under which an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso will enhance zzso from an adjacent zzso zzso I zzso Enhancement is largely independent of orientation and distance and is zzso to copy zzso zzso experiments reveal that two separate regions of the zzso zzso are independently capable of promoter zzso These regions appear to zzso to elements which have been shown by previous workers to cause enhancement in zzso Using the zzso zzso to limit the number of rounds of zzso from each promoter, we found that the degree of enhancement is similar whether one or many rounds of zzso zzso This finding supports a model in which the zzso increases the number of stable promoter complexes but does not alter the loading of zzso on an active zzso Once the stable promoter complex is formed, the zzso can be physically severed from the promoter with no loss of zzso Likewise, the upstream zzso region of the promoter can be severed from the core promoter domain once the stable complex has been zzso These results are interpreted to mean that the zzso functions only to assist stable complex formation and, once that is accomplished, the zzso is zzso
