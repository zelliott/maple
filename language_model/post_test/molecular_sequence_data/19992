zzso is an zzso domain containing zzso that appears to be a negative regulator of zzso To the potential effects of zzso on zzso zzso and migration of cancer cells, three zzso zzso zzso were made: zzso zzso zzso These zzso forms were zzso as well as the wild type zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso into zzso expression zzso then zzso into and zzso zzso and its zzso in a zzso zzso cell line zzso The results showed that zzso of wild type of zzso does not affect the zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso cells, but can induce zzso zzso while either zzso zzso the zzso domain, zzso domain, or C zzso deletion zzso could significantly block the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells and suppress cell invasion zzso The results confirmed zzso as a negative regulator for cell migration and invasion in transformed cells, and implied that it may function through each of its three zzso
