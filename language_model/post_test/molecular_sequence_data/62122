While searching for potential candidate molecules relevant for the zzso of zzso we discovered a zzso pair zzso zzso a novel putative zzso acid integral membrane protein that we called zzso The putative zzso frame was confirmed with zzso against zzso peptides that labeled a protein of approximately 48 zzso in extracts of zzso zzso tissue and also detected zzso expressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells and analysis by surface zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso is indeed a zzso zzso zzso is able to target to zzso zzso junctions and interact with the zzso complex in polarized zzso and zzso canine kidney cells, but not with the zzso complex in zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction of zzso with zzso in in zzso pull-down zzso suggests that zzso might be one of the proteins that targets and/or retains zzso in the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was partially zzso in response to scatter factor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the plasma membrane to the zzso where it still zzso with zzso zzso In zzso we introduce zzso as a novel component of zzso zzso interacting with zzso complexes in polarized zzso zzso
