We have characterized the promoter of the human gene coding for the zzso L zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 3' deletion zzso indicate that the efficiency of the L promoter depends on both negative and positive zzso located upstream and downstream of the zzso start zzso zzso zzso analysis of this DNA region revealed the presence of five protected zzso The most upstream one zzso 1) zzso to the negative zzso and is recognized by zzso sharing a zzso zzso Three positive elements are in the region upstream of the start of zzso a fifth positive zzso zzso 5) is localized in the first zzso of the L zzso
