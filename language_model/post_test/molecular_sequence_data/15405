As part of an ongoing research program dedicated to the understanding of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso seed coat, transgenic zzso plants carrying a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso fused to the zzso reporter gene zzso were zzso Analysis of these plants revealed that zzso was activated in zzso zzso seed coat, following a zzso pattern that was very similar to the PA deposition profile in zzso and also to the one previously described in zzso zzso activity occurred as soon as the early stages of zzso and was restricted to the cells where zzso were shown to zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter can be used to trigger gene expression in zzso zzso seed coat for both genetic engineering and functional validation of candidate zzso In addition, these data strongly suggest that the zzso regulatory network of the zzso gene is zzso between zzso and zzso This is consistent with the fact that similarity searches of the public zzso sequence databases allowed recovering the zzso zzso for several zzso regulators, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been previously described in zzso
