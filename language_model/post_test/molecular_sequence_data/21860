A synthetic zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from activated sludge of a zzso wastewater treatment facility and studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso showing highest sequence similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The polar zzso pattern, the presence of zzso and zzso zzso the predominance of the cellular fatty acids zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso and the zzso content of the zzso DNA also supported the affiliation of the strain with the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed low zzso zzso values with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on its zzso position and its zzso and zzso properties, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
