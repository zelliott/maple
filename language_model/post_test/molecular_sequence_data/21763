From August 2 to October 11, 2006, clusters of low zzso zzso North American lineage H5N1 and zzso avian influenza A viruses zzso and other zzso were recovered from zzso resident, wild zzso used as sentinels at one zzso The zzso zzso zzso potential, and zzso sequencing of the zzso determined the H5N1 and zzso zzso were only recovered from samples collected on zzso and zzso zzso However, subsequent efforts using next-generation sequencing zzso and additional zzso sequencing found partial zzso segments in other zzso virus combinations on zzso zzso and zzso It is well established that over larger geographic areas and years zzso form transient zzso zzso this sequential sampling data revealed that over a short period of time the dynamics of zzso can be active and newer sequencing platforms increase recognition of mixed zzso Both findings provide further insight into the natural history of zzso in natural zzso
