The full-length zzso c zzso zzso I gene zzso containing a group I zzso was isolated from an important medical fungus zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a predicted protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso The group I zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso and Northern analysis showed a mature transcript of spliced zzso Both zzso and zzso junctions were also found by zzso suggesting the possible presence of zzso zzso zzso in total zzso zzso comparison by zzso showed that the coding region of zzso zzso of zzso zzso had significant similarities to those of related species (such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso while the zzso had no significant zzso sequences of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso tree based on the zzso confirmed the present zzso status of related species, but the zzso zzso were zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibited specific zzso site and different zzso zzso The analysis of the folding zzso structures of the known zzso zzso from zzso species showed different base pairs and zzso regions zzso in their zzso The present results provide useful information on the studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
