zzso zzso and other zzso are zzso in the zzso and peripheral nervous system where they may zzso zzso zzso by interacting with zzso zzso zzso For this zzso activity, zzso have to be locally released from either zzso or zzso zzso We here identify the integral membrane protein zzso zzso resistance protein 8) as an zzso zzso pump for steroid zzso including zzso zzso and zzso it to zzso of the human zzso and peripheral nervous zzso zzso zzso was detected in human brain by real-time zzso chain zzso zzso raised against zzso served to detect the protein in brain by zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso found in the white matter of the brain and zzso with zzso indicating that it is an zzso zzso Additionally, zzso was localized to zzso of the peripheral nervous zzso For functional studies, zzso was expressed in polarized zzso canine kidney cells where it was sorted to the zzso zzso This zzso sorting is in accordance with the zzso of zzso to the zzso membrane of zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso with a zzso value of 21 zzso This transport function together with the zzso of the zzso protein in vicinity to zzso receptors is consistent with a role of zzso in zzso zzso release from zzso to sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings may provide a basis for the characterization of zzso in the human zzso gene and their linkage with neurological zzso
