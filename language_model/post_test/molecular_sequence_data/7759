We have identified and characterized a previously zzso human gene that is found within the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso On the basis of its location and its properties, this new gene has been designated zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso DNA and liver zzso clones revealed a zzso gene consisting of three zzso and two zzso Its 3' zzso lies 555 zzso upstream of zzso giving both genes the same zzso zzso The promoter of the zzso gene lacks a typical zzso box, consistent with an apparent zzso in zzso start zzso zzso protection analysis indicated relatively low zzso zzso levels in human liver, compared to zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso contains a putative zzso signal zzso and two potential zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons indicate a limited zzso between zzso and either zzso or zzso Since its zzso expression and predicted protein structure are characteristic of the other genes in this zzso we propose that the zzso gene is a member of the zzso gene zzso
