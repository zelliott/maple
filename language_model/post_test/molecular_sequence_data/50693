The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso locus has been previously localized to the zzso region zzso We have extended our previous linkage studies and analyzed linkage between the zzso locus and 10 marker zzso including five new zzso in 41 zzso Four of the marker zzso showed no zzso with the zzso zzso and six other zzso were also linked to the zzso locus with zzso zzso of zzso zzso analyses gave support to the placement of the zzso locus zzso to the zzso locus and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso Further ordering of the zzso could be zzso from a zzso zzso cell hybrid derived from an affected female with zzso and an zzso zzso and from studies of an affected male with zzso and a zzso zzso Three of the zzso marker zzso which showed no zzso with the zzso zzso when used in zzso were zzso in zzso of zzso The closely linked zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, and when used zzso they were doubly zzso in zzso of zzso The human zzso locus was defined by a zzso mouse probe zzso zzso zzso that zzso with the mouse zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso to the zzso zzso The absence of zzso between zzso and the zzso locus lends support to the hypothesis that the zzso locus in the mouse and the zzso locus in humans may contain candidate sequences for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
