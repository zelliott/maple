zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels are key regulators of zzso zzso zzso and vascular tone because of their ability to sense zzso zzso and zzso zzso In most zzso their stimulation results in a zzso zzso zzso current that reduces zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso channel zzso is found in cells like zzso cells and zzso zzso The molecular zzso underlying zzso zzso channels remain zzso zzso we report a zzso beta zzso zzso that yields zzso zzso currents on zzso with the zzso alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso application of zzso as well as deletion of 19 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso abolished zzso of the alpha zzso zzso fusion of these zzso zzso acids to the zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso leads to an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of a synthetic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso causes zzso of the zzso channel alpha zzso by zzso its zzso pore resembling the zzso caused by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso channels in native zzso can result from the association with different beta zzso
