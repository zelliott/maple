A partial zzso zzso zzso with the characteristics of zzso sequences was isolated from the Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso contains zzso zzso The first zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso The 139 zzso acids predicted from the zzso zzso have zzso zzso with the zzso zzso acids of the zzso protein of zzso The remaining zzso zzso have several features of a typical zzso long terminal repeat zzso For example, the first 14 zzso are identical to the zzso zzso repeat of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence at the 3' end is common to the R region of zzso zzso The zzso sequence was shown to have promoter zzso The activity is approximately twofold higher than that of the zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso lower than that of the early promoter of zzso zzso Two species of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in size were readily detected by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
