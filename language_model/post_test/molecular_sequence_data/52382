The aim of this study was to address whether there is a fundamental difference in regulation of zzso gene expression in cells that have become zzso but retain the ability to zzso compared with those cells that have zzso We compared multiple levels of regulation of zzso gene expression during zzso zzso zzso zzso cells induced to differentiate by treatment with insulin, zzso and zzso initially exhibited an increased zzso response compared with cells given serum zzso This initial differentiation response was associated with a twofold increase in both zzso gene zzso and cellular zzso zzso levels, as well as with enhanced zzso binding of nuclear factors to the zzso zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor beta 1, an inhibitor of zzso zzso increased both the percentage of zzso cells and the cellular levels of zzso zzso when given in addition to serum zzso but no enhancement of these parameters was observed upon addition of zzso beta 1 to the differentiation zzso Interestingly, although zzso beta 1 enhanced binding of nuclear factors to the zzso cell cycle regulatory element of the zzso promoter, these zzso interactions were not associated with an increase in zzso zzso Our results are consistent with the zzso of zzso gene expression at zzso being controlled primarily at the zzso level, in contrast to an increased involvement of zzso zzso at the onset of zzso
