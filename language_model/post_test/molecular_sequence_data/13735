The zzso hydrocarbon zzso responsiveness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human cancer cell lines was determined by the induction of zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso With the exception of zzso zzso breast cancer cell line, zzso zzso significantly induced zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso activity in the remaining six cell lines and, based on their zzso values, for zzso zzso zzso their zzso responsiveness followed the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, all the cell lines expressed the nuclear zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso which bound to a zzso consensus zzso responsive element zzso in a gel mobility shift zzso The results of gel zzso zzso a zzso density zzso zzso studies showed that the calculated Mr values for the nuclear zzso zzso complex varied from 175 zzso zzso zzso to 221 zzso and the apparent molecular weight of the nuclear zzso zzso complex zzso to a zzso zzso was 200 zzso The data show that the molecular properties and levels of the nuclear zzso zzso complex from seven different human cancer cell lines do not predict zzso zzso
