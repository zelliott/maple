Major surface protein 2 zzso is an zzso outer membrane protein of zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathogens that cause bovine zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso has a central zzso region zzso flanked by highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso During zzso zzso infection, dynamic and extensive zzso acid sequence variation in zzso occurs through zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso expression site, followed by sequential zzso gene zzso to generate additional zzso We hypothesized that zzso variation leads to significant changes in zzso cell recognition of zzso in the zzso T cell zzso were mapped using T cells from native zzso cattle and overlapping peptides spanning the most abundant of five different zzso zzso in the zzso Several zzso zzso potent zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso responses, including those in three discreet blocks of sequence that undergo zzso gene zzso zzso cell clones specific for an zzso in the block 1 region of the zzso zzso zzso type failed to respond to naturally occurring zzso However, some of these zzso were recognized by zzso T cell lines from zzso zzso indicating that the zzso sequences contain zzso zzso T cell zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso were not zzso for zzso T cells specific for the zzso zzso Dynamic zzso acid sequence variation in zzso results in escape from recognition by some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variation in zzso zzso cell and B cell zzso may contribute to immune evasion that allows long-term persistence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
