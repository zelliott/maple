zzso was found to slow the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso receptors expressed in the zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso When zzso complexes were formed in zzso and then dissolved in zzso or when these complexes were formed in solution, the toxin completely stopped the zzso of zzso for 6 zzso at 25 degrees zzso zzso complexes formed in zzso or in solution were also highly stable in solution at 25 degrees, as shown by the ability of the toxin to prevent the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes were equally stable, whereas zzso soluble receptors lost most of their ability to bind zzso within an zzso zzso complexes could be partially zzso by incubation at 37 degrees in the presence of zzso and zzso and the freed receptors were then zzso These results demonstrate that zzso binds zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and that the toxin can stabilize the zzso pocket of zzso receptors which contains and binds competitive zzso The zzso nature of the binding of zzso should prove to be useful for such unusual purposes as stabilizing the binding of readily zzso and/or zzso zzso specifically to zzso zzso for zzso labeled or zzso receptors by affinity techniques which recognize the zzso for recognizing receptors with genetically or zzso altered primary binding sites, and for stabilization of the native zzso of zzso receptors for structural zzso
