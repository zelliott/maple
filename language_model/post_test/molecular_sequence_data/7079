zzso zzso zzso by nuclear receptors is important in development, differentiation and zzso The mechanism underlying this effect is unknown but is one key to understanding the molecular basis of hormone zzso Here we identify a zzso factor, zzso as a zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a previously undiscovered protein whose association with receptors both in solution and bound to zzso elements is zzso by zzso The interaction with zzso receptors zzso with their zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso functions as a potent zzso and a zzso zzso domain fusion of zzso behaves as a frank zzso of a zzso zzso Together, our results identify a new class of zzso which may be important zzso of hormone zzso
