To gain insight into the role of zzso family zzso and their associated protein Max in zzso growth and development, we sought to identify zzso in the zebra fish zzso zzso A combination of a zzso chain zzso cloning strategy and zzso zzso screening allowed for the isolation of zebra fish zzso zzso and zzso and max zzso subsequent structural characterization showed a high degree of conservation in regions that zzso motifs of known functional zzso On the functional level, zebra fish Max, like its zzso counterpart, served to suppress the transformation activity of mouse zzso in rat zzso zzso In addition, the zebra fish zzso gene proved capable of cooperating with an activated zzso to effect the zzso transformation of zzso cells, albeit with diminished potency compared with mouse zzso With respect to their roles in normal developing zzso the differential zzso and spatial patterns of zzso zzso expression observed for each zebra fish zzso family member suggest unique functions for zzso in early zzso for zzso in establishment and growth of early organ systems, and for zzso in increasingly differentiated zzso Furthermore, significant zzso in the zzso expression of zebra fish zzso family genes zzso with relatively constant max expression support the emerging model of regulation of zzso function in cellular growth and zzso
