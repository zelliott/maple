zzso zzso zzso is a recently discovered human zzso produced in normal zzso cartilage zzso and thought to be involved in the pathological process of zzso We have zzso and characterized zzso zzso of the human zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso start site was located 22 zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region revealed the presence of the consensus recognition sites for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transformation zzso virus zzso as well as three core motifs of hormone response zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that a small zzso of 133 zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso transformation zzso virus zzso sites promoted zzso in normal and zzso human zzso with significantly higher activity than the original zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison of the promoter region of human zzso revealed a stronger similarity to the mouse zzso promoter than to the human zzso zzso
