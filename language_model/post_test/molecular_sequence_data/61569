The surface of zzso zzso is covered by zzso zzso involved in zzso protection, attachment and zzso The gene family coding for the zzso expressed by the zzso in the zzso host, named zzso is composed of several hundred members and presents high zzso The genes zzso zzso expressed in the zzso zzso stages are part of a much more homogeneous family, named zzso Here, we addressed the organization and evolution of physically linked zzso zzso zzso genes by sequencing large zzso fragments containing these zzso zzso zzso of zzso was restricted to particular zzso of zzso zzso showing that these regions have, or have had, an accelerated evolution zzso zzso analysis of several zzso genes allowed for the identification of members sharing features of zzso I and II, thus zzso that one group of genes was generated from the zzso The highly zzso zzso regions of both zzso and zzso families contained zzso zzso that were not present in unrelated genes in the zzso suggesting a role for zzso zzso in zzso and/or amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparison of putative zzso zzso II genes from different strains of zzso zzso showed that their central variable zzso are zzso This conservation was always higher at the DNA level suggesting positive selection in these particular regions of zzso II zzso
