zzso finger, zzso containing 6 zzso is an important zzso factor in zzso zzso affecting development, cell proliferation and zzso zzso in its promoter and coding regions are likely to impact zzso zzso and growth zzso In this study, rapid amplification of zzso zzso ends zzso analysis revealed two zzso start sites zzso for the bovine zzso starting within zzso 1 of the zzso gene zzso and upstream of the translation start zzso of the zzso gene zzso There was one zzso in the promoter and two zzso zzso in the coding region of the bovine zzso by sequencing of the pooled DNA samples zzso zzso zzso zzso The promoter and coding region are the key regions for gene zzso zzso in these regions can alter gene zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso has a broad tissue distribution in cattle and is highly expressed in skeletal zzso Eleven zzso zzso were constructed, which enabled the cloning of putative promoter sequences and analysis of zzso zzso activity by zzso reporter gene zzso The core region of the zzso promoter of bovine zzso is located within region zzso to zzso The activity of zzso in driving reporter gene zzso is significantly higher than that of the zzso construct zzso zzso zzso Analysis of gene expression patterns in zzso zzso Chinese zzso cattle showed that the zzso zzso exhibited a lower zzso level than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso muscle zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression was low in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso in the promoter and coding regions may zzso the promoter activity and gene expression of bovine zzso in the skeletal muscles of these cattle zzso
