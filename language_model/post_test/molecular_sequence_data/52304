We have examined the expression in zzso coli of genes zzso a plant zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso plant zzso is distinct in that it contains two zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso which have divergent zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso and Ellis, zzso zzso zzso Plant zzso 80, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso 94, zzso The precise zzso zzso of the active zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Genes zzso the mature forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been expressed separately and in combination in zzso coli to produce three novel zzso zzso zzso and alpha zzso The plant zzso zzso accumulated in soluble forms and to similar high levels in zzso There was no conclusive evidence that zzso alpha assembled into zzso species in alpha zzso In beta and alpha beta cells, the plant gene products assembled efficiently into zzso zzso Thus, the assembly of zzso alpha required the presence of zzso zzso whereas the assembly of zzso beta could occur in the absence of zzso zzso zzso proportions of the zzso zzso zzso were not assembled into zzso zzso in beta and alpha beta zzso Analysis of the zzso species that did form indicated the presence of novel hybrid zzso species that contained both plant and bacterial zzso zzso
