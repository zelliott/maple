zzso zzso zzso zzso channels contribute to setting the resting potential of zzso zzso and have recently been defined as molecular targets for zzso zzso and volatile zzso We have isolated a novel member of this zzso zzso from a human zzso library and mapped it to zzso region zzso zzso did not functionally express in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso containing the region between zzso and zzso of zzso produced zzso selective zzso To better correlate zzso zzso with native zzso currents in zzso the precise cellular distribution of all zzso family members was zzso in rat zzso A comprehensive in zzso zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and zzso transcripts are most strongly expressed in many zzso likely to be zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso expression is found in zzso bulb zzso cells and zzso cells, but predominantly associated with the central auditory zzso Thus, zzso zzso channels, possibly in conjunction with auxiliary zzso may play a role in the transmission of zzso information in the auditory zzso
