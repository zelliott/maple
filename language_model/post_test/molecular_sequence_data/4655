The origin of tumor zzso zzso zzso a zzso that binds to zzso zzso has long remained zzso zzso observations of human tumors suggest that tumor zzso could originate from zzso zzso and in some cases from inflammatory zzso The zzso origin was confirmed by the discovery of zzso zzso along with zzso in culture medium of zzso zzso An zzso protein was characterized in the culture medium of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in both normal subjects and zzso patients and was found to be human zzso zzso zzso did not produce zzso zzso was not related to the zzso site zzso zzso of brain zzso peptides demonstrated that each determined zzso sequence was similar to a sequence of the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso One probe was zzso from human zzso by zzso chain reaction with zzso derived from zzso sequences also found in zzso Northern blots were positive only with zzso zzso The main zzso were in the zzso zzso range, and there was a limited proportion of smaller zzso which was compatible with the size expected from the zzso molecular zzso Southern zzso of zzso and tumor cells demonstrated that the gene was limited to a unique zzso We conclude that zzso an zzso component of brain, zzso zzso inflammatory and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Our results suggest that tumor zzso which originates from zzso and zzso of tumor zzso is a molecular component of the zzso relationship and could play a role in the regulation of zzso activity in zzso
