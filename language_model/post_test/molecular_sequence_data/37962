zzso zzso is a member of the oral zzso family and an zzso zzso in the oral cavity of zzso zzso zzso is known to produce zzso zzso which zzso zzso from zzso The zzso was zzso zzso from a culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a molecular mass of 173 zzso and a zzso of zzso This zzso mainly zzso zzso zzso with no primer zzso The addition of zzso markedly enhanced the zzso resting cell zzso of zzso zzso at a level similar to that found in growing cells of zzso zzso The zzso against zzso inhibited the zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibited no similarities to known zzso sequences of oral zzso Using zzso zzso zzso an zzso DNA fragment, carrying the gene zzso coding for zzso and its regulator gene zzso was cloned and zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a close zzso The zzso gene was found to possess a zzso zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso 130 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso or zzso into the zzso or zzso gene resulted in decreased zzso activity by the zzso and changed the colony zzso of these zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in the subsequent colonizing of zzso zzso
