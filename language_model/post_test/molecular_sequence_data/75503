zzso of the zzso zzso zzso respond to an injection of live bacteria by the production of a potent zzso zzso The zzso property of this activity is due chiefly to two small zzso zzso A and zzso zzso of the proteins showed them to be zzso and to contain 37 and 35 zzso acid zzso zzso The subsequent isolation of two zzso clones for zzso B showed that this protein is made as a zzso zzso composed of 62 zzso acid zzso We have now prepared a zzso bank and studied four zzso clones for zzso zzso The coding regions were found in two zzso zzso fragments, one zzso zzso and another varying in size from zzso zzso to zzso zzso for different zzso One zzso unit for zzso B was zzso and found to be zzso zzso long with a single zzso zzso zzso in zzso A zzso insect specific cap site, zzso was identified by zzso mapping and primer extension zzso zzso were found for the presence of zzso families and zzso zzso
