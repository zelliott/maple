Two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family were markedly activated during zzso maturation of zzso zzso sea star zzso A rapid protocol was developed for the zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso by approximately zzso with a specific zzso activity of zzso zzso per zzso per zzso The zzso zzso apparently featured the zzso and zzso regions of zzso as it zzso with zzso directed to peptides patterned after these zzso acid sequences in zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso approximately 60 zzso but was relatively insensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and metal zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The consensus sequence for zzso zzso was determined to be zzso which was partially distinct from zzso zzso in its requirement for an zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso by zzso occurred exclusively on zzso on at least five zzso zzso zzso of sea star zzso zzso activity after treatment with protein zzso zzso confirmed that zzso was still regulated by zzso The sea star zzso zzso was zzso to near zzso with the regulatory and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2A and the heat shock protein zzso The association of an zzso zzso with zzso 2A was confirmed by zzso of zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the sea star zzso system will be useful for analysis of upstream and downstream signaling events that lead to zzso of the zzso protein and other zzso
