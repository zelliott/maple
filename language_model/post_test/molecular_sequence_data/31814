Spinal muscular zzso zzso are a zzso group of inherited disorders characterized by zzso of anterior horn cells and progressive muscle zzso In two unrelated families affected by a distinct form of zzso zzso zzso initially zzso with calf zzso we identified by genetic linkage analysis and zzso sequencing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein 38 zzso zzso is a known zzso of the zzso factor zzso factor 7 zzso which regulates genes required for zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso The zzso substitution did not alter the zzso zzso of zzso but did impair zzso zzso of a zzso promoter construct and zzso zzso target genes in both zzso expressing human embryonic kidney zzso cells and zzso derived from individuals with the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was associated with an impairment of zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that a zzso regulatory zzso that has a well-established role zzso development could also be critical for zzso maintenance and highlight the importance of zzso and zzso activity in motor zzso
