zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from rat zzso zzso total zzso by zzso The primary sequence of rat zzso had zzso and zzso identity to the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso into zzso 7 cells, followed by the addition of 20 zzso zzso acid, resulted in a dramatic increase in zzso released from these zzso The amount of zzso produced was comparable to that obtained from cells similarly zzso with human zzso zzso In the rat paw zzso inflammatory model, the injected paw had elevated levels of zzso zzso compared to the control zzso In a rat zzso model, injection of the zzso zzso resulted in elevated levels of zzso zzso in the zzso These results suggest that zzso expression plays a role both in inflammation and zzso
