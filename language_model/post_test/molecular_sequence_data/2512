Human basic zzso growth factor zzso is an zzso zzso zzso present in a wide variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones predict a zzso zzso zzso gene product based on the presence of a single putative zzso zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso protein isolated from human zzso contains two additional zzso acids zzso to the predicted zzso zzso We report here that the human cell line zzso zzso four molecular forms zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso protein is zzso initiated at the previously predicted zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso proteins initiate at unusual zzso zzso The higher molecular weight forms are zzso zzso extensions of the zzso zzso
