We report the construction of a zzso zzso library made from zzso cells derived from zzso zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted and converted to zzso zzso zzso by zzso reverse zzso followed by zzso zzso A zzso primer with zzso ends was used to amplify the zzso and the resulting zzso product was zzso A total of 154 clones were zzso and results indicated that zzso of the clones derived from either known zzso anonymous expressed sequence zzso or novel transcripts with very little zzso of screened zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of constructing complex representative zzso libraries from specific zzso cell populations that represent microscopic precursor stages of cancer zzso This method should facilitate identification of transcripts specifically expressed in cells of a distinct zzso origin and zzso zzso
