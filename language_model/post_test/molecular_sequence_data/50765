The zzso zzso of rabbit skeletal muscle contains a small zzso zzso a protein which is soluble in zzso zzso We propose the name zzso for this small zzso to signify its zzso zzso and association with the zzso zzso We have determined the following zzso acid sequence for zzso using protein chemistry zzso M E R S T R E L C L N F T V V L I T V I L I W L L V R S Y Q zzso This zzso sequence includes a zzso zzso segment which probably spans the zzso zzso zzso The molecular weight calculated from the zzso zzso agrees with that measured by fast atom zzso mass zzso showing that zzso contains no attached fatty zzso or other prosthetic zzso
