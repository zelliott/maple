To investigate the importance of the zzso region zzso of the mouse cholesterol zzso zzso zzso in zzso regulation of expression of the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso containing the structural sequence of zzso zzso zzso linked to either the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso or the zzso early gene zzso were zzso The human zzso zzso promoter was used to drive the expression of all the zzso zzso Thus the zzso had identical sequences in the promoter, the regions zzso the zzso and translated sequence but differed in the region zzso the zzso of their respective zzso zzso The zzso containing the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso gave rise to zzso activity in zzso zzso cells that was one-quarter of that obtained in cells zzso with the zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso contains sequences resembling zzso elements zzso zzso eight of nine putative zzso from the zzso zzso sequence increased the zzso activity to a level greater than that observed for zzso zzso whereas deletion of the zzso region had no zzso These results show that the zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso acids are known to repress the expression of the zzso zzso To test whether the zzso of the zzso zzso has a role in this process, the expression of the zzso genes was evaluated in zzso cells competent for zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso further decreased the expression of the zzso zzso The same zzso acids had no effect on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso sequence did not alter the zzso activity compared with the parental zzso and also did not alter the sensitivity of the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso which increased the expression of the zzso did not abolish the sensitivity of the zzso to repression by zzso zzso zzso Thus the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso also contains elements that facilitate the further repression of zzso expression in the presence of zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso of the mouse zzso zzso contains information specifying regulation at the zzso zzso
