zzso zzso comprises organisms that share the same species designation despite considerable zzso and zzso zzso To determine the degree and nature of zzso between subspecies and strains of zzso zzso we used zzso sequencing analysis, studying 56 genetically diverse strains of zzso zzso that included all described zzso In total, zzso zzso of sequence from 10 gene zzso were zzso with 205 zzso representing variable zzso The majority zzso of these variations were found among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also evident in this zzso In contrast, there was comparatively little zzso and no evidence of zzso within the zzso subspecies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains clustered together on one branch, while a distinct branch defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the independent origin of these zzso subspecies, an analysis of their rates of zzso zzso to synonymous zzso zzso showed increased zzso ratios for both: zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the value was zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a diverse group of organisms from which two zzso clones zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have evolved zzso
