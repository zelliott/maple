Our previous study showed that the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene of zzso virus displayed zzso zzso activity as predicted from its zzso acids zzso This viral zzso contains four known functional motifs zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso they are essential for zzso zzso reaction by binding zzso and zzso zzso The motifs I and II zzso with the Walker A and B motifs of the typical zzso zzso To examine the zzso roles of these five zzso zzso zzso zzso of five deletion zzso derived from the zzso strain were expressed and zzso Their zzso functions were zzso and compared with those of two wild type zzso zzso and zzso isolated in zzso Our results showed that deletions at motifs zzso or IV exhibited lower activity than that of the wild zzso Interestingly, deletion of zzso motif decreased the zzso activity more significantly than those of motifs zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and calcium were essential for zzso zzso Moreover, our zzso proteins of zzso virus also demonstrated zzso activity, though weaker than the original zzso zzso
