In zzso zzso zzso progeny of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we mapped a zzso quantitative trait locus zzso to zzso zzso at zzso zzso centered about zzso for zzso zzso that included blood zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso The zzso was refined to zzso zzso in a series of zzso zzso lines also segregating for zzso The zzso of zzso zzso mice include reduced zzso replication rates accompanied by reduced zzso mass, reduced zzso ratio in blood, reduced zzso zzso and persistent mild zzso zzso zzso sequence and expression analysis of 14 genes in this zzso identified a predicted gene that we have designated zzso zzso as the most likely zzso The gene spans zzso zzso on zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso on zzso and to zzso on zzso The largest zzso of zzso is predicted to be a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain that contains a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a generalized delay in zzso development in the gut region and zzso of zzso zzso Mice segregating for an zzso zzso zzso of zzso have zzso comparable to the zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso is in the middle of a zzso region of zzso that has been repeatedly associated with type 2 zzso
