The microbial population and zzso process parameters of a sequencing batch reactor for nitrogen removal from urine were monitored over a zzso zzso zzso community zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing, and quantitative zzso on nitrogen cycle functional groups were used to characterize the microbial zzso The reactor combined zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The nitrogen elimination rate initially increased by zzso followed by an extended period of performance zzso This phase was characterized by zzso of zzso and nitrous oxide, reduced zzso activity, and a different but stable microbial zzso zzso of zzso bacteria or their zzso by oxygen or zzso was insufficient to explain reactor zzso Multiple lines of evidence, zzso zzso analysis of chemical and physical parameters and cluster and zzso analysis of the microbial community, indicated that the system had experienced a rapid transition to a new stable state that led to the observed inferior process zzso The events in the reactor can thus be interpreted to be an ecological regime zzso zzso zzso indicated that the pH set point controlling cycle zzso temperature, zzso rate, and the release of zzso and nitrous zzso controlled the primarily zzso microbial zzso We show that by combining chemical and physical zzso microbial community analysis and ecological theory allowed extraction of useful information about the causes and dynamics of the observed process zzso
