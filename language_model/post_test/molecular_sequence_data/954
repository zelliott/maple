zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is critical to zzso zzso class switch zzso and gene zzso In the context of zzso B cells, AID zzso zzso in the DNA of zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso in the variable zzso However, when AID is expressed zzso it is a generalized zzso of zzso base zzso zzso we asked whether AID may be partially regulated by an active system of nuclear zzso We found that removal of a highly zzso nuclear export signal in the C zzso of AID causes zzso of AID in the zzso However, a putative nuclear zzso signal in the N zzso does not appear to be zzso Finally, we found that agents that induce DNA breaks caused retention of AID in the nucleus, suggesting that DNA breaks or the repair patches initiated as a result are a zzso for AID zzso
