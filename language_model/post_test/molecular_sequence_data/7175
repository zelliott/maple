Despite the essential and synergistic functions of the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso development, little is known about the zzso properties of the two zzso We have developed cell lines expressing high levels of the rag proteins and specific, sensitive zzso zzso for their zzso and we have examined the physical properties of the rag proteins in zzso and their zzso zzso in zzso zzso is tightly associated with nuclear structures, requires a high salt concentration to maintain its zzso and is a component of large, zzso sized zzso Furthermore, the presence of zzso alters the behavior of zzso zzso on it properties similar to those of zzso and changing its distribution in the zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso are present in the same complex by zzso and we provide evidence that these complexes contain more molecules of zzso than of zzso The demonstration of zzso complexes containing zzso and zzso raises the possibility that interaction between these proteins is necessary for their biological zzso
