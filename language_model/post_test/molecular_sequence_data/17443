zzso zzso are present in the zzso zzso and/or tissue cell surface and, by binding to specified zzso zzso control many important cellular zzso Some animal viruses had evolved to use zzso as part of their strategy to invade host zzso In this study, two putative zzso proteins were identified from the E protein sequence of the zzso strain zzso of Japanese encephalitis virus zzso zzso the first zzso region at zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso the second zzso region at zzso from zzso to zzso zzso Four zzso proteins with or without these two zzso regions were expressed in zzso coli and zzso to examine their zzso zzso The first zzso binding region was demonstrated to exhibit a higher affinity in zzso zzso zzso increases of zzso cell binding were also demonstrated by cell binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on glass zzso the zzso zzso protein of zzso promoted zzso cell zzso and zzso The present studies demonstrate the zzso zzso proteins of zzso stimulate cell adhesive and proliferation with a potential for applications in tissue zzso
