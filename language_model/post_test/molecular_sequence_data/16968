zzso is a zzso channel unique within the transient zzso potential family because of its gating by zzso zzso zzso gating is enabled by a zzso zzso zzso box sequence motif embedded into a region zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A recently discovered zzso zzso of zzso zzso lacks 34 zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain and is insensitive to zzso To analyze in detail which parts of the deleted sequence zzso are critical for zzso zzso we tested zzso that lacked 19, 25, and 29 zzso acid zzso in the zzso part or had zzso acid zzso zzso in the remaining zzso part of the zzso All of these zzso displayed typical zzso zzso However, the deletion or substitution of the zzso acid zzso zzso immediately downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso analyzed the zzso zzso in the zzso box of zzso because a considerably decreased zzso activity of the zzso zzso protein in comparison to the zzso zzso has been attributed to the reverse exchange zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso failed to respond to zzso even at zzso up to 10 zzso We concluded that the zzso contains no individual zzso acid zzso essential for zzso gating but may act as a zzso segment stabilizing a zzso necessary for the essential zzso zzso to interact with other channel zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso box zzso the zzso gating of zzso pointing to the requirement of prolonged binding rather than zzso
