Although the negative regulation of gene expression by insulin has been widely zzso the zzso factors responsible for the insulin effect are still zzso The purpose of this work was to explore the molecular mechanisms involved in the insulin repression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region allowed us to identify an zzso region located at zzso to zzso zzso This zzso contains a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso By transient zzso zzso we determined that zzso nuclear factor 3 zzso and nuclear factor 1 zzso are necessary for an appropriate expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso or zzso plus zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this region revealed that zzso disruption abrogates insulin action, whereas zzso of the zzso element maintains hormone zzso This zzso between zzso binding and insulin action suggests that zzso is not the sole zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso shows that at least two zzso other than zzso can bind to zzso promoter and that this binding is dependent on the integrity of the zzso We propose a model in which insulin exerts its negative effect through the zzso of zzso binding or zzso potential, probably due to specific zzso of this zzso factor by zzso In this regard, results obtained from zzso experiments using zzso zzso support this zzso Due to this event, zzso would lose accessibility to the zzso The zzso modification of zzso would allow the binding of a protein complex that recognizes the core zzso These results provide a potential mechanism for the zzso repression of zzso zzso
