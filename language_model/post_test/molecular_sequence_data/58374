zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the order zzso have one or two types zzso I and zzso zzso of zzso zzso These zzso consist of identical beta chains and different alpha zzso We determined the complete zzso acid sequences of the zzso beta chain of three species of zzso zzso sea zzso South American sea zzso and northern sea zzso and two species of zzso zzso seal and harp zzso from intact beta chain and chemical zzso zzso The sequences are similar to beta chains of the already known sequences of zzso These sequences were compared with those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and adult human zzso beta zzso Using zzso zzso as an zzso we find that the tree constructed by means of zzso analysis shows that zzso is closest to zzso and that zzso and zzso are closer to zzso than to zzso
