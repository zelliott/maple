The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been investigated in pea zzso zzso leaves, by isolation of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity was mainly located in zzso zzso zzso of total cellular zzso zzso activity was also identified in the soluble phase of both zzso and zzso Two zzso forms were separated by zzso zzso The major form was found to be specific for the zzso zzso whereas the minor form was present in zzso as well as in zzso We also report the isolation and DNA sequence of a zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was isolated by functional zzso of a conditional lethal zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso zzso This indicated that the zzso plant protein was able to zzso specifically an essential zzso zzso in the bacterial host, that is a zzso of zzso zzso called zzso zzso carrier zzso The full-length zzso sequence zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da and shows specific regions of similarity to other zzso zzso zzso genes as isolated from bacteria and zzso and with zzso species from zzso A sequence downstream of the first translation initiation site encodes a putative zzso structurally similar to zzso zzso suggesting a zzso or zzso zzso for this zzso
