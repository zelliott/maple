In studies of DNA replication in zzso coli, an important question concerns the role of the zzso protein zzso This protein is known to bind to a specific zzso sequence in the origin of zzso but it is not understood how it can recognize another, relatively distant, zzso sequence that has no zzso to the binding site but is where the zzso protein serves its zzso function in the initiation of DNA zzso This effect of zzso might be achieved by zzso of DNA in this zzso I have searched for putative binding sites for integration host factor zzso a protein known to bend zzso Here I report the finding of an zzso binding site in the zzso coli origin and present direct evidence that zzso binds and causes DNA zzso in this zzso On the basis of these results I propose a model wherein formation of a zzso zzso structure would facilitate the action of zzso protein in the initiation zzso
