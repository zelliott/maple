The class II zzso gene zzso is zzso by zzso zzso whereas the zzso gene is not zzso in most cell zzso To investigate the DNA region specifically responsible for zzso or its lack that may be required (in addition to the elements required for zzso expression of class II zzso hybrid promoters were constructed between the zzso zzso regions of the zzso promoter up to zzso zzso which is zzso zzso and of the zzso promoter up to zzso zzso which is not zzso As a result of these and previous studies zzso zzso the region of the zzso gene required for its zzso zzso was localized to 27 zzso between zzso and zzso including the zzso element and its zzso zzso
