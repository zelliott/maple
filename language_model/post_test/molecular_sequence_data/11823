A zzso zzso zzso zzso previously shown to bind to a zzso zzso binding site on protein zzso C zzso has been used to identify a zzso acid consensus sequence shared by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid synthetic zzso derived from the corresponding region of zzso zzso acids zzso of the zzso from Chinese zzso zzso zzso bound effectively and specifically to zzso and that derived from rat zzso gamma zzso acids zzso bound zzso but specifically to zzso Analysis of binding of zzso to various synthetic peptides revealed that the consensus sequence zzso zzso is responsible for the interaction with both zzso and zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso acid zzso represent a basic structural motif for the specific interaction with zzso and the corresponding regions of zzso and zzso form the zzso binding sites of these zzso
