zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not produce zzso zzso at the protein or zzso level in response to inducing agents, while zzso acid differentiated zzso cells do produce zzso A probe was constructed spanning positions zzso to zzso of the human zzso upstream regulatory region to examine this zzso control at the level of a zzso regulatory zzso zzso mobility shift analyses were used to examine this molecular mechanism to determine whether the differential expression of positive or negative zzso factors may act to control zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso These analyses showed that while nuclear extracts from zzso induced zzso cells, in the zzso producing cell line, showed two shifted bands, nuclear extracts from both induced and zzso zzso cells showed only one shifted band using the zzso zzso While this single shifted band zzso with the faster zzso species of zzso cell zzso competition analysis revealed differences between the two zzso An zzso representing the positive regulatory domain zzso zzso efficiently for the probe when induced zzso cell extracts were zzso but failed to compete when induced zzso cell extracts were zzso In contrast, an zzso representing the positive regulatory domain zzso zzso very well when induced zzso cell extracts were examined but had only a minimal effect when induced zzso cell extracts were zzso These data suggest the involvement of zzso regulated zzso zzso which have yet to be zzso
