Although zzso T cells are a common feature of many zzso immune responses, the factors that influence, zzso or regulate the response of individual zzso zzso zzso to infection is zzso Here we show that in the absence of zzso T cells, novel zzso of zzso T cells, expressing zzso zzso zzso chains that normally define zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso are recruited to the zzso in response to bacterial infection in zzso zzso By comparison of zzso and structure of zzso chains and/or zzso chains expressed by these novel zzso with those of their zzso counterparts, the zzso T cells zzso in infected zzso mice were shown to be identical to those found in the zzso zzso from where they are presumably recruited in the absence of zzso T zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso T cells found in infected zzso mice were distinct from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the novel zzso zzso zzso identified for infected zzso mice showed that whereas the zzso and zzso zzso may compensate for the absence of zzso T cells by producing similar zzso they do not possess zzso activity and they cannot replace the zzso zzso function of zzso T zzso zzso these findings identify novel zzso of zzso T cells, the recruitment and activity of which is under the control of zzso T zzso
