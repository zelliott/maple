The role of a zzso structure within the zzso sequence of a human zzso gene in the zzso of its zzso in zzso by zzso cell extracts has been investigated using several deletion zzso of a zzso of the gene which lacked part or all of the zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of four zzso was the same as that of the zzso zzso two zzso had decreased zzso efficiency, one was more efficient, and one, lacking part of the zzso zzso control region, was zzso zzso of the zzso efficiencies with the position and the size of the zzso sequence that was deleted indicated that the zzso structure may be deleted without loss of zzso zzso Current models for the zzso of zzso gene zzso by the zzso sequence are assessed in the light of the results zzso and a potential model is zzso
