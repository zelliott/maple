zzso (A zzso And zzso domain, with zzso zzso zzso is a recently described family of zzso zzso which play important roles in a variety of normal and pathological conditions, including arthritis and zzso In this work, we report the identification and cloning of zzso zzso seven new human zzso These novel zzso have been called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All of them show a domain organization similar to that of previously characterized family members, consisting of a signal zzso a zzso a zzso domain, a zzso domain, a zzso region, and a variable number of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these zzso genes are mainly expressed in fetal zzso especially in lung zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso kidney zzso zzso and zzso and liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis also revealed the expression of some of these new zzso in different human adult zzso such as prostate zzso zzso and zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso High levels of zzso transcripts were also observed in some tumor zzso and cells lines, including zzso zzso melanoma and colon zzso cells zzso zzso location analysis indicated that the seven identified zzso genes are dispersed in the human zzso mapping to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso According to these results, together with a comparative analysis of zzso in other zzso organisms, we conclude that these zzso with at least 18 distinct members zzso within the human zzso represent an example of a widely expanded zzso family during zzso zzso
