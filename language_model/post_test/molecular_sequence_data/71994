Two zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso divergent zzso zzso zzso have been isolated from a zzso library obtained from ripe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso acid sequence suggests that zzso and zzso zzso have different secondary and zzso structures and that they differ in the presence of potential zzso zzso By in zzso translation we show that zzso and zzso bear a functional signal zzso the zzso of which yields mature proteins of 52 and 60 zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso early in evolution from other plant zzso Northern analysis showed that both zzso are highly expressed in fruit and that they have different zzso patterns of zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in green fruit, accumulating as the fruit turned from green to white and remaining at an zzso constant level throughout fruit zzso In contrast, the zzso transcript was not detected in green fruit and only a low level of expression was observed in white zzso The level of zzso zzso increased gradually during zzso reaching a maximum in fully ripe zzso The high levels of zzso and zzso zzso in ripe fruit and their overlapping patterns of expression suggest that these zzso play an important role in softening during zzso In addition, the early expression of zzso in green fruit, well before significant softening begins, suggests that the product of this gene may also be involved in processes other than fruit softening, zzso cell wall zzso
