The zzso 2 zzso tumor zzso gene product, zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family, which links cell surface zzso to the zzso zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso of zzso similar to other zzso zzso may regulate its zzso To determine whether zzso zzso has functional consequences for zzso suppression of cell growth and zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso cell lines that zzso express full-length zzso with zzso at two potential zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas a zzso at zzso that mimics zzso zzso zzso abrogates the ability of zzso to suppress cell growth and zzso the zzso zzso zzso which mimics zzso zzso functions zzso to zzso zzso Similar zzso involving zzso the analogous zzso site in zzso proteins important for regulating their function, had no zzso In contrast to other functionally inactive zzso zzso zzso the regulated zzso of zzso zzso resulted in dramatic changes in cell shape and the zzso of zzso zzso These results provide the first direct demonstration that the zzso zzso zzso which mimics zzso zzso zzso not only zzso growth and zzso suppression but also leads to an acquisition of a novel zzso previously ascribed to zzso zzso
