zzso zzso is a zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso that exhibits strong zzso activity against powdery zzso The entire zzso zzso gene cluster was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene disruptions narrowed down the cluster to 16 functional zzso and identified the boundaries of the gene zzso A putative zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso was disrupted in zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso zzso An in zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso could zzso either zzso or zzso as zzso to yield zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to be a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and contains the zzso motif characteristic of members of the radical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso zzso experiments with zzso indicated that zzso at zzso of the zzso ring was coupled with the attachment of zzso side chain through zzso bond zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was not incorporated into the zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the 16 zzso zzso with counterparts involved in the zzso of the structurally similar compound zzso zzso along with the results above, provide insight into the complete zzso zzso zzso
