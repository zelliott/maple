Recently, we isolated and characterized a new mouse zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso plus 121 zzso joined to the zzso end of the zzso This zzso arises from the L strand of the same gene and we have named this transcript zzso zzso At position 121 of the zzso there is a C, which, according to the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso should be a zzso We hypothesized that this zzso is zzso having a U at position zzso which is later zzso to a C by a putative editing zzso Based on the presence of sites for the restriction zzso zzso and zzso around position zzso both forms of the zzso were detected in mouse zzso To confirm the presence of the zzso and putative edited zzso a zzso containing the first 154 zzso of the zzso was amplified by zzso and zzso The substitution of U for C was demonstrated by sequencing these zzso In zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the substitution of U for C is not due to artifact of amplification or zzso Moreover, in zzso from zzso only the zzso form was zzso This, together with other experimental evidence, demonstrated that the base substitution was not due to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first demonstration of a substitution reaction from U to C in a zzso zzso zzso
