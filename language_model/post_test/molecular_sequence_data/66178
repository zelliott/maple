The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the ecology of the Gulf of Maine and other regions of the North zzso To increase our understanding of the physiology of this species, a zzso whole zzso zzso library was constructed, and expressed sequence tags zzso of the clones were zzso Among these zzso was one with zzso to known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a well-known family of zzso peptides that regulate juvenile hormone production in zzso zzso analysis of the clone from which the zzso was generated, with subsequent translation of its open reading frame, showed it to zzso five novel zzso zzso whose mature structures were predicted to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each of the peptides is present as a single copy within the zzso with the exception of zzso which is present in three zzso Surprisingly, the organization of the zzso zzso zzso specifically the number of zzso zzso zzso is more similar to those of insects than it is to the known zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso possess zzso or zzso zzso at their zzso zzso rather than zzso which is present in most other family zzso zzso zzso suggests that six pairs of zzso produce the native zzso zzso zzso five in the zzso and one in the zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, our report is the first characterization of a zzso system in a zzso the first identification of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso the first report of zzso zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso zzso and the first report from any species of an zzso zzso possessing a zzso zzso zzso
