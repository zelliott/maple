Acute zzso leukemia zzso 1 is often disrupted by zzso zzso generating zzso zzso in human zzso However, its role in zzso zzso has not been extensively zzso zzso we show a marked zzso of zzso transcripts including a high frequency of a novel alternatively spliced zzso transcript lacking zzso 6 zzso in zzso cancer zzso The increases in zzso transcripts for total zzso zzso and zzso are associated with poor patient zzso We have shown that although both zzso zzso and zzso are localized to nuclear zzso zzso was observed to have dramatically reduced zzso potential with the zzso zzso zzso promoters and behaved as a weak dominant negative of zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit the growth of immortalized zzso zzso cells zzso decreasing zzso zzso Moreover, we have identified a novel function of zzso where it zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso has lost the ability to inhibit both zzso cell proliferation and migration indicating that the functional effects observed with zzso zzso are dependent on zzso acids zzso zzso these studies suggest that zzso alternative zzso of zzso transcripts may potentially contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso
