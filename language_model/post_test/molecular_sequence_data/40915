Heading date is one of the most important quantitative traits responsible for the zzso of zzso We compared a zzso reference segment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surrounding zzso a major heading date gene in rice, with zzso regions from nine zzso zzso species that zzso over a relatively short time frame zzso zzso to study sequence evolution around a zzso zzso The zzso zzso region from zzso zzso was included to compare and contrast the evolution in a more distant relative of zzso zzso with other observations at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in grass species, we found high gene zzso in the zzso region zzso size differences that were lineage specific and long terminal repeat zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was deleted in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso zzso copies had degenerative zzso suggesting that other heading date zzso might compensate for the loss or zzso of zzso in these zzso Compared with the zzso zzso region, the zzso region in zzso exhibited zzso including gene zzso seven additional zzso and a gene zzso and zzso event predating the divergence from zzso
