zzso from the zzso element of zzso zzso were zzso for the ability to direct zzso formation for zzso initiated by the zzso zzso The zzso the direct repeat at each end of the element, was capable of forming 3' ends at two sites, an inefficient upstream site and an efficient downstream site near the end of the zzso Different sequences were required for zzso formation at these zzso For the efficient site, all transcripts had 3' ends in the delta and no downstream zzso was zzso which suggested that these sequences terminate zzso Surprisingly, the delta region downstream of the initiation site for Ty zzso comprised part of this major site and terminated more than 50% of the transcripts that read into zzso zzso necessary for the efficient site were localized to two small zzso Both regions were upstream of the 3' end and contained similarities to a zzso consensus sequence that has been proposed as a zzso zzso zzso near the position of the 3' end could also affect zzso a short G + zzso sequence inserted just downstream changed an efficient zzso to an inefficient zzso zzso in the delta had no effect on the efficiency or positions or termination in that zzso A new initiation site was seen when the same delta terminated transcription, but zzso interference did not occur, since the amount of initiation was not zzso
