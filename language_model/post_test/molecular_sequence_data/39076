zzso of zzso sensory zzso expressing a given zzso zzso zzso to a few zzso in the zzso zzso We have generated mice with unresponsive zzso sensory zzso by targeted zzso of a zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso When these zzso mice were crossed with mice in which zzso expressing a given zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso of an zzso marker, the pattern of convergence was affected for one but not another zzso In a novel zzso termed zzso zzso zzso from channel positive or negative zzso that express the same zzso zzso segregate into distinct zzso within the same zzso Thus, the peripheral zzso projections are in part influenced by mechanisms that depend on zzso zzso
