The zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein that belongs to the zzso protein zzso zzso forms a zzso a zzso with another zzso zzso zzso and a complex with its interacting zzso named zzso or zzso By zzso zzso screening using human zzso as zzso we isolated a zzso of a novel zzso zzso which turned out to be zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso which has an zzso acid sequence similar to that of the zzso region of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso fusion protein of zzso the direct interaction was analyzed by an zzso overlay zzso and by real-time interaction analysis with a surface zzso resonance zzso zzso The zzso constant zzso was estimated to be approximately 70 zzso The zzso zzso change of zzso in the presence of the zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso was inhibited by mixing with zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso region in zzso masked the zzso exposed zzso surface of zzso
