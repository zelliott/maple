Three differently sized zzso are expressed from each of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present in the Chinese zzso lung zzso cell line, zzso The relative zzso of the transcripts produced from each zzso differs dramatically as a result of differential zzso of the multiple zzso sites present in the zzso zzso gene and a genetic zzso located within the third zzso signal of one zzso We sought to determine whether such differences in zzso affect the zzso levels of zzso and zzso expressed from either zzso and, in a more general sense, to ask whether differences in 3' end zzso processing in a gene containing multiple zzso sites affects the final level of gene zzso An zzso zzso transient expression system producing zzso zzso transcripts was developed to zzso the in zzso zzso zzso patterns associated with each of the two zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the total amount of zzso zzso expressed from each of these zzso in zzso is the same regardless of the differential zzso of the zzso signals that occurs between zzso Moreover, measurement of the individual turnover rates of the zzso zzso expressed in zzso from each zzso as determined by zzso labeling and zzso D zzso studies, revealed no significant zzso differences in transcript zzso Finally, measuring the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso in parental zzso cells demonstrated that both zzso are expressed to the same extent during normal zzso Thus, even though dramatic zzso differences in 3' end processing of zzso transcripts occur in zzso such differences do not appear to influence the zzso levels of zzso gene zzso
