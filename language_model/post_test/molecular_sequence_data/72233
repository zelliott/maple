Using a magnetic zzso zzso selection procedure and a fetal brain expression library, we identified a zzso unit within a zzso positive for the marker zzso Pursuit of its full-length zzso led to the cloning of the third candidate gene zzso we studied in our quest for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spans approximately 140 zzso of zzso DNA and is located immediately zzso to zzso with 544 zzso of DNA separating the two zzso zzso encodes two zzso expressed transcripts of approximately zzso zzso and approximately zzso zzso that are zzso transcribed from a promoter region common to zzso zzso sequence was determined for one of its alternately spliced zzso The predicted protein has zzso zzso acids and is novel in zzso with only weak zzso to zzso factors, zzso zzso and protein zzso including members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although neither zzso to zzso nor any zzso of zzso in zzso patients has been found, the head-to-head arrangement of zzso and zzso with expression of both zzso genes from a common stretch of 544 zzso zzso DNA, suggests a zzso promoter possibly for zzso of biologically related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are defined to aid in further study of this zzso
