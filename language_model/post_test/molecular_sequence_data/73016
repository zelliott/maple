The traffic of proteins through the zzso zzso zzso is achieved in part by zzso zzso zzso transport between the zzso network and the zzso zzso These transit zzso are coated with coat proteins zzso which assemble to form a complex of seven zzso known as zzso From the zzso human zzso zzso cell line, we have previously isolated and zzso the zzso of a novel zzso zzso whose predicted zzso acid zzso calculated relative molecular mass, and zzso are zzso similar to the zzso zzso of the zzso complex in zzso Four synthetic peptides were designed for zzso pairs of rabbits to generate zzso zzso In Western zzso experiments, these zzso could specifically recognize protein bands of 160 zzso which were absent when control zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso components of zzso cells zzso with one of the zzso revealed zzso protein bands predominantly in the zzso and zzso zzso but virtually none in the nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells using the same zzso exhibited fluorescent zzso chiefly in the zzso Taken together with the zzso data, the results of this zzso analysis of the putative zzso protein support the suggestion that the latter is the human zzso of zzso
