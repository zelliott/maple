zzso zzso zzso requires continuous zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso signaling has been shown to be pivotal during this process and its zzso leads to the absence of any zzso or molecular signs of zzso formation, including hair zzso zzso In the zzso primary zzso arise in zzso starting just before zzso when the first zzso signs of a zzso are zzso In this study, our goal was to identify novel factors expressed during primary zzso zzso We performed zzso profiling of the developing zzso at 12 h intervals between zzso and zzso One of the significantly zzso expressed genes was the zzso inhibitor zzso 4, zzso We show that zzso zzso increases sharply in the zzso zzso around zzso and then decreases until zzso Using whole mount in zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso is localized to the zzso at sites of zzso zzso interactions during zzso zzso including the dental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary and secondary zzso In zzso analysis, reporter gene zzso as well as in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso show that zzso is a potential downstream target of zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate a direct physical interaction between zzso complex and the zzso promoter using zzso We propose that zzso acts in a negative feedback loop to zzso zzso zzso zzso and may facilitate a switch to the zzso zzso zzso cell polarity zzso zzso that is involved in cell movements during zzso
