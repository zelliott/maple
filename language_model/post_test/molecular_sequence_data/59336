In birds and zzso T cells develop along two discrete pathways characterized by expression of either the alpha beta or the gamma delta zzso zzso receptors zzso To gain further insight into the evolutionary significance of the gamma delta zzso zzso the present studies sought to define the chicken zzso gamma zzso A zzso zzso library was screened with two zzso chain reaction products obtained from zzso DNA using zzso for highly zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso This strategy yielded zzso clones with characteristics of zzso zzso gamma zzso including zzso zzso considered important for proper folding and zzso Northern zzso analysis with the zzso gamma zzso probe revealed zzso transcripts in the zzso zzso and a gamma delta zzso line, but not in B or alpha beta zzso zzso Three zzso V gamma zzso three J gamma gene zzso and a single constant region C gamma gene were identified in the avian zzso gamma zzso Members of each of the three V gamma zzso were found to undergo zzso in parallel during the first wave of zzso zzso zzso gamma repertoire diversification was initiated on embryonic day 10 by an apparently random pattern of zzso gamma zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso additions to generate a diverse repertoire of avian zzso gamma genes early in zzso
