zzso zzso derive much of their longevity and resistance properties from the relative zzso of their zzso The spore cortex, a zzso structure surrounding the zzso maintains, and is zzso to have a role in zzso zzso zzso A structural modification unique to the spore zzso is the removal of all or part of the zzso side chains from the majority of the zzso acid zzso and the conversion of 50% of the zzso acid to zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso predicted to zzso a zzso zzso results in the production of spores containing no zzso zzso These spores have normally dehydrated zzso but are unable to complete the zzso outgrowth process to produce viable zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the triggering of zzso with loss of spore zzso and the release of zzso acid but no degradation of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso allowed the zzso spores to produce viable cells and showed that they have normal heat resistance zzso These results zzso suggest that a mechanical activity of the zzso zzso is not required for the generation of zzso zzso but rather that it simply serves as a zzso structure to maintain dehydration, zzso demonstrate that degradation of zzso zzso is not required for spore zzso release or partial spore core zzso during zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso is a major specificity zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest the mechanism by which the spore zzso is zzso during zzso while the germ cell wall is left zzso
