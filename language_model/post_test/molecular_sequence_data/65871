Our previous results demonstrated that zzso associated with zzso zzso shoot virus zzso is not necessary for infection but zzso symptoms in some zzso To better understand the function of zzso in virus infection, a zzso deleted infectious clone of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso showed that the truncated zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in tobacco and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that the truncated zzso reverted to near wild type component size in some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants zzso with zzso and zzso zzso analysis of four zzso derivatives revealed that the wild type size zzso molecules were zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in which zzso zzso were produced for zzso The significance of these findings is discussed with respect to the constraints imposed on zzso zzso zzso
