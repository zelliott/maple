zzso virus zzso is a zzso zzso virus closely related to zzso zzso virus zzso However, unlike its close relative zzso zzso lacks a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso that activates the zzso of immediate early genes during the initial events of the virus life zzso zzso in the absence of a functional zzso the mechanism triggering the expression of immediate early genes in zzso at present remains zzso zzso evidence indicates that the gene product of the putative immediate early gene zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso genes of all three putative kinetic classes, namely immediate early zzso early zzso and late zzso classes of zzso zzso In the present study, we show that zzso can positively zzso its zzso promoter using a transient zzso zzso both in zzso and in neural zzso In the same system, we can also demonstrate zzso of the zzso zzso promoter by zzso zzso By deletion analysis and zzso zzso zzso we have localized specific regions in the zzso zzso sequences that mediate zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and provide evidence that this promoter zzso by these two proteins may be through different zzso These data, taken together with the recent demonstration of the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 66, zzso provides a possible mechanism by which the triggering of zzso gene expression occurs in the absence of a functional zzso zzso
