zzso zzso zzso is a product of zzso metabolism of zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso have been hypothesized to reduce zzso pressure via relaxation of the zzso zzso To investigate the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the eye, we cloned the zzso from a human zzso body zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso zzso was identical to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso appeared to be predominantly zzso as zzso by an zzso zzso zzso and coupled to zzso zzso formation when zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso could also be activated by the zzso zzso zzso in addition to its zzso zzso zzso zzso was less potent zzso zzso 5 zzso than zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso in generating zzso zzso via the zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso also zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso caused a zzso zzso of the zzso it failed to activate the zzso human zzso zzso and caused only minimal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso Four additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso or no, zzso of the zzso zzso with these zzso only zzso and zzso caused rapid zzso zzso of zzso and also exhibited zzso with zzso resulting in a maximum of approximately zzso zzso The human zzso may thus be activated specifically, by the free zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso product, zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso may complement the actions of zzso in clinical syndromes where zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso zzso
