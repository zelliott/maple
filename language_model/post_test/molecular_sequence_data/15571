zzso yield is controlled by quantitative trait zzso zzso derived from natural variations in many crop zzso Here we report the molecular characterization of a major rice grain yield zzso that acts through the determination of zzso zzso The dominant zzso at the zzso locus is a zzso zzso causing zzso of a zzso zzso domain zzso The effect of this zzso is to enhance zzso activity, resulting in a reduced length of the zzso zzso an increased number of grains per zzso and a zzso increase in grain zzso This zzso is common to many Chinese high-yielding rice varieties and likely represents a relatively recent introduction into the cultivated rice gene zzso We also show that a functionally equivalent zzso is present in the temperate zzso and seems to have arisen before the divergence of the wheat and barley zzso
