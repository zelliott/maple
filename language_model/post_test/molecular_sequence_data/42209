A zzso library has been constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso from zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The library was screened with zzso generated against zzso zzso zzso A positive clone was isolated, which zzso a zzso zzso zzso having an insert size of zzso zzso zzso analysis by Southern and northern zzso showed that the corresponding protein is zzso by a single gene that gives rise to a transcript of zzso zzso zzso of the full zzso sequence of the gene revealed an open reading frame covering zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso bears the characteristic zzso head, rod and zzso tail zzso present in all intermediate filament zzso zzso The rod has the classical zzso repeats indicating zzso ability, and the predicted lengths of the coils are similar to coils zzso zzso and 2 of intermediate zzso At the zzso end of the rod there is a strongly zzso IF zzso and a fusion protein containing zzso is zzso by the zzso intermediate filament zzso zzso A zzso zzso raised against zzso has been used to show that the protein is present only in zzso zzso and that it is zzso related to zzso from zzso but not from zzso
