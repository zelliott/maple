zzso nuclear zzso are predominantly nuclear zzso proteins that function in a variety of cellular zzso The objective of these experiments was to clone a zzso for a chicken protein similar to other previously reported zzso zzso for other zzso The zzso and 3' ends of the chicken zzso were cloned using Rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso sequence was confirmed via Northern zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was approximately zzso identical to corresponding regions of human, zzso or zzso proteins similar to zzso nuclear zzso zzso The expression data confirmed the size of the predicted zzso zzso The newly identified sequence may be employed in future studies aimed at understanding the role of zzso nuclear zzso in avian zzso
