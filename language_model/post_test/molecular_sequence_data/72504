A knowledge of beta zzso gene expression provides a basis for identifying proteins potentially involved in beta cell function and zzso To identify candidate beta zzso zzso we applied the zzso zzso zzso technique of zzso difference analysis zzso to the mouse zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso Following three successive zzso of zzso complementary DNA from zzso complementary DNA, difference products were cloned into zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso of 91 sequences against the databases identified 11 known and 8 novel zzso Known genes included previously reported beta zzso zzso insulin zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as other zzso zzso genes such as those for zzso growth factor II, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and type 1 protein zzso A regulatory zzso By Northern zzso zzso expression of the majority of known and novel genes was restricted to zzso zzso Novel genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed not only in zzso cells, but also in normal pancreatic zzso and a limited number of other zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed significant zzso with members of the zzso zzso indicating that zzso may zzso a zzso zzso potentially involved in beta cell zzso events during zzso zzso In zzso cells, none of the novel genes were regulated at the zzso level by high zzso However, in parallel studies, zzso of zzso was significantly increased by both sodium zzso and zzso suggesting that this gene may play a role in pancreatic beta cell growth and/or zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that zzso is an effective strategy for systematically mapping differences in gene expression between two related but zzso zzso zzso Its application to experimental animal models of zzso zzso may facilitate the discovery of potential factors that mediate beta cell growth and zzso
