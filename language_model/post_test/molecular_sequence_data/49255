Many cases of muscular zzso in humans are caused by zzso in members of the zzso associated protein complex zzso zzso are small zzso whose bodies are composed predominantly of skeletal muscle, making them attractive models for studying zzso muscle zzso Potential zzso to most of the human zzso proteins have been found in zzso by database zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso has been confirmed by western zzso zzso and zzso techniques zzso these proteins to the muscle cell membrane in adult zzso zzso zzso experiments designed to inhibit the translation of zzso zzso produce juvenile zzso that are less active than zzso injected with control zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso shows concurrent reduction of zzso and the zzso suggesting that these zzso like those in zzso are part of a complex whose integrity is dependent on zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso is an excellent animal model in which to approach the study of zzso and its associated zzso
