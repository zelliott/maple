zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso and gamma chains are major components of zzso zzso zzso throughout the zzso To date, three alpha chains zzso have been shown to assemble into at least seven zzso (called zzso zzso Genes zzso two additional alpha chains zzso and zzso have been zzso but little is known about their zzso and their protein products have not been zzso Here we generated zzso to zzso zzso and zzso and used them to identify authentic proteins in tissue zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso and zzso assemble into four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a panel of zzso and zzso zzso we surveyed the expression of zzso in zzso zzso All five chains were expressed in both zzso and adults, but each was distributed in a distinct pattern at both zzso and protein zzso Overall, zzso and zzso exhibited the broadest patterns of zzso while expression of zzso was the most zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and heart showed that the alpha chains were confined to zzso zzso and, with few exceptions, to zzso All developing and adult zzso examined contained at least one alpha chain, all alpha chains were present in multiple zzso and some zzso contained two or three alpha zzso zzso analysis of developing kidney revealed that some individual zzso including those of the zzso and zzso changed in zzso chain composition as they zzso expressing up to three different alpha chains and two different beta chains in an elaborate and dynamic zzso zzso zzso mapping of the five alpha chain genes revealed that they are distributed on four mouse zzso Finally, we identified a novel full-length zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso which was previously believed to zzso only truncated zzso Together, these results reveal remarkable diversity in zzso composition and complexity in zzso zzso
