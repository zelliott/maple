Isolation of human disease genes is a challenging process and can often only be achieved by zzso zzso cloning zzso Fortunately, there are alternative strategies for isolation of zzso zzso disorder zzso The first, functional zzso was established as a viable approach by zzso and colleagues, who identified zzso the first known zzso zzso disorder zzso The second strategy, computer-based zzso zzso relies on zzso the fact that zzso assembly has been zzso throughout the evolution of zzso zzso knowledge of the zzso acid sequences of an increasing number of zzso zzso assembly zzso zzso and zzso the existence of sequence data from large numbers of human zzso The recent development of the expressed sequence tag zzso database zzso is fulfilling the last of these zzso We have applied the zzso probing strategy in the search for candidate genes for the zzso zzso disorders by routinely screening the database of zzso for genes with significant sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this approach is demonstrated by its use in identifying zzso as the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso as a human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, detailed analysis of zzso has revealed that zzso in this gene are responsible for zzso group 2 of the zzso zzso zzso The demonstration that human zzso of zzso zzso genes exist and that zzso in these genes cause zzso zzso disorders demonstrates that zzso pas zzso are accurate and useful models for the analysis of these zzso
