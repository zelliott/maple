The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso decisions by orchestrating responses that go from zzso arrest to zzso We have identified a new zzso zzso protein that we named zzso which becomes stabilized and accumulates in response to certain zzso stresses such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to induce zzso whereas its zzso reduces the zzso response to these DNA zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts with zzso and stimulates the zzso of several zzso zzso target genes such as zzso and zzso This zzso with enhanced zzso recruitment of zzso to the zzso In zzso cells, low zzso levels of zzso are probably maintained by a zzso negative feedback zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso regulator that links the zzso zzso and zzso pathways and contributes to the establishment of zzso stress zzso
