A zzso zzso zzso which detects an zzso zzso rising from heavy chains zzso by the zzso gene segment has been zzso to investigate the role of this gene in zzso zzso zzso in zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were established from two patients with zzso with one zzso an zzso zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the heavy chain variable regions revealed involvement of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso used the gene in germ line zzso whereas the zzso zzso had 18 zzso zzso The zzso sequences for both the zzso had a predominance of basic zzso zzso with zzso having five and zzso two zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene segment, often in germ line zzso is also used by zzso zzso against red cell zzso zzso However, zzso from a panel of six zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso had no zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso had only a weak ability to zzso red zzso Comparisons of zzso variable regions indicate that the zzso acids in the zzso region of the zzso chain influence the ability of zzso zzso by the zzso gene segment to discriminate between a zzso zzso zzso and DNA, and strongly support the suggested role of zzso in interaction with zzso zzso from patients with zzso were found to have significantly raised levels of Id which was expressed by zzso zzso against both zzso and zzso
