Short peptides connecting zzso and zzso have been analyzed in 240 proteins refined at resolutions of zzso zzso or zzso Connecting peptides of lengths between one and five zzso have been classified as part of zzso motifs of four zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and beta zzso zzso consideration has been given to the definition of secondary structures on the basis of hydrogen bonds and zzso zzso zzso Using five classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso structure regions of zzso zzso space, 34 classes of zzso motifs occurring at least five times have been zzso Among these 34 classes, 11 classes that occur more than 25 times are commonly occurring zzso structure zzso The patterns and zzso of the 11 commonly occurring zzso structure motifs have been zzso demonstrating that patterns and zzso adopted by zzso structure motifs are zzso The results have relevance to structure zzso comparative zzso and protein zzso
