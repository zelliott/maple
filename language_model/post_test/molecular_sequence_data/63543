Heart development is a precisely coordinated process of cellular zzso migration, zzso and integrated zzso zzso and therefore it is highly susceptible to zzso anomalies such as the zzso heart disease zzso One of the major causes of zzso has been shown to be the zzso in key cardiac zzso factors, including zzso Here, we report the analysis of zzso zzso zzso that showed a progressive heart zzso in the later stages of heart zzso Our analyses revealed that the cardiac muscle maturation and heart zzso in zzso zzso were impaired because of the disorganization of zzso zzso we found that the expression of zzso was zzso in the zzso heart despite the normal expression of zzso and zzso suggesting a common mechanism for the occurrence of zzso zzso and zzso We identified zzso to be a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso zzso expressed during early heart zzso We further showed by a rescue experiment that zzso is the downstream zzso of zzso zzso From these results, we propose that the cardiac zzso zzso and its downstream signaling are crucial for establishing zzso zzso which in turn promotes zzso parallel alignment of zzso and the subsequent proper heart zzso
