zzso resistance to antibiotics is now a serious problem, with traditional classes of antibiotics having gradually become zzso New drugs are therefore needed to target and inhibit novel pathways that affect the growth of zzso An important feature in the survival of bacteria is that they coordinate their efforts together as a colony via zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulating peptides zzso are among the zzso sensing zzso involved in this zzso These peptides activate a zzso system in zzso bacteria, binding to and zzso a zzso zzso zzso called zzso which zzso a response regulator called zzso leading to gene expression and induction of zzso zzso bacteria are able to take up zzso DNA and incorporate it into their own zzso By this mechanism bacteria are able to acquire and share genes zzso zzso zzso Despite having been studied for over 30 years, this zzso has only recently begun to be explored as a novel approach to modulating bacterial zzso zzso of zzso might block the signaling cascade that leads to zzso while zzso of zzso might also reduce bacterial zzso One possible approach to zzso zzso is to examine zzso sequences of zzso that activate zzso and attempt to zzso them to zzso zzso likely to have higher affinity due to zzso for recognition by the zzso Thus, small molecules that mimic an alpha zzso zzso of zzso the putative zzso binding domain, have been shown here to inhibit growth of bacteria such as zzso zzso Such alpha zzso zzso may be valuable clues to zzso zzso agents that zzso a new mechanism to control bacterial zzso
