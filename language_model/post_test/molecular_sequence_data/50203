We have recently reported the cloning and sequencing of the gene for the zzso release factor zzso zzso displays high sequence similarity to the bacterial release factors zzso and zzso A database search for proteins resembling these three factors revealed high similarities to two zzso acid sequences deduced from zzso zzso reading frames in zzso coli and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the zzso reading frame is zzso identical to zzso and zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting that it represents zzso zzso Our comparison suggests that the expression of the zzso gene is, like that of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a stop zzso dependent zzso zzso A comparison of zzso and zzso release factor zzso including the putative zzso zzso leads us to propose a zzso model for release factor zzso zzso functions of the various zzso are zzso
