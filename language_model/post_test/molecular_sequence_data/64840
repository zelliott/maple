Complete zzso sequences of 19 zzso B virus zzso zzso of zzso A zzso were determined and zzso along with those of 20 previously reported zzso zzso Of the 19 zzso zzso six including three from Japan and three from the USA clustered with the 14 zzso zzso from Western zzso The remaining 13 zzso including four from The Philippines, two from India, three from Nepal and four from Bangladesh clustered with the six zzso zzso reported from The Philippines, South Africa and zzso Due to distinct zzso zzso zzso A in the 20 zzso zzso was classified into zzso zzso zzso for zzso and that in the other 19 into zzso zzso (a for Asia and zzso zzso The 19 zzso zzso had a sequence variation significantly greater than that of the 20 zzso zzso zzso % vs zzso zzso zzso they differed by zzso % zzso zzso The double zzso zzso in the core promoter was significantly more frequent in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso or 58 % vs zzso or 25 zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso a point zzso from G to A or T at zzso zzso was detected in 16 of the 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in any of the 20 zzso zzso which may affect virus replication and translation of zzso B e zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso A deserve evaluation for any clinical differences between them, with a special reference to zzso zzso prevalent in zzso
