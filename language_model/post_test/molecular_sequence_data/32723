zzso genes are essential for zzso in zzso male zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso exclusively expressed in mice and human zzso from the results of the zzso zzso analysis in the six zzso stages of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The full zzso length of zzso was 810 zzso with a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a 180 zzso acids protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso A zzso search in the mouse zzso database localized the zzso gene to mice zzso zzso Multiple zzso acid sequence alignment of human, zzso and rat zzso genes showed that mice zzso protein was highly zzso with the human zzso gene zzso and rat zzso gene zzso The results of reverse zzso chain reaction analysis showed that the mice zzso is exclusively expressed in the zzso and zzso of mice, and its expression is only detected after the mice is 35 days zzso Human zzso is also exclusively expressed in zzso of zzso Considering the expression profile zzso in mice and human, we propose that zzso may play a role during zzso male zzso Our study should be a basis for function characterization of the zzso zzso leading to the zzso of the molecular events underlying zzso male zzso
