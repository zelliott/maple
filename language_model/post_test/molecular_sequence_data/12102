zzso zzso activity zzso has been previously identified in the particulate fraction of human term zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 97, zzso In the present study we have zzso to zzso and characterized this zzso A zzso zzso has been obtained by zzso of the particulate fraction and subsequent zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The preparation has been shown to be free of alkaline zzso even though the zzso extract is rich in this zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso as a single broad band of 82 zzso on zzso The same band is obtained after zzso labeling of the zzso with zzso The zzso has a broad zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or other zzso zzso The activity is dependent on the addition of zzso zzso zzso or zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso were determined to be 10 zzso and 20 zzso zzso zzso activity was found at pH zzso with zzso as zzso and pH zzso with zzso The zzso activity is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis showed zzso to be zzso zzso zzso internal zzso acid sequence information was obtained after zzso zzso and identified a unique sequence with no significant similarity to known zzso zzso activity has been reported to be implicated in the prevention of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and thus preventing blood zzso
