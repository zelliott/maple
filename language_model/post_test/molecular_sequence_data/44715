The zzso gene encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that is subject to alternative zzso and zzso zzso We have recently presented data indicating that several zzso zzso of zzso incorporate elements of the zzso zzso previously implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso by the detection of an zzso zzso repeat expansion as the zzso zzso in affected zzso We now report the zzso structure of zzso and primer sequences designed to facilitate full zzso including details relating to a novel zzso zzso zzso 17) derived from the zzso of the zzso zzso The detection of a zzso within these zzso would provide additional support for the hypothesis that a zzso in zzso metabolism gives rise to the disease zzso
