The death zzso zzso zzso and their respective downstream zzso control whether or not cells initiate zzso or activate zzso events critical for proper immune system zzso A screen for upstream zzso of zzso identified a novel zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso and inducing zzso Based upon domain organization and sequence zzso this novel zzso named zzso zzso zzso interacting protein zzso appears to be a new zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain an zzso zzso domain that share 30 to zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso death domain found in zzso or the zzso zzso domain found in zzso the zzso tail of zzso contains neither motif and is zzso Despite this feature, zzso of the zzso C zzso is sufficient to induce zzso suggesting that zzso uses a novel mechanism to induce zzso zzso also induced zzso activity which was inhibited by zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso is zzso active and has zzso zzso in the zzso domain, but the zzso zzso activity is not required for zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a subset of adult zzso and is thus likely to be a zzso regulator of zzso and zzso zzso While the lack of a zzso zzso zzso linking zzso to a known upstream regulator, characterizing the expression pattern and the in zzso functions of zzso provides insight into the zzso by which cells zzso the balance between survival and death in a zzso zzso
