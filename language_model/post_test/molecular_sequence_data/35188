Human heat shock zzso factor 1 zzso promotes the expression of zzso genes and is a critical factor for the cellular protective response to zzso and other zzso In response to stress, zzso zzso a transition from a zzso zzso zzso to a zzso accumulates in the nucleus, binds DNA, and activates target gene zzso Although these steps occur as sequential and highly regulated events, our understanding of the full details of the zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Here we describe a genetic screen in humanized zzso that identifies zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso do not bind to DNA in zzso in the absence of stress and only become DNA binding competent upon stress exposure, suggesting that an additional level of regulation beyond zzso and nuclear zzso may be required for zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, we identified a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located in zzso of the zzso zzso domain, which in response to zzso stress is strongly compromised for DNA binding at the zzso and zzso promoters but readily binds to the zzso promoter, suggesting that zzso DNA binding is in part regulated in a zzso manner, perhaps via zzso differences in zzso zzso Furthermore, these results zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso domain in a function beyond its zzso role in zzso zzso
