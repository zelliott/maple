To zzso the stability of a zzso development candidate for the treatment of type II diabetes, zzso studies were initiated in organic zzso and compared to results obtained in zzso zzso zzso was assessed by reversed phase liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso Previous studies had shown zzso and zzso to be the primary mechanisms of degradation in zzso zzso Surprisingly, the use of an organic zzso did not decrease the rate of degradation and, as presented here, produced degradation products including zzso We propose here that zzso can readily occur in polar zzso organic zzso such as zzso and that the zzso forms through zzso zzso attack of an zzso acid side chain on a stabilized zzso zzso zzso
