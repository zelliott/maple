zzso zzso of human zzso A and monkey zzso were investigated with a variety of zzso as zzso Human zzso A had a strict preference for zzso zzso at zzso while monkey zzso showed a diversified preferences accommodating charged zzso as well as zzso zzso A comparison of zzso forming the zzso zzso between zzso zzso A and zzso demonstrated the presence of conservative zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso loop region near the C zzso The zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso in zzso A zzso zzso and zzso and charged or polar zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Because the zzso in the loop appeared to be involved in the unique zzso of respective types of zzso zzso zzso was undertaken to replace zzso zzso by zzso ones and vice zzso A zzso expression zzso for zzso fusion protein was newly developed for expression of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso could be successfully altered to the zzso preference and those of zzso zzso to zzso zzso confirming zzso in the zzso loop to be essential for unique zzso properties of the zzso An increase in preference for charged zzso at zzso in zzso zzso might have been due to an increase in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the reverse is zzso The changes in the zzso efficiency for peptides having charged zzso at zzso were dominated by zzso rather than zzso zzso
