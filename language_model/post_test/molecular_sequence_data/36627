zzso Y zzso has been isolated from brain extracts of the rainbow trout zzso zzso and subjected to structural zzso Plasma zzso mass zzso estimated the molecular mass of the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation unequivocally established the sequence of a 36 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass calculated from this sequence zzso zzso is consistent with that obtained by mass zzso The presence of a zzso zzso was established by zzso Rainbow trout zzso is identical in primary structure to zzso salmon zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso These data may indicate that, in this group of zzso fishes, a single member of the zzso zzso family is expressed in both zzso and peripheral zzso zzso
