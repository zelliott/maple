We have analyzed a set of new and existing strong zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso In addition to zzso and other zzso zzso three zzso behave as zzso zzso indicative of dominant negative zzso Unlike zzso zzso the three zzso zzso are zzso lethal in double zzso with an inflated zzso zzso zzso and they fail to complement very weak, otherwise viable zzso of zzso Two of the zzso result from identical zzso site zzso which create a zzso in the zzso half of the zzso domain of zzso The third zzso zzso is caused by a stop zzso just before the zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso proteins can support cell spreading in culture, especially under conditions that appear to promote zzso zzso zzso of developing animals indicate that the dominant negative properties are not a result of inefficient surface zzso or simple competition between functional and zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain of zzso beta zzso can have dominant negative effects in zzso at normal levels of zzso and that this property does not necessarily depend on a specific new protein sequence or zzso The results are discussed with respect to similar zzso beta zzso zzso zzso
