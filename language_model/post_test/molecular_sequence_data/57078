We recently reported that the putative tumor zzso gene product zzso interacts with a zzso DNA sequence zzso within the zzso growth factor zzso gene and zzso its promoter activity, suggesting that zzso functions as a zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso We now show that zzso functions also as a zzso zzso Using zzso reporter zzso we demonstrated that zzso requires both zzso and 3' binding sites relative to zzso start site for zzso zzso however, when zzso binds to either the zzso or the 3' site alone, zzso functions to activate zzso We truncated the zzso gene and established that zzso acid zzso zzso are required for zzso suppression, whereas zzso acid zzso zzso contain a domain that mediates zzso zzso These results establish that zzso has regulatory zzso that function either to activate or suppress zzso and suggest the possibility that zzso functions as an zzso and not as a zzso of selected gene zzso
