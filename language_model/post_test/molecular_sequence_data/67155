zzso gene zzso can explain a part of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso drugs, particularly zzso Genes for which zzso may potentially influence zzso of zzso including zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The aim of this prospective pilot study was to analyze the effect of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso on toxicity and efficacy in advanced breast cancer patients receiving zzso as zzso zzso zzso of zzso (6 zzso deletion in the 3' region and 28 zzso repeats, including zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were determined in 105 consecutive zzso 

A trend toward a higher global toxicity grade 3 and 4 was observed in patients zzso for the zzso zzso zzso compared with patients zzso for the zzso zzso or patients not carrying the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso versus zzso respectively, zzso The sole patient bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso deceased from zzso zzso The median response duration was zzso months zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of response was significantly shortened in patients zzso for the zzso zzso compared with others zzso 

The present data suggest that zzso breast cancer patients are not good candidates for zzso zzso In addition, attention should be paid to zzso zzso in breast cancer patients receiving zzso These preliminary data require further confirmation on a larger number of zzso
