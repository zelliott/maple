A gene coding for a zzso zzso factor zzso obtained from rat zzso zzso was used to construct an expression zzso zzso It contained a zzso gene that was zzso in frame, to a region zzso the zzso signal zzso The zzso coli zzso harboring zzso produced 18 zzso of mature zzso The zzso coli cells produced a larger amount of zzso than that of human nerve growth factor zzso which was produced using the same expression zzso The zzso coli cells harboring zzso were zzso and zzso to obtain a zzso and zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso containing zzso of the total zzso had high biological activity zzso of 30 zzso against zzso of chick zzso root zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso from the zzso had low biological activity zzso of 2 zzso and incorrect zzso zzso
