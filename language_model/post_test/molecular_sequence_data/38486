zzso 60 zzso belongs to the group of ubiquitous molecular zzso that comprise the heat shock zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso from humans was used to screen a zzso library of zzso zzso and zzso clones were zzso zzso of the DNA zzso confirmed their identity as zzso zzso These are distinct from a zzso sequence recorded previously from zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso that appears to be of zzso origin, rather than derived from the zzso zzso The full-length sequence of the zzso zzso zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and shares significant identity with zzso gene products from zzso zzso zzso humans zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso The zzso and zzso sequences are zzso zzso zzso zzso with an apparent molecular mass of zzso on zzso and is present in all zzso zzso as determined by zzso with rabbit zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso electron zzso identified the protein within zzso as expected, but also in zzso sites, including inclusion bodies of the zzso zzso (in zzso zzso the zzso wall, zzso of developing zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso indicating zzso between zzso from the zzso and its zzso zzso In human infections, serum zzso to zzso were present in only zzso of cases from Ecuador, but in zzso of subjects in three separate zzso from West zzso There was no relationship between zzso levels and age, sex, or infection intensity, and no consistent association between the zzso response and immune zzso An evaluation of zzso zzso in individual zzso revealed a mixture of zzso and host zzso zzso zzso the ratio of which varied amongst geographic zzso It is concluded that zzso responses to zzso are unlikely to contribute either to host protection or pathology in zzso
