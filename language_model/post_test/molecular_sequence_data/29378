Little is known about the structure of the C zzso of the human cardiac zzso sodium channel alpha zzso zzso but zzso zzso within this zzso acid zzso region of the channel have marked effects on channel zzso Here we report a structural analysis of the zzso tail of the cardiac zzso channel that sheds new light on mechanisms that control its zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso C zzso predicts zzso zzso structure (six zzso in the zzso half of this zzso tail but little structure in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of isolated and zzso C zzso supports this zzso Whole cell and single channel patch clamp recordings of wild type and zzso alpha zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells indicate that zzso of the zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso reduces current density but does not affect channel gating zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the sixth zzso containing a concentration of positively charged zzso along with the zzso C zzso zzso zzso also reduces current density but, in addition, has profound and selective effects on zzso (no effect on zzso Channel availability is shifted zzso zzso zzso zzso and there is a zzso increase in the percentage of channels that burst zzso to zzso during prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) versus zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso These results suggest that the charged structured region of the zzso C zzso plays a major role in channel zzso stabilizing the zzso zzso
