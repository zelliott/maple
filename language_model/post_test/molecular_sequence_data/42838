zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso product zzso was used to evaluate zzso expression in 42 cases of tumors of the zzso The results showed that there was a higher level of zzso zzso expression in zzso cell zzso of the zzso zzso than in zzso of the zzso zzso and the normal zzso adjacent to zzso P zzso zzso We had also detected zzso zzso at zzso 12 of zzso zzso in zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso products were zzso with zzso zzso zzso Thirty per cent zzso zzso cases zzso this zzso But zzso zzso was absent in 3 LP and 5 normal zzso adjacent to zzso A relationship may exist between the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso grading zzso All of 6 zzso cases containing zzso zzso were in high zzso grading group, P zzso zzso This study implicates that zzso of zzso zzso and presence of zzso zzso zzso may be one of the molecular mechanisms of maintenance of zzso and progression of zzso
