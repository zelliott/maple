zzso and differentiation of skeletal muscle cells are driven by the activity of genes zzso members of the zzso regulatory factors zzso In zzso the zzso family includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are capable of converting a variety of zzso cells into zzso and zzso To better understand their roles in fish muscle development, we isolated the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso and analyzed its structure and patterns of zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso shared a structure similar to that of zzso zzso with three zzso and two zzso and its protein contained a highly zzso basic zzso domain zzso zzso of sequences revealed that zzso zzso was highly zzso with other fish zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were more likely to be zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was first detected as two rows of zzso cells in the zzso zzso From zzso zzso transcripts were present in the zzso cells that give rise to slow muscles and the lateral zzso cells that give rise to fast zzso After 30 zzso formed, zzso expression decreased in the zzso except the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso In the zzso stage, zzso was expressed in other muscle cells and zzso zzso It was detected only in muscle in the growing zzso
