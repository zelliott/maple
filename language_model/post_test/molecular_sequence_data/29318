A zzso was constructed for red zzso zzso zzso subspecies using sequence data from the control region of zzso DNA zzso The tree was rooted using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso A division between the zzso zzso of red deer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to subspecies found on opposite sides of the Himalayan Mountains and zzso which suggests zzso should be reconsidered for the status of zzso zzso Using zzso and distance analysis, red deer and zzso are derived from a single recent common zzso which is consistent with current zzso that recognizes the subspecies of zzso zzso as zzso zzso However, zzso analysis using weighted transitional zzso caused red deer to form a sister group to zzso deer zzso zzso and zzso A zzso comparison revealed zzso also share more zzso similarities with zzso zzso although approximately zzso sequence divergence separates zzso zzso and red zzso zzso evidence from the zzso b sequences zzso observations from the control zzso Observations from this study suggest that the species status of zzso should be zzso
