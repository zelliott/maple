zzso zzso angle and zzso zzso zzso were zzso to analyze the surface composition of five zzso block zzso The zzso studied included a zzso control, a zzso version of the control zzso and three different zzso grafted zzso zzso and zzso zzso On dry samples the nitrogen signal detected using zzso decreased with increasing zzso angle zzso as the zzso was zzso closer to the zzso for all five zzso This was believed to be due to the depletion of zzso zzso hard segments at the zzso For all five zzso the surface nitrogen zzso associated with the hard segment, increased upon zzso A greater increase of nitrogen concentration was observed for the zzso grafted zzso which suggests that zzso of the zzso peptides to the zzso zzso the hard segment enrichment at the surface upon zzso Upon dehydration, the nitrogen concentration decreased for all five zzso suggesting migration of the more zzso zzso soft segment to the zzso In zzso zzso cell zzso showed an increase of cell attachment on zzso zzso zzso grafted zzso but not on the other zzso This result suggests an enhancement of zzso density at the zzso zzso in good agreement with the zzso zzso
