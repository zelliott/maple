A zzso zzso clone has been isolated from the region where the zzso zzso zzso ring a zzso is found on zzso IV of the special lobe of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The clone was characterized by zzso sequence zzso Two clusters of direct tandem repeats were identified, as well as large and small open reading frames zzso The large zzso was fused to an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso against the zzso fusion protein reacted selectively on Western blots with a zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso showed that this protein was distributed in the cells of all zzso zzso zzso We concluded that zzso a zzso zzso whose activity zzso with the synthesis of zzso zzso protein zzso et zzso zzso 83 (1981) zzso may also contain a gene which is not expressed in a zzso zzso
