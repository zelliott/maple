We established a transformed B cell line expressing both zzso and zzso on the cell surface from a patient with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso DNA and zzso of the cells were zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso were observed on both zzso Cloning and DNA sequence analyses showed that one has a zzso structure while the other has a zzso zzso Southern zzso with zzso zzso and S gamma zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso in the switch regions of zzso and gamma genes on both zzso To test expression of zzso and gamma chains in the transformed cells at the zzso we used the zzso chain reaction with three kinds of synthetic zzso as zzso one of which was part of the zzso zzso while the other two were complementary to parts of C zzso and C gamma zzso zzso analysis of the amplified products showed that the same zzso sequence is directly connected with either the C zzso or the C gamma sequence in the zzso This is direct evidence showing that in double zzso cells one zzso zzso in the transcript is alternatively spliced to C zzso or C gamma without DNA zzso The zzso in this disease could be at the zzso zzso zzso
