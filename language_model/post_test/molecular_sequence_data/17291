zzso is a potent zzso zzso produced by the soil fungus zzso zzso and is a member of a large structurally diverse group of secondary zzso known as zzso By using zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso we cloned two zzso zzso and zzso (an apparent zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso are two other zzso zzso and zzso These three genes have 64 to zzso zzso acid sequence similarity and zzso zzso with a cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso which are required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso with transcript levels dramatically increasing at the onset of zzso zzso A zzso copy of zzso can complement a zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso is a functional zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso are necessary, but not zzso for zzso zzso by zzso zzso This provides the first genetic evidence for the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
