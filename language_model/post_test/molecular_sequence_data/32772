zzso DNA zzso is a potentially important source of energy and nutrients in aquatic zzso However, little is known about the identity, zzso and interactions of the zzso capable of consuming zzso zzso from Eel Pond zzso Hole, zzso were cultivated on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso which served as the primary source of zzso zzso and zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso genes revealed that distinct bacterial zzso with comparable levels of zzso richness developed on zzso and zzso zzso Since the zzso and zzso zzso used in this study were zzso zzso the results confirm that the size alone of dissolved organic matter can influence bacterial community zzso Variation in the growth and metabolism of zzso provided insight into mechanisms that may have generated differences in bacterial community zzso For example, bacteria from zzso zzso zzso generally grew better on zzso zzso than on zzso zzso In contrast, bacteria isolated from zzso zzso zzso were more effective at degrading zzso zzso than bacteria isolated from zzso zzso zzso Thus, marine bacteria may experience a zzso between their ability to compete for zzso zzso and their ability to access zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso Together, the results of this study suggest that zzso turnover in marine zzso may involve a succession of microbial zzso with specialized ecological zzso
