zzso zzso zzso strains resistant to zzso were isolated in a high zzso frequency after zzso and selection on media containing zzso Two different resistant zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of their zzso ability were zzso All zzso zzso strains produced zzso at zzso significantly higher (up to zzso than the zzso parent strain on zzso extract zzso zzso whereas the majority of zzso strains zzso zzso lost their zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the expression levels of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso regulatory gene in zzso zzso showed that this gene was not expressed in zzso zzso strains zzso Study of fitness determining parameters showed that most zzso zzso strains had zzso growth rate, zzso and spore zzso lower that the sensitive zzso zzso studies with other zzso showed that all zzso zzso strains were also resistant to the zzso zzso and zzso but retained their parental sensitivity to zzso affecting other zzso pathways and/or cellular zzso zzso to the above, all zzso zzso strains exhibited a low to moderate zzso resistance to zzso and to several other zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and an zzso gene zzso an zzso cassette protein which may be involved in zzso resistance were cloned and zzso zzso comparison of zzso gene revealed an zzso acid substitution from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at position 54 zzso in two out of three of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed that no zzso were associated with zzso zzso Study for the zzso levels of zzso showed that this gene was zzso in the third zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso acid zzso nor an zzso of the zzso gene were found in the zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso analysis showed high levels (up to zzso zzso of the zzso transcript in all zzso zzso strains zzso This is the first report describing the existence of two zzso genes and a potential zzso gene coding for an zzso binding cassette protein in zzso zzso These results also indicate that multiple zzso mechanisms, including zzso modification due to zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene and the function of an ABC zzso zzso are responsible for zzso in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso have the genetic and zzso potential for the appearance of highly zzso zzso zzso in the zzso
