The switch in export specificity of the type III zzso protein export apparatus from zzso type to filament type is believed to occur upon completion of hook assembly by way of an interaction of the type III zzso zzso specificity switch zzso domain of the zzso control protein zzso with the integral membrane export apparatus component zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso consisting of zzso acid zzso zzso has an unstable and flexible zzso in its last 35 zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso specificity zzso we studied the effect of deletions and point zzso within this domain and characterized zzso zzso zzso of ten zzso acid zzso within the region of zzso zzso and five zzso acids of zzso zzso abolished switching of export zzso Site directed zzso showed that highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential, and that the five C terminal zzso zzso are restricted in zzso for the switching zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso which produces extended hooks with filaments attached due to delayed zzso suggested that zzso interacts with the C terminal half of the zzso domain of zzso zzso We propose a two step binding model of zzso and zzso in which zzso zzso of zzso bind to zzso upon hook assembly completion at about 55 zzso and then unfolded zzso binds to zzso to trigger the switch in zzso zzso
