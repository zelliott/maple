A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso procedure was developed for the detection of bovine viral zzso virus zzso in cell culture zzso and in bovine zzso Several sets of zzso zzso conditions and extraction methods were examined to zzso the zzso A set of zzso designed to amplify a highly zzso portion of the zzso gene from zzso zzso to zzso strain sequence from zzso zzso to zzso was demonstrated to be the most zzso These zzso zzso consistently amplify a zzso zzso from several zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The viral origin of the zzso products was assessed by zzso The introduction of a zzso zzso zzso step to remove seminal zzso prior to zzso extraction permitted zzso detection of zzso in raw and extended zzso zzso A maximum sensitivity of zzso zzso was achieved with this method using zzso extracted from tissue zzso This zzso zzso may be a useful tool for the detection of zzso in zzso of persistently infected zzso
