The principal zzso domain zzso of zzso infectious anemia virus zzso is located in the zzso region of zzso zzso variation in the zzso is considered to play an important role in immune escape and zzso zzso however, few studies have characterized genetic variation in zzso during the zzso stage of zzso To better understand the mechanisms of virus zzso we undertook a zzso study of zzso variation in a pony zzso zzso with the virulent zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso and from sequential zzso samples was amplified by zzso zzso and individual clones were zzso Of the 147 zzso clones zzso we identified 71 distinct zzso zzso that zzso into five major zzso groups, designated zzso to zzso which zzso with specific stages of clinical zzso zzso representative of each group were inserted into an infectious molecular zzso and zzso viruses were tested for zzso to zzso by zzso zzso from successive times zzso Overall, there was a trend for increasing resistance to zzso zzso during disease zzso The zzso zzso associated with zzso late in infection was resistant to both zzso and broadly zzso zzso and displayed a reduced replication zzso in zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso exerts selective pressure throughout infection and suggest that viral strategies of immune evasion and persistence change in the face of an evolving and maturing host immune zzso
