The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso has restricted zzso and spatial expression patterns during development, and several members are also found to be zzso in zzso Very little is known of the promoter elements or regulatory factors required for expression of zzso zzso zzso In this report we describe the identification and characterization of the zzso gene promoter zzso A region of 86 zzso located at zzso zzso to zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start site was identified as the zzso zzso This region was shown to be active in both zzso and zzso cell lines, contrasting with the widely different levels of zzso zzso We noted a region rich in zzso zzso downstream of the zzso zzso Using Southern zzso analyses with zzso restriction zzso and zzso sequencing of zzso DNA, sites of DNA zzso were identified in zzso cell lines which correlated with their levels of zzso gene zzso We showed that zzso was not zzso in normal zzso but that a subset of clinical samples from leukemia patients showed extensive zzso similar to that observed in cell zzso These results suggest that DNA zzso may be an important mechanism regulating zzso zzso in zzso zzso
