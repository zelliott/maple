The active site of zzso is composed of a zzso complex, where the two metal atoms are bridged together by a putative zzso zzso and are also zzso by zzso zzso namely carbon monoxide and zzso zzso of this metal site is thought to require specific protein machinery coded by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein has been cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso possesses specific zzso acid signatures for zzso binding and is able to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein binds a zzso cluster with peculiar zzso zzso an S zzso 1/2 signal presenting a high field shifted zzso together with a S zzso zzso zzso similar to those observed for zzso clusters zzso by only three zzso zzso zzso experiments were carried out to determine the nature of the fourth zzso of the zzso and its zzso was demonstrated with the formation of a zzso zzso
