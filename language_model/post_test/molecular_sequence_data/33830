Gene zzso may be an important mechanism for the evolution of new functions and for the zzso zzso of gene expression via dosage zzso Here, we analyzed the fate of gene zzso for two strains of a novel group of zzso zzso zzso that produces the zzso light absorbing zzso d as its main zzso zzso The zzso of both strains contain an unusually high number of gene zzso for zzso As has been observed for zzso zzso we find that the demography of gene zzso can be well modeled by a zzso zzso Most duplicated zzso genes are of comparatively recent origin, are zzso and tend to be located on different genetic zzso zzso of selection on zzso of different divergence classes suggest that a minority of zzso exhibit near neutral evolutionary dynamics immediately following zzso but that most duplicate pairs (including those which have been retained for long zzso are under strong zzso selection against zzso acid zzso The likelihood of duplicate retention varied among gene functional classes, and the pronounced differences between strains in the pool of retained recent zzso likely reflects differences in the zzso status and other characteristics of their respective zzso We conclude that most zzso are quickly zzso from zzso zzso and that those which are retained likely make important contributions to zzso ecology by zzso fitness benefits via gene dosage zzso The mechanism of enhanced zzso may involve zzso zzso between genetic elements zzso by zzso copies of zzso
