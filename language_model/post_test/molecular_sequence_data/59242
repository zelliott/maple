zzso factor zzso is a protein which acts on vascular zzso cells and stimulates the production of zzso Recently, we were able to purify zzso from the zzso medium of cultured human zzso zzso and clone zzso zzso In this study, we screened a human zzso library and isolated zzso clones to determine the structure of the human zzso zzso zzso By determining the zzso sequence and zzso initiation site of this zzso we found that it comprises 5 zzso and 4 zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated the presence of a single copy of the zzso gene per zzso set of zzso The 300 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site had a very high zzso content, and 7 binding sites for the zzso regulating factor zzso were zzso
