An understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cell fate determination in the nervous system requires the zzso of zzso regulatory programs that ultimately control zzso gene expression zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso orphan nuclear zzso zzso acts at several distinct steps to determine the identity and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso diversification of a class of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso controls several broad aspects of sensory zzso development and, in addition, triggers the expression of a sensory zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso to its induction of overall zzso fate, zzso zzso the fate of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso across the zzso axis by promoting zzso and zzso zzso zzso This function is achieved through direct expression zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso an zzso of zzso fate, that is inhibited in zzso through the zzso zzso Besides controlling bilateral and zzso aspects of zzso development, zzso is also required for many other zzso of diverse lineage history and function to appropriately zzso illustrating the broad and diverse use of this type of zzso factor in zzso zzso
