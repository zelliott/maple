We have cloned and characterized a novel gene zzso mapping to zzso zzso The transcript was initially identified as a partial zzso sequence in the course of constructing a transcript map of the region between markers zzso and zzso known to zzso the gene causing Best zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso zzso full-length zzso sequence was subsequently zzso The zzso gene consists of 26 zzso spanning zzso zzso of zzso DNA and is located about zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso analysis predicts that its conceptual translation product of zzso zzso acids contains two zzso zzso as well as two zzso zzso zzso reveals significant zzso to hypothetical peptides from several other species including zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating a high degree of conservation throughout zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses demonstrate widespread expression of a single transcript but varying degrees of abundance among the individual zzso zzso zzso analysis of the entire coding sequence excluded zzso as the Best disease zzso
