We report here the zzso sequence of the L gene of avian zzso zzso This is the second zzso L gene and the second avian zzso L zzso following that of zzso disease virus, to be zzso The zzso L gene is zzso zzso long and encodes a single large zzso of 2004 zzso zzso This makes the zzso L protein the smallest to be described for any zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein contains six linear zzso zzso a putative zzso site and four zzso motifs previously described for the L proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of domain III of 14 different L proteins suggests the zzso to be as distant in evolutionary terms from the other members of the zzso as are the zzso
