In order to gain additional understanding of the zzso mechanisms used by bacteria to maintain surface zzso and to identify potential targets for new zzso drugs, we zzso the variation of the zzso tuberculosis zzso profile in response to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Our analysis identified 153 genes zzso regulated after exposing bacteria to a concentration of the drug ten times higher than the zzso and 141 genes zzso expressed when bacteria were growing in a concentration of the drug zzso lower than the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the response to these different conditions is different, although with some zzso This approach allowed us to identify several genes whose products could be involved in the protection from zzso stress targeting the envelope and help to zzso the zzso level of zzso tuberculosis resistance to zzso drugs, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and proteins related to zzso zzso Moreover, we also demonstrated that the alternative zzso factor zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso once again underlining its importance in the physiology of the zzso surface stress zzso
