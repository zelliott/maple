Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been fully cloned and zzso from both zzso and susceptible clones of cotton zzso zzso of both zzso acid and deduced zzso acid sequences revealed considerable zzso zzso Further study found that two zzso occurred consistently in all resistant zzso The zzso zzso in zzso corresponding to zzso in zzso zzso might reduce the zzso sensitivity and result in zzso zzso The other zzso zzso in zzso abutting the zzso zzso zzso might affect the activity and zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso analysis showed that insect zzso fall into two subgroups, of which zzso is the zzso gene whereas zzso is the zzso gene of zzso zzso Both zzso contain zzso zzso zzso To avoid confusion in the future work, a nomenclature of insect zzso is also suggested in the zzso
