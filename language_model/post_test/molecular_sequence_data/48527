Group A zzso zzso is one of the main causes of zzso calf zzso zzso zzso strains affecting Argentinean cattle mainly possess combinations of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To determine zzso diversity among Argentinean zzso representative bovine zzso strains detected in zzso calves were selected from a survey conducted during zzso The survey covered the main livestock regions of the country from dairy and beef zzso Different zzso approaches were used to investigate the genetic evolution of zzso strains belonging to the prevalent zzso The zzso zzso tree showed that all zzso studied could be divided into several zzso Argentinean bovine zzso strains were distributed across multiple lineages and most of them were distinct from the lineage containing the vaccine zzso Only the zzso zzso tree of zzso zzso strains maintained the same lineages as observed at the zzso level, whereas a different zzso pattern was observed for the zzso zzso trees of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the strains are more closely related at the zzso level than zzso zzso Association between zzso and zzso prevalent in beef zzso and between zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso prevalent in dairy zzso were zzso In addition, Argentinean zzso zzso zzso and zzso bovine zzso strains grouped together with human zzso highlighting their potential for zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso circulating in animals raised for consumption and in close contact with humans, such as zzso contribute to a better understanding of the epidemiology of the zzso infection and zzso
