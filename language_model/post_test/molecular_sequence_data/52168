The fifth zzso resistance factor from the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized and zzso The genetic zzso for zzso zzso resistance five) was zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which also encodes a restriction and modification zzso Typical of other zzso resistance mechanisms, zzso reduces the efficiency of zzso to zzso to zzso and decreases the plaque size and burst size of the small zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso plaques occurred at a frequency of zzso and contained zzso zzso that were resistant to zzso even after repeated propagation through a sensitive zzso zzso does not prevent zzso zzso or promote restriction and modification activities, but zzso of zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso infections in zzso cells are zzso zzso is effective in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains against several small zzso zzso but not against zzso zzso The zzso zzso was localized by zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequencing identified a zzso structural gene designated zzso zzso expression was obtained when zzso was zzso into the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso is distinct from two other zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso the action of zzso does not appear to affect DNA zzso Thus, zzso represents a second zzso system found in zzso that acts at a different point of the zzso zzso zzso
