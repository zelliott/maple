A zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and found to zzso a zzso of 380 zzso acid zzso and its gene was shown to be present as a single copy in the zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons showed that the zzso zzso was most closely related to the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has four potential zzso sites, two of which are in identical positions to the two zzso sites of human kidney zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, all four zzso bonds found in zzso zzso D sequences are present in zzso although the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso during maturation of zzso zzso Ds to yield light and heavy chain zzso is absent from zzso While most zzso involved in zzso specificity and zzso of zzso zzso are preserved in zzso several zzso in these regions exhibit changes that may result in a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is present in extracts of adult zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in culture media in which zzso were maintained and was capable of digesting zzso The zzso zzso zzso may play a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso obtained from host zzso
