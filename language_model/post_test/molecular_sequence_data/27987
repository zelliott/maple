zzso zzso zzso derived from an outbreak of zzso in the Republic of zzso did not have the genetic potential to produce the zzso direct zzso but one such isolate produced a zzso zzso related to the zzso direct zzso zzso Honda, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the DNA probe for the gene zzso the zzso direct zzso (the zzso zzso under reduced zzso A DNA zzso containing the zzso zzso sequence was isolated from a selected strain and cloned into zzso in zzso zzso A clone producing the zzso direct zzso zzso was obtained by screening with zzso zzso and by an zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the cloned DNA zzso revealed that the gene zzso the zzso direct zzso zzso (the zzso zzso like the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso composed of 189 zzso acid zzso The zzso gene had significant zzso sequence zzso with the zzso gene zzso with the zzso gene copy and zzso with the zzso gene zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso deduced from the zzso sequences of the zzso gene and zzso gene were zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and contained the two zzso zzso to form an zzso bond at the same positions, and their possible zzso appeared to be similar as determined by zzso analysis and a secondary structure zzso The zzso and zzso genes may have had a common zzso and may have evolved by zzso changes so that they maintained the fundamental architecture of the zzso
