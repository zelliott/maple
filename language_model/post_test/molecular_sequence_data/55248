The first confirmed outbreak of highly zzso avian influenza zzso virus infections in North America was caused by zzso zzso however, the zzso of this virus is largely zzso This study performed zzso sequence analysis of 11 avian influenza zzso from 1956 to 1979 for comparison with zzso zzso zzso and genetic analyses included these viruses in combination with all known zzso sequences of avian viruses isolated before zzso It was shown that a zzso avian influenza virus, zzso zzso that had been isolated 3 months zzso was the closest known genetic relative with six zzso segments of common lineage zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The lineages of these zzso segments included zzso with other North American turkey viruses that were all rooted in North American wild waterfowl with the zzso gene originating from the zzso zzso The zzso demonstrated adaptation from North American wild birds to zzso with the possible involvement of domestic zzso The turkey zzso zzso zzso was the second most closely related poultry isolate to zzso zzso possessing five common lineage zzso segments zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso virus was more virulent than zzso zzso for chicken zzso and mice, indicating a greater biological similarity to zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso was identified as the closest known ancestral relative of zzso zzso zzso which will serve as a useful reference virus for characterizing the early genetic and biological properties associated with the emergence of zzso avian influenza zzso
