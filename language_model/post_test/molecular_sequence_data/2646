Using a zzso zzso a partial zzso clone for rat zzso M was identified in a zzso zzso library from rat zzso A synthetic zzso probe derived from the sequence of the insert was used to screen a randomly primed zzso zzso zzso This allowed the identification of several overlapping clones zzso the full sequence of the zzso The reading frame, zzso base pairs in zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso A highly zzso segment, 24 zzso acids in zzso located close to the zzso is proposed to serve as the zzso domain for this zzso zzso The sequence includes nine potential zzso zzso sites and one potential zzso zzso In addition, the rat zzso M sequence contains an eight zzso acid consensus sequence believed to serve as the zinc binding domain in a family of zzso zzso zzso M shows zzso similarity with the recently cloned human zzso as well as weaker but significant similarity with zzso N from zzso coli zzso and with human zzso A4 zzso zzso
