zzso T cells encountering their zzso zzso become activated and acquire the ability to zzso in response to zzso zzso is an essential component in this zzso We demonstrate that zzso cannot access DNA in zzso T cells and acquires this ability only after zzso zzso zzso zzso The transition is not associated with changes in DNA zzso or global zzso modification but rather zzso zzso zzso occurs during zzso development and proper zzso is dependent on zzso of the zzso II zzso Our findings suggest that this unique zzso zzso which can affect interpretations of zzso accessibility zzso is required for proper zzso development and maintenance of the zzso zzso This mechanism ensures that zzso driven proliferation can only occur in the context of zzso zzso
