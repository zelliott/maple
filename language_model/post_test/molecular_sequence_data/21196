Finding a series of zzso zzso zzso gene universal primer applied strategies to detect complex microbial diversity in environmental samples, especially with rapidly development of next generation sequencing technology zzso 

We used zzso soft to simulate two pairs of zzso zzso zzso gene universal zzso with zzso zzso database zzso database zzso zzso gene sequences matching zzso In succession, the zzso sample was constructed for two clone libraries by using two pairs of zzso zzso zzso gene universal zzso 

The soft simulation matched percentage result suggests that primer zzso is better than primer zzso This result is consistent with zzso and diversity index analyses by two clone zzso 

zzso and properly primer are used to recovery environmental zzso diversity, which will be advanced in environmental microbial zzso
