A zzso zzso approach was used to characterize 31 zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso a zzso zzso species, growing close to a zinc mine in the south of France zzso Laurent le zzso Comparative analysis of nearly full-length zzso zzso gene sequences showed that these zzso bacteria belonged to the zzso zzso and that they were related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso relationships of these zzso with other zzso species were confirmed by sequencing and analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso which were used as alternative zzso zzso These novel zzso strains tolerated high zzso of heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso % zzso between the strains isolated from zzso zzso but only zzso % zzso between these and the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results, together with other zzso zzso support the conclusion that these zzso represent a single, novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
