To better understand the relationship between the zzso and zzso cell types in the zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso zzso and compared its expression profile with that of four other pancreatic zzso insulin, zzso zzso and zzso Our results demonstrate that the first pancreatic marker to be expressed is insulin, exclusively in the zzso zzso These zzso cells form small groups which resemble zzso but no insulin is detected in the zzso zzso until stage zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are first expressed only in the zzso zzso beginning at stage zzso by stage 45 their expression extends into the zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, is not expressed in the zzso until stage zzso In the zzso cell clusters we do not find zzso cells surrounding zzso cells, either in the zzso or in the mature zzso zzso
