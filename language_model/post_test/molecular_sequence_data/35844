zzso influencing the direct transformation of the zzso zzso zzso with synthetic zzso were investigated by selecting for zzso zzso that contained at least partially functional zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cells, were obtained by using 1 zzso of zzso in the reaction zzso zzso such as zzso zzso enhanced transformation zzso Transformation zzso were dramatically reduced if the zzso had a large number of zzso or had terminally located zzso Transformation with zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso was efficient in a zzso strain, suggesting that the zzso for transformation with zzso is different from that with zzso zzso zzso We describe a procedure of zzso with two zzso one correcting the zzso zzso of the target zzso in the host strain, and the other producing a desired zzso acid zzso elsewhere in the zzso c zzso approximately zzso of the zzso obtained by zzso contained these desired second zzso
