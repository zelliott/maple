The zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso adds zzso DNA to zzso ends in short increments both in zzso and in zzso Whether or not zzso functions as a zzso has not been addressed zzso Here we show, first, that following zzso the zzso zzso remains zzso bound to its zzso zzso reaction zzso We then exploit this finding and a previously reported zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate that, unexpectedly, the zzso zzso zzso complex contains at least two functionally interacting zzso molecules that both act as templates for DNA zzso Here, functional zzso contains at least two active zzso
