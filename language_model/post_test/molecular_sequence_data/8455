A unique zzso site was introduced at the 3' end of zzso toxin B zzso zzso gene by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were chemically zzso and fused to the 3' end of zzso toxin B zzso zzso The fused gene was zzso (about 30 zzso zzso in zzso coli, and more than zzso of the fusion protein was zzso into the zzso The fusion protein expressed was zzso by affinity zzso The zzso protein obtained bound to zzso zzso and had the zzso of both zzso toxin B zzso and zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso After mice were zzso zzso with the fusion zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These results indicated that the fusion protein retained not only the biological function of zzso but also the zzso and the zzso of zzso toxin B zzso and zzso zzso zzso This work provided a sound basis for further studies on the construction of engineered zzso zzso
