Continuing our studies of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso antagonists, we zzso a first series of zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Through this zzso constraint it should be possible to gain insight into their three-dimensional zzso The cycles were proposed on the basis of existing ideas and hypotheses about the zzso bound zzso of BK and its zzso The reported peptides contain zzso at position 7 or zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions 7 and 8, respectively, and a zzso or zzso bridge between positions 0 and zzso zzso including zzso zzso were carried out on zzso zzso The biological activity of the lead compound zzso the linear precursors and the zzso zzso as estimated on isolated rat zzso guinea pig zzso and lung zzso are in the same zzso The zzso properties of the new zzso zzso were studied through energy zzso on a model zzso The results of the calculations support the existence of low-energy structures containing a zzso zzso such a turn in the zzso segment of the zzso can be proposed as an important structural feature of the zzso zzso of BK zzso
