The zzso zzso zzso is the closest zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to be zzso activated and able to cause zzso zzso Among G zzso zzso a zzso sequence in the second zzso loop is highly zzso However, the zzso shows a zzso sequence zzso In this study, we exchanged zzso of the zzso sequence in the zzso with a Val zzso the corresponding zzso acid in zzso or with a zzso zzso and investigated the functional consequences of these zzso In focus formation and soft zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso exhibited transforming potential similar to the zzso Surprisingly, the zzso wild type itself showed transforming activity, although not as zzso due to continuous zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso formed no zzso In agreement with these results were high levels of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso indicating zzso zzso These data emphasize the importance of the zzso sequence for G zzso signaling of the zzso Either zzso zzso or persistent zzso stimulation of the zzso causes transformation similar to zzso cells, probably zzso the same signal zzso cascade that can abrogate normal growth control zzso
