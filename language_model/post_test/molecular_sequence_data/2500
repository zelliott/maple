Using previously isolated zzso zzso strains that zzso large amounts of proteins but little zzso into the zzso we have developed a zzso system for very efficient synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso The multiple promoters and the zzso region of the zzso zzso a structural gene for one of the major cell wall proteins of zzso zzso strain 47, were used to construct zzso zzso With this system, a synthetic gene for human zzso growth factor zzso was expressed efficiently and a large amount zzso g per liter of zzso of mature zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso from the culture zzso had the same zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso acid composition as natural zzso and it was fully active in biological zzso These results, in combination with previous results, showed that zzso proteins can be produced in active form zzso times more efficiently in zzso zzso than has been reported in other zzso
