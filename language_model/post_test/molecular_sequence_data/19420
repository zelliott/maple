Group A zzso zzso also know as zzso zzso is a human pathogen and can cause several fatal invasive diseases such as zzso zzso the so-called flesh-eating disease, and toxic shock zzso The destruction of zzso tissue and the zzso acid zzso zzso is a key element of zzso zzso We therefore zzso zzso in zzso growth media in an attempt to create a simple biological system that could reflect some elements of zzso zzso Our results show that several zzso zzso factors were zzso in zzso media, including the zzso zzso a zzso surface protein and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been shown to play important roles in zzso zzso Interestingly, two hypothetical proteins of unknown function were also zzso and detailed zzso analysis showed that at least one of these hypothetical proteins is likely to be involved in zzso It was therefore concluded that this simple biological system provided a valuable tool for the identification of potential zzso zzso zzso
