zzso zzso are widely used zzso tools in zzso zzso The knowledge of their corresponding zzso is of major zzso One possible approach for zzso characterization is the application of protein zzso zzso in combination with mass zzso zzso mapping zzso Two complementary zzso strategies were zzso zzso limited zzso of zzso zzso followed by removal of zzso peptides and detachment of the zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso zzso digest of the zzso followed by extraction of the zzso peptides with the zzso and detachment of zzso peptides after removal of zzso fragments zzso zzso In the few examples published so far, immobilized zzso were used for these zzso In this study we present a method for characterization of the zzso sequences without prior zzso of the zzso zzso The separation of zzso peptides from zzso peptides was carried out by zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso without further zzso and the zzso sequences were zzso The method was developed using a model system consisting of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the commercial zzso zzso zzso In further investigations the zzso sequence of a synthetic 32 zzso acid zzso derived from heart muscle protein zzso T toward a zzso zzso zzso which was raised against the intact zzso was zzso With this approach the zzso binding site of this zzso was determined, and selective shielding of potential zzso sites in the immune complex could be zzso Furthermore, statements about the three-dimensional structure of the bound zzso were zzso
