zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection was used to monitor zzso transformations of a labeled zzso of zzso zzso Gal (1 zzso 4) beta zzso zzso in crude zzso zzso For this purpose, six authentic standards including zzso itself zzso a zzso arm attached to zzso the zzso zzso that would form by either alpha (1 zzso 2) or alpha (1 zzso 3) zzso of zzso or both zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso zzso were chemically zzso The potential degradation products produced by zzso and zzso were also zzso All of the standards were zzso competent zzso for the zzso present in zzso cells and could be baseline separated in a single run requiring 11 zzso The action of competing zzso acting on the common zzso sequence could thus be monitored in a single run with sensitivity routinely as low as a few thousand zzso
