Small interfering zzso zzso is a class of duplex zzso molecules of 21-25 zzso zzso in length functioning zzso to zzso targeted gene zzso The membrane zzso protein of severe acute respiratory zzso coronavirus zzso is highly abundant during viral infections and is a critical element for viral zzso zzso substitution in the viral zzso occurs frequently during zzso zzso In the current study, we analyzed the M gene sequences derived from 15 zzso zzso and uncovered six zzso zzso among these zzso Interestingly, these zzso zzso are all located at the zzso half of the M zzso Based on this information and previous reports, we created two novel zzso targeting two unexplored and well zzso regions in the M zzso The effects of these two zzso were tested by zzso zzso and zzso fusion gene zzso The results demonstrated that both zzso effectively and specifically blocked the targeted gene zzso Real time quantitative zzso zzso revealed that zzso targeting the 3' half of the M gene zzso induced more potent zzso than that targeting the zzso half zzso Both zzso and zzso significantly zzso M gene zzso zzso of zzso b zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso M gene specific zzso might function in a zzso zzso
