The differential display technique was applied to compare zzso from two clinical zzso of zzso zzso with different zzso high zzso strain, zzso and low zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments corresponding to several apparently zzso expressed zzso were recovered and zzso A complementary DNA zzso seen distinctly in the potent zzso producing strain was highly zzso to the zzso translation initiation factor zzso The selected DNA zzso was then used as a probe to isolate its corresponding complementary DNA clone from a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence of isolated gene revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso with the potential to zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of 43 zzso Over its entire zzso the zzso acid sequence showed strong zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to mouse zzso zzso zzso our zzso zzso gene was identified to be zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis in the two strains of zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso expression is zzso higher in the potent zzso producing zzso The restriction zzso zzso of zzso DNA from this potent strain revealed at least two zzso bands in Southern zzso analysis, suggesting two or more closely related sequences in the zzso zzso zzso
