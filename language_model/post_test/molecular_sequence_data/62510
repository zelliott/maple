zzso are major protein constituents of the zzso zzso where their stability and association into higher order complexes are critical for lens clarity and zzso They undergo modification as the lens ages, including zzso of their terminal zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso association was studied using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso wild type zzso and zzso were modified by removal of either the zzso extension of zzso zzso or zzso zzso or both the zzso and zzso extensions of zzso zzso The proteins were expressed in zzso insect cells or zzso coli and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso All zzso studied demonstrated fast zzso zzso zzso over the temperature range studied zzso degrees zzso with a tendency to form tighter zzso at higher zzso The zzso deletion of zzso zzso significantly increases the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of binding relative to unmodified zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso extensions of zzso also increases these parameters but to a lesser zzso zzso of the zzso zzso extension alone zzso gave almost no change relative to zzso The zzso net negative changes in the binding energy suggest that zzso and zzso association is zzso zzso The zzso consequences of the loss of zzso terminal extensions by in zzso zzso processing could increase their tendency to associate and so promote the formation of higher order associates in the aging and zzso zzso
