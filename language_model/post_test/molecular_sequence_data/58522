After zzso cloning of the zzso of bovine viral zzso virus zzso isolate zzso a full-length zzso clone was zzso zzso transcribed in zzso from this construct was shown to direct the generation of infectious zzso upon zzso into bovine zzso To confirm the de zzso generation of infectious zzso from cloned zzso a genetically zzso virus was zzso In comparison with parental zzso the zzso virus was slightly retarded in zzso The zzso coding region of the zzso zzso contains a zzso of 27 zzso which is not present in the zzso of its zzso counterpart, zzso Exchange of a small zzso harboring this zzso against the corresponding part of the zzso sequence led to recovery of zzso zzso zzso of the construct by introduction of a zzso derived from a zzso zzso defective interfering particle resulted in a zzso defective interfering particle which exhibits a zzso zzso These findings confirm the hypothesis that the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso are responsible for the induction of cell zzso
