zzso zzso motor zzso zzso form a clinically and genetically zzso group of disorders, characterized by muscle weakness and zzso zzso at the zzso part of the zzso due to the progressive zzso of motor zzso in the spinal zzso We report here a novel rare zzso of zzso with zzso zzso inheritance in a large Jewish family originating from zzso The disease is characterized by a predominance of paralysis at the lower limbs and an early adulthood zzso We performed a genetic study in this family to identify and characterized the causing zzso 

zzso mapping strategy and sequencing of the candidate genes were zzso zzso studies were made on patient zzso zzso experiments were performed on a cellular model of motor zzso zzso 

We mapped the disease to the zzso zzso region and identified a zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso decreasing the expression of the 2 main zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso reduced inclusion formation induced by the zzso zzso in a zzso cellular zzso 

zzso is a zzso enriched member of the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso proteins play a crucial role in protein zzso and zzso in several zzso types, in animal models and human zzso Interestingly, this zzso causing a zzso of zzso is linked to a pure lower motor zzso disease, strongly suggesting that zzso also plays an important and specific role in motor zzso
