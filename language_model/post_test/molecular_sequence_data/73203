A zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned from an expression library of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso showed that the zzso zzso consists of 209 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso This zzso is highly zzso contains four putative zzso zzso and has significant similarity to the rat zzso withdrawal zzso protein zzso and the mouse zzso specific zzso the functions of which are zzso The expression of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 407 cell lines, but not in the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso gene product expressed in zzso zzso cells bound to zzso specifically and directly and with high affinity and rendered the cells sensitive to the zzso indicating that the cloned zzso is zzso zzso showed that zzso could not assemble into a complex with a defined structure unless it zzso with the zzso From these results, it is proposed that the zzso zzso is required for both target cell recognition and pore formation in the cell zzso
