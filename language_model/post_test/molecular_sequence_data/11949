The bovine leukemia virus zzso zzso Tax, zzso zzso from three imperfect zzso repeats in the viral zzso regulatory zzso Each zzso zzso repeat contains a zzso response element zzso in the center and unique zzso and 3' neighboring sequences which are crucial for the zzso zzso by zzso zzso Here we describe the interactions of zzso zzso Tax with cellular zzso zzso The zzso zzso Tax, zzso at the zzso zzso with a zzso extension, was prepared by zzso in 6 M zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso when introduced into zzso cells by scrape zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso enhances binding of members of the zzso family of zzso proteins to zzso motifs by interacting with their zzso zzso in zzso Chemical zzso indicates that zzso of zzso proteins such as zzso becomes greatly facilitated in the presence of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso Tax interacts directly with zzso factors to activate viral zzso zzso
