A series of observations have indicated that zzso one of the major zzso zzso is involved in zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also the major component of paired zzso filaments found in brains affected by Alzheimer's zzso To explore an as yet unidentified role of zzso in zzso approximately 11,000 zzso were zzso from zzso mouse brains and compared with those from control brains at the same zzso The expression of zzso zzso a small zzso protein of the zzso zzso was significantly increased in the brains of zzso mice at 8 weeks of zzso Because zzso zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso organization, this protein was zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells that do not express zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced a marked zzso of Chinese zzso zzso cells, and simultaneous expression of zzso eliminated this effect, although zzso did not bind directly to zzso zzso This zzso activity of zzso was attributed to its zzso domain, and zzso zzso of zzso proteins 2 and 4 exhibited similar zzso zzso Taken together, the present results indicate that the level of zzso zzso and its cell zzso activity are modulated by zzso and suggest that zzso may be involved in a zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
