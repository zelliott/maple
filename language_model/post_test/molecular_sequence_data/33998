zzso or gene fusion analysis is a zzso method for detecting gene zzso in one zzso by comparing its zzso to that of other zzso The occurrence of gene zzso suggests that the two original genes that participated in the fusion are functionally linked, zzso their gene products interact either as part of a zzso protein complex, or in a zzso zzso Gene fusion analysis has been used to identify protein functional links in zzso as well as in zzso model organisms, such as zzso and zzso 

In this study we have extended this approach to include a number of recently zzso zzso four of which are zzso to identify fusion linked proteins in zzso zzso the zzso agent of African sleeping zzso We have also examined the evolution of the gene fusion events identified, to determine whether they can be attributed to fusion or zzso by looking at the conservation of the fused genes and of the individual component genes across the major zzso and zzso zzso We find relatively limited occurrence of gene zzso within the zzso lineages zzso Our results point to two zzso gene zzso which have recently been zzso confirmed, one fusion involving proteins involved in the same zzso pathway, as well as two novel putative functional links between zzso protein zzso 

This is the first study of protein functional links in zzso zzso identified by gene fusion zzso We have used strict thresholds and only discuss results which are highly likely to be genuine and which either have already been or can be zzso zzso We discuss the possible impact of the identification of these novel putative zzso zzso to the development of new zzso therapeutic zzso
