The zzso zzso is a membrane zzso of T zzso that interacts with major zzso complex class II zzso and is also a zzso for the human zzso zzso the zzso portion of zzso is predicted to fold into four zzso zzso The crystal structure of the third and fourth zzso of rat zzso was solved at zzso zzso resolution and shows that both zzso have zzso zzso zzso 3, however, lacks the zzso between the beta zzso this results in an expansion of the zzso There is a difference of 30 degrees in the orientation between zzso 3 and 4 when compared with zzso 1 and zzso The two zzso zzso structures provide a basis from which models of the overall zzso can be zzso These models suggest an extended structure zzso two rigid portions joined by a short and possibly flexible zzso zzso
