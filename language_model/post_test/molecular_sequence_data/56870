The zzso represents a structural element frequently encountered in zzso zzso However, in spite of various theoretical and experimental studies the zzso signature bands of pure zzso are still not established beyond zzso Although considerable information exists now on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso structures, the lack of knowledge concerning turn structures in general, and that of zzso in particular, presents a major uncertainty in the zzso of global protein secondary structures from zzso zzso zzso To obtain more specific information about the characteristic zzso bands in zzso we report zzso an zzso zzso analysis of a series of five zzso zzso known to form zzso from previous CD and zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Foxman, and zzso zzso zzso (1991) Journal of the American Chemical Society, Volume zzso zzso zzso We show here that in these zzso peptides the zzso groups involved in zzso that comprise a zzso zzso ring (and represent the first zzso pair in a zzso give rise to characteristic zzso I bands in the range zzso zzso with the exact position depending on the zzso and the nature of the zzso zzso
