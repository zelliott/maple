We studied two patients with a zzso T cell zzso who presented with a marked increase in blood zzso To investigate the mechanism of the zzso zzso of peripheral blood cells containing more than zzso zzso cells were tested by biological zzso for the presence of colony stimulating factors zzso In one case zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These effects were neutralized by zzso zzso zzso zzso slightly decreased zzso colony zzso zzso derived from the second patient cells zzso the same zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that in addition to zzso it contained zzso 3 zzso and zzso 5 zzso In agreement with the biological data, zzso studies using the zzso chain reaction showed that cells from the first patient expressed zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also detected in very low zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were detected in cells from the second zzso Thus zzso associated with some T cell zzso is likely due to zzso of different combinations of zzso by zzso zzso
