zzso zzso the product of the zzso gene of zzso zzso is zzso in zzso acid sequence throughout most of its length with several other zzso factors of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, 8 zzso from the C zzso the zzso abruptly breaks down, suggesting that the zzso tail of the protein may be zzso It is known that an amber zzso at the 11th zzso zzso zzso zzso from the C zzso zzso the function of the zzso zzso We have now placed zzso zzso at the ninth zzso zzso zzso zzso the eighth zzso zzso zzso zzso or the seventh zzso zzso zzso zzso from the C zzso We have tested the resulting zzso for their capacity to zzso and for their ability to transcribe from a promoter zzso that is normally read by zzso zzso bound to zzso F zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that a zzso zzso F lacking the terminal 7 zzso functions almost zzso which suggests that zzso zzso is zzso By contrast, zzso 247 is crucial for the activity of zzso zzso deletion of the 9 zzso zzso totally zzso the zzso When the terminal 8 zzso were deleted, placing zzso 247 at the C zzso the zzso activity of the factor is reduced by about zzso we attribute this effect to zzso of the positive charge of zzso 247 by formation of a salt bridge with the zzso zzso
