The human zzso zzso light chain zzso locus includes multiple variable region gene segments zzso that can be divided into four zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify specifically gene segments of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso sequences were zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of sequences within each zzso indicate that some zzso can be subdivided further into zzso The history of zzso segment zzso apparently includes at least two separate zzso the first giving rise to the zzso and the second generating further complexity within each zzso zzso of large pieces of DNA zzso by others through zzso gel zzso also played a zzso Rates of synonymous and zzso base changes between pairs of sequences suggest that natural selection has played a major role in the evolution of the zzso variable gene zzso leading to sequence conservation in some regions and to increased diversity in zzso
