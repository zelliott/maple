A combined protein and zzso model for zzso zzso zzso zzso has been derived using various zzso chemistry zzso A combination of zzso modeling zzso 31 zzso pathways for 27 zzso protein modeling zzso the rabbit zzso crystal zzso and molecular zzso calculations was used to derive a model that incorporated zzso zzso and chemical stability zzso The initial zzso model (based on a subset of 17 zzso pathways for 16 zzso and the protein model used to construct the combined model were derived independently and showed a large degree of zzso The combined model is in agreement with experimental results concerning the zzso used to derive the model and with zzso zzso data available for zzso The model has been successfully used to predict the metabolism of zzso not used to construct the model, of which four examples are discussed in zzso The model has also been successful in explaining the differences in zzso specificity between zzso and zzso
