The first step in the metabolism of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is the addition of zzso to the aromatic nucleus of zzso to form zzso with zzso release of zzso This reaction is zzso by the zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso We report here the cloning and zzso zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso all of the genes required for zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso DNA zzso revealed five open reading frames zzso The zzso acid zzso sequences of the predicted zzso from these zzso exhibit high zzso to the zzso sequences of zzso from other zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso sequence zzso four of the peptides were designated zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso for zzso zzso with gene zzso zzso The predicted zzso sequence from the remaining zzso zzso had identity to zzso alpha zzso from other zzso zzso systems but had a calculated molecular weight zzso of zzso which is zzso small for zzso alpha zzso
