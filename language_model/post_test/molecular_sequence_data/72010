The structural gene for a putative zzso family zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The sequence of the predicted gene product, zzso was zzso identical to that of the predicted product of an open reading frame, zzso from a zzso that does not produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso displayed less than zzso identity with other zzso family protein zzso from zzso zzso or other bacterial zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso Both zzso exhibited zzso metal dependent zzso activity in zzso toward zzso and zzso proteins and zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso This zzso potential also was apparent in samples of zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso activity was insensitive to zzso acid or the zzso produced zzso zzso zzso both potent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso displayed zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso share zzso sequence features with zzso family protein zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso confirms that these zzso share a common zzso zzso
