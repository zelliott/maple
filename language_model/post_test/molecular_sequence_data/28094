To identify zzso recognized by zzso zzso we have examined zzso zzso for their recognition of synthetic peptides with sequences derived from the native zzso class I zzso zzso zzso peptides spanning the zzso alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso of zzso were tested for their capacity to inhibit zzso clones in their recognition of cells expressing the native zzso zzso zzso by these peptides was found to be an extremely rare zzso One zzso zzso did inhibit recognition by one particular zzso zzso clone zzso Upon further investigation it was observed that clone 13 also recognized zzso zzso when presented in the context of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Considering that zzso 111 to 122 are located at the base of the zzso groove, and clone 13 is able to recognize zzso when presented by zzso target cells, we suggest that zzso of this zzso clone may be due to zzso zzso zzso of zzso rather than to direct binding of free zzso to the zzso Taken together, these results suggest zzso of zzso zzso by zzso peptides is a rare event at least for zzso zzso Furthermore, they demonstrate the need for caution when interpreting zzso by zzso as evidence for recognition by the zzso of the corresponding region on the native zzso
