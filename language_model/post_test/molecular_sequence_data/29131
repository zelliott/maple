The worldwide zzso of tuberculosis and the widespread appearance of zzso resistance have strengthened the need for rapid and specific diagnostic zzso The prevailing zzso identification of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso which implies the use of in zzso cultures and zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis directly in clinical samples through zzso amplification of zzso zzso designed to shorten diagnostic zzso demonstrated reliability and high zzso However, the quality of the diagnosis depends on the specificity of the target sequence for zzso tuberculosis complex zzso In the present study, we demonstrated the specificity of zzso and zzso zzso for this complex and thus the feasibility of using zzso sequences as a new target for zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso and zzso genes of 36 clinical zzso of zzso tuberculosis and 10 field strains of zzso zzso were found to be interrupted by an zzso sequence at the zzso and zzso sites, respectively, while a large number of zzso zzso species failed to demonstrate these zzso Besides, the zzso which was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, was shown to possess an zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso sequence spanning the zzso zzso site zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso amplification of zzso and zzso zzso genes as a tool for diagnosis, the specific zzso activity could represent a new molecular approach to identify zzso zzso
