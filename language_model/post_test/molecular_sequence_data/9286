The zzso repeat zzso protein family is involved in various steps of zzso metabolism in zzso and zzso To investigate the function of a zzso zzso zzso protein in the moss zzso zzso we constructed and characterized knockout zzso of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso localized zzso protein with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso showed poor growth of moss zzso To investigate whether zzso transcripts were affected by disruption of zzso we zzso the zzso to detect zzso editing events and performed zzso analyses to measure zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso of zzso did not result in defective zzso editing, but a substantial reduction in the level of mature zzso transcript was observed in the zzso zzso analysis showed that the 3rd zzso of zzso zzso was not spliced out in the zzso but the 1st, 2nd and 4th zzso were efficiently spliced zzso This suggests that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso 3 zzso was analyzed by zzso experiments with truncated zzso lacking the zzso domain or both the E and zzso zzso Both truncated genes completely restored zzso in the zzso knockout zzso This indicates that the E and zzso zzso of zzso are not required for zzso and can be deleted without loss of zzso zzso 3 zzso
