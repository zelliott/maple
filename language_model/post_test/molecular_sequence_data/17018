The crystal structure of zzso P protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined at zzso A resolution using X-ray zzso zzso The central feature of this zzso protein is a sheet of six zzso zzso twisted around a zzso zzso zzso zzso near the zzso and zzso form zzso structures that are oriented in an zzso zzso A comparison of zzso zzso acids indicates that zzso zzso is zzso to human zzso P protein zzso The zzso protein is structurally similar to bacterial zzso factors zzso and zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso proteins from zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso differs from the previously reported solution structure, where zzso data did not detect the zzso and indicated that approximately zzso of the zzso are relatively flexible or zzso zzso zzso data indicate that the protein has less zzso content than the amount observed in the zzso suggesting that in solution the zzso regions are unfolded or in equilibrium between folded and unfolded zzso this hypothesis is consistent with zzso zzso exchange rate zzso Surface zzso that are zzso from zzso to humans and are likely to interact with the zzso P zzso or other protein zzso are identified in the zzso The model of the zzso protein defined by this work provides an essential step toward eventually understanding the overall architecture of zzso zzso
