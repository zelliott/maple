zzso stabilization of zzso zzso was studied in zzso zzso its original host background, and in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso By zzso zzso analysis it was shown that 40 zzso specifically increased the chemical zzso of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso minutes whereas the zzso of zzso zzso was not increased by zzso While expression of zzso has been shown to be induced by zzso at the level of translation, our studies with three zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso stabilization in growing cells occurred independently of induced gene zzso suggesting that the stabilized zzso was not functional for protein zzso Studies of zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso end of the zzso was sufficient to zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso acid zzso in a leader zzso located at the extreme zzso end of the zzso was required for the zzso stabilization as a zzso zzso introduced into the leader zzso zzso abolished zzso By zzso zzso no differences were detected in the length of the zzso or 3' end of zzso zzso with the addition of zzso indicating that the stabilized transcript was not processed at its zzso
