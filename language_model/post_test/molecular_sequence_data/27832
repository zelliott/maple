The major zzso zzso for Lewis rats is the zzso sequence of guinea pig basic protein zzso or rat basic protein zzso T cells responsive to this zzso are I-A restricted and zzso express the V alpha zzso beta 8 gene combination in their zzso In this work, we describe for the first time the delayed appearance of T cells specific for additional discrete zzso of zzso the zzso zzso sequence of zzso restricted by zzso and the zzso zzso sequence of zzso restricted by zzso The zzso V alpha zzso beta 8 gene combination was expressed by both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cell zzso but not by zzso zzso T zzso This is the first demonstration of zzso zzso T cells in Lewis rats and supports the conclusion that the zzso class II locus is involved in zzso zzso
