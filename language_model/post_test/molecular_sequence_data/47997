zzso virus zzso zzso E zzso zzso and I zzso zzso are members of late zzso They belong to the major components of the zzso envelope and can be found on the host cell surface as zzso To get further insights in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso which are known to be activated by zzso and zzso we zzso the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing the putative promoters of zzso and zzso We have mapped the zzso start site of zzso and have identified an extensive set of zzso zzso typical zzso and zzso and further regulatory sequences to facilitate interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been made using the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as promoter zzso In zzso interaction studies, an influence on the regulation of zzso and reporter gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has become zzso In addition, zzso binding zzso using both zzso and zzso regions and cellular extracts from different zzso cells have suggested a binding of a 32 and 18 zzso zzso In conclusion, these data indicate an involvement of common cellular zzso factors in the regulation of zzso late gene zzso
