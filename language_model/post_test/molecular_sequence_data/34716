zzso translation initiation begins with assembly of a zzso zzso complex at the zzso cap structure or at an internal zzso entry segment zzso In both cases, zzso positioning at the zzso zzso requires a zzso untranslated region upstream from the initiation zzso Here, we report that translation of the zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 2 takes place by attachment of the zzso zzso zzso complex to the coding region, with no need for an upstream zzso untranslated zzso zzso This unusual mechanism is zzso by an zzso sequence that has features of an zzso with the unique ability to recruit zzso upstream from its core zzso A combination of translation zzso and structural studies reveal that sequences located 50 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso are crucial for zzso zzso
