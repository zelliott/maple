The application of mass zzso for determining the topography of integral membrane proteins has focused primarily on the mass determination of fragments that do not reside in the zzso zzso In this work, we present the accurate mass determination of zzso zzso peptides of bovine zzso using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The ability to determine the accurate mass of zzso zzso peptides will facilitate the mapping of zzso binding sites in membrane zzso It will also augment the determination of membrane spanning regions from integral membrane proteins zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in retinal rod zzso were zzso with zzso zzso peptides were separated using zzso zzso liquid zzso at 55 degrees C with the zzso zzso in the mobile zzso Four of the six zzso zzso peptides of zzso were identified, ranging in mass from zzso Da to zzso zzso The identities of the peptides were confirmed by zzso zzso In addition, zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso was identified by zzso zzso without zzso the zzso prior to zzso
