We describe the zzso attachment of zzso to the fusion zzso of respiratory zzso virus and the identification of the attachment zzso zzso of respiratory zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso followed by the zzso and subsequent analysis of the fusion zzso in conjunction with zzso gel zzso demonstrated that the fatty acid is zzso attached to the F1 zzso of the fusion zzso The bound zzso was sensitive to 1 M zzso at neutral zzso In addition, the release of zzso label by reduction with sodium zzso showed that the zzso is linked to the protein through a zzso zzso Isolation of a zzso zzso from a zzso digest of the protein and subsequent zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso within the anchor zzso located at the zzso zzso of the F1 zzso is the zzso attachment site for zzso
