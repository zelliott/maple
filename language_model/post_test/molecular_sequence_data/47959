In human cells the expression of the zzso protein zzso appears to be regulated through zzso zzso zzso However, in the zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso To shed more light on the zzso regulation of the zzso gene we have analyzed the zzso zzso zzso We find several zzso and zzso binding sites as well as three putative zzso binding sites that are zzso in the human promoter zzso We can show that both the zzso and the zzso binding sites are necessary for proper regulation of zzso zzso and show by zzso zzso zzso that all these sites are occupied in zzso In contrast, the putative zzso binding sites were not occupied by protein in zzso in primary zzso zzso either before or after induction of zzso by DNA zzso Moreover, zzso was unable to regulate the zzso of zzso promoter fragments up to zzso zzso in zzso Further, steady state levels of zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso protein expression levels in DNA zzso cell zzso Our findings exclude a direct zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso in zzso cells suggesting a dominance of zzso independent mechanisms for the regulation of zzso protein zzso
