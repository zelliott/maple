Mice zzso for a targeted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene are born with zzso zzso and die within 24 zzso of zzso Analysis of stained skeletons revealed that zzso zzso animals contained multiple zzso skeletal zzso including a zzso of the zzso centers of the bones of the middle zzso zzso analysis suggested that this zzso resulted from the transformation of skeletal elements derived from the second zzso arch into more anterior structures, resulting in a zzso of zzso cartilage adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso elements normally derived from the second arch were absent in the zzso These data provide direct experimental evidence for the existence of a zzso zzso zzso
