zzso strategies to target the molecular basis of hormone and drug resistance of prostate cancer cells are zzso Since protein zzso zzso zzso is thought to have a role in the development of the zzso zzso of prostate cancer cells and in zzso suppression, the objective of the present study was to test whether specific zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso was able to sensitize zzso prostate cancer cells the effects of zzso zzso zzso 

An active zzso zzso targeting zzso 4 in human zzso zzso was zzso by in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was also made by deleting zzso from the zzso core of the active zzso and used as a control throughout the zzso The zzso zzso sequences were then inserted into an expression zzso under the control of the zzso promoter and delivered to growing prostate cancer cells zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso A zzso resistance gene on the zzso was used to select zzso zzso The clones were analyzed for zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso drugs and ability to undergo drug-induced zzso 

Two zzso cell clones expressing the active zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso and one clone expressing the zzso inactive zzso zzso were selected for the zzso zzso 2 and zzso 12 were characterized by a markedly (about zzso lower zzso protein level than parental zzso cells, whereas no reduction in zzso expression was observed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso experiments indicated that zzso 2 and zzso 12 but not zzso cells were significantly more sensitive than parental zzso cells to a 1 zzso exposure to the zzso platinum compounds zzso and zzso and showed an increased zzso to undergo zzso zzso A significantly enhanced zzso response to zzso was also observed in a zzso zzso cell population zzso expressing the active zzso 

zzso of the study highlight the importance of zzso in the response of prostate cancer cells to zzso platinum compounds and indicate specific zzso of the zzso as a potential therapeutic strategy to sensitize zzso prostate cancer cells to these zzso
