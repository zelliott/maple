A DNA clone containing the putative zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated from a zzso DNA zzso The zzso insert contained a continuous open reading frame of zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein is 78 and zzso zzso respectively, to zzso zzso zzso proteins 1 and zzso Only one zzso gene could be detected in zzso zzso zzso DNA by Southern analysis with a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis detected a single, abundant zzso zzso zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso When cells were grown on zzso levels of zzso zzso were markedly increased by comparison with zzso zzso levels in cells grown on ethanol, a zzso carbon zzso In contrast to this zzso zzso zzso the carbon source had no dramatic effect on the levels of zzso protein or zzso activity in the zzso zzso strains zzso These results suggest that zzso mechanisms are responsible for modulating expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
