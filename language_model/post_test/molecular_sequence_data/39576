zzso zzso zzso serve as a zzso model system for studies of viral zzso zzso zzso virtually all zzso but cause disease only in the very zzso zzso strains of the three zzso zzso differ in zzso following infection of newborn zzso zzso are zzso zzso particles that consist of ten segments of zzso zzso zzso within two protein shells, the inner core and outer zzso zzso structures of individual components of the zzso outer zzso and a single viral zzso have been solved and provide insight into the functions of these molecules in viral attachment, entry, and zzso zzso of zzso to target cells is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that projects from the outer zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso and zzso acid is a zzso for zzso 3 zzso After binding to receptors on the cell surface, zzso is zzso via zzso zzso zzso is followed by zzso zzso of the viral outer zzso in the zzso zzso zzso events, which require zzso pH and zzso zzso lead to removal of major zzso protein zzso resulting in exposure of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso change in attachment protein zzso After penetration of zzso by zzso zzso the zzso active viral core is released into the zzso where replication zzso Despite major advances in defining zzso attachment and entry mechanisms, many questions zzso zzso research is aimed at understanding zzso differences in zzso zzso viral zzso zzso the individual and corporate roles of zzso pH and zzso in viral entry, and zzso function in membrane zzso
