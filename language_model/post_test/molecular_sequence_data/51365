We have found that various mycoplasma species quickly and efficiently incorporate zzso into their zzso from labeled zzso added to the zzso The label can be in any of several positions in an zzso and incorporation also occurs efficiently from labeled zzso zzso also incorporate the zzso when they zzso a zzso cell culture; the host cells do zzso This incorporation presumably involves zzso of the zzso followed by zzso to zzso conversion to zzso and incorporation in new zzso We believe that the processing of zzso by mycoplasma could be a source of artifacts in zzso work in cell culture and could have implications for the development of zzso zzso We also suggest ways to exploit the incorporation phenomenon in mycoplasma zzso
