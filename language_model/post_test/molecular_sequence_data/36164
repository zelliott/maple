zzso studies at the zzso interface were carried out on the major zzso zzso derived zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso derived zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the minor zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso obtained showed that the two zzso lipids had molecular surface areas about twice those of the zzso lipids at all surface pressures, suggesting that both polar zzso of the zzso lipids are anchored into the zzso zzso even at the collapse pressure zzso zzso A zzso hydrocarbon chain zzso thus appears to be preferred for the zzso lipids at the zzso zzso rather than an extended chain zzso The zzso zzso of the two zzso lipids zzso and zzso were very similar at pH 0, both molecules being zzso but at pH zzso or 8, zzso films were much more expanded than the neutral zzso due to zzso of the zzso group in zzso and the resulting zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were much less zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso because the latter lipids contain the more zzso zzso zzso oriented in horizontal zzso at low surface pressures, compared to the lower zzso of the zzso zzso in the vertical zzso particularly at pH 0 and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
