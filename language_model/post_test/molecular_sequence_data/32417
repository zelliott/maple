The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso family represent one of the largest zzso families in the animal kingdom and exert their actions via a zzso of structurally related zzso zzso In this study, we have identified a novel zzso zzso from the zzso heart, zzso zzso includes zzso and motifs typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso that expressed zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso an induction of membrane zzso currents coupled to the zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso with moderate zzso zzso zzso P and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely failed to activate zzso whereas a zzso P analog containing a zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso of zzso These functional analyses prove that zzso but not zzso serve as zzso functional zzso through zzso although both of the family peptides were identified in a single species, and the importance of zzso zzso in the specific recognition of zzso by zzso is zzso through evolutionary lineages of zzso Southern zzso of zzso products revealed that the zzso zzso was widely distributed in the central and peripheral nervous systems plus several peripheral zzso These results suggest multiple zzso functions of zzso as zzso both in the zzso central nervous system and in peripheral zzso This is the first report on functional discrimination between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
