The genetic zzso zzso has a dual zzso serving as a zzso and zzso zzso However, most popular gene zzso programs only take it as a stop zzso resulting in zzso or completely missing zzso zzso We developed a zzso method named zzso that is specific for the prediction of zzso zzso zzso To evaluate its effectiveness, we first applied it to 14 zzso zzso with previously known zzso zzso and zzso identified all reported zzso genes without redundant zzso When we applied it to 12 zzso zzso that had not been researched for zzso zzso zzso detected a novel zzso gene in zzso zzso Further evidence was also collected to support that the predicted gene should be a real zzso zzso The result shows that zzso is effective for the prediction of zzso zzso zzso
