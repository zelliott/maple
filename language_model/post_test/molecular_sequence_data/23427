zzso are composed of bacterial cells embedded in an zzso zzso zzso A major component of the zzso coli zzso zzso is zzso a linear zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso PGA mediates zzso zzso and attachment of cells to zzso zzso In this report, we present genetic and zzso evidence that PGA is also a major zzso component of zzso produced by the human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso respiratory pathogen zzso zzso We also show that PGA is a zzso for zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and that an zzso zzso B zzso is produced by zzso zzso We further show that zzso zzso PGA zzso with zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is genetically and structurally related to zzso Our findings confirm that PGA functions as a zzso zzso zzso in zzso diverse bacterial species and suggest that PGA may play a role in zzso zzso and cellular detachment and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
