The early 3 region zzso of two strains zzso type zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso 11, causing persistent urinary and acute respiratory zzso respectively, has been identified and partially zzso The zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso were 1980 and 1966 zzso long and zzso three complete zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The sequence analysis of the zzso gene product demonstrated that a zzso domain and a zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the signal zzso There was one zzso acid mismatch between zzso and zzso represented by an zzso instead of a zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain, which binds to class I zzso was relatively zzso between zzso and zzso with the exception of zzso and zzso in zzso which were replaced by zzso and zzso in zzso Within the zzso protein of zzso the zzso acid sequence zzso was deleted from a position immediately upstream the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame zzso of zzso was deleted in the zzso of zzso and zzso It is noteworthy that zzso and zzso which both cause persistent infection of the urinary tract display a remarkable similarity in several zzso of the zzso zzso
