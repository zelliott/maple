zzso zzso are soluble serum zzso in which the zzso play significant roles in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso produced in different host cells by zzso DNA technology are becoming major therapeutic agents to treat life threatening diseases such as zzso Since zzso is cell type specific, zzso produced in different host cells contain different patterns of zzso which could affect the biological zzso In order to determine the extent of this variation zzso zzso structures present in the zzso of different animal species were zzso zzso of human, zzso dog, zzso guinea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cat, and chicken were treated with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analyzed by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso for neutral and zzso zzso in positive and negative zzso zzso zzso The data show that for neutral zzso the proportions of terminal zzso core zzso and/or zzso zzso containing zzso vary from species to zzso for zzso zzso in the negative mode zzso show that human and chicken zzso contain zzso with zzso acid zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso contain zzso with zzso acid zzso In contrast, zzso from dog, guinea zzso zzso and rabbit contain both zzso and zzso Further, the zzso F released zzso were zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso with laser induced zzso detection zzso The zzso results indicate that the proportion of the two zzso of zzso zzso complex zzso vary significantly, suggesting that the branch specificity of zzso zzso might be different in different zzso These results show that the zzso of zzso is zzso and reveal the necessity for appropriate cell line selection to express zzso for human zzso The results of this study are useful for people working in the transgenic zzso
