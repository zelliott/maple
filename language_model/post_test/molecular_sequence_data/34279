zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso activity against zzso C virus zzso in cell zzso Previously, zzso zzso cell lines resistant to zzso were selected, but transfer the zzso zzso zzso was not observed following zzso of whole cell zzso To further explore the nature of the resistance of zzso to zzso full length zzso zzso sequences were obtained from two zzso zzso zzso and the parental zzso cell zzso Numerous zzso changes were observed in individual zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso consensus zzso but no common zzso in the zzso zzso genes or zzso were zzso A cluster of single zzso zzso was found within a zzso portion of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequences from both resistant cell zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were individually inserted into zzso zzso zzso zzso showed reduced replication (5 to zzso but none zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cured of zzso zzso by serial passage under zzso zzso of cured zzso and zzso with either whole cell zzso from zzso zzso or zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited an zzso zzso zzso (the active zzso of zzso was found to be inactive against the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These data confirm previous speculations that zzso resistance to zzso is not due to zzso in the virus, and demonstrate that zzso resistance and most likely the zzso activity of zzso are due to interactions with cellular zzso
