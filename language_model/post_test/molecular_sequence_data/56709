The atomic structure of a truncated zzso zzso from human zzso virus 1 zzso that contains the principal zzso zzso sites and the zzso binding domain has been derived by molecular dynamics and calculation of potential energy using the zzso force zzso The zzso zzso molecular model is consistent with known properties of zzso and zzso with zzso with a substantial reduction in the sum of the internal potential energies of the individual proteins zzso E zzso zzso zzso The primary mechanism of recognition and binding is the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso into a zzso zzso zzso pit formed by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to zzso delta E for the zzso complex is reduced significantly zzso zzso zzso is by zzso interactions of the aromatic groups forming a zzso zzso stable environment for these functional zzso bonding zzso This model for zzso provides a theoretical basis for the evaluation of zzso molecular zzso involving the zzso zzso the analysis of zzso on functional immune response of the host, and the design of zzso zzso specific for the zzso binding site on zzso
