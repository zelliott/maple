zzso peptides are expected to be beneficial compounds that improve our quality of zzso To address the growing need for functional zzso we have examined zzso synthesis by using microbial zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso the zzso of unprotected zzso acids in an zzso manner and is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso to achieve cost-effective zzso To obtain a zzso with novel zzso zzso we focused on the putative zzso involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso designated zzso The zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso protein produced showed the broadest zzso specificity of any known zzso it detected 136 of 231 combinations of zzso acid zzso when zzso synthesis was zzso In addition, some new zzso zzso were identified and unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso were found to be acceptable zzso Furthermore, kinetic analysis and monitoring of the reactions over a short time revealed that zzso showed distinct zzso selectivity at the N and C zzso which made it possible to specifically zzso a zzso without zzso such as zzso and zzso with the reverse zzso zzso specifically zzso the following functional zzso including their zzso zzso zzso zzso yield, zzso zzso zzso zzso yield, zzso zzso zzso of zzso which has zzso zzso yield, zzso zzso zzso zzso yield, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso which enhances zzso yield, zzso Furthermore, our results also provide new insights into zzso zzso
