Human cells are known to express many zzso zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso Wondering whether there also is zzso zzso zzso an zzso containing three zzso zzso we wrote simple computer code to screen human expression sequence tags zzso deposited in different public databases, and obtained hundreds of putative zzso zzso We then used zzso zzso and zzso zzso browsers to further analyze their zzso and identified 61 zzso and two zzso zzso (one zzso containing four different zzso We also identified 57 zzso zzso or zzso zzso that contained both zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso In some zzso zzso the downstream partner was fused to the zzso tail of the upstream partner, which, together with the zzso zzso suggests a possible new mechanism for zzso fusion that occurs after both zzso and zzso have been zzso and possibly outside the nucleus, in contrast to the two current hypothetical mechanisms, zzso and zzso that occur in the zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso had zzso in the nucleus but, surprisingly, localized mainly in zzso 1 and zzso In some zzso zzso as well as in some zzso that were derived only from zzso the zzso might be zzso or zzso Actually, we cloned a new zzso zzso coined as zzso zzso zzso may not always be zzso Fusion of three or more zzso to one, fusion of zzso to zzso and zzso or zzso of zzso should all enlarge the cellular zzso repertoire, in turn enlarging the cellular zzso zzso future experimental zzso of the existence of these novel classes of fusion zzso and spliced zzso in human cells should significantly advance our understanding of biology and zzso
