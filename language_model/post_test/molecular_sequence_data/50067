Using mixed resistance gene zzso as zzso a putative resistance gene zzso was isolated from soybean and characterized zzso The zzso protein consists of a zzso zzso zzso domain, a zzso binding site zzso domain, an imperfect zzso repeat zzso domain and two zzso zzso zzso Due to these features, zzso represents a distinct member in the zzso class of resistance zzso zzso analysis indicated that there were several zzso sequences within the soybean zzso and two zzso zzso were mapped onto linkage group zzso zzso was induced by zzso treatment and soybean mosaic virus zzso infection in the resistant line zzso zzso An zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of the zzso gene were also identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was highly zzso to zzso and zzso but had a zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso was zzso by viral infection in zzso These results indicated the complexity of the regulatory mechanism in the plant responses to zzso zzso
