zzso prediction of the binding affinities of zzso zzso to their biological targets is fundamental for zzso drug design but remains a very challenging zzso In this paper, we have performed zzso studies to predict the binding models of 31 zzso zzso (the second zzso zzso of zzso zzso to their target, the zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and their binding zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso was able to reliably predict the binding models, as confirmed by zzso determined crystal structures of some zzso zzso zzso with zzso However, all the zzso methods we have tested, including an empirical scoring function, two zzso scoring functions, and zzso zzso mechanics and generalized Born surface zzso yield poor to modest prediction for binding zzso The linear correlation zzso zzso value between the predicted affinities and the zzso determined affinities was found to be between zzso and zzso zzso of ensemble zzso zzso obtained from molecular dynamic simulations did not significantly improve the zzso However, major improvement was achieved when the zzso change for zzso between their zzso and zzso or zzso free zzso was included in the zzso zzso and the zzso value increased from zzso to zzso The prediction was validated using 10 additional zzso zzso designed and evaluated by an independent zzso This study demonstrates that zzso reorganization free energy plays an important role in the overall binding free energy between zzso zzso and zzso This term should be evaluated for other zzso systems and included in the development of new scoring zzso To our best knowledge, this is the first zzso study to demonstrate the importance of zzso reorganization free energy for the prediction of zzso binding free zzso
