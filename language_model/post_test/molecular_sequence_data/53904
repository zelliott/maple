zzso translation termination is essential for cell zzso In zzso this process is strictly maintained by two zzso zzso release factor 1 zzso which recognizes all stop zzso and zzso zzso and zzso release factor 3 zzso which is an zzso factor zzso zzso zzso stimulating zzso zzso To zzso the evolution of this core system, we cloned and zzso the zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are generally thought to be zzso zzso as well as those from two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also determined the sequence of the zzso gene for zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso appears to have only one domain, corresponding to zzso while other zzso (including the zzso zzso zzso have an additional zzso domain, of zzso zzso zzso Considering this novel zzso structure and our extensive zzso zzso we suggest that zzso the current translation termination system in zzso evolved from the zzso version, zzso zzso was introduced into the system prior to the divergence of extant zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso might be the first zzso branch among the organisms zzso
