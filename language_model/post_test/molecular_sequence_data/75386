Some zzso characteristics of zzso binding zzso zzso in several species have been zzso zzso zzso were determined from Ferguson plots and were used in conjunction with zzso zzso determined by zzso density zzso zzso to calculate the molecular weights of the zzso These were found to range from zzso zzso to 60,000 zzso for most zzso The zzso monkey was found to have a molecular weight twice that of other species zzso zzso zzso was prepared from human, zzso and guinea pig zzso The molecular weights of the zzso material, as determined by gel zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso were in excellent agreement with those determined by Ferguson zzso zzso examination of the zzso proteins by zzso at pH zzso revealed that each consisted of two closely related zzso zzso zzso peptides were prepared from the zzso proteins and separated by reversed phase zzso zzso The zzso patterns were identical for the three proteins with the exception of three zzso zzso zzso terminal sequence analysis of the rat and human proteins revealed no apparent zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the three zzso proteins was also zzso but no zzso was zzso The results obtained suggest that while the molecular size and zzso of peptides have been zzso across species considerable surface differences must zzso
