zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso highly resistant to zzso zzso Also, the strain is able to degrade zzso into the less toxic compounds zzso and zzso zzso this zzso has potential to be employed in zzso zzso In this context, defining its biological safety is zzso With that purpose a number of intrinsic zzso usually zzso with virulent zzso were zzso Few zzso factors were detected in strain zzso For instance, a zzso gene is present, but it is not apparently expressed in zzso zzso adherence factor and zzso activity were also zzso Additionally, zzso to zzso cells was zzso Resistance to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso and also to the zzso agent zzso was zzso Five plasmids zzso 7, 10, zzso and one greater than zzso were zzso No Class I and II zzso were zzso Study of the optimal growth conditions showed that zzso easily adapts to different environmental zzso Overall, the results suggest that zzso zzso zzso can be considered safe to use to zzso zzso in contaminated zzso
