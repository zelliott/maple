Although zzso 13 zzso is an important zzso of asthma and allergic diseases, the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso gene expression are not well zzso This study was designed to define the molecular mechanisms governing zzso gene expression in T zzso zzso expression was examined in human peripheral blood T cells and in the zzso zzso line by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso An zzso promoter deletion analysis was performed using zzso reporter plasmids zzso zzso into zzso cells by zzso DNA binding factors were investigated using zzso mobility shift zzso In contrast to zzso zzso which required zzso zzso of zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso alone was sufficient for zzso protein zzso in zzso (but not zzso peripheral blood T cells, and for zzso zzso expression and promoter activity in zzso T zzso zzso deletion analysis localized a zzso zzso zzso zzso element to a zzso promoter region between zzso and zzso base pairs upstream from the zzso zzso start zzso This promoter region supported the binding of both zzso and zzso nuclear factors in gel shift zzso
