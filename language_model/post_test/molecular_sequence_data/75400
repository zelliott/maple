The zzso zzso zzso promoter is often employed in zzso expression zzso due to its very high zzso Its activity in zzso cells has been shown to be due to an upstream zzso site zzso at zzso to zzso Since levels of zzso zzso can sometimes be elevated by heat shock of zzso cultures this investigation determined how specific deletions of zzso promoter sequences effect levels of zzso zzso both before and after heat zzso A series of zzso promoter deletions was inserted on a high copy zzso into cells having a zzso gene disruption of the solitary zzso zzso zzso This enabled zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso origin to be distinguished by virtue of their different zzso Certain deletions lacking zzso displayed activities that were very low in zzso cells, but which increased fifty to zzso fold after heat zzso With zzso present heat shock had only a relatively small or negligible effect on zzso zzso zzso Heat shock zzso was abolished when the zzso to zzso region with zzso to the heat shock element consensus of zzso was deleted in addition to zzso but was unaffected by the deletion of regions further downstream containing zzso and zzso sequence zzso This is the first demonstration of a heat shock element, an zzso site normally found upstream of zzso heat shock protein zzso as a natural constituent of a high efficiency zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso may be one member of a small subset of zzso genes that are highly expressed in zzso cells yet possess a heat shock element to ensure their continued zzso after heat zzso
