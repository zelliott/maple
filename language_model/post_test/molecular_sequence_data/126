A real-time zzso zzso was developed to detect and zzso zzso disease viruses zzso in clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso minor groove zzso zzso zzso amplified and zzso to a region in the fusion protein zzso gene that zzso to the zzso site of the zzso zzso which is a key zzso of zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso provided high specificity to the zzso as was shown by the successful and rapid zzso determination of 39 zzso strains representing all the known zzso (I to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso strains had high zzso sensitivity, detecting approximately 10 and 20 copies of the target zzso per reaction, zzso The detection limit was also determined in terms of 50% egg zzso dose zzso by using dilution series of virus stock solutions to be approximately zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and stool specimens from zzso infected animals were tested to prove the clinical suitability of the zzso The results of this study suggest that the described real-time zzso zzso has the potential to be used for the rapid zzso of zzso zzso and zzso measurement of the virus zzso
