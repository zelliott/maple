zzso T4 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso steps of a zzso repair zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso module with an essential zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso module with an essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the viral zzso proteins reveals several shared features, including an alkaline pH optimum for the zzso zzso an intrinsic zzso zzso activity, and a zzso or zzso zzso structure, that distinguish them from the zzso zzso zzso zzso found in zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso differ from each other in their preferences for zzso of zzso zzso blunt ends, or recessed ends, none of them displays the preference for recessed ends reported for zzso DNA zzso We zzso that zzso provides zzso that have it with a means to evade an zzso zzso host zzso zzso zzso of the essential zzso steps of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso establishes their capacity to perform zzso repair reactions in zzso A supportive correlation is that zzso and zzso which are distinguished from other zzso by their possession of a zzso zzso are also unique among the zzso in their zzso of putative zzso zzso
