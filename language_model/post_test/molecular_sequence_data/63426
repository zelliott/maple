zzso zzso zzso is the third zzso in the reductive zzso zzso pathway, which is responsible for the breakdown of the zzso bases zzso and zzso in higher zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso are grouped into two zzso unrelated zzso a general zzso one and a zzso zzso To reveal the molecular architecture and understand the zzso mechanism of the general zzso zzso zzso we determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso to zzso A zzso It shows a zzso assembly of the zzso in the shape of a left-handed zzso turn, in which tightly packed zzso units are related by zzso zzso Such an assembly would allow formation of higher zzso by attachment of additional zzso on both zzso The zzso has a zzso fold and consists of a central zzso with a layer of zzso packed against both zzso However, the core fold of the zzso zzso zzso is extended in zzso zzso zzso by addition of several secondary structure elements at the zzso The active site can be zzso from the zzso by a narrow channel and contains the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso
