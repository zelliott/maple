zzso in the zzso zzso form zzso root zzso in association with zzso zzso Several aquatic and zzso species have the additional capacity to form stem zzso and some of them can zzso interact with specific strains that do not produce the common zzso factors zzso by all other zzso The question of the emergence and evolution of these zzso characters has been the subject of recent zzso We conducted a molecular zzso analysis of 38 different zzso zzso The zzso was reconstructed with both the zzso DNA zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso DNA zzso zzso We also tested 28 zzso species for their capacity to form root and stem zzso by zzso different zzso zzso including zzso strains zzso zzso and a zzso strain zzso zzso likelihood analyses resolved four distinct zzso groups of zzso We found that stem zzso may have evolved several times in the zzso and that all zzso species using a zzso symbiotic process clustered in the same zzso The zzso approach suggested that zzso zzso has evolved once in this zzso and should be considered as a derived character, and this result is discussed with regard to previous experimental zzso
