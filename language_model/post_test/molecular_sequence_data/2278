zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso cloned and expressed in zzso coli, has been zzso to zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso was determined and the zzso acid sequence zzso The zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso to yield a partially inactive zzso After about zzso loss of activity, no further zzso is zzso The rate of zzso exhibits a zzso dependence on zzso zzso zzso concentration with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 300 zzso zzso of 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso for 120 zzso results in the incorporation of zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso completely protect the zzso against zzso by the zzso and decrease the zzso incorporation from zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso offers only partial zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso functions as an affinity label of the zzso binding site and that specific reaction occurs at only about zzso zzso zzso or 3 zzso zzso zzso modified with 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso was reduced with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso peptides were zzso by high performance liquid zzso and characterized by gas phase zzso Two peptides modified by the zzso were isolated and identified as zzso zzso and zzso These two peptides were located within the derived zzso acid sequence as zzso zzso and zzso In the presence of zzso which completely prevents zzso only zzso zzso was zzso This result indicates that modification of the zzso causes loss of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso is the probable reaction target and is located within the zzso binding zzso
