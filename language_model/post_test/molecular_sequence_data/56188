Blood zzso from patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis and zzso healthy zzso protein zzso donors were infected with human zzso virus type 1 zzso in zzso to assess their zzso to productive infection by zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso in zzso of infected cells from patients with zzso albeit zzso were significantly higher at days zzso of culture; the maximum levels of zzso zzso were greater in zzso of zzso zzso from patients than maximum levels for controls zzso zzso zzso The maximum zzso in zzso levels for patients also exceeded that for controls zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or initiation of reverse transcription, measured by zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso primer pairs, was variable and low in infected zzso from both patients and controls, and did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso The frequency of infected cells as assessed by zzso dilution viral cultures was similar for both zzso zzso blood zzso from patients with active tuberculosis can develop a highly productive infection with zzso that does not appear to be due to enhanced zzso entry or higher frequency of infected zzso The enhanced zzso may result directly from zzso of zzso by exposure to zzso tuberculosis and its products in zzso
