zzso of zzso or trans zzso zzso adjacent to zzso acid zzso introduce a zzso into the backbone of peptides when positioned respectively at the zzso and zzso position of the zzso This is confirmed by zzso experiments performed on a model zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group allows simple probing of the zzso limits and zzso potential of a zzso binding site, a technique applied successfully to the zzso zzso
