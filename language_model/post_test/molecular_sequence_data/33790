The zzso channel is a zzso channel activated by zzso zzso features that reflect the dynamic flexibility of the channel include zzso pore zzso following zzso application and direct zzso interaction with activated zzso zzso receptors on the zzso We have been studying the mechanisms by which zzso channel functionality is zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso expression system, we observed that the pore properties, including zzso selectivity and zzso depend on the open channel density on the zzso zzso zzso was apparent when the open channel density was high and inward zzso was zzso We also observed that zzso channels show zzso zzso despite the absence of a zzso zzso zzso At a zzso state after zzso application, zzso channels were activated upon membrane zzso This zzso zzso was also zzso zzso With increases in zzso the speed of zzso zzso was increased and the zzso relationship was shifted towards zzso zzso Based on analyses of experimental data and various simulations, we propose that these phenomena can be explained by assuming a fast zzso binding step and a zzso zzso gating zzso Complete zzso of these regulatory mechanisms awaits dynamic imaging of functioning zzso zzso
