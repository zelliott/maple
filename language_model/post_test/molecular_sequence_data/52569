zzso acid zzso in biological zzso binds to serum zzso and other proteins that enhance its effects on cellular zzso The zzso protein zzso binds zzso with an affinity zzso zzso 6 zzso similar to that of the G zzso zzso receptors zzso by zzso differentiation genes 2, 4, and 7 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and greater than that of serum zzso zzso zzso 360 zzso At zzso of zzso or less of that in zzso which are observed in zzso of injured zzso zzso and zzso zzso augment zzso stimulation of nuclear signals and protein synthesis in rat cardiac zzso zzso that express zzso and zzso zzso At zzso of zzso or more of that in zzso zzso suppresses zzso stimulation of zzso The lack of effect of zzso on zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso plus a zzso zzso without zzso zzso to its specificity for zzso delivery and the absence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding and cellular delivery of zzso by zzso zzso and peptides zzso the two zzso binding zzso of zzso suggests competition between zzso and zzso for the same zzso Thus, delivery of zzso to zzso is zzso to zzso receptors by zzso in a zzso zzso
