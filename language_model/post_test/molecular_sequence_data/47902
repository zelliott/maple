Era is a small zzso widely zzso in zzso and zzso Although essential for bacterial growth and implicated in diverse cellular zzso its actual function remains zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that Era may be involved in some aspect of zzso zzso The zzso domain contains features in common with all zzso and is required for Era function in zzso The zzso domain zzso bears scant similarity to proteins outside the Era zzso On the basis of sequence zzso we argue that the zzso is similar to, but distinct from, the zzso zzso zzso Although both contain the consensus zzso zzso zzso the protein folds are probably zzso We show that bacterial Era binds zzso in zzso and can form zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso motif and other zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso decrease zzso binding in zzso and have corresponding effects on Era function in zzso including previously described effects on cell division and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso located in the predicted switch II region of the zzso coli Era zzso domain, also zzso zzso leading us to propose that the zzso domain regulates zzso binding in response to unknown cellular zzso The possible biological significance of Era zzso binding is zzso
