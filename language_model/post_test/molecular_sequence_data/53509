The early growth response zzso zzso gene encodes a zinc finger zzso factor which is critical for cell proliferation and zzso The human zzso promoter comprises regulatory elements including two zzso sites, an zzso site, two zzso response elements and an zzso binding zzso In addition to these zzso factor binding sites, the promoter zzso five serum response elements zzso and associated binding sites for the zzso zzso factor family, previously identified from partial sequence data zzso et zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso We now report the full sequence of the human zzso promoter and confirm the presence of a fifth serum response zzso This element is functionally active in a minimal promoter zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso
