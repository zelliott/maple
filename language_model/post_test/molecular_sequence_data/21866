To allow zzso of bacteria previously reported as the SP group and the zzso group, 35 zzso from zzso zzso rabbits zzso a dog and humans zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso of partial zzso sequences showed that 34 of the zzso were closely zzso demonstrating at least zzso % zzso zzso zzso gene sequence comparison of 20 selected zzso confirmed the zzso of the SP group and revealed zzso zzso % similarity between zzso A blast search using the zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the highest similarity outside the SP group was zzso % to an zzso rat zzso The single strain, zzso representing the zzso group showed the highest zzso zzso gene similarity zzso zzso to members of the SP zzso zzso gene sequence analysis of 11 representative strains resulted in similarities of zzso among the SP group zzso which showed 80 % sequence similarity to the zzso group zzso zzso similarity values based on the zzso zzso indicative for whole zzso zzso showed the SP group being clearly separated from established zzso whereas the zzso group strain was associated with the SP zzso A new zzso zzso zzso zzso with only one species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to include all members of the SP zzso The new zzso can be separated from existing zzso of the family zzso by at least three zzso zzso The most characteristic properties of the new zzso are that zzso is not observed on bovine blood zzso positive reactions are observed in the zzso test, acid is produced from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and negative reactions are observed for symbiotic growth, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Previous publications have documented that both zzso and zzso were produced by the proposed type strain of the new zzso Michel zzso and that the major zzso of representative strains zzso strain not included) of the zzso is zzso zzso is present in moderate amounts and zzso and zzso are zzso only in minor zzso The major fatty acids of strain Michel zzso are zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso and summed feature zzso : zzso zzso : 1) zzso This fatty acid profile is typical for members of the family zzso The zzso content of DNA of strain Michel zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso in a previous zzso The type strain is zzso zzso Michel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
