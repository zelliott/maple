Many zzso alter their zzso composition in response to changes in light wavelength in a process termed complementary chromatic zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are characterized by zzso chromatic zzso Instead of adjusting to different zzso of light, zzso and zzso behave as if they are always in green light; they do not respond to red zzso We have previously reported zzso of zzso by zzso transfer of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA has now been localized by genetic analysis to a region on the rescued zzso zzso that contains a gene designated zzso This region of DNA is also able to complement zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA from zzso and zzso indicates that these strains harbor DNA insertions within the zzso sequence that may have resulted from the activity of zzso genetic zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso shares strong identity to response regulators of bacterial zzso regulatory zzso This relationship is discussed in the context of the zzso zzso zzso regulation of genes zzso zzso zzso during chromatic zzso
