The zzso gene zzso a heat shock zzso factor, zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso from zzso zzso is more than zzso zzso to that of zzso from zzso zzso The zzso box, a zzso sequence region zzso specific to zzso and two downstream box sequences complementary to a part of zzso zzso were zzso zzso extension analysis showed that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed from only one zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the level of zzso zzso was clearly increased at 20 degrees C, a temperature that zzso heat shock in this zzso In the presence of an inhibitor of zzso zzso the degradation of zzso zzso was much slower at 20 degrees C than at 10 degrees zzso Thus, increased stability of the zzso zzso might be responsible for the zzso zzso zzso The predicted secondary structure of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was different from the zzso patterns reported for most zzso bacteria, and the base pairing of the downstream boxes appeared to be less stable than that of zzso coli zzso zzso Thus, essential features that ensure the zzso expression at a relatively low temperature are embedded in the zzso gene of zzso
