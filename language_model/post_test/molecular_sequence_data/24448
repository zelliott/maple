The zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso that zzso associates with the zzso zzso II core and constitute the only two components of the zzso for which no structural information is zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the complex between the zzso zzso zzso E and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso E has an zzso zzso structure and contains two potential zzso binding zzso while the smaller F zzso wraps around one side of zzso zzso at the interface between the two zzso We propose a model for the interaction between zzso and the core zzso zzso in which the zzso binding face of zzso is positioned to interact with the nascent zzso zzso
