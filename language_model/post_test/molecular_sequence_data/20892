zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso infecting rats and humans, zzso Both present extraordinary life cycles zzso a zzso generation in addition to zzso zzso In search of molecules possibly involved in zzso interaction, we performed mass zzso to identify zzso products of zzso zzso zzso others we detected zzso of the heat shock proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso are well known as zzso involved in stress responses of cells, but recent studies suggest additional roles of small zzso for zzso biology including immune zzso To zzso zzso we cloned its full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso tested its zzso role as an interaction partner of zzso studied its zzso in the zzso and expressed the protein to test its immune zzso The zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso a zzso of 110 zzso acids with an approximate molecular weight of zzso The zzso protein is highly zzso to that of the human pathogen zzso zzso with only eight zzso acid zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso locus revealed that the gene is linked head-to-head to the gene zzso zzso and both share a zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated potential independent expression of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso results demonstrate zzso zzso in the gut zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show zzso of zzso but no binding to zzso zzso zzso experiments finally revealed a strong zzso of zzso and provided evidence for a role in regulating the zzso zzso
