The coordination modes of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides with zzso activity isolated from zzso zzso of zzso were investigated by means of electron zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso and zzso The results allow the identification of the complex species involved and the attribution of the spectral data set to the various complex zzso According to the zzso data, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso belonging to the zzso or zzso zzso of the peptides is involved in the metal coordination in a complex which is a minor species at neutral pH zzso
