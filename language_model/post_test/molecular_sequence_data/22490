The zzso zzso of the zzso complex is highly zzso from zzso to humans and contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The central region of zzso shares significant sequence zzso to the zzso SAM zzso Members of this large family of bacterial proteins contain a zzso cluster and use zzso zzso to zzso a variety of radical zzso To zzso characterize this domain we have expressed and zzso the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of a zzso cluster has been confirmed by zzso zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso zzso and the zzso content determined by both a zzso zzso and atomic zzso zzso The zzso zzso involved in cluster formation have been identified by zzso zzso The protein binds SAM and the binding alters the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso Our results provide zzso support to the hypothesis that zzso does indeed contain the zzso cluster which characterizes the zzso SAM zzso and binds zzso suggesting that zzso in addition to its zzso activity, has a second as yet zzso zzso zzso We also present preliminary data to show that the protein zzso zzso
