The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned and zzso There were two positions zzso to the active site zzso and in the zzso interaction site zzso with zzso zzso The zzso genes of strain zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso exhibiting the highest sequence similarity were zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was more zzso than the zzso zzso The apparent zzso value at zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso was higher than that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in which a zzso substitution was introduced at position 229 decreased the zzso stability and zzso value at zzso zzso The zzso zzso that was zzso zzso with His increased the zzso stability and zzso value at zzso zzso These results indicate that the His zzso at position 229 of the zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso stability and the zzso function at high zzso
