The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in zzso and degradation of Tomato bushy stunt zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso a model host zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Baker, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso screen identifies host genes affecting viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To test if the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso could also affect zzso zzso in this paper, we silenced zzso in zzso zzso an experimental zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased by 50% and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso We also observed up to zzso increase in the emergence of new zzso and partly zzso viral zzso in the silenced zzso Using a zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso which supports authentic replication and zzso of zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibited the zzso of zzso and partly zzso viral zzso Altogether, the data from a plant host and zzso system confirm a central role for the plant zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and viral zzso zzso
