To obtain high levels of expression of the free alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso we have used two plasmids zzso and zzso that carry the genes zzso the alpha and beta zzso zzso The expression of each zzso in zzso coli zzso results in overproduction of each zzso We also report new and efficient methods for zzso the individual alpha and beta zzso zzso of the beta zzso are obtained by addition of zzso zzso 8000 and zzso to crude bacterial zzso This zzso procedure is similar to methods used previously to grow zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 beta 2 complex for X-ray zzso and to purify this complex by zzso from bacterial zzso The results suggest that zzso by zzso may be useful for other zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the alpha zzso zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso liquid zzso on a zzso Q zzso The zzso alpha and beta zzso are more than zzso pure by the criterion of sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The procedures developed can be applied to the expression and zzso of zzso forms of the separate alpha and beta zzso The zzso alpha and beta zzso provide useful materials for studies of zzso association and for investigations of other properties of the separate zzso
