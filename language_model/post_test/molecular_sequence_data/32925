General zzso factor zzso plays an essential role in zzso initiation by zzso zzso II at numerous zzso However, understanding of the assembly and a full structural characterization of this large 15 zzso complex is zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be present twice in this complex and to be critical for the function and assembly of zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain is required for its incorporation within zzso and zzso experiments carried out by electron zzso at low resolution have suggested that this domain might zzso possibly explaining the zzso architecture of zzso However, the resolution at which the electron zzso zzso analyses were conducted is not sufficient to determine whether zzso occurs or whether a more intricate assembly zzso other zzso is zzso Here we report the X-ray structures of the fully evolutionary zzso zzso zzso of the zzso N zzso from zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso displays a novel fold with specific surfaces having zzso zzso properties that can form zzso zzso Although a zzso zzso zzso one of these surfaces is present in one of the crystal forms, several zzso analyses show that this zzso is zzso in solution, even at various salt conditions and in presence of different zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso N zzso which is zzso to a zzso motif but has not been fully zzso during evolution, was studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that this zzso zzso at very high concentration but is neither required for zzso zzso nor for incorporation of two zzso molecules within zzso and for the assembly of this zzso Altogether, although our results do not argue in zzso of a zzso of the zzso zzso domain, our structural analyses suggest a role for this domain in assembly of zzso and its related complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso
