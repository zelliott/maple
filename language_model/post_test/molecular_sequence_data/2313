Two integrated zzso B virus zzso DNA molecules were cloned from two primary zzso zzso each containing only a single zzso One integration zzso contained a single linear segment of zzso DNA, and the other integration zzso contained a large zzso zzso of viral DNA at the site of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso junctions of zzso placed the left zzso junction at zzso zzso which is at the zzso end of the directly repeated zzso sequence and is 6 base pairs from the 3' end of the long zzso negative zzso The right zzso junction was at zzso zzso in a region of viral DNA zzso the cohesive zzso which shared zzso zzso with cellular zzso zzso analysis of the normal cellular DNA across the integration site showed that 11 base pairs of cellular DNA were deleted at the site of zzso On the basis of this analysis, we suggest a mechanism for integration of the viral DNA zzso which involves strand invasion of the 3' end of the L negative strand of an open circular or linear zzso DNA zzso (at the zzso zzso and base pairing of the opposite end of the zzso with cellular DNA, accompanied by the deletion of 11 base pairs of cellular DNA during the double zzso zzso zzso across the zzso zzso of zzso DNA in clone C4 located one side of the inversion at zzso 1820, which is 2 base pairs from the 3' end of the L negative zzso Both this sequence and the left zzso junction of zzso are within the zzso terminally redundant region of the zzso L negative strand zzso We suggest that the terminal zzso is a preferred zzso I zzso region because of both its base sequence and zzso zzso Such zzso would lead to integration and zzso of zzso molecules within the terminal zzso as we have observed in both our zzso
