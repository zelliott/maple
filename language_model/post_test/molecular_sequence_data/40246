We report the zzso zzso resolution crystal structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in its closed zzso The zzso structure is highly zzso to known structures of the zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, it also presents some unique features that are described and discussed here in zzso zzso differences, in particular in the zzso adopted by the so-called lid zzso suggest that the opening mechanism of zzso may differ from that of other zzso zzso Because the zzso activity of zzso is strongly dependent on structural zzso of this mobile zzso we focused on zzso the molecular mechanism of lid zzso Using the zzso structure of zzso we carried out extensive zzso simulations in explicit zzso environments zzso and zzso zzso to characterize the major structural zzso that the lid zzso under the influence of zzso or upon zzso zzso Overall, our results suggest a zzso opening mechanism that gives rise first to a semi-open zzso upon zzso of the protein at the zzso zzso zzso followed by a further opening of the lid upon zzso zzso
