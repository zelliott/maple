zzso zzso by plant symbiotic zzso plays a central role in the zzso interaction established by these organisms, as well as in nitrogen flux in a variety of zzso In the present study, we report on the functional properties, structural organization and distinctive mode of regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso the nitrate zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso As revealed by experiments conducted in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso for nitrate and zzso It is expressed in zzso zzso and in zzso where it zzso accumulates in the plasma membrane of zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is transcribed from a zzso gene clustered with the nitrate zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso was specifically zzso following transfer of zzso to zzso (or zzso zzso However, at zzso with the strict zzso induction commonly observed in other organisms, zzso was also zzso (at both the zzso and the protein zzso following transfer to a zzso zzso This unusual mode of regulation differs from that of the adjacent nitrate zzso zzso which was expressed at zzso levels under nitrogen deprivation conditions and required nitrate for zzso The functional and expression properties, described in the present study, delineate zzso as a versatile zzso that may be especially suited to cope with the fluctuating (and often zzso mineral nitrogen zzso found in most natural, especially forest, zzso
