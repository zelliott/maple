A zzso within the obese gene was recently identified as the genetic basis for obesity in the zzso zzso The obese gene product, zzso is a zzso protein expressed predominantly in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso role as an zzso signaling zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso with the obese gene zzso zzso with minimal zzso zzso Upon differentiation of zzso zzso into zzso the zzso zzso was expressed zzso with zzso zzso zzso marker zzso A zzso present in calf serum markedly activated expression of zzso by fully differentiated zzso zzso A zzso fast decreased (by approximately zzso the zzso zzso level of zzso tissue of lean zzso or zzso mice but had no effect on the approximately zzso higher level in obese zzso zzso Since the zzso at the zzso locus fails to produce the functional zzso yet its zzso zzso is zzso it appears that zzso is necessary for its own zzso zzso zzso was also suppressed in zzso tissue of rats during a zzso fast and was rapidly induced during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provoked by zzso also markedly zzso zzso zzso and this suppression was rapidly reversed by zzso These results suggest that insulin may regulate the expression of zzso
