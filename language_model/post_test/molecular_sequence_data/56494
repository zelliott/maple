The two mouse melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso retain their zzso capacity when cultured in zzso zzso peptides such as zzso hormone zzso induce formation and release of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells do not respond to zzso Using zzso analysis and zzso zzso we demonstrate that the lack of response of zzso cells to zzso is due to the absence of functional zzso receptors from the cell zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso zzso These cells represent a new tool for the study of signal pathways related to the control of zzso in melanoma zzso
