zzso zzso binds a series of zzso fatty zzso To identify the fatty acid binding site, this zzso zzso from zzso zzso blood by zzso zzso was zzso labeled using zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso the fatty zzso zzso was zzso zzso acid sequence analysis showed that this zzso consisted of the zzso acid zzso zzso The fact that no appreciable zzso acid was detected at 14th cycle on the degradation suggested that zzso was modified with the fatty zzso The finding that zzso zzso did not cleave off at the zzso supported this zzso These results indicate that the zzso group of the bound fatty acid is located close to zzso in human zzso
