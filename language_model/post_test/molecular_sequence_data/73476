zzso zzso I feedback regulatory protein zzso mediates feedback zzso of zzso zzso I activity by zzso and also mediates the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso To characterize the molecular structure of zzso we have zzso it from rat liver using an efficient step of affinity zzso and isolated zzso zzso based on partial zzso acid sequences of peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso between the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso and the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso showed that the mature form of zzso consists of 83 zzso acid zzso with a calculated Mr of zzso The isolated zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with six consecutive zzso zzso at its N zzso The fusion protein was zzso and zzso with zzso to remove the zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso showed kinetic properties similar to those of zzso zzso from rat zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso indicated that zzso was a zzso of 52 zzso zzso equilibrium zzso confirmed the zzso structure of zzso by giving an average Mr of zzso which is 5 times the calculated molecular weight of the zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso structure of zzso we have proposed a model for the zzso structure of zzso and zzso zzso I zzso
