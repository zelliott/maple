Using CD zzso we have investigated the effect of zzso on the secondary structure of synthetic peptides zzso and zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of chicken zzso In addition, zzso zzso was used to estimate the zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding by both zzso Both peptides exhibited unusual CD zzso complicated by the high proportion of aromatic zzso revealing little secondary structure in zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso induced an increase in random zzso to resemble zzso The zzso of both peptides was zzso by zzso and this was used to calculate zzso of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Other zzso zzso showed lesser effects on the zzso of the zzso
