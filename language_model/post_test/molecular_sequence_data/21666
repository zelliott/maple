zzso zzso zzso are a distinct class of zzso to zzso zzso produced by a zzso zzso and are associated with zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the several hundred species of zzso zzso identified thus far, zzso consist of more than 30,000 different species in zzso Studies in flies, fish and mice zzso these zzso in regulating germ line development, the zzso of selfish DNA zzso and maintaining germ line DNA zzso Most zzso map to unique sites in the human zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in humans remains to be zzso Here, we uncover an unexpected function of the zzso zzso in zzso We show for the first time, that the zzso located in zzso 1 of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in adult human zzso zzso and zzso and in the human cell line zzso zzso Although the role of zzso expression in brain tissue remains unknown, the zzso expression is consistent with previous findings in several zzso Surprisingly, in contrast to the mechanism known for zzso zzso of gene zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso gene expression by binding to its zzso zzso This finding suggests that changes in individual zzso levels could influence both zzso gene expression and the expression of the gene in which the zzso is zzso These findings offer a new perspective for zzso functioning as gene regulators in zzso
