The reaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was carried out using pulse zzso to understand the effect of zzso of zzso on its zzso zzso This reaction produced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The formation of these products was established with the help of zzso zzso and mass zzso The mass spectral data indicate that the major site of zzso is at zzso while the site for zzso is at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not produce any zzso species upon zzso with zzso The quantitative chemical modification studies indicated that one of the three zzso zzso is zzso modified during pulse zzso The zzso studies of the oxidized zzso revealed that it has similar zzso properties as the zzso zzso Further, the zzso studies point out that both oxidized and zzso zzso zzso are equally efficient in producing free zzso in presence of copper and zzso that resulted in comparable cell zzso
