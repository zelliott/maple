A zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso grows zzso at 88 degrees zzso To understand the structural basis for the zzso of zzso we have determined the crystal structure to zzso A zzso The zzso zzso unit contains three zzso related by approximate zzso zzso and a zzso is built up by twofold zzso zzso The zzso fold of zzso is almost identical to that of the known crystal structure of the model from zzso zzso A detailed comparison of the crystal structure of zzso with related structures from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli shows significant differences that may account for the difference in their zzso A reduction in zzso zzso additional aromatic zzso and more intimate association between zzso all contribute to the larger zzso of zzso In particular, deletions in two zzso surrounding the active site help to stabilize its zzso while zzso networks unique to zzso are located in the active site and near the zzso The identification of structural features that make zzso more adaptable to extreme temperature should prove helpful for future biotechnology zzso
