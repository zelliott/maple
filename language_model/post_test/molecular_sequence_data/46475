A major problem in designing vaccine for the dengue virus has been the high zzso zzso in the envelope protein of different virus zzso In this study, a zzso approach was adopted to identify a zzso vaccine candidate against dengue virus that may be suitable for large populations in the zzso zzso Different zzso tools were exploited that helped the identification of a zzso zzso zzso in the dengue envelope zzso The tools also rendered the prediction of zzso and population coverage to the proposed zzso zzso vaccine candidate against zzso A zzso region, spanning 19 zzso zzso was identified in the envelope protein which found to be zzso in all four types of dengue zzso Ten zzso zzso sites were identified within the zzso zzso zzso sequence and a total of 8 overlapping putative zzso T cell zzso zzso were zzso The zzso of these zzso was evaluated in terms of their binding affinities to and zzso zzso from respective human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were studied among populations in the dengue endemic regions and compared with respect to zzso restriction patterns of the overlapping zzso The cumulative population coverage for these zzso as vaccine candidates was high ranging from approximately zzso to zzso zzso analysis suggested that a zzso zzso fitted well into the zzso groove of zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso cluster was shown to have the potential for use as a vaccine candidate against zzso
