A transcript map was previously constructed in the zzso zzso region of zzso One of the zzso zzso displayed zzso to a zzso bovine zzso channel and to a human zzso channel zzso zzso at both the zzso and the zzso zzso In addition, all three sequences exhibited zzso to numerous zzso derived from human, zzso rat and zzso While the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso small peptides of zzso and 243 zzso zzso respectively, the bovine zzso has a length of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the human genes represent a novel and separate class of small zzso zzso Unlike other zzso channels, the zzso zzso was recently shown to zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso genes have thus been designated zzso and zzso for zzso zzso channel genes 1 and 2, zzso Since a direct association exists between a number of human zzso channel genes and a range of zzso diseases, zzso possibly represents a candidate for one of the many diseases linked to zzso To facilitate defined zzso zzso we determined the zzso structure of the zzso zzso
