zzso and zzso analysis were studied among zzso individuals in zzso zzso population originating from a cross between wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso parent, salt zzso and zzso Red zzso parent, salt zzso For genetic analysis and zzso test gave a good fit of zzso ratio showing that one major gene was controlling the salt tolerant character in zzso zzso DNA of zzso population was extracted to develop tolerant and sensitive gene pools, respectively, based the zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 520 random zzso were used to amplify the two types of gene zzso Only primer zzso was found to be zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso in the two parents, F1 and zzso zzso So, the specific zzso zzso was, a zzso marker linked to salt tolerance gene in zzso zzso By the software zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso and the linking distance was zzso zzso zzso was extracted from the zzso and mixed with zzso zzso then the zzso was transferred into zzso The clone was determined 591 zzso after being zzso It indicated that the zzso marker of salt tolerance gene in zzso Red was zzso
