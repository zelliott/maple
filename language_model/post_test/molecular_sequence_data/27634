zzso secondary structure models supported by zzso evidence have been derived for the 3' terminal domain of large zzso zzso (the region that exists as a separate zzso S molecular entity in zzso zzso through a comparative analysis of all the zzso and zzso sequences at present zzso While several universally zzso features of secondary structure are found, a few diversified structural elements are also detected which are specific to one of the primary zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso some appear to be selectively preserved during the evolution of the primary zzso suggesting they represent functionally important zzso Thus, although the role of this 3' terminal domain in zzso function still remains unknown, its mode of sequence variation clearly points to a significant diversification of its function among the primary zzso
