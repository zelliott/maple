We constructed a series of zzso stem cell factor zzso zzso which were zzso truncated at the 3' zzso The zzso six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 142 and 133 zzso acid zzso of the mature zzso protein fused to the zzso zzso peptides derived from the zzso zzso Each zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso cells, and the cultured zzso was zzso for its ability to support the growth of a human zzso cell line, zzso and to enhance colony formation by zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that as few as zzso 142 but not 133 zzso acid zzso of zzso remained biologically active in zzso suggesting that the region of 9 zzso acids from zzso to zzso containing a zzso zzso bond may contribute to the zzso end of the active zzso of zzso
