DNA zzso activities in zzso cell extract of zzso zzso a zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso activities were zzso The activity in fraction I was more heat stable than that in fraction zzso Two different genes zzso and zzso zzso family B DNA zzso were cloned from the zzso by zzso using zzso zzso based on the two zzso motifs zzso A and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences from their entire coding regions contained all of the motifs identified in family B DNA zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The product of zzso gene zzso I) was zzso resistant and heat stable up to 80 degrees zzso In contrast, the product of zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso sensitive and stable at 95 degrees zzso These properties of Pol I and Pol II are similar to those of zzso II and I, respectively, and moreover, those of Pol I and Pol II of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso Pol I exhibited the highest identities to zzso family B DNA zzso zzso found only in the zzso zzso zzso while Pol II exhibited identities to zzso found in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results provide further evidence that the zzso zzso has two family B DNA zzso Furthermore, at least two DNA zzso work in the zzso cells, as found in zzso which contain one family B DNA zzso and one zzso DNA zzso of a novel zzso
