The solution of the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso has enabled us to undertake a zzso modeling exercise on the sequence differences between the families of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This analysis indicates that the secondary structure elements in the core of the two zzso of a single zzso of these zzso are zzso as are zzso directly implicated in the recognition of the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of the sequences indicates that the zzso in the pocket accommodating the side chain of the zzso acid zzso are zzso between these two zzso suggesting that the small differences in specificity arise from minor changes in molecular structure, possibly associated with shifts of the main chain rather than zzso of zzso in the pocket zzso While zzso zzso zzso is an zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso The differences in zzso structure can be understood in terms of the deletion in the latter of a zzso loop, which forms important interactions around the zzso axis in zzso
