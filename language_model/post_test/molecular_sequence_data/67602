zzso zzso zzso is an active element involved in zzso signaling and plays critical roles in zzso plant zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a putative sequence from zzso zzso zzso designated zzso The expected protein exhibits a similar molecular structure to that of zzso zzso however, zzso displays more sequence polarity in the zzso site due to substitution of some crucial zzso zzso predicted to be involved in zzso Further, zzso expression was assessed throughout fruit zzso to determine its role in fruit zzso Comparing the expression data with the zzso aspects that characterize zzso stages indicates that zzso zzso is usually associated with the signature events that are triggered in an zzso manner such as floral zzso fruit zzso zzso and cell division and zzso However, the diversity in zzso expression profile during the zzso process of early and late plum zzso seems to be due to the zzso of zzso zzso levels among the two zzso which consequently can change the levels of zzso zzso available for the fruit to zzso zzso The effect of zzso on stimulating zzso production and in regulating zzso was zzso Our data suggest that zzso is involved in the transition of the mature green fruit into the zzso phase and in enhancing the zzso process in both zzso and zzso manners zzso
