According to known zzso sequences of zzso zzso correlated zzso and human being, sequences of zzso zzso were defined with computer zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso about 640 zzso in zzso was directly amplified by two temperature point zzso chain reaction from extracted zzso DNA of two blood samples of zzso malaria patients from Yunnan zzso Using zzso zzso method, the sequences of amplified DNA fragments were determined separately and showed no difference between the two zzso However, comparison of the sequence reported by zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) and that of amplified zzso of Yunnan zzso zzso zzso revealed the existence of zzso substitution and deletion which occurred respectively in the sites zzso and zzso and resulted in the change of restriction zzso
