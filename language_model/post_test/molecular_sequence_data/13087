zzso tobacco showing zzso resistance against cucumber mosaic virus zzso can be infected by the strain zzso By use of zzso zzso between full-length zzso clones of zzso of strains zzso and zzso the existence of two independent mechanisms of zzso resistance against viral replication and movement of zzso was demonstrated in these zzso The data indicate that viral zzso may serve as the target for both mechanisms of zzso A positive correlation was observed between the amount of zzso zzso sequence present in the zzso zzso and the ability to overcome the zzso of zzso whereas a sequence domain was zzso in zzso zzso responsible for the ability of this strain to break resistance against virus zzso
