An in zzso selection procedure for identifying highly efficient zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso is presented as a model system for engineering zzso to improve their zzso zzso zzso protocols as well as the rationale for setting up such a system are included, using the zzso sequence that encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso virus 1 zzso 1) as a target zzso of zzso Using the selection system, we have successfully generated zzso zzso zzso that more efficiently cleave the zzso zzso in zzso and more effectively inhibit the zzso expression in cultured cells than the zzso derived from the zzso zzso P zzso zzso The in zzso selection system represents a novel and effective approach for engineering highly active zzso P zzso that can be used in both basic research and clinical therapeutic zzso
