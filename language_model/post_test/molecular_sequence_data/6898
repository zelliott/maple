zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso This study characterizes mouse zzso its molecular form, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso sequence was determined from zzso clones selected from a mouse zzso zzso expression library using a bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and size of zzso zzso were determined using Northern zzso zzso zzso followed by Western zzso analysis provided characterization of molecular properties of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso gene zzso used Southern zzso of a panel of zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso 

Mouse zzso is a zzso acid protein with zzso identity to bovine and chicken zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso protein contains consensus sequences for zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso is present in cornea and several other zzso zzso against bovine zzso reacted with zzso mouse zzso expressed in zzso coli and also detected high molecular weight zzso in extracts of mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso released zzso zzso demonstrating the presence of zzso zzso zzso chains on mouse zzso zzso in zzso The zzso gene zzso was mapped to the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso The zzso map site is in the region of a previously identified zzso zzso eye zzso affecting zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse cornea and describes the tools zzso and zzso necessary to investigate the functional role of this important zzso zzso using naturally occurring and induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
