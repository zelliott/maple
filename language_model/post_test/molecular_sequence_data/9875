zzso growth zzso 1 zzso 1) is strongly expressed during zzso and in sites undergoing intense development and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso have been identified as zzso zzso zzso This study was undertaken to further explore the role of the distinct zzso receptors during kidney zzso The zzso sequence information for the two T beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the rat was zzso Two full-length T beta zzso zzso were cloned from a zzso rat kidney and lung libraries, and sequencing revealed that they were the rat zzso of human zzso and zzso zzso Both types I and II zzso receptors are expressed in the kidney as determined by Northern zzso zzso T beta zzso zzso abundance was significantly greater in the zzso rat kidney compared with the adult rat zzso Similarly, zzso zzso was more highly expressed in the fetal and zzso rat kidney than the adult rat zzso In contrast, there was no significant difference in zzso zzso abundance among the zzso zzso and adult rat zzso Thus, based on these findings, both T beta zzso and zzso are zzso regulated in the zzso Increased expression of T beta zzso and zzso proteins in the developing kidney was confirmed by zzso Interestingly, the two zzso receptors did not entirely zzso raising the intriguing possibility that other zzso signaling receptors may be zzso
