The zzso resistance gene product, zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to cancer cells by maintaining zzso levels of zzso agents below a killing zzso zzso is located within the plasma membrane and is thought to act as an zzso drug zzso zzso The zzso zzso represents a member of the zzso cassette zzso of zzso (or traffic zzso and is composed of two highly zzso halves, each of which harbors a zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso This review focuses on various zzso and molecular genetic approaches used to analyze the structure, function, and mechanism of action of the zzso zzso whose most intriguing feature is its ability to interact with a large number of structurally and functionally different zzso zzso These studies have underscored the complexity of this membrane protein which has recently been suggested to assume alternative zzso and zzso structures, and to serve multiple functions both as a zzso and as a zzso With respect to the zzso zzso activity of zzso progress has been made towards the zzso of essential zzso acid zzso and/or zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso activity of zzso has been zzso The mechanism of drug transport by zzso however, is still unknown and its zzso role remains a matter of zzso
