Southern zzso of zzso DNA extracted from a human primary zzso zzso revealed amplification of a zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso Two additional rearranged DNA fragments, lying upstream of zzso fused to distant zzso sequences from the same zzso with an opposite zzso zzso to head zzso head to zzso were also found to be zzso zzso analysis suggested that these zzso resulted from illegitimate zzso at two distinct points within the DNA sequence just upstream of the zzso zzso and further that these events triggered two different amplification mechanisms, only one of which, involving a strand invasion event following DNA double strand breaks, increased the copy number of the zzso zzso
