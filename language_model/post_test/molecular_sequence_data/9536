zzso active peptides exert their biological effects by interacting directly with a cell's zzso zzso zzso These zzso promising peptides have demonstrated a variety of activities including zzso zzso membrane zzso and cell penetrating zzso Here, we use zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso supported zzso zzso constructed on single crystal silicon to study two pairs of closely related membrane active peptides selected from rationally zzso zzso libraries to have different activities in zzso zzso zzso zzso or no zzso Using zzso we observed that binding of a membrane zzso zzso to the zzso zzso resulted in a small decrease in membrane resistance followed by a recovery back to the original zzso The recovery may be directly attributable to zzso zzso A zzso zzso did not decrease the zzso The other pair, two membrane zzso zzso caused an exponential decrease of membrane resistance in a zzso zzso This zzso of the supported zzso occurs at zzso to zzso ratios as much as zzso lower than that needed to observe effects in zzso leakage zzso and gives new insights into the fundamental zzso interactions involved in membrane zzso
