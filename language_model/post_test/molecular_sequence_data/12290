Evidence documenting the requirement for a functional DNA zzso I when zzso zzso zzso uses zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso as the sole carbon and energy source is zzso Providing rat zzso beta in trans demonstrated that the growth zzso observed were due exclusively to the lack of DNA zzso I zzso The location of the zzso (a zzso zzso that rendered cells unable to grow on zzso zzso or zzso was determined by DNA sequencing to be within the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso may be unable to repair the damage caused by zzso zzso generated during the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso with this hypothesis, the zzso effects of zzso and zzso on the growth of this zzso zzso were zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso unable to zzso zzso zzso was markedly more sensitive to zzso and zzso than was the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This finding was in agreement with the recently proposed role of zzso as a mechanism for zzso zzso zzso generated during the zzso of these compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
