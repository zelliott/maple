zzso zzso is a bacterial member of the zzso family that functions in iron metabolism and protects against zzso zzso zzso differs from the zzso protein in that it is comprised of 24 identical zzso and is able to bind 12 zzso of zzso at sites located between adjacent pairs of zzso The mechanism by which iron enters the protein to form the zzso zzso zzso site present in every zzso and the zzso iron core housed within the zzso is not well zzso To address this issue, the properties of a zzso functional assembly zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso are characterized by a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three-dimensional structure of the protein zzso A zzso includes two zzso zzso molecules located on either side of the zzso iron zzso One of these zzso zzso molecules is integrated into the surface of the protein that would normally be exposed to zzso and the other is integrated into the surface of the protein that would normally face the iron core where it is surrounded by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We propose that the sites occupied by these zzso zzso molecules define regions where iron interacts with the zzso and, in keeping with this proposal, zzso activity decreases significantly when they are replaced with the corresponding zzso
