We cloned a gene zzso zzso DNA zzso II from zzso zzso nuclear DNA using zzso zzso corresponding to the consensus zzso acid sequences found in the gene in other zzso The gene zzso a predicted zzso of zzso zzso acids with zzso of about 146 zzso is a single copy that is expressed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shares similarity with those of other zzso with identity between 32 and zzso The protein is zzso zzso acids shorter in the zzso region and zzso longer in the zzso region than those of other zzso In zzso of zzso zzso the zzso region with stretches of charged and zzso zzso acids is predicted to fold into an zzso zzso which is characteristic of a zzso targeting signal zzso Four independent zzso zzso against zzso expressed zzso fusion proteins containing four portions of the zzso detected a single band on Western blots at about 135 zzso Western blots analysis of zzso zzso revealed that this protein is localized in zzso The protein and the zzso are present in growth phase and during development, although levels of both declined as development zzso
