zzso surface protein A zzso a zzso factor of zzso pneumoniae, is exceptionally diverse, being classified into two major families which are over 50% divergent by sequence zzso A family 1 zzso from strain zzso was previously shown to impede the clearance of zzso from mouse blood and to interfere with complement deposition on the bacterial zzso To determine whether a family 2 zzso can perform the same role as family 1 zzso the family 1 zzso (from strain zzso was replaced with a family 2 zzso (from strain zzso by molecular genetic methods to make an zzso pair of strains expressing different zzso zzso Surface binding of zzso and interference with zzso deposition by the two types of zzso proteins were determined by flow zzso and zzso was assessed in a mouse zzso zzso Although the family 2 zzso appeared to bind less human zzso than did the family 1 zzso both zzso proteins could interfere with complement deposition on the zzso surface and could provide full zzso in the mouse infection zzso A zzso form of the family 2 zzso with a deletion within the zzso region was also zzso zzso with this zzso zzso failed to bind human zzso even though the zzso was present on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso only partially zzso with complement deposition and moderately attenuated zzso These results suggest that family 1 and family 2 zzso proteins play similar roles in zzso and that surface accessibility of zzso is important for their zzso
