A rubber particle protein with apparent molecular mass of 43 zzso as determined by zzso was zzso A zzso zzso primer based on the zzso zzso acid sequence of this zzso protein was used to amplify a zzso zzso zzso by 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso contains five repeats in a zzso arrangement without intervening zzso each zzso a zzso unit of 76 zzso zzso The last zzso unit is followed by an zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso is consistent with the structure of other known zzso zzso Western zzso demonstrated that 43 zzso rubber particle protein might be a zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that there were multiple copies of gene zzso 43 zzso rubber particle protein in zzso zzso The results of Northern zzso analysis indicated that the gene was expressed in zzso young leaves and bark zzso
