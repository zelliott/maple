Four different DNA fragments each coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated in zzso plasmids from a zzso library of zzso zzso in zzso zzso All zzso strains zzso a highly active zzso zzso zzso and produced large translucent zzso on an opaque medium containing zzso zzso zzso One DNA region zzso was present in seven independently isolated zzso Three other cloned DNA fragments were different from zzso and from each other zzso In zzso an zzso frame of zzso zzso was identified from the zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G + zzso zzso of this region and zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso site was predicted from the deduced zzso acid sequence between zzso and zzso The calculated relative molecular masses of the precursor and the putative mature protein were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso contains a zzso consensus sequence zzso and an unusually high proportion of zzso zzso zzso of 36 zzso zzso near the zzso The zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso differed from that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A, B and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene product, zzso zzso zzso C, was partially zzso from zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso protein was specific for zzso zzso consisting of zzso of four or five carbon atoms and for zzso as zzso The zzso activity, but not the zzso zzso activity, was inhibited by complex media such as zzso medium and by soluble zzso coli zzso The zzso protein did not zzso with zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
