Typical zzso zzso coli zzso zzso : zzso is regarded as the closest relative of zzso zzso coli zzso zzso : zzso Both zzso usually express the zzso zzso zzso and trigger zzso zzso by the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso : zzso strains capable of triggering zzso zzso via the zzso zzso have recently been zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso differences and zzso relationships between typical and zzso zzso : zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso : zzso zzso which express the zzso zzso zzso and lack both zzso and zzso belong to an zzso coli lineage distinct from the typical zzso : zzso and from the zzso zzso : zzso which also uses the zzso zzso zzso zzso We conducted zzso comparisons of the zzso regions covering the zzso gene cluster and its zzso regions between the three zzso lineages by zzso analysis of zzso products and DNA sequencing analysis of about 65 zzso zzso zzso This unexpectedly revealed that horizontal transfer of large fragments zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene cluster and part of the zzso zzso acid gene cluster was involved in the emergence of the three zzso zzso coli zzso The data provide new insights into the mechanisms involved in the generation of a wide variety of zzso in zzso zzso
