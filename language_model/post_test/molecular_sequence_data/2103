A new zzso zzso zzso which contained a unique restriction site zzso at the 3' end of the zzso gene to produce a fused zzso and the zzso region to make the outer membrane zzso was constructed from zzso A zzso zzso zzso which contained a synthetic gene for human zzso with a zzso zzso zzso site at the junction site of the fused zzso was constructed and introduced into zzso zzso The hybrid protein produced in zzso coli carrying zzso was zzso into the culture zzso The zzso acid composition of this product was consistent with that deduced from the DNA zzso zzso zzso was obtained following zzso zzso zzso of the fused zzso
