zzso and zzso variation in the first internal transcribed zzso region zzso of zzso DNA zzso was examined in two species of zzso zzso zzso symbiotic algae and zzso with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso An approximately zzso region of the zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso from populations at zzso Loma, La Jolla, zzso Bay, and Santa Catalina Island and compared for each species and compared with the same region from the zzso coral zzso zzso There was a wide range of sequence variation in the zzso region between the species, and these differences readily distinguished the zzso zzso comparisons of zzso zzso individuals showed very little sequence variation zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso we found 14 variable zzso zzso in the zzso region for zzso zzso Although there were no zzso sites that zzso separated central and southern zzso these findings indicate that the zzso region is variable in zzso zzso and a promising source for nuclear molecular markers in zzso zzso
