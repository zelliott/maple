A protocol has been developed for the zzso of the zzso zzso f complex from the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is based on the use of the neutral zzso zzso zzso and comprises only three steps: selective zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex contains two b zzso zzso bands, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one zzso alpha zzso max zzso zzso zzso per zzso f zzso band, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is highly active in transferring electrons from zzso to oxidized zzso zzso number zzso zzso The zzso complex contains seven zzso whose identity has been established by zzso sequencing and/or zzso zzso namely four high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and three approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are consistent with every zzso being present as two copies per zzso f zzso
