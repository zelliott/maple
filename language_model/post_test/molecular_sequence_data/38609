The transfer of zzso from zzso to the core zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is a widespread feature of plant zzso which renders them zzso and zzso in zzso Here, we report the isolation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains two zzso and encodes a zzso zzso protein with a predicted type II zzso protein zzso typical for zzso zzso Upon expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell system, a zzso protein was produced that exhibited zzso activity in zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso displayed zzso activity in zzso in the insect cells, as judged by the acquired zzso of cellular zzso with zzso against the zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso are essential tools to study the role of zzso in the zzso and zzso of plant zzso at the molecular zzso
