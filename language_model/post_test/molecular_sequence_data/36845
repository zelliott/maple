zzso that break down zzso to zzso and zzso are zzso by low or no activity in zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso however, their activity increases zzso The structural and chemical basis for this phenomenon, referred to as zzso zzso has been revealed by the crystal structures of a zzso zzso and a human pancreatic zzso which evidently have a divergent evolutionary zzso These studies reveal that: zzso In both zzso the zzso zzso are zzso the same as occur in the zzso zzso The active atoms on this zzso zzso have essentially identical zzso in the zzso zzso and in these two zzso The zzso acids themselves, however, have quite different zzso and zzso zzso In both zzso the zzso groups are buried and zzso to the surrounding zzso Burial in these two zzso is brought about by a small stretch of zzso (the zzso which sits over the active zzso zzso In both zzso this zzso lid presents zzso zzso over the zzso group, and polar zzso to the zzso zzso Although the zzso are very similar in construction in the two zzso they belong to very different parts of the zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequences have no identity (except at the active zzso the two zzso show a similar architectural framework consisting of a central zzso parallel beta sheet zzso The zzso groups decorate this beta sheet structure in a zzso similar way though there are also some significant zzso The crystal structure of the complex between the zzso zzso and a zzso analogue demonstrates how the zzso lid is displaced to reveal the active zzso The movement of the lid also greatly zzso the zzso surface at the active surfaces and zzso previously exposed polar zzso The movement of the lid also helps to create the appropriate movement at the zzso zzso It is possible to define the zzso at the active site and to identify the positioning of the fatty acid and the zzso zzso
