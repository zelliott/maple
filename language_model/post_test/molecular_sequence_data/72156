Gene expression patterns in normal and zzso quail zzso zzso were compared by zzso differential zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso species by reverse zzso zzso of 73 differential zzso fragments and zzso by Northern analysis led to the isolation of a zzso termed zzso that zzso to an zzso species present only in the normal but not in the transformed zzso Further analyses revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was present in all normal quail and chicken zzso zzso tested, but that it was zzso in a variety of established quail cell lines transformed by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or by a chemical zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso newly transformed by zzso zzso carrying zzso or zzso zzso or by the avian zzso virus zzso In zzso transformed by a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was strongly induced at the zzso temperature and reduced at the zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of quail zzso zzso indicated that the corresponding gene encodes a zzso acid protein with 46 to zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the regulatory beta zzso zzso of the zzso human and canine high zzso zzso zzso zzso No sequence zzso to other zzso channel zzso or to any other proteins in the databases was zzso Like the zzso zzso the zzso protein contains two putative zzso zzso Based on the relationship to zzso zzso both in primary structure and domain zzso the zzso protein may represent the regulatory zzso of a yet unidentified avian zzso zzso channel or a related membrane protein possibly involved in the regulation of cell zzso
