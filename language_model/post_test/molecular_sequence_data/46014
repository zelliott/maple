The tissue zzso of zzso zzso are zzso as important regulators of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most recently characterized member of the zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the expression and zzso of the zzso transcript and protein in zzso and zzso of zzso monkey zzso zzso on days 12, 18 and 26 of pregnancy using zzso in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso gene from zzso monkey zzso samples shared zzso identity with the corresponding region of human zzso On day 12 of pregnancy, zzso zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso On days 18 and 26 of pregnancy, the expression of zzso zzso tended to decline in zzso zzso and there were strong zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was very faint or zzso in the zzso cells, zzso cells of zzso and zzso at any stages of zzso The results of zzso analysis were similar to that of its zzso These findings indicate that zzso might play an important role in zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso and invasion of the zzso cells by regulating zzso in a localized manner in the zzso of zzso monkey during early zzso
