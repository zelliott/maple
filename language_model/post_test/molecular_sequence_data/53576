The surface zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to the family of zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso system prepared from zzso zzso we have described the structure and zzso zzso for zzso zzso The core zzso of the polar zzso are modified by a zzso zzso side zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso side chain is added onto the core zzso in two zzso The first step involves the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso core zzso via an zzso zzso prior to the addition of the zzso linked to the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso is the donor of all zzso zzso including the zzso linked to zzso Furthermore, we were able to identify in zzso a zzso intermediate containing an additional zzso linked to the zzso zzso side zzso The addition of this zzso zzso zzso intermediate into the zzso system leads to a loss of the zzso zzso and its conversion to the penultimate intermediate having only zzso zzso as a side zzso Together the data indicate that the zzso intermediate is a transitional zzso We suggest that the zzso intermediate is essential for zzso and maturation of zzso zzso It is hypothesized that this zzso processing in the course of zzso zzso is required for the zzso of zzso from the zzso side of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
