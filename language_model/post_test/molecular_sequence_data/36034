The successful establishment of a zzso zzso T zzso transformed zzso cell line, zzso which retains tight junctions and zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells shows a defined pattern of zzso zzso and a characteristic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating the presence of zzso zzso The presence of both tight junctions and zzso has been confirmed by electron zzso Cell zzso have good zzso resistance measured in zzso zzso zzso increase zzso zzso transport in response to addition of agents that raise either zzso zzso or zzso measured either by zzso zzso or zzso patch zzso An increase in zzso zzso in response to these agents, can be measured in zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso zzso channel has been demonstrated in single cell detached membrane zzso In addition, the cells have been found to express zzso zzso These cells therefore demonstrate that it is possible to select transformed cell clones with particular zzso zzso zzso the presence of tight junctions and cell zzso which also retain useful zzso zzso functions, including zzso zzso zzso They also provide a major resource for the study of the structure and function of human zzso
