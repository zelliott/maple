zzso immune system plays a significant role in all zzso zzso The key feature of the system is its ability to recognize and respond to invading zzso zzso including zzso fish have evolved an array of pathogen recognition receptors zzso for detecting and responding to various zzso molecular patterns zzso including zzso receptors zzso zzso domain, zzso repeat containing receptors zzso and the zzso acid zzso gene I zzso like receptors zzso In this study, we identified 22 zzso including six members of the zzso zzso zzso two members of the zzso zzso 11 members of the zzso zzso and three genes that do not belong to any of these three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all identified in zzso In addition, an additional truncated zzso gene was also identified in zzso While the identities of zzso A zzso could be established, the identities of the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso at zzso zzso of representative zzso genes was analyzed using zzso and zzso In healthy zzso zzso all the tested zzso genes were found to be zzso expressed in all 11 tested zzso zzso Analysis of expression of these representative zzso genes after bacterial infection with zzso zzso revealed a significant zzso of all tested genes in the zzso and liver, but a significant zzso in the zzso and head zzso suggesting their involvement in the immune responses of zzso against the zzso bacterial pathogen in a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the tested genes exhibited an amazing similarity of expression profiles after infection, suggesting the zzso of these zzso
