The interaction of zzso zzso zzso with synthetic zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso promoter was zzso The zzso effectively zzso with either coding or zzso zzso when zzso at 365 zzso but not with zzso The extent of the zzso reaction, which was complete within 16 zzso zzso reached its maximum at an zzso concentration of 3 zzso zzso remained constant below the zzso of the duplex and then rapidly zzso and zzso appeared to depend upon the sequence surrounding the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso to the template strand inhibited zzso by zzso zzso zzso whereas an zzso zzso to the zzso strand had only a small zzso zzso zzso did not zzso to zzso undergoing zzso nor did they inhibit the zzso zzso
