zzso fragments of human DNA ranging in size from 50 to 250 zzso were cloned into zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Six zzso zzso zzso strains were selected by virtue of the specific zzso of their DNA with the human zzso zzso sequence zzso and the zzso zzso of this sequence within each zzso was demonstrated by its sensitivity to zzso zzso In zzso zzso of DNA from three of these zzso strains with human zzso zzso yielded discrete patterns of zzso signals at the zzso of a limited number of human zzso different for each zzso DNA from selected zzso zzso of one of the zzso strains was used to zzso the origin of the cloned zzso DNA by in zzso zzso to the tip of the long arm of zzso zzso
