The human zzso zzso zzso gene is a candidate for involvement in the zzso of affective zzso In humans, multiple transcripts of the gene have been detected by northern zzso analysis of brain and other zzso We performed 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends to identify the common sites of zzso in zzso zzso from human zzso cells and whole zzso Two major zzso sites were zzso one zzso zzso downstream of the stop zzso consistent with the usage of the zzso signal zzso and a second site zzso zzso downstream of the stop zzso The putative zzso signal upstream of this site contained a single zzso zzso zzso However, zzso variation at this site did not influence zzso site zzso and there were no significant differences in the abundance of the two zzso of this zzso between zzso control subjects, 158 individuals with major depression, and 130 individuals with bipolar affective zzso This single zzso zzso in the 3' untranslated region of the zzso gene should provide a useful genetic marker in the evaluation of zzso as a candidate gene influencing zzso to mood zzso
