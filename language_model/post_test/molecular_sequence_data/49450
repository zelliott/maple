zzso zzso family members are zzso factors crucial for the expression of various zzso genes and other zzso zzso zzso of mice defective in one or two zzso family members have revealed functions specific to each zzso zzso However, the redundant functions of several family members limit the usefulness of gene disruption zzso For example, zzso T cells isolated from zzso mice do not show any zzso in zzso gene zzso perhaps because other family members compensate for its zzso To analyze the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso genes in T cells, we made a zzso zzso by creating transgenic mice expressing a zzso nuclear form of zzso in T cell zzso In zzso zzso T cells, zzso zzso the expression of several zzso genes and zzso markers and suppressed the expression of zzso In zzso cells, zzso enhanced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso suppressed zzso zzso genes such as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso It has been reported that both zzso and zzso are required to maintain the zzso of the immune zzso Our results suggest that zzso exerts this function by zzso the expression of some critical zzso zzso
