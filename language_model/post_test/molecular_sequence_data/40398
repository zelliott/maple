A zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the zzso soil of traditionally zzso zzso zzso zzso were strictly zzso zzso zzso and formed zzso The best growth was achieved at zzso and pH zzso in ammonium mineral zzso zzso medium containing 600 zzso zzso A comparative zzso zzso gene zzso zzso analysis placed strain zzso in a zzso with the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and revealed zzso similarities ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed a low level zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso and its closest zzso The major components of the fatty acid profile were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso iso and zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso acid of the cell wall was zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The lipids present in strain zzso were zzso zzso a minor amount of zzso and two unknown zzso The zzso respiratory zzso was zzso Studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses and zzso data based on zzso zzso gene sequencing enabled strain zzso to be described as representing a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
