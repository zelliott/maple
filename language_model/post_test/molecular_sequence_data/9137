Here, we present the first complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and compared it with that of zzso a broad zzso zzso recently isolated in zzso The zzso consist of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso they differ mainly in the region zzso structural zzso in which the zzso of zzso shows two major zzso Both zzso share zzso zzso identity, a high percentage of identity among zzso isolated at so globally distant locations and temporally different zzso zzso analysis revealed 57 zzso zzso three zzso zzso and four putative zzso zzso The zzso of an zzso zzso a putative zzso protein and a putative zzso origin of replication was found in both zzso zzso a feature not described in any other zzso zzso These elements suggest that DNA replication in zzso differs from other zzso and might resemble that of bacterial zzso
