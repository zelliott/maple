We have developed a zzso zzso zzso chain zzso method, performed on single cells, for the analysis of the most common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As a quality control, the zzso zzso 2 of the zzso zzso locus was zzso from the same zzso With a zzso reverse zzso zzso the zzso of these two zzso could be zzso zzso on 98 single zzso zzso for the zzso and the zzso zzso showed that amplification of either locus could be obtained in 97 per cent of the cases, but only 90 per cent showed zzso for zzso 75 per cent showed zzso for zzso and 74 per cent showed zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso detected only after zzso typing occurred in 3 per cent of our zzso zzso rate calculations based on our experimental zzso data indicate that single zzso diagnosis would lead to unacceptable zzso zzso an affected zzso in less than 1 per cent of the zzso The risk of zzso zzso or the dubious results that zzso could zzso would make isolated polar body diagnosis at the present time very zzso The combined approach of zzso on polar bodies followed by confirmation of the diagnosis on zzso however, should give a solid base for zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso
