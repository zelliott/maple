zzso zzso zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso is a potential drug target for zzso zzso zzso zzso is much less soluble and is produced in lower yields than the closely related zzso from zzso zzso zzso In order to explore zzso as a model for zzso in drug discovery, we compare the two zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso have been prepared and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Met zzso zzso in which zzso within 6 A of the zzso zzso have been replaced with the corresponding zzso from zzso Two zzso proteins have also been produced in which the third domain of zzso has been replaced by the third domain of zzso and vice zzso The activity profile of the zzso proteins suggests a role for the third domain in the evolutionary divergence of zzso between these closely related zzso zzso
