zzso induced models of breast zzso in the rat are widely used for studying the biology of breast cancer and for developing and evaluating cancer prevention and control zzso However, very little is known about gene expression changes that are associated with zzso induced zzso zzso This paper reports the zzso by differential display of zzso and molecular zzso of seven zzso fragments of gene transcripts zzso in zzso zzso induced by zzso These genes included the rat zzso of human zzso zzso the zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sensitive protein zzso the mouse zzso zzso zzso and the mouse zzso B zzso zzso zzso Although each of these genes has been implicated in some aspect of zzso in other zzso this paper is the first report of their zzso in chemically induced zzso zzso Two previously zzso gene transcripts were also zzso A comparison of the expression levels of several genes in zzso zzso with those in the normal zzso zzso tissue of virgin rats, zzso pregnant rats, and of day 1 zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso of several genes observed in zzso zzso could not be accounted for by either a difference in the zzso zzso content between zzso zzso and normal zzso tissue or by zzso zzso proliferation associated with zzso Several genes were also zzso in rat zzso zzso induced by zzso but not in zzso rat colon zzso The genes identified in this study may therefore represent zzso zzso molecular markers that may be helpful in investigations of zzso zzso and its zzso
