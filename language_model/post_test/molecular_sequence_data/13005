The zzso zzso which encodes zzso from zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was modified to remove the putative zzso zzso region, cloned into the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso and used to transform zzso coli strain zzso The majority of zzso was expressed in the form of inclusion bodies, which were zzso zzso and zzso The protein was then zzso by zzso and zzso zzso A 6-liter culture of induced zzso coli provided 37 zzso of zzso zzso which was greater than zzso zzso zzso affinities for zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso with high affinity for zzso were shown to be comparable to zzso found in membrane preparations of zzso zzso strain zzso A direct binding zzso using zzso zzso was developed and used to show zzso binding to the zzso soluble zzso In addition, zzso mass zzso showed that zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso bound to the zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, two zzso of the putative zzso zzso showed the predicted loss of zzso binding of the zzso to the zzso demonstrating the high specificity of the soluble binding zzso
