zzso B zzso a zzso zzso zzso antibiotic, despite its severe side effects continues to occupy a premiere position for treating zzso Its mode of zzso of zzso has remained elusive for the last three zzso Several synthetic zzso mimics of zzso capable of binding zzso have been zzso However, the binding ability alone appears to be a deceptive indicator of zzso zzso activity as molecules with similar binding zzso could either zzso or zzso the zzso Hence identification of additional physical parameters which describe adequately the outcome of zzso interaction become zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso studies reported here show that several mimics of zzso despite exhibiting zzso binding affinities comparable with it but, unlike it, do not zzso the zzso These studies thus provide a striking illustration of the difference in the behavior of zzso zzso a zzso its mimics toward the zzso zzso and define further, in chemical terms, mechanism of the action of zzso and allow us to zzso that the design of molecules as effective antidotes for zzso should incorporate the ability to zzso zzso zzso
