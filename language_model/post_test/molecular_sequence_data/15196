CBS zzso are small protein zzso usually associated in zzso that are involved in binding to zzso zzso In humans, several genetic diseases have been associated with zzso in CBS zzso and then, they can be considered as promising targets for the rational design of new zzso However, there are no structural studies describing their zzso states, zzso preferences, and zzso In this work, the zzso state, the stability, and zzso properties of the CBS domain protein zzso from zzso zzso were explored by using a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso and zzso techniques zzso circular zzso zzso and zzso The results indicate that the protein had a zzso zzso zzso at pH 7, the dominant species is a zzso where each zzso is a zzso domain zzso and at pH zzso the dominant species is a zzso with an oblong shape, as shown by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso indicates that the zzso at zzso pH has zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso with most of the structure zzso These results are similar to the percentages of secondary structure of the zzso in the resolved zzso X-ray structure zzso of zzso structure and zzso of zzso At pH zzso there was a decrease in the level of secondary structure of the zzso and formation of zzso hydrogen bonds, as shown by zzso suggesting the presence of zzso weight zzso The zzso zzso species is zzso and chemically very stable with a zzso zzso of approximately 99 degrees C, as shown by both zzso and zzso the zzso chemical zzso of the zzso species occurs in a single step and was greater than 4 zzso
