zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso filter cleaning zzso waste zzso The strain is able to grow on zzso and zzso The genes for degradation of short chain zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso using a newly designed zzso zzso and cloned in zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso revealed three genes involved in zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the first zzso zzso had high similarity to zzso zzso the protein of the second zzso zzso had similarity to zzso zzso the third zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The three genes were located between two gene groups: one zzso a putative zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the other eight genes for the zzso of an zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso of the zzso abolished growth of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso zzso degradation was observed by zzso expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A zzso containing zzso and zzso on a zzso was not sufficient to allow zzso zzso zzso to grow on zzso Not until all three genes were assembled in the zzso zzso zzso was it able to use zzso as carbon zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso was clearly demonstrated by zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that zzso zzso by gas zzso analysis has been definitely demonstrated to be an intermediate of zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso expressed in zzso coli and zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso The protein exhibited high zzso activity towards short chain zzso like zzso zzso and zzso zzso
