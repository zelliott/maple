zzso of the zzso network is an important adaptation of zzso bacteria to zzso and evade a host immune zzso Here we describe that zzso is rapidly and efficiently zzso and zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso and zzso One of the primary zzso sites for zzso has been mapped between zzso and zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso however, both zzso and zzso cleave zzso within the zzso region of the zzso zzso After these initial zzso zzso zzso is further zzso by each of the zzso zzso Although zzso is the most potent zzso zzso the initial zzso zzso of zzso zzso by all zzso is already sufficient to zzso this zzso Our data are consistent with the observation that in zzso the zzso concentration is lowest in the zzso tissue adjacent to bacterial zzso whereas significantly elevated zzso of this zzso are detected around the infected zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may, therefore, represent an additional mechanism which influences the balance between zzso and zzso reactions at zzso versus zzso sites from the zzso zzso
