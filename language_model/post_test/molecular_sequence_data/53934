Members of the zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso gene family convert zzso zzso into zzso in zzso and are involved in zzso zzso editing of transcripts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso the third member of this class of human zzso and investigated its editing site selectivity using in zzso zzso editing zzso zzso As originally reported for rat zzso or zzso zzso zzso proteins could not edit zzso zzso at the zzso site, the zzso site, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso did not edit any of five sites discovered recently within the zzso loop II region of zzso zzso confirming its total lack of editing activity for currently known zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is capable of binding not only to zzso but also to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a region rich in zzso zzso located in the zzso that is responsible for binding of zzso to zzso The presence of this zzso domain as well as its expression in restricted brain regions and zzso zzso make zzso distinct from the other two zzso gene family members, editing competent zzso and zzso zzso inhibited in zzso the activities of zzso editing zzso of the zzso gene family, raising the possibility of a regulatory role in zzso zzso
