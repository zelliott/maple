The development of the zzso nerve zzso and muscle zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was assessed using differential interference contrast and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and in zzso zzso for the zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso nerve zzso first appears as a stream of zzso zzso zzso that extends into the tail from the zzso zzso By this stage a few zzso nerve fibers course zzso along the zzso As the tail zzso the zzso nerve zzso extends and becomes more zzso and the zzso cluster at stereotyped zzso zzso The number of zzso in the nerve zzso reaches a relatively stable maximum of about zzso A subset of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso nerve zzso expresses zzso zzso These putative zzso are distributed along nearly the full extent of the tail in numbers consistent with an independent zzso of each tail muscle zzso The zzso series of putative zzso is not aligned with the muscle cells, but peripheral nerve fibers extending to the muscle cells are, indicating that motor zzso grow along the zzso before zzso adjacent to their peripheral zzso Muscle zzso occurs roughly zzso with the onset of zzso zzso zzso Our results provide the first molecular identification of zzso and the first zzso characterization of the motor system in an zzso and help set the stage for gene expression studies aimed at understanding the evolution of zzso patterning in this part of the zzso central nervous zzso
