zzso can form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we study the role of zzso zzso in the interaction of these forms of zzso with the killer cell zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso and with zzso transcripts zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with three of five different naturally processed self peptides and three of seven zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes containing peptides with charged zzso acids at position 8 did not bind to zzso however, studies with analogue peptides demonstrated that these are not the only zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso by zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso production in a zzso zzso zzso but not zzso B7 or zzso heavy chains formed zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso by zzso inhibited zzso and T cell zzso zzso By contrast with zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso did not depend on the sequence of the bound zzso zzso in zzso binding to classical zzso and zzso could be involved in the zzso of zzso
