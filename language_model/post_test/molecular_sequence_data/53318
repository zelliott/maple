A zzso surface loop zzso acids zzso is zzso to be an important zzso binding zzso In human zzso myosin, zzso of zzso to a zzso or a zzso causes zzso zzso There is a zzso zzso or zzso zzso present on this loop in some lower zzso zzso class I and zzso class VI zzso zzso of the zzso I molecules at this site regulates their zzso zzso In almost all other zzso the zzso zzso is either a zzso or an zzso suggesting that a negative charge at this location is important for zzso To study the function of this loop, we have used zzso zzso and zzso expression of a heavy zzso zzso like zzso of human zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in human zzso muscle zzso has essentially no effect on the zzso zzso or in zzso zzso of the expressed zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and a deletion zzso that removes zzso zzso all decrease both the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso and the rate of in zzso zzso by a factor of zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso activity and the affinity constant for binding of zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso are affected by less than a factor of zzso These data support an important role for the negative charge at this location but show that it is not critical to zzso zzso
