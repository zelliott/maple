An abundant zzso protein belonging to the low density zzso zzso zzso family is essential for chicken zzso growth by zzso the zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso This zzso harbors at the zzso zzso a cluster of eight zzso arranged repeats typical of the zzso binding zzso of members of this family and is designated low density zzso zzso relative with 8 repeats zzso Here, we demonstrate by reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso and Western zzso analyses that the chicken expresses two forms of zzso which are generated by differential zzso of an zzso zzso a zzso and zzso region characteristic of zzso termed zzso sugar zzso The female germ cell of the chicken expresses extremely high levels of the short form of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in contrast, zzso cells express lower but zzso levels of the form containing the zzso sugar domain zzso The main sites of zzso expression in the chicken are the heart and skeletal muscle, zzso the same zzso were zzso zzso predominate in zzso in addition, in zzso zzso demonstrates that a significant amount of zzso is produced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found no apparent functional difference between the two zzso zzso however, cell zzso targeting of the multiple zzso of these receptors possibly relates to their respective expression on the cell zzso
