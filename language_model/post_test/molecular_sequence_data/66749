zzso genes zzso zzso termed zzso that are required for the zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso We have screened the available protein and DNA databases to identify putative zzso zzso in 17 zzso species zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso This analysis demonstrated that most zzso are present in all zzso under zzso Only zzso is absent in most zzso species, with the exception of zzso zzso but this zzso is present in all zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative orphan zzso might zzso a zzso zzso In addition, in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso several zzso genes appear to have been zzso exemplified by the presence of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso which were absent in other zzso In all organisms, we observed multiple zzso of the zzso involved in zzso zzso These proteins belong to two groups of zzso that we propose to designate the zzso and zzso zzso This zzso may complicate future studies on zzso zzso and proliferation in zzso zzso
