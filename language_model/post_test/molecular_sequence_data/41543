zzso the architecture of zzso networks is increasingly used as a framework to study zzso interactions within their ecological context and to assess the extent to which evolutionary constraint shape zzso Orchid zzso zzso are particularly interesting as they are viewed as more beneficial for plants than for zzso a situation expected to result in an asymmetry of biological zzso This study addressed the architecture and zzso constraint in these associations in tropical zzso We identified a zzso network including 73 zzso species and 95 zzso units of zzso zzso across the natural zzso of Reunion zzso Unlike some recent evidence for zzso in zzso zzso we found a highly modular architecture that largely reflected an ecological barrier between zzso and zzso zzso By testing for zzso zzso the overall signal was stronger for both partners in the zzso zzso Moreover, in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the signal in zzso zzso was stronger than the signal in zzso zzso zzso associations are therefore more conservative and may zzso more than zzso zzso We suggest that such tighter zzso specialization may have been driven by stressful life conditions in the zzso zzso In addition to zzso recent insights into zzso networks, this study zzso provides support for zzso as a major factor affecting ecological zzso and evolutionary constraint in tropical zzso zzso
