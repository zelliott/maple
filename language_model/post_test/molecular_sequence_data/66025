In 2001, zzso zzso was described as a new zzso zzso zzso species related to zzso zzso based on data from three zzso During a review of our extensive culture collection we encountered 18 additional zzso zzso strains and further characterized them in zzso Thirteen of the 18 strains were isolated from female zzso tract specimens without any obvious disease zzso zzso zzso zzso can be easily differentiated from zzso zzso by its distinct zzso colonies whereas nearly all other routinely applied zzso tests do not allow a unanimous separation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis using zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso definitively allows differentiation between the two zzso Surprisingly, comparative zzso zzso gene analysis does not discriminate between zzso zzso and zzso zzso because the designated type strain of zzso zzso is not the most representative strain for this zzso The present report also includes detailed data on the zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso presented here for the first zzso Based on the large number of additional zzso zzso strains from our culture collection, we provide an extended and zzso species description of zzso zzso
