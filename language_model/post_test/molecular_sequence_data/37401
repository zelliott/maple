The zzso processing of and zzso presentation by zzso class II molecules were examined in B cell lines derived from pairs of identical twins zzso for type 1 zzso zzso class II defects detected exclusively in cells derived from the twins with zzso included increased rates of transport to and subsequent turnover at the cell surface, inadequate zzso and a reduced display at the cell surface of zzso zzso These defects appeared to be secondary to a decreased abundance of the zzso zzso of the zzso chain zzso a zzso zzso protein for zzso class II normally generated by use of an alternative translation start zzso zzso zzso of diabetic B cell lines with an zzso zzso expression zzso corrected the defects in zzso class II processing and zzso zzso A zzso in the expression of zzso zzso may thus result in impairment of zzso presentation by zzso class II molecules and thereby contribute to the development of type 1 diabetes in zzso zzso
