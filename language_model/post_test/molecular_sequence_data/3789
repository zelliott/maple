The zzso 43 surface protein of zzso coli is expressed in a zzso manner by a mechanism involving alternative zzso and repression of zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is the zzso zzso zzso and its binding site was found to be located downstream of the zzso zzso start site in a region of DNA that encompasses three zzso sequences that are subject to zzso DNA zzso It has been suggested previously that the zzso expression of zzso 43 results from a competition between Dam zzso and the zzso zzso for these zzso The zzso sequences were zzso for zzso by zzso zzso and all possible combinations of inactive and active sites were assessed for effects on zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso of any zzso site individually had no zzso at least two sites had to be zzso to disrupt the normal pattern of zzso Studies of zzso interaction with zzso DNA showed that zzso of any two zzso sites was necessary and sufficient to block binding of the zzso It was also found that the zzso of the second and third zzso sites are required for zzso zzso demonstrating that the sites for Dam zzso and for zzso binding are intimately zzso This is consistent with a competition model in which Dam and zzso share a preference for specific DNA sequences in the regulatory region of the zzso zzso
