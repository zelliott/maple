A zzso termed the zzso hairpin is one of the most highly zzso structures within the leader of human zzso virus type 1 zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso Because it plays a key role in the in zzso zzso of short zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1996, and references zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1996, and references zzso and because zzso zzso may be preferably zzso into the zzso virus, zzso of the zzso hairpin might affect the in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso substitution and deletion zzso were introduced into the zzso hairpin of an infectious zzso molecular clone in order to produce viruses by zzso zzso The zzso of the resulting viruses was decreased by at least zzso the amount of zzso zzso packaged per virus was decreased by 50 to zzso and the proportion of zzso zzso zzso was reduced from zzso to 40 to zzso but the zzso temperature of the zzso zzso was zzso There is evidence suggesting that the deletion zzso moderately inhibited zzso production but had no significant effect on zzso zzso These results are consistent with the zzso model of zzso zzso zzso In fact, because zzso viral zzso are probably more concentrated in zzso cells than in cells infected by one virus and because the zzso and zzso processes are concentration dependent, it is likely that much larger zzso and zzso defects would have been zzso within cells infected by no more than one zzso
