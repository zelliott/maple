Perhaps the simplest of biological timing systems, zzso zzso accumulate during the zzso zzso period and then trigger to zzso the zzso membrane with lethal zzso thus, terminating the infection zzso zzso zzso form very large holes that allow zzso release of zzso zzso but a recently discovered class of zzso the zzso make much smaller zzso or zzso that serve only to zzso the zzso Here, we interrogate the structure of the zzso zzso by zzso transmission zzso zzso and chemical zzso as well as by zzso zzso Together, the results suggest that the zzso forms zzso zzso structures with the zzso surface of one zzso domain lining the surface of a central channel approximately 15 A in zzso The structural model also suggests a rationale for the zzso state of the zzso the persistence of which defines the duration of the viral zzso period, and for the sensitivity of the zzso timing system to the energized state of the zzso
