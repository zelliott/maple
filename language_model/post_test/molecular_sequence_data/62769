zzso an zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Previous studies report that zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso severing by zzso presumably by interaction with zzso However, direct association of zzso with zzso has never been zzso In this report, we presented zzso analysis to identify the zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso binds zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso and a Hill zzso of zzso We generated deletion zzso of zzso lacking putative zzso sites and examined the impact of these zzso on zzso binding and zzso zzso Our analysis revealed the presence of three zzso sites, two in the zzso core and one in the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso peptides analogous with these sites confirmed the binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso of intrinsic zzso zzso revealed a significant zzso change in these peptides ensuing in their association with zzso By using zzso zzso zzso 138 to zzso we demonstrated the presence of an identical zzso and zzso site in the capping and severing domain of zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso demonstrated the presence of an overlapping zzso and zzso site in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso with this zzso association of zzso with zzso inhibited the zzso capping and severing functions of zzso and enhanced the zzso bundling function of zzso Our studies revealed that structural changes induced by association with zzso could regulate the zzso functions of zzso This study provided zzso proof of the functional significance of zzso association with zzso and identified the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso dynamics by zzso and zzso
