The zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso which associates with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and exhibits protein zzso activity depending on DNA zzso zzso The gene is also responsible for the aberration in severe combined immune zzso zzso mice, which exhibit a high sensitivity to zzso radiation and abnormal DNA zzso of zzso and T cell zzso zzso There is further evidence that zzso zzso various proteins involved in DNA zzso transcription, repair, and zzso zzso the zzso relationship in this huge zzso is virtually zzso We determined the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso gene by the long-distance zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso gene consists of 86 zzso distributed in a region of more than 250 zzso The average size of the zzso is 140 zzso All the zzso sites conform to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso site zzso has been identified in zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene provides clues for the study of various functional zzso in this zzso
