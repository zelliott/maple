zzso are involved in a wide range of biological zzso These structurally diverse compounds are more complex than other biological zzso and are often present as zzso zzso in zzso The chemical synthesis of carbohydrates is one way to obtain pure zzso but it is hampered by difficulties associated with the zzso protection of zzso and challenges related to the zzso assembly of zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso and zzso method that can be used to protect individual zzso groups of a zzso This approach can be used to install an zzso protecting group pattern in a single reaction vessel (a zzso zzso which removes the need to carry out the time-consuming isolation and zzso of zzso Hundreds of building blocks have been efficiently prepared starting from zzso and the zzso zzso of these building blocks enabled us to assemble zzso and a library of zzso based on the zzso zzso
