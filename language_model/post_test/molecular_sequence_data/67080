The zzso measures play a fundamental role in library searching, virtual zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso relationship modeling as well as in zzso and zzso In this paper, a new zzso measure is proposed as a new approach for the analysis of sequential data, where useful information can be also obtained by the ordering relationships between the sequence zzso This methodology can be applied for evaluating molecular zzso using sets of sequential zzso and for evaluating the similarity between zzso sensor zzso and other sequential data such as DNA and protein zzso The new proposed distance (weighted standardized zzso distance) is evaluated between pairs of zzso zzso derived from the classical zzso zzso It can be naturally zzso thus allowing the interpretation of these distances as absolute values zzso zzso and zzso simple similarity and correlation zzso A simple example is taken to highlight the behavior of the new zzso measure on DNA sequences taken from the first zzso of the zzso for eight different zzso zzso analysis has been also performed, showing the high capability of this measure to take into account small modifications of the DNA zzso Finally, a comparison with results obtained from the literature is given, together with a comparison with zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso
