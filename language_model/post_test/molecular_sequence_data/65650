We examined in zzso abundance and activities of the major bacterial groups in the two most distinct compartments of zzso divided Lake Grosse zzso zzso The selected zzso zzso and zzso basin zzso differ substantially in their major chemical and biological parameters that potentially influence the dynamics and composition of microbial zzso Water from the zzso were incubated in dialysis bags, which allowed for a relatively free exchange of zzso limiting zzso and low molecular organic matter but fully prevented exchange of zzso To investigate the effect of zzso and bottom-up zzso three size zzso of water samples were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso pore size zzso to remove large zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso through zzso zzso filters to remove all potential zzso One set of dialysis bags was either incubated in zzso SW zzso in zzso zzso or in almost neutral zzso basin whereas a second set was transferred from the SW to the zzso basin and vice zzso Our study revealed pronounced differences in growth rates among the major bacterial groups in relation to the zzso Members of the zzso in particular of the zzso targeted by the zzso probe, were highly abundant in both zzso and most of them belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Their specific growth rates surprisingly increased in all treatments when being transplanted into the zzso SW zzso indicating that pH and zzso substances greatly affected growth of this particular group in the zzso In contrast, members of the zzso group of the zzso (both zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso were less abundant, especially in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, because of their extremely low initial numbers, grazing of zzso zzso mostly controlled only a small part of the bacterial production zzso or zzso zzso
