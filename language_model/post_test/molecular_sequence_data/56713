To identify the sites in the zzso tumor zzso gene most susceptible to zzso zzso by sunlight, the entire coding region of 27 zzso cell zzso zzso of the skin was zzso zzso percent of tumors contained zzso and these were zzso primarily zzso or zzso changes at zzso zzso Such zzso can alter more than half of the zzso zzso acids in zzso but two-thirds occurred at nine sites at which zzso were seen more than once in zzso or in 27 previously studied zzso cell zzso of the zzso Seven of these zzso hotspots were specific to skin zzso zzso hotspots not located at zzso sites were not zzso in skin zzso moreover, zzso zzso were absent at these zzso The existence of hotspots altered the process of zzso zzso in zzso compared to other zzso zzso loss was rare, but zzso of the point zzso were accompanied by a second point zzso on the other zzso At least one of each pair was located at a zzso Sunlight, acting at zzso zzso appears to cause zzso so frequently that it is often responsible for two genetic events in zzso zzso
