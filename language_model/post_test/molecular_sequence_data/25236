zzso factor I zzso is a zzso factor which binds to the zzso zzso virus long terminal repeat zzso and promoter at two zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that two forms of zzso DNA binding activity exist in nuclear extracts of avian zzso One form requires two zzso components zzso for high zzso specific DNA binding activity, whereas a second form is not dependent on zzso for binding and may be composed solely of zzso perhaps as a zzso Both forms give rise to the same mobility shift in gel zzso zzso but the two forms can be separated zzso under buffer conditions which stabilize the two DNA binding zzso A zzso for zzso has been isolated from a rat liver zzso expression zzso The zzso pair zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein which is nearly identical to two previously described human DNA binding zzso These are zzso a DNA binding protein of unknown specificity which binds to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso gene promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) Gene zzso 73, zzso and zzso a protein which recognizes the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso alpha chain gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Schwartz, zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 85, zzso zzso share a highly zzso region of 100 zzso acids with zzso another protein identified by Sakura et zzso (1988) which binds to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso gene promoter, and with two zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso This highly zzso domain among all six proteins is presumed to represent or contain a DNA binding domain for the zzso zzso In addition, we note that the zzso zzso contains a novel arrangement of alternating clusters of positively and zzso charged zzso acids not yet reported for any zzso zzso The functional significance of this novel structural zzso which is also zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso will be zzso
