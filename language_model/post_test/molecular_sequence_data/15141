zzso is a family of outer membrane zzso from zzso zzso which elicits zzso zzso and are currently undergoing human clinical trials in a zzso zzso where each zzso represents one of the two known zzso zzso Here we report the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a representative of the zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals a novel fold composed of two zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso connected by a zzso The structure in zzso solution is consistent with a model of zzso anchored to the outer membrane zzso through its zzso N zzso A long flexible chain connects the folded part of the protein to the zzso anchor and acts as zzso making both zzso accessible to the host immune zzso zzso broadly zzso against members from both zzso have been mapped to the N zzso A surface of zzso zzso was identified on one face of the zzso offering an explanation for the induction of zzso zzso zzso
