The presentation of zzso peptides by major zzso complex zzso class II molecules to zzso T cells is critical to the function of the immune zzso In this study, we have zzso the sorting signal of the zzso membrane protein zzso to target a model zzso human zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sorting signal zzso the zzso into the zzso class II processing pathway, resulting in enhanced presentation to zzso cells in zzso In zzso zzso experiments in mice demonstrated that zzso containing the zzso zzso gene generated greater zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities than zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that specific targeting of an zzso to the zzso and zzso compartments enhances zzso class II presentation and vaccine zzso
