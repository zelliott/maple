We describe a new approach to identify proteins involved in disease zzso The technology, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the specificity of patients' immune responses to zzso targets and requires no prior knowledge about the zzso zzso links zzso zzso of unknown zzso isolated from patient zzso to their zzso zzso in the protein zzso The zzso process first involves reconstruction of a predicted zzso using a zzso zzso zzso We then search the protein database for closely matching zzso acid zzso Previously published attempts to identify unknown zzso targets in this manner have largely been unsuccessful for two reasons: 1) short predicted zzso yield too many irrelevant matches from a database search and 2) the zzso may not accurately represent the native zzso with sufficient zzso Using an in zzso model, we demonstrate the critical threshold requirements for zzso length and zzso zzso We find that zzso generally need to have at least seven zzso zzso with an overall accuracy of zzso to the native zzso in order to correctly identify the protein in a zzso protein database zzso We then confirmed these findings zzso using the predicted zzso for four zzso zzso Since many predicted zzso often fail to achieve the seven zzso acid zzso we demonstrate the efficacy of paired zzso zzso This is the first systematic analysis of the zzso framework to make this approach viable, coupled with experimental zzso
