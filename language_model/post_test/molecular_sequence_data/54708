zzso diversity in zzso viruses is shaped by a variety of evolutionary zzso including the bottlenecks that may occur at zzso zzso However, how these processes structure genetic variation at the scale of individual hosts is only partly zzso We obtained zzso sequence data for the coat protein zzso gene of zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso from two zzso transmitted populations - one via zzso the other without - and with multiple samples from individual zzso We show that although zzso are generated relatively frequently within infected plants, attaining similar levels of genetic diversity to that seen in some animal zzso viruses zzso zzso diversity of zzso most zzso are likely to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also observed more population structure in the zzso transmitted viral population, including the same zzso in multiple zzso the presence of a zzso and evidence for the short-term zzso of defective zzso
