Bone zzso mast cells zzso contain zzso zzso zzso comprised of zzso units and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transfers zzso to position 6 of zzso zzso of zzso On the basis of the specificity of zzso it is thought that zzso is zzso in zzso through the sequential zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this paper, we investigated whether zzso and zzso are actually expressed in zzso in which zzso is actively zzso As the bone zzso cells differentiate to zzso level of zzso and zzso messages increased, whereas zzso zzso zzso message zzso In the extract of zzso activity of zzso and zzso but not zzso were zzso The zzso mouse zzso transferred zzso to both zzso terminal and internal zzso zzso the activity toward zzso terminal zzso was increased with increasing zzso When zzso zzso by zzso was metabolically labeled with zzso in the presence of zzso A, zzso or zzso the proportion of the zzso terminal zzso was increased compared with the control, suggesting that zzso in zzso may elaborate zzso in the zzso compartment with relatively low pH where zzso of the internal zzso by zzso zzso zzso
