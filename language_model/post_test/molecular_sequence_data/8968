zzso zzso zzso zzso has affinity for three consecutive zzso zzso more than zzso The major aim of this study was to isolate genes zzso zzso variable zzso to produce a large quantity of zzso zzso zzso in turn, allowing the conduct of studies on precise interactions between zzso or zzso and zzso This study describes cloning of the variable region genes of zzso construction of the variable region genes in zzso variable fragments zzso and two zzso zzso with human zzso hinge and zzso regions zzso types, and their respective expression in bacterial and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein with the expected specificity and affinity was successfully prepared from inclusion bodies accumulating in zzso zzso Construction, expression and zzso of two types of zzso proteins with differing zzso lengths in Chinese zzso zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso zzso proteins had binding activity specific to the zzso zzso zzso These results revealed that zzso and zzso genes cloned from the zzso represent those of zzso and that zzso zzso produced from these genes should provide sufficient amounts of binding zzso for use in zzso structural studies such as zzso and X-ray zzso
