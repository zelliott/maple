zzso studies have previously associated zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso with zzso a common zzso disease in zzso These studies, however, have been problematic on zzso grounds and their results are zzso To better understand the possible relationship between the zzso gene and zzso we characterized its zzso in the zzso macaque, an animal model for the zzso 

Human zzso zzso were used to isolate zzso gene sequences from four unrelated zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso proteins were expressed in zzso cells and zzso for their ability to zzso zzso zzso and bind zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso showing zzso identity to human zzso was identified in the zzso zzso Its two characterized zzso designated zzso and zzso were differentiated by one synonymous zzso and one zzso zzso zzso the latter causing a zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was not recognized by zzso zzso but reacted with zzso against zzso or the active site of zzso zzso zzso provided relatively high zzso activity with zzso lower activity with zzso zzso or zzso and poor activity with zzso zzso zzso in the activities of the two zzso were evident with most zzso 

A zzso zzso of human zzso was characterized in the zzso macaque, to facilitate investigations of the zzso involvement of this zzso in the zzso of zzso
