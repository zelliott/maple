The identification of minimal residual disease zzso in zzso zzso zzso is of immediate clinical zzso Although several zzso chain reaction zzso strategies are currently available, they all share serious technical or zzso limitations with respect to their ability to detect the broad spectrum of mature zzso zzso We report a new strategy based on anchored zzso that does not rely on a particular zzso zzso or zzso consensus zzso It can yield the complete DNA sequence of the zzso heavy chain variable region zzso The zzso is capable of detecting one zzso cell among zzso normal cells with high specificity and has the potential to greatly expand the variety of zzso zzso zzso that can be zzso
