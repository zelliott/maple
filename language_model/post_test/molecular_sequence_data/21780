In excitable cells, the main zzso of sodium zzso across zzso are zzso sodium channels zzso zzso zzso are essential elements in zzso signaling and muscular contraction and in humans have been zzso related to a variety of neurological and cardiovascular zzso They are complex heavily zzso intrinsic membrane proteins present in only trace quantities that have proven to be challenging objects of zzso However, in recent years, a number of simpler zzso sodium channels have been identified, with zzso from zzso zzso being the most zzso to zzso The availability of a bacterial zzso that is amenable to zzso expression and functional characterization in both bacterial and zzso systems has provided new opportunities for zzso zzso This review describes features of zzso as an zzso of this class of bacterial channels, compares zzso and zzso zzso with respect to their structural organization, pharmacological zzso and functional zzso and discusses how zzso zzso channels may have evolved to deal with the complex functional demands of higher zzso
