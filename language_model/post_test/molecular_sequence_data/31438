The aim of the present study is to investigate for the first time the genetic diversity of samples identified zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from sheep and cattle from two localities of zzso and to compare them with available data from other localities by partial sequences of the first zzso the zzso and second zzso Internal zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso of the sequences from zzso with sequences of zzso zzso from zzso confirmed that all samples belong to the species zzso zzso The zzso sequencing of ITS zzso showed no zzso variation in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences among all zzso samples, comparing with two zzso zzso in standard zzso zzso showing a substitution zzso in 20 position zzso reported previously from zzso zzso Australia, Uruguay and zzso The present study shows that in zzso sheep and cattle there is the most frequent zzso zzso of zzso zzso species from South zzso Considering zzso zzso the zzso trees showed reliable grouping among the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso and the zzso lineage I, including the main zzso zzso observed previously from Europe zzso Belarus, Ukraine and zzso zzso West Africa zzso America zzso and zzso Asia zzso Japan, and zzso Georgia, zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, common zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso from zzso also corresponded mostly to the first lineage including the main C1 zzso reported previously from Eastern European and Western Asian zzso they belonged just to a zzso distinguishable zzso as zzso zzso from Australia, France, Turkey, Uruguay, Russia, zzso Ukraine, Belarus, zzso USA, zzso and zzso indicating that this is the main zzso involved in the spread of zzso zzso throughout all zzso
