The zzso zzso family comprises many proteins widely differing in sizes and functions which have in common a variable number of zzso repeated arm sequences of about 42 zzso acids zzso In a search for proteins with sequence zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, we have identified a novel zzso zzso This new member of the zzso family is zzso if not exclusively, expressed in neural and neuroendocrine zzso hence the name neural zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso with a predicted molecular weight of 135 zzso and a zzso of zzso The zzso human protein differs only in a few zzso indicative of the evolutionary stability of zzso In human and zzso zzso we have found different transcripts of the zzso zzso suggesting that in each species the protein exists in at least two zzso The zzso protein contains three different zzso a zzso zzso zzso domain, including a potential zzso zzso segment, a central domain with 10 imperfect zzso units, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which represent a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso By in zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso we have demonstrated zzso and its zzso in the zzso of various kinds of zzso zzso in embryonic and adult mice, but minimal amounts have also been detected by zzso analysis in some other zzso containing neural or neuroendocrine zzso We have not seen significant enrichment of zzso at cell junctions or in zzso zzso zzso functions are discussed and the correlation of zzso synthesis with zzso differentiation processes is zzso
