In the presence of zzso zzso and other structural zzso the regulatory protein zzso of the family of zzso regulators which act in concert with the zzso 54 factor, activate the promoter zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid changes zzso and zzso introducing a zzso zzso at the hinge region between the zzso A domain and the central portion of zzso resulted in a zzso zzso which zzso the zzso effect of aromatic zzso This zzso was further exacerbated by inserting extra zzso acid zzso within the same zzso zzso A truncated zzso protein devoid of the zzso zzso portion of the protein zzso the zzso promoter zzso at high levels independently of zzso addition, both in zzso coli and in zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso domain by a zzso zzso derived from the zzso virus zzso resulted in a hybrid protein still able to bind DNA to the same extent in zzso as zzso but unable to stimulate zzso These data indicate that a key event in the zzso of zzso by zzso is the release of the repression caused by the A domain of the protein on surfaces located at the central domain of the zzso
