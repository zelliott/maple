All zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso to date are zzso to family B DNA zzso from zzso and zzso zzso representatives of the zzso division of zzso appear to have a single family B DNA zzso whereas two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso each possess two family B DNA zzso We have found the gene for yet a third family B DNA zzso designated zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is highly divergent at the zzso acid level from the previously characterized family B zzso in zzso zzso zzso and contains a number of zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso of this gene from the closely related zzso zzso It is also highly divergent from other zzso family B DNA zzso and, surprisingly, from the zzso zzso B3 zzso zzso analysis using all available zzso family B DNA zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso B3 and zzso zzso B3 zzso are related to one of the two DNA zzso of zzso zzso These sequences are members of a group which includes all zzso family B zzso while the remaining zzso sequences form another distinct zzso zzso family B DNA zzso together constitute a zzso zzso whose evolution has been characterized by a number of gene zzso zzso
