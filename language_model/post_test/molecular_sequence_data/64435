zzso are a family of proteins devoted to assisting the folding of other zzso They are large zzso assembled into ring structures that zzso a cavity in which folding takes zzso For this process to occur, the zzso must first recognize and interact with the unfolded zzso then undergo a zzso change upon zzso binding that results in the closure of the cavity which in turn mediates the folding reaction inside the zzso Although this general mechanism seems to apply to every zzso studied so far, there exist two different modes of interaction between the zzso and the zzso The first occurs mainly through the interaction between the exposed zzso zzso of the unfolded zzso and those of the zzso zzso binding site, as zzso for the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The second type of mechanism has been described so far only for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and here the interaction seems to be of a more specific nature, involving charged and polar zzso in both the zzso and the zzso which interacts with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
