zzso zzso is one of the major zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Evidence has accumulated for the biological importance of the zzso and, in particular, the zzso groups in bone formation, zzso and zzso The precise locations of the zzso groups in the zzso zzso were determined by metabolically labeling zzso with zzso in cultured chicken zzso followed by zzso to zzso zzso sequencing showed a single sequence of zzso consistent with that deduced from both zzso and previous zzso acid sequencing of the protein isolated from chicken zzso Three zzso peptides were isolated by zzso high performance liquid zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequencing of each of these zzso fragments gave single sequences as zzso zzso zzso and zzso with approximate molecular masses of 5, 30, and 20 zzso These data demonstrate that zzso was incorporated throughout the zzso to zzso sequence of the zzso zzso specifically zzso chicken zzso at two sites: between zzso and zzso which generated the zzso zzso end fragment, and another between zzso and zzso which generated the zzso and zzso zzso To further define the exact locations of the zzso zzso acids and the surrounding zzso acid zzso zzso was zzso with zzso which generated seven major zzso peptides whose zzso acid sequences were zzso The zzso zzso regions of zzso were identified as zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sites are followed by an asterisk zzso Of the seven identified zzso zzso regions, three were localized on the zzso end of the zzso zzso (with five zzso zzso and contained the sequence motifs that were zzso by zzso zzso II zzso whereas the remaining four peptides are concentrated toward the zzso half of the zzso (with five zzso zzso and contained recognition motifs for other zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso
