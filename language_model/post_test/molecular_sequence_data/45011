It is shown for the first time for the zzso family that a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from zzso zzso cells and its zzso sequence has been zzso The hybrid zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zzso zzso library contains an zzso insert of about zzso zzso which ensures the appearance of zzso activity when expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso contains two open reading zzso The first frame (the zzso zzso encodes a protein of 398 zzso acid zzso that has sequence zzso with zzso from different zzso The second frame encodes a protein with sequence zzso with proteins belonging to the family of zzso To zzso the zzso gene it was cloned into zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and its kinetic parameters have been zzso It is demonstrated that a presence of a hybrid zzso zzso containing the zzso gene in the zzso coli zzso cells, leads to a decrease in efficiency of zzso It seems likely that decomposition of zzso under the action of zzso leads to a decrease in the zzso content of zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso occurs only upon induction by a significant amount of zzso
