The potential role of zzso zzso in zzso formation is zzso through in zzso zzso zzso Studies focused on the native zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso product zzso that is prominent in developing zzso Experimental conditions supported spontaneous calcium zzso zzso with the initial formation of zzso calcium zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso was found to undergo relatively rapid transformation to randomly oriented zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso a longer induction period was observed during which relatively small zzso zzso were zzso zzso In the presence of zzso these zzso were found to align to form linear zzso particles that subsequently transformed and organized into parallel zzso of zzso zzso zzso In sharp contrast to these findings, zzso with a single zzso group on zzso 16, was found to inhibit calcium zzso zzso and stabilize zzso formation for more than 1 zzso Additional studies using zzso zzso zzso and partially zzso forms of zzso zzso showed that the single zzso group in zzso was responsible for the profound effect on mineral formation in zzso The present study has zzso for the first time, evidence suggesting that the native zzso zzso product zzso may have an important functional role in regulating zzso during zzso formation by preventing unwanted mineral formation within the zzso zzso during the zzso stage of zzso zzso obtained have also provided new insights into the functional role of the highly zzso zzso C zzso found in full-length zzso
