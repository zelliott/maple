zzso zzso generated during the metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso are imported to the zzso and converted to respective zzso zzso via zzso zzso to be zzso as activated zzso Because zzso zzso is activated mainly in the form of zzso derivatives in seed plants, the salvage reactions for zzso are expected to be independent from those for zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, which are activated as zzso For this study we have identified, in the zzso data base of zzso the gene zzso zzso of a zzso zzso with similarity to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli showed both zzso and zzso zzso activities, generating zzso from zzso zzso and zzso as the starting zzso Point zzso in zzso at either zzso or zzso caused loss of zzso zzso and zzso activity, zzso The apparent zzso values of zzso activity of zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and those of zzso zzso activity for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was detected in most cell types of zzso indicating that salvage reactions for free zzso zzso by zzso occur zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso exhibited higher zzso of free zzso in the soluble fraction than the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso activities, which zzso free zzso in zzso
