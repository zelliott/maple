zzso zzso contain numerous fragments of DNA that are derived from zzso zzso zzso The zzso and persistence of these elements is generally attributed to zzso activity rather than through possession or acquisition of a function of value to the host zzso Here we describe such a repetitive element, named zzso zzso zzso zzso 130 zzso of DNA derived from a zzso zzso which functions as a potent zzso zzso The expansion of the DNA database arising as a result of the human zzso sequencing project enabled us to identify zzso in, or close to, several well characterized genes including those for zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso A systematic analysis of the entire zzso sequence revealed that zzso and not other regions of the zzso zzso was especially highly represented in the human zzso Acquisition of a function by this repetitive element may explain its zzso These data show that a zzso zzso of an zzso nuclear element has the potential to zzso gene zzso a discovery that has broad implications for the way in which we view so-called zzso DNA and our understanding of zzso gene zzso
