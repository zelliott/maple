The sequence and structure of snake zzso seed zzso zzso a nontoxic zzso of type II zzso proteins zzso have been determined by mass zzso and X-ray zzso zzso As in type II zzso the zzso consists of a zzso chain made up of two zzso zzso The zzso chain, which is connected through a zzso bridge to the zzso chain in type II zzso is zzso into two in zzso However, the integrity of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso component of the zzso is zzso This is the first time that a zzso zzso or zzso zzso has been zzso A thorough examination of the sequence and structure of the protein and of its interactions with the bound zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso results from a combination of changes in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso analyses of the sequences of type II zzso of known structure and their zzso with unknown structure provide valuable insights into the evolution of this class of zzso They also indicate some zzso in zzso sites, which appears to contribute to the different levels of toxicity exhibited by zzso from various zzso
