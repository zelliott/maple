zzso repair is one of a number of DNA repair pathways that cells possess to deal with damage to their zzso zzso repair is concerned with the recognition and correction of incorrectly paired zzso which can be zzso zzso or insertions or deletions of a few zzso and appears to have been zzso throughout zzso zzso this is concerned with increasing the zzso of DNA zzso but also has important roles in the regulation of zzso zzso and the correction of chemical zzso In this study, we describe five genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that are likely to be involved in nuclear mismatch zzso The predicted zzso zzso mismatch repair genes are zzso compared with their likely counterparts in the other zzso examined to zzso To demonstrate that these do indeed zzso a functional nuclear mismatch repair system, we made zzso zzso zzso zzso in two of the zzso zzso and zzso that are likely to be central to the functioning of the mismatch repair zzso These zzso resulted in increased rates of sequence variation at a number of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and led to increased tolerance to the zzso agent zzso both zzso consistent with mismatch repair zzso
