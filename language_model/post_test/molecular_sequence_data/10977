We describe the isolation and initial characterization of zzso a gene that is essential for the assembly of a functional zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso nuclear zzso in this gene are respiratory deficient and contain reduced levels of zzso a and zzso The zzso gene has been cloned by zzso of the respective nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso is located on zzso II and contains an open reading frame of zzso base zzso The corresponding protein exhibits zzso similarity to the zzso of zzso zzso It contains three possible zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso import zzso The strain carrying a zzso zzso in zzso does not grow on zzso carbon sources and is deficient in both zzso c zzso and respiratory zzso It is proposed that zzso like its zzso zzso counterpart, provides an important function at a later step of the zzso zzso assembly zzso
