We have determined a zzso zzso zzso sequence around the 39 degrees region, located about zzso zzso downstream from the zero position of the zzso zzso zzso physical zzso Among the 17 putative zzso identified, zzso and zzso seem to zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be another signal zzso I gene zzso of zzso zzso The putative products of six zzso were similar to known proteins in data banks, namely a hypothetical zzso zzso protein of zzso coli zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso regulatory protein for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso identity with that of zzso of zzso zzso though they seem to be functionally zzso The remaining seven zzso did not show similarity to any known zzso
