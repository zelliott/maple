zzso zzso are zzso plants that constitute a large part of the zzso biomass and carbon storage on zzso Little is known about how this important portion of zzso maintains its health zzso This study assessed whether the zzso zzso zzso responds to treatment with zzso a zzso cell zzso compound inducing defense against zzso pathogens in vascular zzso Application of zzso to liquid culture of zzso zzso caused a rapid increase in zzso activity in the zzso For identification of the zzso zzso laser zzso zzso other methods and the zzso sequence of zzso zzso were zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were made and zzso with zzso The zzso activity resulted from a single zzso class III zzso zzso which belonged to a zzso zzso specific zzso cluster in analysis of the 45 putative class III zzso of zzso zzso and those of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from another moss killed the zzso knockout zzso but did not damage zzso zzso zzso The data point out the first specific host factor that is pivotal for pathogen defense in a zzso zzso Furthermore, results provide conclusive evidence that class III zzso in plants are needed in defense against hostile invasion by zzso
