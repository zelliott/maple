zzso are the tools of choice for studying bacterial functions involved in DNA zzso Here a genetic study on the replication of a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The results show that two zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso and an zzso origin, and at least nine zzso replication zzso the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the DNA zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso On the contrary, the cellular initiators zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and DNA zzso I are zzso From this, it is zzso that zzso replication is of the zzso type and is initiated by an original zzso zzso evidence suggests that during this process the zzso zzso might be delivered to the zzso origin by the zzso active zzso zzso zzso by a predicted interaction between zzso and a domain of zzso zzso to the major zzso domain of the cellular zzso zzso The zzso zzso replication fork appears to require the same functions as the bacterial zzso and the unrelated zzso zzso Most importantly, this replication machinery contains the two type C zzso zzso and zzso As the mechanism of initiation of the three zzso is substantially different, this suggests that both type C zzso might be required in any zzso replication in zzso zzso and presumably in other bacteria zzso zzso and zzso
