The spatial structure and zzso of zzso were investigated using theoretical zzso zzso The spatial organization of the zzso can be described by a set of 11 low-energy zzso of the zzso By solving the reverse zzso problem, a number of modified zzso acid sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were determined that have spatial structures corresponding to the set of low-energy zzso and should, therefore, possess zzso zzso
