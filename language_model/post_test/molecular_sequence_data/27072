zzso is a key zzso factor that regulates the zzso unfolded protein zzso Its expression is regulated by unconventional zzso zzso that is carried out by zzso zzso and a specific, as yet unknown, zzso zzso in response to the zzso of unfolded proteins in the zzso Conventional zzso zzso occurs only in the nucleus, but it has remained unclear whether unconventional zzso of zzso zzso takes place in the nucleus, zzso or zzso Here, we show that the zzso domain of zzso contains a nuclear exclusion signal to prevent zzso from zzso to the zzso In addition, zzso zzso which joins zzso zzso zzso by zzso was detected in the zzso but not in the zzso Moreover, the zzso contained large amounts of zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso Most zzso zzso zzso was converted to spliced zzso by unconventional zzso even if de zzso zzso was zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso not nuclear zzso zzso is a major zzso for unconventional zzso From these zzso we concluded that unconventional zzso of zzso zzso occurs predominantly in the zzso
