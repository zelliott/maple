The replication initiation protein zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso is a dual regulator in the control of zzso copy number, functioning both as a specific zzso and inhibitor of zzso While the zzso basis of these activities is not known, zzso activity requires binding of the protein to the seven 22 zzso direct repeats within the zzso zzso By deleting zzso segments of the zzso coding region, we have found that the zzso zzso of zzso that are produced, corresponding to the first 117 and zzso zzso zzso respectively, retain the negative activity of the zzso zzso zzso these truncated zzso proteins specifically inhibit zzso replication in zzso These zzso acting zzso however, are incapable of initiating replication in zzso and fail to bind to the zzso of the zzso DNA in zzso A correspondence between the observed negative activity of the zzso zzso and the negative regulatory activity of the intact zzso protein is supported by the finding that point zzso introduced into the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso that result in a decrease in its zzso activity also produce a zzso zzso zzso when these zzso are incorporated into the full-length zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the negative domain of zzso resides in the zzso segment of the zzso Furthermore, the data obtained suggest that zzso of zzso replication by zzso does not require direct binding to zzso
