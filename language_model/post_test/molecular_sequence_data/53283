zzso is an automated system for building protein structures from zzso zzso It uses pattern recognition to select regions in a database of previously determined structures that are similar to regions in a map of unknown zzso zzso zzso values, called features, of the electron density are extracted from zzso regions in an unknown map and compared with features extracted around regions in maps generated from a database of known zzso Those regions in the database that match best provide the local coordinates of atoms and these are accumulated to form a model of the unknown zzso zzso between the regions in the database and an zzso region is determined zzso by evaluating the zzso difference in feature values and zzso by calculating the zzso correlation zzso for those regions with similar feature zzso zzso has been successful at building protein structures for a wide range of test zzso maps and can automatically model entire protein structures in a few hours on a zzso Models built by zzso from test zzso maps of known protein structures were accurate to within zzso A zzso zzso assuming prior knowledge of zzso zzso The system represents a new approach to protein structure determination and has the potential to greatly reduce the time required to interpret zzso maps in order to build accurate protein zzso
