The advent of transgenic technology has greatly facilitated the study of zzso in animals in zzso The Big Blue mouse system, transgenic for the zzso zzso permits not only the zzso of zzso in different zzso but also provides for the generation of in zzso zzso zzso This report details the sequence zzso of 348 spontaneous zzso recovered from the liver of zzso male Big Blue zzso The zzso recovered from two strains of mice, zzso and zzso were compared and found to be very zzso The zzso zzso are zzso zzso with zzso of these occurring at zzso zzso This zzso bias is consistent with zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The second most common class of zzso is zzso zzso A significant zzso expansion of zzso was found in several animals, and this was used to make an approximate correction of the zzso frequency such that the most conservative estimate of zzso frequency is zzso The establishment of this substantial database of spontaneous zzso in the liver of Big Blue mice is intended to serve as a reference against which zzso recovered after treatment can be zzso
