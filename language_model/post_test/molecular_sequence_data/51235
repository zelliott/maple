Ras proteins can be modified by two types of zzso zzso and the fatty acid zzso These lipids help the otherwise zzso Ras protein to interact with the plasma membrane of a zzso The biological consequences of this association between Ras and zzso are dramatic, and can alter a cell's behavior from normal growth into zzso The scope and limits of our knowledge of the steps, structures and zzso involved in this molecular transformation from soluble zzso to zzso potency are offered zzso The prospects of regulating Ras function by controlling its zzso location provides a tantalizing opportunity to translate research into a novel therapeutic zzso
