The majority of infections with zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso originate in biomedical devices, suggesting a possible increased ability of these strains to produce zzso Loss of function of the accessory gene regulator zzso of zzso zzso has been suggested to zzso an enhanced ability to bind to zzso We studied zzso in zzso zzso and related zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso strains from diverse geographic origins belong to zzso group zzso All zzso strains were defective in zzso function, as demonstrated by their inability to produce zzso zzso isolate zzso demonstrated a nonsense zzso in zzso that was not present in a zzso gel zzso zzso isolate from the same zzso Various other zzso point zzso were noted in several clinical zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain demonstrated a small but zzso increase in zzso zzso after growth in zzso in zzso zzso of zzso This was not seen in the zzso zzso group II parent strain in which zzso was zzso The in zzso zzso activity of zzso was attenuated in the zzso strain compared to the parent zzso These findings imply that compromised zzso function is advantageous to clinical zzso of zzso zzso toward the development of zzso zzso perhaps through the development of zzso zzso
