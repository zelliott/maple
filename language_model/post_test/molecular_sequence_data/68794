The zzso zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso This complex, called the zzso is cell associated and has a mass of from 2 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso It consists of from 14 to 26 different zzso zzso form larger complexes, zzso with masses from 50 zzso zzso to 80 zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiently zzso zzso cellulose whereas individual zzso alone or in zzso do zzso Many of the zzso are zzso active and can be characterized as zzso zzso and zzso Several of the zzso have been zzso including the largest zzso zzso that is a zzso with a mass of 210 zzso zzso has a zzso domain and nine internal repeated sequences zzso to bind eight zzso zzso and a special zzso zzso The zzso anchors the zzso to the cell zzso zzso can be characterized as a scaffold holding the zzso zzso that line up with the cellulose zzso This arrangement allows a multiple cutting of the cellulose zzso zzso A similar system has been observed for other zzso complexes, notably zzso zzso
