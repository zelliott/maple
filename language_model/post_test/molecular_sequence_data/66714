zzso peptides arising from in zzso zzso of zzso zzso usually called advanced zzso end zzso product zzso are biologically relevant compounds due to their zzso towards circulating and tissue zzso To investigate their structures, in zzso zzso of human serum zzso zzso has been performed and followed by zzso zzso Using different zzso based approaches the zzso products obtained have been compared with those arising from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso obtained using zzso acid zzso indicate this as the most effective zzso leading to an increase in the coverage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso prior to zzso analysis reveals that zzso of the free zzso groups amenable to zzso are zzso In addition, the same approach shows the zzso of zzso zzso This indicates that, regardless of the high zzso concentration employed for zzso zzso zzso does not go to zzso zzso mass zzso data suggest that the collision induced zzso of zzso charged zzso peptides leads to specific fragmentation pathways related to the condensed zzso zzso The specific neutral losses derived from the activated zzso peptides can be used as signature for establishing the occurrence of zzso zzso
