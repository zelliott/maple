Our model of the human zzso zzso zzso has been refined on the basis of the recently published projection map of bovine zzso The refined model has a slightly different zzso arrangement, which reveals the presence of an extra zzso pocket located between zzso 3, 4 and zzso The interaction of series of zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso has been studied zzso by zzso zzso In order to account for the observed results, three-dimensional models of zzso zzso zzso in the target zzso are zzso zzso the obtained models are in good agreement with the experimental zzso zzso and partial zzso have a relatively small zzso They can bind to the same region of the zzso zzso however, different zzso zzso zzso zzso are usually larger zzso filling almost completely the same pocket as zzso They can usually produce much stronger interactions with aromatic zzso Experimental data combined with molecular zzso studies highlight how subtle and diverse zzso interactions could zzso
