The identity of cells responsible for transmission of human zzso zzso in blood products or bone zzso transplants is zzso We have tested the capacity of zzso to in zzso zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from healthy donors and found that certain zzso are zzso to zzso zzso In zzso viable cells were double stained for surface expression of different zzso proteins and for zzso zzso to allow the identification of sensitive zzso All analysis were performed on viable cells, using zzso zzso zzso and automated flow zzso zzso were infected either with the zzso zzso strain zzso or with a virus isolate obtained from a zzso zzso Up to zzso of all zzso could express the major zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso known at the lower zzso zzso zzso cells were mainly zzso zzso but also a small population of large zzso cells were susceptible to zzso zzso zzso B zzso were resistant to zzso zzso Different populations of infected cells were enriched by using zzso coated with zzso zzso and the presence of infectious virus was demonstrated by zzso the selected and zzso cell material on human zzso Only material from infected zzso and from zzso zzso cells gave rise to zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso as a sign of active viral zzso of the major zzso and late zzso genes in infected cells was demonstrated by using zzso reversed zzso chain zzso A common zzso was found for all cells that could be infected with zzso The zzso zzso a zzso to zzso integral membrane protein identical to the zzso zzso zzso was expressed on all zzso zzso
