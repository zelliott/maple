Two novel zzso zzso were identified in a patient who was a compound zzso with type 1 zzso zzso zzso and whose zzso was typical except that he exhibited zzso zzso A deletion of 36 zzso in zzso 12 zzso predicted the net loss of 12 zzso acid zzso zzso in the third zzso repeat of the zzso stalk region zzso A nonsense zzso in zzso 15 zzso predicted a zzso zzso of the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso were expressed at very low levels compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression with the zzso zzso zzso were equivalent to results with zzso zzso zzso function of zzso with zzso zzso was equivalent to that with zzso zzso However, binding function of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was reduced by 50% versus zzso zzso It was concluded that zzso the portion of the zzso stalk region deleted in zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso expression but the portion of the zzso domain truncated in zzso is not; and zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso binding function of zzso but not of zzso Studies with the patient's zzso zzso were consistent with functional impairment of zzso but not of zzso
