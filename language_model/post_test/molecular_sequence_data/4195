The zzso diversity of 31 strains of zzso zzso 27 strains of zzso zzso and 29 strains of zzso zzso was determined by partial zzso zzso sequence analysis and zzso infrared zzso zzso As a prerequisite for the zzso 27 strains derived from culture collections which had carried invalid or wrong species zzso were reclassified in accordance with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be a rapid and reliable method for screening for similar zzso and for identifying these zzso at the species zzso Two main conclusions emerged from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso similarities suggested that zzso zzso strains have a very low diversity, zzso linens displays high diversity and zzso zzso occupies an intermediate zzso zzso No correlation of zzso spectral similarity and zzso zzso sequence similarity below the species level zzso between strains of one zzso was zzso zzso diversification of zzso zzso sequences and zzso change of the cellular components detected by zzso zzso appear to be zzso
