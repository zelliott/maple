We have zzso the small zzso zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso This provides the first molecular information on a zzso zzso We have performed a zzso analysis by maximum likelihood, zzso and distance methods for all available nearly complete zzso small zzso zzso zzso genes and for representatives of all major groups of more advanced zzso zzso These show zzso as the zzso zzso zzso closely followed by zzso zzso proves to be much more closely related to zzso and, to a lesser degree, to zzso than to zzso The close relationship between the zzso zzso on our trees and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the idea that the early divergence of the zzso zzso is an zzso caused by zzso The deep molecular divergence between the three zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso that lacks zzso is in keeping with the classical evidence for a fundamental difference in the symmetry of the zzso between the two zzso We accordingly separate the two groups as two zzso zzso for those with two zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso that lack these, and divide each order into two zzso We suggest that this fundamental divergence in manner of feeding and in the symmetry of the zzso evolved in a zzso zzso very early indeed in the evolution of the zzso cell, possibly very soon after the origin of the zzso state zzso two zzso linked together firmly by the zzso and before the evolution of zzso by zzso and zzso which may have zzso animal guts zzso We discuss the possible relationship between the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the nature of the first zzso cell in the light of our results and other recent molecular zzso
