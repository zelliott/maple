zzso 2 zzso is a zzso protein that regulates numerous aspects of zzso zzso zzso However, its possible involvement in zzso processes is poorly zzso In this work, we examined the potential role of zzso during zzso early zzso zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso is required for proper zzso extension zzso movements, and normal cell polarization and zzso without affecting cell zzso Moreover, for zzso movements, zzso acts as an essential regulator of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized with the same distribution as the zzso zzso which is reasonable, as zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with the zzso quarter of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso and regulates zzso zzso through zzso zzso for zzso zzso We provide evidence that the zzso activity of zzso is essential for control of zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso has a pivotal role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
