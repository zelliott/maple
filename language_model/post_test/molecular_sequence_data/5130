zzso zzso repair in humans is a complex reaction involving 14 zzso in six repair factors for dual incisions on either sides of a DNA zzso To identify the reaction zzso that form by the human zzso repair zzso we adopted three zzso zzso of functional zzso complexes, zzso zzso and the employment as zzso of zzso DNA reaction zzso containing zzso sequences zzso to, 3' to, or encompassing the DNA zzso The first zzso reaction intermediate was formed by zzso binding of zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso complex 1, zzso In this complex the DNA was zzso on either side of the zzso by no more than 10 zzso Independent of the zzso zzso function, the zzso protein stabilized this complex, forming a long lived zzso complex 2 zzso The zzso complex bound to zzso forming zzso which led to dual incisions and the release of the excised zzso With partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was excised at a fast rate independent of zzso indicating that a major function of this protein is to stabilize the zzso DNA or to aid zzso unwinding in zzso zzso
