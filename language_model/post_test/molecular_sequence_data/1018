zzso zzso is a zzso plant pathogen that possesses a type III zzso system zzso similar to that of the zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso The regions zzso the zzso zzso gene clusters in the latter pathogens zzso various zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the complete zzso zzso zzso gene cluster and approximately 12 zzso of the zzso regions zzso the previously characterized zzso zzso gene in the left zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso and similar zzso zzso zzso with their zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso cluster was interrupted by a cluster of four zzso only one of which, a zzso of zzso zzso is implicated in zzso zzso Furthermore, the regions zzso the zzso cluster lacked genes that were likely to zzso zzso zzso Instead, some of the genes in these regions predict ABC zzso and zzso zzso proteins that could have alternative roles in zzso zzso affecting all of the genes in the regions zzso or interrupting the zzso cluster were constructed in zzso zzso zzso a zzso whose reduced zzso capacity can enhance the zzso of minor zzso zzso zzso were screened in zzso chicory leaves and then in potato zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in one zzso designated zzso resulted in strongly reduced zzso in all three zzso zzso is immediately downstream of zzso has an unusually low zzso content of zzso and predicts an unknown protein of 111 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was shown to be active by its ability to zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to an zzso zzso reporter that is active in the presence of zzso zzso into zzso zzso leaf zzso However, zzso was not zzso into plant cells, and zzso expression was not affected by zzso in zzso zzso zzso regulator genes zzso and zzso Thus, the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is centered on the zzso cluster encodes a potpourri of zzso factors, but none of these appear to be a zzso zzso
