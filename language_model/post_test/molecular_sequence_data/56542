The zzso and a partial zzso sequence of a rat class I major zzso zzso zzso zzso is reported zzso The sequence contains several unique zzso acid zzso at certain positions, zzso in zzso 7 (which is not zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso 8 stop zzso to a sense zzso and includes a long 3' untranslated region zzso The structure of zzso 7 differs from that found in most rat class I genes and resembles zzso 7 of most zzso zzso Parts of the 3' zzso region are zzso to the zzso and certain zzso zzso zzso is zzso by northern zzso analysis in zzso zzso only, by zzso chain reaction zzso in each tissue zzso After zzso into L cells zzso can be shown to be zzso at the cell zzso zzso derived from the 3' zzso part zzso with a number of restriction fragments which map to the zzso region, thus defining a zzso of zzso region zzso Several members of this zzso are deleted in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene presents typical features of a class zzso zzso Aspects of evolution and the potential function of the gene are zzso
