The plasma membrane zzso gene was cloned and zzso from the extremely zzso green zzso zzso zzso and from the extremely zzso zzso zzso A special feature of the zzso zzso is an extended zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the two proteins are zzso identical but differ in their C zzso A zzso loop within this domain in zzso zzso which presumably faces the cell exterior, has a high ratio of zzso over basic zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso The amount of the zzso protein in plasma zzso and the level of its zzso transcript in zzso zzso are far higher than in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso the zzso A pH shift from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso a large increase in the level of the zzso zzso and in the amount of the zzso zzso This suggests that the expression of the zzso in zzso zzso is zzso at the zzso zzso The implications of these findings are discussed with respect to the zzso pressures imposed on these zzso species by their exceptional environmental zzso
