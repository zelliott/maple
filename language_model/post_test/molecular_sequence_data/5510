A zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from pig small zzso It is distinguished by an zzso part with a high content of zzso (7 in a zzso zzso a zzso part with a high proportion of zzso (3 in a zzso zzso and six zzso zzso in three zzso zzso bridges zzso positions zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and Pro zzso suggest a tight and special zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso it has no established zzso effect on insulin zzso At 10 zzso zzso a weak zzso tendency is less than half of that of the other two zzso Like gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso has three zzso bridges, zzso zzso and many charged zzso but they are differently distributed and zzso belongs to a separate, apparently novel zzso However, zzso is similar to a zzso corresponding to an zzso zzso of human fetal liver and zzso establishing the nature of the mature form of the product of this zzso and showing a general zzso age, and species distribution of this zzso A truncated form of zzso composed of its zzso 37 zzso zzso was also zzso and structurally zzso These two peptides increase the complexity of known zzso zzso and at least zzso has properties compatible with specific zzso
