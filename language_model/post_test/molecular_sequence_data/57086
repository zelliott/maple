The fusion activity of influenza zzso zzso and of zzso proteins altered in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso York, zzso and White, zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 102, zzso was analyzed following expression in zzso cells using zzso zzso virus zzso Fusion was monitored by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso between zzso labeled zzso and zzso zzso cells using zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso after lowering the pH showed the same pattern for wild type zzso and zzso zzso although there were shifts in the pH zzso The time for commitment to the zzso state and the temperature dependence of the processes leading to zzso fusion were also the same for wild type and zzso zzso However, striking differences were observed between wild type zzso and the zzso zzso in their ability to induce zzso zzso from zzso to zzso cells of large molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso The data indicate that the kinetic processes which are measurable in the time range of seconds are insensitive to the structure of the fusion zzso Surprisingly, however, the fusion zzso plays an important role in later processes related to pore widening which eventually results in delivery of the zzso into the zzso
