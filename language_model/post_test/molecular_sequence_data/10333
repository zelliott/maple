zzso X mental zzso syndrome is associated with an expansion of a zzso repeat within the zzso of the first zzso of the zzso zzso abnormal zzso of the zzso island in the promoter region, and a zzso zzso of this zzso We studied zzso regulation of the zzso gene using protein footprint analysis of the active and inactive gene in zzso zzso We identified four zzso within the zzso promoter region which zzso to consensus binding sites of known zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso were present in normal cells with a zzso active zzso zzso The same zzso were present in different cell zzso primary zzso zzso cells and peripheral zzso However, for the zzso zzso region zzso no zzso were detected in a variety of cell types derived from patients with fragile X syndrome which have a zzso inactive zzso zzso A zzso zzso search identified sequence similarities between the region of the zzso gene containing the zzso and an analogous region within the promoter region of the gene for the zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso a member of a family of zzso implicated in zzso processing and zzso zzso The zzso sequences identified in the zzso promoter region zzso to the same consensus binding sites showing zzso interactions in the zzso zzso Our previous functional studies and the studies of others demonstrate that zzso zzso like zzso are also zzso which appear to be involved in zzso zzso The results from our footprint studies suggest that the expression of the zzso gene is regulated by the binding of specific zzso factors to sequence elements in the zzso region of the gene and that this expression may be regulated by elements in common with the zzso zzso Common regulation of these two genes might play an important role in the cooperative processing and transport of zzso from the nucleus to the translation zzso
