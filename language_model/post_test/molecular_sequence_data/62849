The variable domain of zzso zzso comprises only the heavy chain and is missing the zzso variable zzso This single domain is sufficient for zzso recognition and zzso that required by other zzso Human zzso have previously been zzso to be soluble stable fragments that retain zzso zzso Such engineered zzso are of interest in drug development, since they are zzso and in other biotechnology zzso We present the structure of a zzso human zzso zzso zzso which is a competitive and zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso C virus zzso In solution, this zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The structure confirms the minimum zzso requirements of the zzso zzso The zzso also suggests a means by which the observed zzso occurs, highlighting the importance of the composition of the zzso in maintaining a truly zzso zzso
