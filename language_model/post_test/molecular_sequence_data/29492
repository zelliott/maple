A precise genetic map containing anonymous markers and genes is indispensable for the efficient selection of candidate zzso responsible for quantitative trait zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, a first version of a radiation hybrid cell zzso map has been constructed by using the zzso of Minnesota zzso panel for 757 markers zzso zzso et zzso 1999, zzso Genome zzso zzso In this study, 280 zzso zzso fragments in zzso clones were assigned to the zzso zzso 255 zzso clones were successfully linked to first-generation linkage groups zzso zzso zzso The remaining 25 clones could not be zzso because their zzso to the closest markers in the first generation map were less than zzso In addition, 16 zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso zzso 1 by zzso zzso were subjected to isolation of zzso zzso Thirty-one zzso were isolated from 15 zzso zzso and 24 of 31 zzso zzso derived from 14 clones were found to be zzso We also mapped both zzso of 12 zzso clones to the zzso map, in order to measure resolution of the zzso zzso the resolution was found to range from 8 zzso to more than 126 zzso depending on the zzso
