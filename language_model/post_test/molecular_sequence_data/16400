A new zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso as zzso was zzso zzso long and contained a 657 zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso protein of 219 zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein was found to have a potential nuclear zzso signal zzso in its zzso region followed by an zzso zzso motif and an zzso zzso half that might act as an zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso strongly resembled other zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso and zzso zzso cold zzso zzso showed that zzso was relevant to cold zzso Our study implies that zzso might have similar functions possessed by other zzso genes such as inducing the expression of some zzso genes and increasing plants' freezing zzso
