zzso zzso zzso is an important component of the zzso system zzso zzso active and inactive zzso zzso It is of primary importance in understanding how different zzso zzso zzso marks and a specific combination of them are read and interpreted by zzso proteins to regulate gene zzso In this paper, we report that the rice zzso protein zzso that was required for many aspects of plant development can interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso a mark associated with moderately expressed or zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso a mark associated with zzso zzso respectively, through the zzso and the plant zzso zzso finger of the zzso A zzso or zzso of the gene provoked a decrease of zzso and zzso (a mark associated with active zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso respectively, were lost from about 56 and zzso of marked zzso which zzso mostly to zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso a zzso proportion of zzso genes lost zzso among which many zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the rice zzso protein is a zzso zzso regulator able to recognize and zzso zzso and zzso zzso over zzso or zzso zzso which may be associated with regulation of a gene zzso program of plant zzso
