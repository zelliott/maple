Small synthetic molecules called growth hormone zzso zzso stimulate the release of growth hormone zzso from the zzso They act through the zzso a zzso zzso highly expressed in the zzso and zzso Using an orphan zzso strategy with a stable cell line expressing zzso we zzso zzso zzso for zzso from rat and human stomach and named it zzso after a word root zzso in zzso languages meaning zzso zzso is a zzso hormone in which the third zzso acid, usually a zzso but in some species a zzso is modified by a fatty zzso this modification is essential for zzso zzso The main active form of rat zzso is zzso acid peptides with zzso zzso In rat stomach, a second type of zzso zzso was zzso identified as zzso With the exception of the deletion of zzso zzso is identical to zzso retaining the zzso acid zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso created by alternative zzso of the zzso zzso As in the zzso the major active form of human zzso is a zzso acid zzso with an zzso zzso However, in human stomach, several minor forms of human zzso peptides have been zzso These can be classified into four groups by the type of zzso observed at zzso and into two groups by the zzso acids in zzso The discovery of zzso indicates that the release of zzso from the zzso and appetite stimulation might be regulated by zzso derived from the zzso
