Single zzso zzso zzso are the most common type of sequence variation among plants and are often functionally zzso We describe the use of zzso technology and high resolution melting analysis zzso for high zzso zzso discovery in zzso alfalfa zzso zzso zzso a species with high economic value but limited zzso zzso 

The alfalfa zzso selected from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which differ in water stress sensitivity, were used to prepare zzso from tissue of zzso plants grown under either zzso or zzso conditions, and then pooled for zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso of raw zzso a total of zzso unique sequences were obtained including zzso tentative consensus zzso sequences and zzso zzso ranging from 100 zzso to zzso zzso in zzso with an average length of zzso zzso We identified zzso candidate zzso distributed throughout the zzso A sample of candidate zzso were evaluated and validated using high resolution melting zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso harboring zzso candidate zzso were located on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso assignments indicate that sequences obtained cover a broad range of GO zzso 

We describe an efficient method to identify thousands of zzso distributed throughout the alfalfa zzso covering a broad range of GO zzso zzso zzso represent valuable molecular marker resources that can be used to enhance marker density in linkage zzso identify potential factors involved in zzso and genetic variation, and as tools for association mapping and zzso selection in zzso
