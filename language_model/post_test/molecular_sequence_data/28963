zzso proteins from zzso assume a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso domain of 72 zzso flanked by two zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the targeting and zzso zzso present within the zzso zzso sequence using zzso canine pancreatic zzso Our data indicate that zzso are integrated into zzso by a zzso zzso zzso This is supported by the identification of two independent functional signal sequences in the H domain, and by demonstrating the involvement of the zzso zzso in membrane zzso zzso zzso was manipulated by the addition of an zzso zzso signal zzso resulting in zzso of the N zzso to the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the C zzso failed to zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not dependent on either the sequence of zzso segments in the H domain, the central zzso knot motif or charges zzso the H zzso zzso the zzso constraint results from the length and/or the zzso of the H domain, zzso a general case that long zzso spans are unable to zzso their C zzso to the zzso zzso
