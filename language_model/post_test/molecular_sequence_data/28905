zzso zzso possesses at least two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one of which is related to the zzso system of zzso zzso In this study, we have cloned an additional gene of this circuit, zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso Delta zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in total zzso activity due to loss of expression of the zzso zzso but no changes in either AHL production or zzso Additional genes positively regulated by zzso were identified from a zzso gene library fused to a zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified which exhibited decreased expression in the Delta zzso zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso and zzso the first step in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has identity with zzso zzso and zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso strains require an active zzso to produce high levels of an zzso brown color via zzso suggesting that zzso controls zzso zzso zzso and Sat are related to zzso zzso proteins zzso within a DNA locus required for zzso zzso A zzso zzso Delta zzso zzso and a zzso carrying a polar zzso in the zzso DNA locus were shown to produce defective zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family has been characterized in zzso zzso that positively regulates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
