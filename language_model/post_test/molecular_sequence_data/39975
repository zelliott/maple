It has recently been proposed that the zzso zzso domain functions as a GAP zzso zzso domain for small zzso zzso Because of the large number of zzso proteins in zzso however, most zzso zzso have never been investigated for zzso zzso In this study we established panels of the zzso form of 60 different zzso constructed in zzso a zzso zzso bait zzso We also constructed a zzso zzso prey zzso zzso that harbors the zzso of 40 distinct zzso zzso zzso investigation of zzso combinations of 60 zzso zzso and 40 zzso proteins by zzso zzso screening revealed that seven zzso proteins specifically and zzso interact with specific zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso of in zzso zzso activity revealed that zzso and zzso actually possess significant zzso and zzso activity, respectively, but that zzso do not display zzso activity at zzso These results indicate that specific interaction between zzso protein and zzso would be a useful indicator for screening for the target zzso of some zzso zzso but that there is little correlation between the zzso activity and zzso activity of other zzso zzso
