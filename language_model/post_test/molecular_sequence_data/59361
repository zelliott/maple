The zzso zzso genes derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso from a previously constructed zzso zzso zzso using zzso as the cloning zzso and zzso coli zzso as the host zzso The resulting strain, zzso coli zzso zzso produced zzso zzso when grown in LB broth or minimal medium in the presence of zzso zzso mapping and partial DNA sequencing provided evidence for the presence of zzso with extensive zzso to parts of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The clones exhibited some residual zzso zzso zzso activity which resulted in the formation of small amounts of zzso zzso of the zzso was induced by zzso but was not directed by the zzso promoter within the cloning zzso The clones were assessed for zzso zzso production in zzso batch cultures, and the maximum product concentration obtained was zzso g zzso zzso formation was dependent upon the presence of zzso in the culture zzso Although the zzso was toxic, the zzso was apparently limited by the supply of zzso The results suggest that it should be possible to improve zzso zzso production by zzso substantially by improving both the strain and zzso zzso
