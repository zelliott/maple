Three different zzso initiate zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso different zzso zzso proteins that are subsequently used to zzso zzso M zzso Here, genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are characterized for the first zzso A single copy of zzso the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a copy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, two other nearly identical copies of zzso designated zzso and zzso were also found in the zzso A zzso transcript was detected with zzso to zzso and zzso as well as to zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins for zzso and zzso zzso transfer, respectively, and with zzso to zzso zzso a putative membrane protein which might function as a zzso zzso These results indicate that these zzso found on the zzso in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a single zzso zzso A zzso start site was detected zzso or 304 zzso upstream of the zzso start of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso however, like the zzso zzso zzso the genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso each contain a single zzso amber zzso Each of the three zzso zzso gene copies from zzso zzso contained an amber zzso at the same position, followed by a downstream zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells matched the zzso predicted for the gene products of zzso zzso or zzso if termination occurred at the zzso or zzso zzso rather than the zzso amber zzso The zzso gene from zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso at the same position as the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is also present in zzso zzso Thus, the genes zzso the three types of zzso that initiate zzso from zzso contain zzso amber zzso that are suppressed during expression of the characterized zzso
