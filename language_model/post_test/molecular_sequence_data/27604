The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is part of the zzso membrane sector of the zzso zzso It is a nuclear gene zzso zzso DNA clones zzso a precursor of the protein have been isolated from a bovine zzso The initial partial clone was identified with a mixture of 32 synthetic zzso designed from the known protein sequence zzso et zzso zzso and this isolate was then used to screen the library again in order to find a complete zzso The DNA sequence of a clone that encodes the entire mature protein has been established, and the deduced protein sequence agrees exactly with that determined by direct sequence analysis of protein isolated from bovine hearts zzso et zzso zzso At the 3' ends of two independently isolated zzso alternative zzso sites have been zzso otherwise, the DNA sequences of the clones are zzso In common with many other zzso proteins zzso in nuclear zzso the deduced protein sequence has an zzso extension that is absent from the mature zzso These zzso direct the protein to its appropriate zzso compartment and are removed during the import zzso The zzso clone has been employed to isolate bovine zzso clones containing the gene for the zzso From them, the DNA sequence has been established of a region zzso the mature protein and six zzso acids in the zzso but not the remainder of the proposed import zzso This sequence extends over almost 10 zzso and is divided into eight zzso zzso B between zzso I and II contains a sequence that is related to long zzso repetitive elements zzso that have been described in other zzso Human zzso are usually flanked by directly repeated sequences with a zzso tract at their 3' ends, and these features are present in the bovine LINE which is zzso This sequence contains an open reading frame zzso part of a protein that is closely related to a protein zzso in mouse zzso to reverse zzso and to DNA binding zzso We have also made a preliminary investigation by DNA zzso of the number of sequences related to the bovine gene in both the bovine and human zzso Under the experimental conditions zzso one zzso zzso in zzso of bovine DNA, and two to four bands were detected in zzso of human zzso these latter fragments have originated from either expressed genes or zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
