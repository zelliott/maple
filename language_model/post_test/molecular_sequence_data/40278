In this report, we describe insights into the function of the zzso tunnel that were obtained through an analysis of an unusual 25 zzso zzso motif zzso ) associated with the signal zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso It was previously shown that zzso zzso signal zzso recognition by the signal recognition zzso and we now show that fusion of zzso to a zzso protein causes it to zzso We obtained two lines of evidence that both of these effects are attributable to the zzso of zzso inside the zzso zzso First, we found that zzso in zzso that abolished its effects on protein targeting and protein folding altered the zzso of short nascent chains to zzso zzso Second, we found that a zzso in zzso that zzso the tunnel zzso the effects of the zzso zzso on protein zzso Our results provide evidence that the zzso of a zzso inside the zzso tunnel can influence protein folding under zzso conditions and suggest that zzso zzso might increase the zzso of at least some zzso proteins produced in zzso zzso
