Recent genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene has established that zzso encodes a novel nuclear protein that is involved in both eye and leg zzso In the zzso eye, zzso expression appears to be controlled by the product of the zzso zzso In order to analyze the zzso zzso in zzso we have isolated and characterized the zzso and zzso clones corresponding to the human and mouse zzso of zzso zzso A full-length human zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso acids protein with predicted molecular weight of 73 zzso A 109 zzso acid domain located at the zzso of the zzso showed significant sequence and secondary structure zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis found human zzso predominantly in adult zzso heart, and zzso with less expression detected in the brain, zzso skeletal muscle and zzso A panel of human cell lines was studied and most notably a large proportion of zzso expressed zzso zzso Mouse zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with predicted molecular weight of 78 zzso that is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso protection analysis showed the highest zzso zzso expression in the adult mouse kidney and zzso whereas lower expression was detected in the brain and zzso zzso analysis readily detected zzso zzso in the adult mouse cornea and zzso zzso zzso expression in the mouse zzso zzso was observed primarily in the fore and hind zzso as well as in the zzso
