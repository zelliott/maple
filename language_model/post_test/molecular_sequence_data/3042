zzso zzso zzso peptides have a tendency to zzso This study is an attempt to account for the coupled zzso of zzso and zzso association for two zzso with zzso different loop sequence and net zzso We have studied each of the two separate zzso fragments from zzso zzso A series of zzso at different zzso zzso were monitored by CD and zzso zzso All data were fitted simultaneously to both a complete model of all possible equilibrium zzso and a reduced model not including zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso shows that the peptides may occur as zzso or zzso depending on the solution zzso Our results show zzso different behavior for the two zzso The zzso containing the zzso zzso shows a strong tendency to zzso in the zzso zzso The average zzso is zzso orders of magnitude lower than for the intact zzso We observe a large apparent zzso of zzso binding for the overall process from zzso zzso to fully loaded zzso showing that a zzso zzso folds upon zzso to a zzso zzso thereby presenting a zzso binding site to the second zzso The zzso zzso shows a much smaller tendency to zzso which may be related to its larger net negative zzso In spite of the differences in zzso behavior, the zzso affinities of both zzso fragments are similar and in the range zzso zzso zzso
