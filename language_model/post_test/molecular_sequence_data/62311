zzso and specific zzso zzso were designed for the detection of zzso reductive zzso zzso the key zzso of zzso zzso based on sequence information of three zzso and three zzso zzso zzso For the design of the zzso zzso seven zzso zzso blocks identified with different zzso tools were zzso For one block zzso zzso containing a zzso clamp region specific for zzso and a zzso zzso core region specific for zzso in general were designed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso design zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso DNA of zzso zzso strain K, zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso led to the isolation of the known zzso genes and three new genes zzso putative reductive zzso that cluster with zzso and not with zzso In addition, zzso designed to be specific for the three known zzso zzso namely zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were successfully tested on zzso DNA of different zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso followed by a zzso with specific zzso allowed a sensitive detection of only zzso copies per zzso
