zzso present in cabbage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against various kinds of cancer cell zzso Another cabbage zzso zzso zzso also has an zzso zzso zzso These proteins exhibit DNA zzso zzso zzso proteins are found to be distributed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we performed the zzso cloning of zzso proteins designated zzso from zzso white, zzso zzso and zzso from zzso white, zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso an zzso and an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The partial zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso were identical to the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that zzso is zzso similar to zzso and zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso with the rabbit zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity against human cervical zzso zzso and human gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso site resulted in a significant decrease in zzso of both zzso Moreover, the proteins incubated with calf zzso DNA and zzso resulted in the formation of zzso as in the case of zzso and zzso These findings could provide useful information for understanding the importance of zzso ability and molecular evolution of zzso proteins in family zzso
