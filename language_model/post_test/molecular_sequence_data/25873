zzso in zzso zzso is controlled by a single genetic locus (the S zzso with nearly 50 different zzso In this paper, we report the characterization of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibits weak DNA zzso to the other previously zzso S locus zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso clones with sequence zzso to zzso were isolated from two different zzso zzso strains belonging to two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso sequences are zzso zzso to each other, but only zzso zzso to zzso Using the Chinese kale zzso genetic background, we demonstrate that the isolated zzso zzso sequence is a transcript from a zzso designated zzso that resides at the S zzso and propose that it is a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso Among the estimated zzso zzso copies of zzso genes detected in the zzso zzso we cloned and characterized the zzso gene and another closely related and genetically linked gene zzso zzso A complete open reading frame that is zzso zzso to zzso is located within zzso The existence of this intact duplicated S gene raises the possibility that zzso may also be involved in the functioning of zzso in zzso zzso
