A comparative study of the gene expression profile in different zzso stages of zzso zzso has been initiated based on the expressed sequence tag zzso zzso A total of zzso zzso were generated from seven different zzso libraries constructed from four distinct stages of the zzso life zzso The libraries were first evaluated for their quality for a large-scale zzso sequencing zzso Most of them were shown to have less than zzso useless clones and more than 50% new zzso The zzso of each library was also zzso showing that one adult zzso zzso library was composed of a small number of highly frequent zzso When comparing zzso from distinct libraries, we could detect that most genes were present only in a single library, but others were expressed in more than one zzso stage and may represent zzso genes in the zzso When considering only once the genes present in more than one library, a total of zzso unique genes were zzso corresponding to zzso new zzso zzso zzso From the total of unique zzso zzso were identified based on zzso with genes from other organisms, zzso matched zzso zzso characterized genes and zzso represent unknown zzso
