The zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in development, particularly in cell fate determination and zzso in addition to their function of blocking cell cycle zzso We have identified two novel members of the zzso zzso inhibitor family, zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso results in cell cycle arrest by zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of these zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso tail zzso zzso and cement zzso while zzso is expressed in the central nervous zzso In a retinal cell fate determination zzso both zzso and zzso have an activity that influences cell fate zzso These observations suggest that zzso and zzso might be involved in cell fate determination in a zzso manner by zzso proliferation and differentiation as observed with zzso
