The high-resolution structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso not yet established in detail, was zzso by limited zzso with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso While in zzso there were no zzso sites inside of any of the four zzso the analysis of the fragments obtained after partial zzso of zzso showed a site of zzso at the putative third zzso suggesting that this zzso is partially zzso at this zzso The partial zzso of the rest of the zzso was compatible with a similar folding pattern for zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of the crystal structure of these last zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso occurred at zzso zzso which would be located at the end of the first zzso and the beginning of the second in the zzso folding model, suggesting that these zzso are shorter in zzso than in zzso In order to gain further insight on the folding of these zzso circular zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso were used to examine the effect of zzso conditions on zzso and zzso After exposure to 6 M zzso the unfolding of both proteins was completely reversed upon elimination of the zzso zzso In contrast, exposure to pH zzso caused an irreversible decrease in the zzso content in both hormones, most striking for zzso indicating that this hormone is less stable than zzso or zzso
