The process of zzso involves the transfer of a short spliced leader zzso zzso sequence to a consensus zzso site on a separate zzso zzso In this study, the first stem loop of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso patterns established that the first 36 zzso (which includes the zzso site and a complementary zzso region surrounding a zzso hairpin zzso remain structurally independent of the rest of the zzso full-length zzso A comparison of zzso and zzso zzso chemical shifts in the region of the zzso site and loop between the native sequence and a modified zzso zzso from which an zzso internal loop had been deleted was zzso There was no significant difference between the resonance locations of the equivalent zzso in the two zzso establishing that there was no zzso interaction between the hairpin and internal zzso Full chemical shift assignments of zzso zzso and zzso chemical shifts were obtained for the modified zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The stem adopts an zzso zzso typical of zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the stem appears to continue for the first three zzso of the zzso side of the loop, followed by a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso about the zzso zzso Base stacking is not seen on the 3' side of the zzso There was no evidence for formation of zzso zzso within the loop, but several long distance zzso indicated zzso zzso indicative of a structured zzso The final loop zzso an zzso which is zzso among all known zzso zzso zzso zzso adopts an zzso zzso
