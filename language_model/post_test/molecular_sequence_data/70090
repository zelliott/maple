The zzso activity of a novel modified zzso zzso was compared with that of a zzso zzso in a canine model of copper zzso coronary zzso The coronary zzso was allowed to age for 1, 3 or 6 zzso before either drug was zzso zzso was administered by zzso zzso injection, while zzso was given by the same method, as well as by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity 2 to 4 times as potent as that of zzso when administered by zzso injection, the difference in zzso effect being obvious in the 3- and zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved more rapidly with zzso than with zzso infusion of zzso In animals injected with doses of more than zzso zzso of zzso no acute zzso zzso zzso of plasma zzso to zzso of baseline levels was observed in animals given zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso via zzso The residual plasma zzso and zzso zzso 30 zzso after zzso injection was zzso and zzso of the peak levels, zzso zzso administered by zzso zzso injection, was thus confirmed to exert a zzso effect superior to that of zzso injection and infusion of zzso without systemic zzso zzso These results suggest the potential clinical zzso of zzso as a zzso agent that can be administered by zzso zzso injection for acute zzso zzso
