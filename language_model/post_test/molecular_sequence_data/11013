Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was first demonstrated in zzso zzso the zzso zzso has not been found in this zzso Here we report that the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso was demonstrated by screening for its gene with a DNA probe containing zzso sequences of zzso from various zzso The zzso sequence of the gene zzso revealed a zzso open reading frame corresponding to a zzso protein with a high similarity to previously reported zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso gave a high zzso zzso activity, and the zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a zzso with a zzso molecular mass of approximately 44 zzso different from that of zzso zzso zzso zzso previously zzso from zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso showed that the zzso in zzso zzso was localized in zzso but not in zzso Similar levels of zzso zzso and its protein product were detected in cells grown on zzso zzso and zzso although a slight decrease was observed in zzso zzso From these results, zzso was demonstrated to be zzso zzso The properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were proven to be similar, but they were zzso zzso suggesting the presence of another gene responsible for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
