The isolation and zzso of a gene zzso the putative zzso proteins of infectious salmon zzso virus zzso is zzso Following identification of an zzso sequence from a zzso library, zzso was used to identify a zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso containing the zzso consensus sequence zzso at the zzso zzso Although the zzso transcript and its putative protein product did not possess high zzso with other zzso zzso similarity to a zzso fusion zzso and viral cell surface proteins was zzso The size of this transcript suggested that it was derived from segment 7 of the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso Like zzso segments of other zzso this segment was shown to zzso at least two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The existence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso and sequencing, with the zzso transcript being more abundant than the zzso in infected cell cultures, as is found in other zzso zzso sequence comparison of segment 7 of the zzso zzso from zzso of different geographic origin indicated it to be the one of the most variable of the zzso genes zzso to zzso
