Several different zzso and growth factors promote zzso phase zzso zzso zzso the regulatory zzso of several zzso zzso is required for, and capable of zzso the zzso phase of the cell zzso The present study demonstrates that transforming zzso of zzso zzso zzso Ras zzso induce the zzso D1 promoter in human zzso zzso mink lung zzso zzso and in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences at zzso abolished zzso zzso of zzso D1 zzso The zzso sequences were also required for zzso of the zzso D1 promoter by zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso using nuclear extracts from cultured cells and primary zzso several zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound the zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso D1 promoter activity was zzso by zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso through the zzso 22 base zzso zzso of plasmids zzso either dominant negative zzso zzso or dominant zzso of zzso zzso zzso antagonized zzso induction of zzso D1 promoter zzso zzso growth factor induction of zzso D1 transcription, through the zzso promoter region, was antagonized by either zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso functions downstream of zzso growth factor and zzso in the context of the zzso D1 zzso The zzso of zzso D1 zzso by zzso provides evidence for zzso between the zzso and cell cycle regulatory zzso
