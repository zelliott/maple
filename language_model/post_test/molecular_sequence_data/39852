In this study, we describe the characterization of human zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso expressed by zzso cell zzso zzso family of immune zzso zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso library and zzso revealed the gene to be expressed zzso in cells of zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso type I protein composed of a single zzso zzso zzso domain followed by a zzso region containing a positively charged zzso zzso which is a common feature among receptors that associate with zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso was able to associate with zzso protein of 12 zzso zzso and deliver different zzso signals through this zzso zzso zzso for an zzso zzso the zzso zzso tail of zzso contains a zzso motif that, upon zzso zzso became a zzso site for the zzso signaling zzso growth factor zzso protein zzso Moreover, in the absence of zzso zzso was able to activate zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso This activity could be abolished only by mutating both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Our data suggest the existence of an unidentified zzso capable of interacting with zzso through a charged zzso of the zzso region and allowing zzso signaling independent of zzso zzso zzso defines a zzso zzso zzso able to trigger signals by zzso distinct zzso and thus initiating different signaling zzso
