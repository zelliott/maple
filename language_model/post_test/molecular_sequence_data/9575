To detect genetic zzso associated with zzso dominant zzso stationary night zzso zzso in a family from zzso zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples of 14 family zzso Based on 3 genes reported zzso zzso zzso were designed and corresponding zzso containing the zzso sites were amplified with zzso zzso products were zzso and directly zzso
