The zzso drug zzso zzso zzso binds to DNA resulting in a variety of zzso and zzso which are thought to be responsible for the toxicity of the zzso We have used the gel mobility shift zzso to detect proteins which bind to DNA treated in zzso with zzso zzso and have identified two complexes which bind with increased affinity to zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have shown that one complex, zzso contains human zzso DNA binding zzso a protein known to be involved in the in zzso repair synthesis zzso of zzso zzso zzso
