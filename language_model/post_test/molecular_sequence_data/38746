Comparative zzso sequencing was carried out on dengue type 2 virus zzso strains isolated from patients in Northeast Thailand during the epidemic season in zzso The patients exhibited different clinical manifestations ranging from dengue fever zzso to dengue zzso fever zzso shock syndrome zzso The results classified 19 zzso strains into 3 zzso according to zzso zzso acid zzso The strain isolated from a zzso patient zzso secondary zzso response belonged to zzso I, whereas 13 strains isolated from zzso patients with secondary response and 2 strains from zzso patients with primary response belonged to zzso zzso On the other hand, 3 strains isolated from zzso cases evoking either primary or secondary response belonged to zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso III virus infection could result in clinically milder manifestation irrespective of the zzso response compared with zzso I or II zzso The zzso secondary structure predicted for the 3' zzso region showed 4 different structures zzso B, C, and zzso The result also indicates that different zzso of zzso zzso are circulating in a single epidemic in zzso
