The zzso analog zzso zzso zzso is an zzso drug that is used in the treatment of a variety of zzso viruses in zzso patients and in a gene therapy protocol that has shown promising activity for the treatment of zzso To probe the structural effects of zzso when incorporated into DNA, we determined and compared the solution structure of a modified zzso zzso duplex zzso and a control duplex zzso using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both duplexes were assigned using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso distances determined from zzso data and zzso angles determined from zzso data were used in restrained molecular dynamics simulations starting from zzso A- and zzso DNA zzso Both the control and zzso sets of simulations zzso to zzso zzso These structures were subjected to full relaxation zzso refinement to produce final structures that were in excellent agreement with the observed zzso zzso zzso of the final zzso structures reveals that the base of the zzso zzso is hydrogen bonded to its complementary zzso and is stacked in the zzso in fact, the base of zzso exhibits increased stacking with the zzso base relative to the zzso Interestingly, some of the most significant zzso in the structures occur 3' to the zzso site, including a noticeable zzso in the zzso backbone at this zzso Further examination reveals that the backbone zzso sugar zzso and zzso zzso angle of the zzso 3' to the zzso site all indicate an zzso zzso at this zzso A possible correlation of these structural findings with results obtained from earlier zzso studies will be zzso
