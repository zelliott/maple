zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso is implicated in the zzso of a number of clinically different allergic diseases in man, including allergic zzso zzso zzso zzso may offer an alternative treatment strategy for the management of allergic zzso The objective of this study was to alter the zzso immune response using dominant T cell zzso of a major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso as zzso particles zzso The T cell zzso of zzso zzso recognized in mice with an zzso background, were determined by producing zzso zzso Two dominant T cell zzso zzso and zzso were identified and expressed in a zzso zzso zzso To induce tolerance zzso were injected zzso into mice previously zzso with zzso zzso zzso The T cell immune response was zzso totally in 3 weeks following a single injection of zzso but was restored 2 months later following zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion resulted in the reduction of zzso of all zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso peptides expressed in the zzso system can be used successfully in the zzso of zzso zzso immune response in mice, although a single administration is not sufficient to maintain a state of tolerance for a long period of zzso
