An 800 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA was amplified by the zzso chain reaction method using zzso designed from zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso from the zzso zzso and several zzso Although more than one product was zzso only one of them had the expected size and was exclusively amplified in the presence of the left and right zzso The DNA and the deduced protein sequences of the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso to the corresponding sequences in zzso and zzso (about zzso identical zzso and a less evident zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso identical zzso with zzso zzso
