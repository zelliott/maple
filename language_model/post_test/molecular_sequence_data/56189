zzso zzso was raised in rabbits against a synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to a unique zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso gene product zzso The zzso was zzso by affinity zzso A single band with an apparent molecular mass of 60 zzso was recognized when the zzso of zzso of brain and spinal zzso from chick zzso and zzso was zzso with the affinity zzso zzso zzso after zzso gel zzso followed by Western zzso zzso of the zzso was further characterized by zzso zzso of zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies by light zzso revealed that zzso was localized in zzso zzso in zzso cell bodies of the spinal zzso in zzso chick zzso and newly hatched zzso zzso spinal zzso and muscle cells were also zzso at early zzso zzso By electron zzso the reaction product was observed mainly in two zzso One region was at zzso and along the zzso of the rough zzso zzso The other region was along the zzso plasma zzso subsurface zzso and at zzso At zzso the zzso density, zzso membrane and synaptic zzso zzso were zzso zzso at zzso were more frequently observed at earlier stages than at later stages of zzso These findings suggest that zzso is actively produced in developing zzso and has some important roles in zzso In mature zzso zzso may be involved in the interaction of synaptic zzso with the zzso zzso
