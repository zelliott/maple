The group A zzso zzso is an important pathogen that is responsible for a wide range of human zzso zzso binding proteins zzso play an important role in promoting zzso adherence and invasion of host zzso The zzso gene encodes an zzso and is present in approximately zzso of zzso zzso In the present study we examined 51 zzso zzso strains isolated from the Northern zzso of Australia, and here we describe two zzso of zzso which are mutually zzso The two zzso have been identified previously as zzso and zzso We show that these zzso map to the same zzso location within the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that they arose from a common zzso and in this study these zzso were designated the zzso type and the zzso zzso zzso analysis of seven zzso types, 14 zzso types, and 11 zzso zzso strains by zzso gel zzso zzso produced 32 distinct zzso zzso zzso of evolution based on the zzso zzso by zzso suggested that the zzso type had a recent origin compared to the zzso zzso A comparison of multiple DNA sequences of the zzso and zzso types revealed a mosaic pattern for the zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso type is generally zzso at the zzso zzso but varies in the number of zzso binding repeats in the zzso zzso Our data also suggest that there is a possible association of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso while the zzso zzso was found in a majority of the zzso strains negative for zzso zzso indicating that these two zzso zzso may be under different selective zzso
