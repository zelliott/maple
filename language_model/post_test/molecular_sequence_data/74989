The zzso zzso particles containing the zzso zzso small zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed to determine their zzso secondary structures and sites of zzso zzso The secondary structures were zzso with zzso and by chemical modification with zzso zzso and the sites of modification or zzso were mapped by primer zzso These data were used to develop secondary structures for the two zzso and likely sites of close zzso contact were identified by comparing modification patterns for naked zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, sites of interaction between each zzso zzso zzso zzso and the La zzso were identified by analyzing zzso fragments resistant to zzso by zzso A or zzso after zzso by an zzso serum sample from a lupus zzso Our results confirm earlier findings that the La protein binds to the 3' zzso of each zzso zzso functions for the zzso zzso are zzso
