zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors A and B are zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso receptors are coupled to zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso and zzso receptors and zzso response in various zzso In the present studies, we have examined the regulation of zzso zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso and zzso zzso that interacts specifically with zzso zzso in A10 smooth muscle cells zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso for 24 h resulted in a reduction in zzso zzso binding zzso zzso bound to control and zzso cell zzso at a single site with zzso zzso of zzso zzso 6 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner in control zzso A zzso zzso observed was about zzso with an apparent zzso of about 1 zzso however, this zzso was completely attenuated in cells zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso domain of zzso zzso was attenuated by about 50% but was not completely abolished by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was dependent on the concentration and time of zzso of the cells with zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso ( approximately zzso was also abolished by zzso treatment, indicating that the zzso zzso by zzso was zzso In addition, zzso treatment decreased the expression of zzso and zzso proteins by about 40 and zzso respectively, and their zzso by zzso However, the levels of zzso proteins were not altered when the cells were treated for shorter period of time zzso zzso or with lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the levels of zzso but not of zzso were increased by about zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso exerted by zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso were also zzso in cells treated with zzso These results indicate that zzso treatment of A10 cells zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which may be due to the zzso of zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso proteins to which these receptors are zzso
