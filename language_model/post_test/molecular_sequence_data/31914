Small zzso zzso zzso zzso sheep and zzso Diagnosis of zzso infection mostly relies on zzso testing but more recently, also zzso is regarded as a useful complementary tool in zzso zzso The goal of this study was to develop and validate a quantitative zzso capable to detect a broad range of zzso strains from zzso A, including strains circulating in zzso The developed zzso targets a region of the gag gene and showed to be highly sensitive and specific with a limit of detection of 6 DNA and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences could be detected in lung samples and zzso zzso The zzso identified zzso positive animals in Belgian sheep zzso but also zzso zzso and samples from Scotland, The Netherlands, Spain, zzso zzso Iceland, Finland and USA were found zzso zzso known to contain zzso zzso zzso from France and Spain were not identified as zzso Combined zzso and zzso analysis of a limited number zzso of Belgian sheep zzso the usefulness of the described zzso as a complementary diagnostic tool since 3 zzso animals were found positive by the zzso In conclusion, the validated zzso shows excellent zzso characteristics and is capable to detect zzso strains belonging to zzso A from various zzso
