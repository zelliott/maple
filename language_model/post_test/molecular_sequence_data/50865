The secondary structure of zzso zzso is predicted using the zzso and zzso method in conjunction with the zzso index of zzso and zzso The predicted zzso structure was compared with the structure determined by Henderson et zzso zzso using electron zzso and was found to correlate extremely zzso The secondary structure of bovine zzso zzso was then predicted using the same zzso The proposed zzso regions of zzso were then examined and found to have sequence similarity with those zzso regions of zzso
