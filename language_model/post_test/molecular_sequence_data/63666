The effect of light zzso on the amount of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and bundle sheath zzso zzso of zzso species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso and guinea grass zzso zzso type zzso was investigated in plants grown under high, moderate and low light zzso equal to zzso 350 and 50 zzso photons zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso in both M and zzso zzso is altered by light intensity, but differently in the investigated zzso Moreover, we identified two zzso of the zzso zzso called alpha and zzso The zzso zzso was the major zzso and was present in all light conditions, whereas alpha was the minor zzso in low zzso A strong increase in the level of the zzso in zzso zzso and bundle sheath zzso was observed after 50 h of high light zzso The alpha and zzso from investigated zzso species displayed apparent molecular masses of 64 and 67 zzso respectively, on zzso The presence of the zzso of zzso was confirmed in isolated zzso complex, where it was recognized by zzso to the zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is nearly identical to that of zzso Our results indicate that both zzso coexist in M and zzso zzso during plant growth at all zzso We suggest the existence in M and zzso zzso of zzso plants of a zzso regulating the zzso composition in response to light zzso zzso of the alpha zzso may have a protective role under high light stress against over zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso damage of zzso
