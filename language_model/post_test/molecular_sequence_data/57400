Human zzso serum zzso A protein zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of high density zzso 3 zzso We have examined several parameters of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso medium zzso and dual treatment with zzso beta and zzso zzso beta + zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso or zzso beta + zzso caused a dramatic and rapid increase in zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso was first zzso at 3 zzso with peak levels reached by 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by a gradual and homogeneous decrease in the length of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso tail zzso does not apparently affect the intrinsic stability of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso isolated from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells showed that most zzso zzso was associated with small zzso regardless of time zzso suggesting that the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso is constant throughout zzso zzso Moreover, the transit time of zzso protein out of the cell is also constant throughout the time course of zzso These data provide evidence of a paradox with regard to the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso beta + zzso and the relative synthesis of zzso protein and suggest a role for zzso control of zzso zzso during the acute zzso
