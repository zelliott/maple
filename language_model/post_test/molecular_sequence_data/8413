This study has characterized the zzso from the zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso and the effect of the zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso synthesis in these zzso There appeared to be two classes of zzso One, zzso was recognized to have a core protein of 31 zzso an overall molecular mass of zzso zzso and zzso chains of mean size zzso 25 zzso The size of this zzso was increased by both zzso and zzso zzso was increased by zzso and reduced by zzso zzso for zzso was increased at 24 to 72 zzso following zzso zzso In addition, the cells contained a core protein zzso at 96, zzso and 120 zzso and the medium only the bands at 96 and 110 zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso of this zzso was enhanced by zzso This zzso had an overall size of zzso zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso in control cells, but in the presence of zzso a component zzso 250 zzso was zzso zzso for Northern zzso analysis were prepared by zzso chain reaction zzso based on the sequences of human zzso and zzso The zzso probe recognized a zzso zzso band, and the zzso probe recognized a zzso zzso band, on blots prepared from zzso from zzso cells and cultured normal human zzso Both zzso in their intact form zzso to peptides derived from zzso and zzso but the free zzso released by alkaline zzso zzso did not zzso zzso of two zzso appears to be a part of the differentiation process of zzso tumor cells and normal zzso
