zzso protein 4 zzso is a well studied viral toxin zzso by the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso that kills sensitive zzso strains as well as zzso zzso and plant root growth by zzso calcium zzso Numerous small, zzso proteins have been shown to play a critical role in zzso zzso The discovery of six zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso efforts to understand their function and evolutionary zzso Analysis of publicly available zzso sequence identified 31 additional zzso genes from a range of zzso a zzso and the moss zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso analysis indicate that the viral zzso and the moss and zzso zzso genes evolved from a common zzso providing evidence for lateral gene transfer between zzso Six genes of the 37 total genes are predicted to zzso a protein with two, zzso zzso zzso in tandem separated by zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that two independent events led to the zzso zzso genes present in different lineages of the zzso zzso the nature and function of zzso proteins in zzso species like zzso may help to limit plant diseases and increase food safety and food zzso
