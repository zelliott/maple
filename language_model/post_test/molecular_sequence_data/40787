The molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso virus zzso resistance to zzso drugs interfering with viral DNA synthesis reported so far rely on the presence of zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The interpretation of zzso zzso resistance zzso results requires the clear distinction between resistance zzso and natural zzso sequence zzso The objectives of this work were to describe extensively the natural zzso of zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso among zzso and zzso strains and the zzso acid changes potentially associated with zzso resistance to zzso The sequence analysis of the full-length zzso and zzso genes was zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso and 51 zzso and 3 laboratory strains zzso zzso and zzso were studied for natural zzso and 25 clinical zzso exhibiting zzso traits of resistance to zzso were analyzed for drug resistance zzso Our results showed that zzso and DNA zzso are highly zzso among zzso zzso with a weaker zzso for zzso zzso This study provided a precise map of the natural zzso of both viral zzso among zzso and zzso zzso with the identification of 15 and 51 zzso never previously described for zzso and DNA zzso respectively, which will facilitate the interpretation of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso characterization of 25 drug-resistant zzso zzso revealed 8 new zzso acid changes located in zzso and potentially accounting for zzso zzso zzso
