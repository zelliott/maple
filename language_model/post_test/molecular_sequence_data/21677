zzso zzso proteins are involved in cellular processes including trafficking, degradation, and zzso They contain a zzso membrane anchor and are zzso delivered to the zzso zzso zzso membrane by the zzso zzso zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso We have determined crystal structures of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in different functional states at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The structural data, together with zzso experiments, show that zzso and zzso use zzso partially overlapping binding sites and that both can bind simultaneously to zzso zzso to the zzso complex allows for zzso changes in zzso that are required for zzso protein zzso These data suggest a molecular mechanism for zzso delivery of zzso zzso
