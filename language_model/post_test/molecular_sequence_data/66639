The zzso cells missing regulatory gene of zzso zzso zzso was proposed earlier to be the zzso target of zzso zzso signaling required for zzso of the zzso precursors of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso results in larvae without zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso a dominant negative form of zzso of zzso zzso results in reduced levels of zzso zzso disruption of zzso founder cell zzso and failure to produce zzso zzso These results confirm that this gene is required for zzso cell zzso Three zzso zzso of the zzso gene were identified, which when incorporated in a zzso expression construct zzso the early expression pattern of this zzso zzso expression of this zzso expression construct is severely disrupted by zzso of zzso zzso confirming that zzso is a direct target of zzso N signaling zzso through zzso zzso zzso analysis by zzso of consensus zzso sites identified a zzso motif zzso and a lone site in the middle module that function both to drive expression in zzso precursors which receive the Delta signal and to repress expression in zzso locations which lack this zzso While these zzso target sites provide the zzso architecture with the core of an N signaling zzso response switch, both the on and off zzso from this module require additional zzso
