zzso of dormant wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1-3 days with zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso induced activity of the plant defense zzso zzso zzso zzso Both extracts and zzso obtained from zzso zzso had decreased abundance of an zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased abundance of zzso zzso ranging from zzso to 14 zzso as compared to extracts and zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso incubated for 2 days with zzso also had zzso and zzso more total zzso zzso zzso and specific activity, zzso zzso of zzso proteins by zzso zzso associated the majority of zzso activity with an zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso and zzso 25, and 24 zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences obtained from zzso liquid zzso mass zzso analyses indicated that the zzso and 36 zzso wild zzso proteins had a strong similarity to wheat zzso However, the 25 and 24 zzso proteins were most similar to a zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in wild zzso zzso likely involves a zzso mechanism allowing activated zzso to be readily mobilized into their surrounding zzso
