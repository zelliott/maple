zzso are zzso members of the zzso zzso and were initially characterized based on their abilities to stimulate zzso synthesis and zzso by zzso cells of the anterior zzso zzso Here, we identified the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso type I zzso zzso as an zzso gene in immortalized zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to the more active zzso and zzso A zzso an increase in this zzso activity in these zzso We demonstrated that zzso signaled via the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso signaling zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso Critical zzso including a minimal zzso element, were mapped to within 100 zzso of the start of zzso zzso signaling also regulated zzso zzso in both immortalized and primary cultured zzso zzso zzso The promoter regions zzso zzso and zzso promoter activity were generally zzso across the different cell zzso The data show that zzso A rapidly regulates zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells and may thereby regulate local zzso zzso
