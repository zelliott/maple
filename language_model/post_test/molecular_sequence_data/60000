zzso The effect of partial zzso on the expression of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso fall into two distinct classes based on zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso rat zzso and in the partially zzso zzso rat at various times after zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso specific for individual zzso zzso was used to monitor zzso zzso zzso zzso In general, zzso zzso underwent a decrease in expression after zzso and the magnitude of decrease was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso The decrease in zzso zzso expression was resolved and even induced zzso in the female zzso by zzso days after zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso were significantly decreased by zzso h after zzso in the male zzso The other zzso zzso zzso and zzso tended to decrease in the male rat after zzso but the decreases were not statistically zzso zzso of zzso zzso was decreased in the female rat zzso at 24 zzso and fully recovered by 10 zzso zzso zzso tended to decrease after zzso however, the decrease was not statistically zzso zzso 60 zzso was decreased from 24 to 96 h after zzso zzso Thus, during the period of rapid liver growth that occurs after partial zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso The phenomenon of decreased zzso zzso expression is similar to other states of rapid liver growth zzso cancer tissue and young zzso in which expression of zzso zzso is characteristically zzso
