Due in part to its small zzso zzso 350 zzso zzso zzso is emerging as a model system for temperate zzso including important crops like wheat and zzso We present the analysis of zzso of the zzso zzso based on zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso end sequences zzso Analysis of repeat DNA content in zzso revealed that approximately zzso of the zzso consists of known repetitive zzso The vast majority of the zzso repetitive elements are zzso zzso While zzso zzso are common to wheat and zzso zzso repetitive element zzso zzso closely related to zzso is also abundant in zzso Moreover, unique zzso repetitive element sequences identified constitute approximately zzso of its zzso zzso sequence repeats from zzso were zzso and zzso primer sequences for zzso detection potentially useful for genetic mapping are available at zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso indicated that approximately zzso of the zzso zzso represents coding zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso have more significant matches to zzso from wheat than rice or zzso although these species have similar sizes of zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on 335 sequences shared among seven grass species further revealed a closer relationship between zzso and zzso than zzso and rice or zzso
