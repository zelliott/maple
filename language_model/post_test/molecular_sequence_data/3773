A new zzso chain reaction zzso method for the identification of zzso zzso strains from zzso or zzso zzso milk and milk products and from other zzso sources and zzso including the dairy zzso 

Two strains from raw milk and feed concentrate could be allocated to zzso zzso based on zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso Two specific zzso zzso were derived from the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso 

The zzso identification method was validated using a collection of zzso zzso strains from different sources and on a large collection of dairy and zzso zzso zzso and other relevant zzso 

This zzso method was used as a screening method for strains with very zzso zzso isolated at the dairy farm level after heat treatment for 30 zzso at 100 degrees zzso zzso strains isolated at the dairy farm were identified as zzso zzso They originated mainly from feed concentrate and also from zzso pulp and zzso The zzso identification method described here can, therefore, contribute to a better understanding of the route by which zzso zzso contaminates raw and/or heat-treated zzso
