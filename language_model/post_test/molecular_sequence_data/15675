The zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso complex that degrades a wide range of zzso zzso especially those modified with zzso zzso zzso and other plants use pairs of genes to zzso most of the core zzso with both of the zzso often incorporated into the mature zzso Here, we show that the gene pair zzso the regulatory particle zzso zzso zzso has a unique role in zzso function and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be generated due to a zzso in male zzso While single zzso zzso appear zzso single zzso zzso display a host of zzso zzso including abnormal zzso partially zzso development in the dark, a severely dwarfed zzso when grown in the light, and zzso zzso complexes missing zzso are less stable in zzso suggesting that some of the zzso defects are caused by altered complex zzso The zzso zzso could be rescued by expression of either zzso or zzso indicating functional zzso However, abnormal zzso generated by zzso implied that zzso functions also zzso zzso the data point to a specific role for zzso in the plant zzso zzso and suggest that its two zzso genes in zzso have both redundant and unique roles in zzso
