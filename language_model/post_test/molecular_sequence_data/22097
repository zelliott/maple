zzso zzso is extremely resistant to the effects of zzso zzso The source of the radiation resistance is not known, but an expansion of specific protein families related to stress response and damage control has been zzso DNA repair zzso are among the expanded protein families in zzso zzso and genes zzso five different zzso zzso are identified in the zzso Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso possesses a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso has a modified and broadened zzso specificity compared with zzso coli zzso The importance of zzso for activity was confirmed by structural analysis and abolished activity for the zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess genes that zzso zzso with the highest sequence identity to zzso among all of the bacterial zzso zzso A zzso analysis indicates that these three zzso form a new zzso zzso zzso here called the zzso zzso We suggest that the novel zzso zzso zzso has evolved to provide zzso with broad zzso specificity to increase the DNA repair repertoire of zzso zzso
