A zzso zzso DNA segment, previously cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1981) zzso 71, zzso contained several open reading frames including one zzso a zzso zzso In this work, the zzso initiation site of the zzso zzso was mapped and part of the gene was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion zzso A synthetic zzso whose sequence is included in the fusion zzso was zzso zzso against both the fusion protein and the zzso reacted with a zzso protein in a zzso zzso total protein zzso zzso characteristics of this protein and its zzso into the zzso phase indicated that zzso which shares limited sequence similarity with the zzso of zzso zzso and the attachment protein of zzso zzso is an integral membrane zzso
