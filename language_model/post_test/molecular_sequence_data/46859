zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is mainly zzso as the corresponding zzso of 94 zzso acid zzso In this study, we show that the originally isolated zzso zzso representing the zzso part of the zzso is released from the zzso by zzso of an zzso zzso bond under conditions applied during the isolation zzso Thus, the zzso zzso is probably a zzso chemically induced zzso zzso This zzso zzso contains two zzso bonds that are absolutely necessary for zzso zzso We demonstrate that the folding of the reduced zzso zzso results almost completely in the formation of the two inactive zzso zzso In contrast, the reduced form of zzso containing the entire zzso folds to a product with the native zzso zzso Because zzso lacking the 31 zzso zzso of the zzso folds only to a minor extent to zzso with the native zzso bonds, it is evident that this zzso region contributes significantly to the correct zzso zzso zzso studies using CD and zzso zzso show that native zzso contains a considerable amount of zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso structural zzso In addition, a close proximity of the zzso and the zzso regions was found by zzso It appears that this interaction is important for the constitution of the correct zzso and provides an explanation of the minor zzso zzso activity of zzso by shielding the zzso zzso domain from the zzso
