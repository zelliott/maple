zzso zzso spot zzso zzso is a significant pathogen of zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes six proteins that are involved in zzso zzso movement, zzso insect transmission and zzso To gain insight into the associations of these viral zzso we determined their zzso zzso and interactions in living plant zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of a Kentucky isolate of zzso were amplified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed as zzso with zzso proteins in leaf zzso cells of zzso zzso All proteins accumulated at the cell periphery and zzso with an zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein fusion also localized to the zzso N and zzso protein zzso and an zzso interaction were observed by using zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso interaction had not been reported zzso
