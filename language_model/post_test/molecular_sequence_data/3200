zzso 1, a human zzso zzso zzso was originally identified through its interaction with zzso a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso in zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso in human cancer zzso In addition to its zzso zzso zzso 1 resides at multiple zzso sites, suggesting additional functions for this zzso Here we identify zzso a novel zzso zzso protein of 182 zzso zzso displays a complex pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus in a zzso zzso pattern and to the zzso where it zzso with the cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso 1 from human cells and serves as an zzso of zzso by zzso 1 in zzso Like zzso zzso binds to the zzso domain zzso 24 zzso zzso of zzso zzso Surprisingly, dissection of this domain reveals multiple discrete and overlapping binding sites for zzso and zzso Thus, we demonstrate five well zzso zzso repeat clusters in zzso zzso Although each of the five zzso repeat clusters independently binds to zzso only three of the five bind zzso These findings suggest that zzso 1 may act as a scaffold for large molecular mass complexes made up of multiple binding zzso We discuss potential roles for zzso zzso higher order complexes at zzso and at other zzso zzso
