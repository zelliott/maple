In this study, we have identified and characterized a new protein present in human high density zzso that we have designated zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso and high resolution two-dimensional gel zzso zzso L was identified and partially zzso from zzso high density zzso zzso zzso was only detected in the zzso The zzso sequence zzso the full-length protein was cloned using reverse zzso chain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains zzso zzso including a typical signal zzso of 12 zzso zzso No significant zzso was found with known zzso The plasma protein is a single chain zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 42 zzso zzso raised against this protein detected a truncated form with a molecular mass of 39 zzso Both forms were predominantly associated with zzso zzso zzso and detected mainly in the density range zzso zzso d zzso zzso zzso Free zzso was not detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to purify zzso zzso zzso directly from zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso showed two major molecular species with apparent diameters of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exhibited both zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also detected in the zzso zzso zzso
