We developed a computer program, zzso which predicts the most probable translation initiation site for a given zzso zzso The program requires that information be extracted from the zzso sequence data surrounding the translation initiation sites according to the framework of the Hidden zzso zzso Since the translation initiation sites of 72 highly abundant proteins have already been assigned on the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso analysis, we extracted necessary information for zzso from the zzso sequence zzso The prediction rate of the zzso for these proteins was estimated to be zzso We then used zzso for prediction of the translation initiation sites of 24 other zzso of which the initiation sites were not assigned zzso because of the lack of a potential initiation zzso at the zzso zzso For 20 out of the 24 zzso the initiation sites were predicted in the upstream of their zzso zzso According to this assignment, the processed regions represent a typical feature of signal zzso We could also predict multiple translation initiation sites for a particular gene for which at least two initiation sites were zzso zzso This program would be effective for the prediction of translation initiation sites of other zzso not only in this species but also in other zzso as zzso
