The principles of influenza A virus replication and packaging are not fully zzso In order to investigate the signals required for these processes we have introduced zzso in the terminal zzso region of an influenza A virus zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we have obtained two zzso zzso and zzso which produced a reduced amount of zzso zzso zzso in infected cells but not in the viral zzso These data indicate that zzso specific signals which affect the amount of zzso in the viral particle are distinct from those required for viral replication and zzso the amount of packaged zzso is not strictly dependent on the amount of zzso produced during zzso In addition, zzso zzso was shown to be effectively attenuated in zzso Thus, diminished replication of one viral segment might be a principle on which to base a live influenza virus zzso
