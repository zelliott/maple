zzso and zzso are members of the zzso family of zzso zzso exchange factors zzso for the zzso family of zzso binding zzso zzso is expressed primarily in zzso cells, while zzso has a wider tissue zzso The zzso structure of the human zzso zzso was studied by identifying and sequencing all 27 zzso of the gene from overlapping zzso and zzso zzso The gene spans a zzso region on zzso zzso In contrast, the coding region of zzso is distributed over 30 zzso spanning zzso The overall organization of the zzso which zzso both proteins was found to be zzso In humans, alternative zzso of zzso 6, 16 and 28 generated at least two distinct zzso zzso zzso Several differences from the original zzso zzso sequence were zzso The most important difference was the identification of zzso acid zzso as zzso rather than zzso This change warrants the zzso of the zzso zzso domain as a type 3 zzso instead of a type 2 zzso as originally proposed by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso A series of zzso promoter deletions were constructed using the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso as a reporter zzso A zzso segment that included a potential zzso binding site was found to be essential for zzso expression in zzso zzso The same zzso were not active in zzso cells, which do not express zzso A potential zzso DNA binding site within the zzso promoter was not required for zzso zzso
