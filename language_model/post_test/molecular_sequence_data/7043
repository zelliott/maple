The possible involvement of zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso in zzso zzso signal zzso was investigated in mouse zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso Q column zzso zzso obtained from 105,000 g zzso and particulate zzso of zzso cells was performed using zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in low salt range corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as high salt range corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected as a zzso protein of zzso and zzso zzso in 105,000 g zzso but as a zzso zzso protein in particulate zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso specific zzso possessed zzso zzso protein zzso activity, but neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso were further activated by 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso indicating that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso Treatment of intact zzso cells with zzso or other zzso zzso caused the apparent shift of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso from in particulate zzso zzso treatment of the cells with zzso induced the zzso of both forms of zzso zzso in particulate zzso Under the same condition, zzso zzso in 105,000 g zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso did not respond to zzso This apparent shift was zzso and the content ratio of zzso to 75,000 zzso zzso zzso was decreased by acid zzso treatment, indicating that the apparent shift results at least in part from zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Total activity of zzso zzso was increased in association with the apparent shift from the zzso to zzso zzso form in response to zzso treatment of intact zzso zzso All of these results indicate that zzso zzso is present as multiple forms in mouse zzso cells, and that especially zzso zzso in particulate zzso play a significant zzso in zzso signal zzso in mouse zzso zzso
