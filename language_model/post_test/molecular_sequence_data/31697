A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from zzso sand around a seaweed farm on the South Sea, South Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 30 zzso at pH zzso and in the presence of 2 % zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso trees based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso clustered with the type strains of zzso species and zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso G, zzso and zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids detected in strain zzso were zzso and one unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data and other zzso properties revealed that strain zzso represents a novel zzso and species within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
