zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant zzso disease which has been shown to be caused by an unstable zzso repeat located on zzso zzso We have conducted extensive zzso analysis on 105 zzso zzso using twelve zzso zzso identifying 18 zzso spanning a physical distance of zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso Three major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in our population, were zzso With the exception of zzso and zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso the remainder of the zzso zzso analyzed were found to have unique zzso zzso zzso and zzso observed exclusively on zzso zzso of zzso origin contain identical zzso core zzso The low frequency of this core zzso in normal zzso zzso is consistent with a mapping of the zzso gene within this zzso However, the zzso zzso is found 160 zzso zzso to the point of divergence between the two zzso In contrast, the zzso region shared by zzso zzso and zzso contains the zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso region using a zzso zzso zzso zzso located 15 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso revealed strong zzso association of one of the zzso repeat zzso to zzso zzso 5 was observed on zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of normal zzso The fact that the zzso zzso 5 was found on all 56 zzso zzso containing the three major zzso indicates that zzso zzso in our population, including the two zzso zzso which have a common region outside the zzso zzso are probably derived from the same zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
