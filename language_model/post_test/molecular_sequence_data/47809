The zzso structure of T cell zzso recognizing a tumor zzso zzso has been studied using reverse zzso and gene zzso The zzso had been raised against a zzso zzso consisting of the mouse zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso in position 72 with zzso The zzso zzso varied widely in their use of zzso genes although zzso was zzso being present in one third of zzso The zzso gene usage was more restricted and dominated by zzso and zzso There was no correlation between zzso and zzso usage and zzso fine specificity of the zzso The overall zzso acid composition of the zzso region zzso 3 of the zzso was dominated by small polar zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ala, zzso acids reported in the literature to be frequent in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of most zzso also contained an aromatic zzso with preference for zzso A few of the zzso raised against the zzso zzso were zzso specific, zzso zzso they responded to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid usage of their zzso regions was not radically different from that of the zzso specific zzso They also zzso used zzso However, zzso and zzso were the dominating beta zzso
