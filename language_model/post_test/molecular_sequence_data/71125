zzso zzso pumps have been implicated in zzso strains of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Most zzso pumps of clinical relevance have three zzso an inner membrane zzso an outer membrane channel zzso and a zzso zzso which together coordinate zzso from the zzso membrane across the outer membrane through an unknown zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso and outer membrane zzso proteins zzso are not obviously related to proteins of known structure, and understanding the structure and function of these proteins has been hindered by the difficulty of obtaining reasonable multiple zzso We present a general strategy for the alignment and structure prediction of protein families with low mutual sequence similarity using the zzso and zzso families as detailed zzso Gibbs zzso hidden zzso models, and other analysis techniques were used to locate zzso generate multiple zzso and assign zzso or zzso function to hypothetical proteins in several zzso We also developed an automated procedure which combines multiple alignments with structure prediction zzso in order to identify zzso structural features in protein zzso This process was used to identify a probable zzso hairpin in the zzso family and was applied to the detection of zzso zzso in zzso We also show that all zzso contain a large tandem duplication, and demonstrate that the zzso family is unlikely to adopt a zzso fold, in contrast to previous zzso
