Cell wall proteins of zzso zzso are anchored by means of a zzso zzso zzso It is not known whether this chain is linked to the protein part zzso through zzso zzso or to the zzso zzso zzso of cell wall zzso An zzso zzso recognition site was introduced in zzso a zzso zzso cell wall zzso immediately zzso from the omega zzso acid (the attachment site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this site revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was not linked to the protein zzso We conclude that neither zzso zzso is involved in zzso of cell wall zzso This confirms that the zzso core of the zzso zzso is the probable zzso zzso attachment zzso
