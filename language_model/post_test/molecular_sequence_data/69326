The zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso are distributed between the zzso and zzso gene 4 zzso The zzso protein zzso both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene 4 protein lacks the 63 zzso acids at the N zzso of the zzso zzso protein and zzso only zzso zzso zzso activity is dependent on the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals a single zzso zzso zzso binding site near the center of each gene 4 zzso We have examined the essential role of zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso by using zzso zzso to alter the zzso adjacent zzso and zzso zzso within this zzso binding zzso The zzso gene 4 zzso expressed from plasmids carrying the cloned zzso do not complement a zzso zzso lacking gene zzso Moreover, the zzso are zzso they block productive infection by zzso zzso zzso A zzso binding site zzso zzso gene 4 zzso zzso to zzso from cells zzso the zzso binds but lacks the ability to zzso zzso and cannot bind to zzso zzso zzso this zzso gene 4 protein also lacks zzso zzso The zzso gene 4 proteins inhibit the zzso zzso activity of zzso gene 4 proteins in a zzso zzso The apparent zzso constant zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso of this interaction may reflect the gene 4 zzso zzso constant in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso reaction indicates that this is a linear zzso zzso indicating that the zzso protein binds the zzso protein to form an inactive complex on zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso gene 4 protein has the same affinity for both the zzso zzso and zzso gene 4 zzso suggesting that there is no preference for the formation of zzso zzso The ability of the zzso proteins to inhibit the activity of the zzso gene 4 proteins indicates that zzso zzso is coordinated and cooperative among the members of the gene 4 protein complex as it binds and zzso on zzso zzso
