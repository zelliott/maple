zzso of the zzso zzso gene is the ultimate cause of Hunter zzso zzso of the nature of zzso will create a necessary premise for prenatal gene zzso A zzso zzso type II patient and his parents from an ethnic minority in Yunnan province were studied to identify their possible zzso in zzso gene to establish the basis for prenatal gene zzso 

The patient was a boy, 6 years and 10 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for preliminary diagnosis of the patient and his parents with the zzso The three related zzso DNA was extracted and the concentration and purity of the DNA were measured after the urine test results confirmed the zzso zzso chain zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso analysis was performed to detect the position of the zzso around the hot spots of zzso in zzso 9, 3, 8 of the zzso zzso DNA zzso direct sequencing was applied to analyze the zzso detected by zzso 

The results of zzso test showed that in the child with zzso zzso zzso zzso was positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were negative zzso while in his parents none of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso in zzso 9 of zzso gene shown by zzso were found in the zzso His mother had zzso zzso A new zzso zzso in zzso 9 of zzso gene of this patient was confirmed by DNA zzso The position where zzso occurred was inside zzso 407 zzso that means two zzso deleted at position zzso base pair zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso caused a new zzso It caused zzso of the zzso acid chain to a terminal zzso zzso at position zzso Thus the zzso chain was shortened from 550 to zzso zzso zzso The patient is a zzso of the zzso and his mother is a zzso 

A new zzso zzso on the zzso gene was identified in this zzso The patient is a zzso and his mother is a zzso The zzso zzso resulted in loss of 122 zzso zzso which probably caused seriously decreased zzso activity of zzso and the authors speculate that this zzso may be the pathological basis of the zzso So, if the mother becomes pregnant again, a prenatal gene diagnostic test for the same zzso should be zzso Furthermore, zzso followed by DNA sequencing are effective methods for diagnosis, including prenatal diagnosis of zzso zzso
