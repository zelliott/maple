The zzso zzso two distinct growth hormone receptors zzso were zzso cloned and zzso from the liver of zzso grouper zzso zzso The zzso of grouper zzso consisted of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso of grouper zzso consisted of zzso and zzso 577 zzso zzso The two zzso shared zzso identity in zzso sequence and zzso identity in deduced zzso acid zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated a single zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso in liver and a single zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso in the liver and zzso In the zzso zzso zzso grouper zzso and zzso were expressed in all zzso zzso The expression of zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso in zzso zzso zzso heart and white muscle, whereas the expression of zzso was significantly higher in zzso These results indicated that there were two types of zzso existing in zzso zzso and they had different structural features and zzso expression zzso However, the functional differences between zzso and zzso in zzso grouper remained further zzso
