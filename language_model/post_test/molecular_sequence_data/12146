The gene responsible for zzso zzso zzso group A has recently been cloned and designated zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that most Japanese zzso patients have zzso zzso for the zzso site of zzso 3 of the zzso zzso which was recognized by restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso found to date have been the nonsense zzso at zzso zzso in zzso 6, recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and at zzso 116 in zzso 3, recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso chain reaction restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis, we examined the point zzso of the zzso gene in 16 zzso patients, their parents, and their four zzso zzso We found that eight patients were zzso for the zzso zzso two were compound zzso for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso one was a compound zzso for the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso three were compound zzso for the zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso and two were compound zzso for the zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso Investigation of their clinical features suggested that the four patients who were zzso for the zzso zzso and the zzso or an unidentified zzso had milder clinical manifestations such as later development of skin zzso and milder neurological zzso than those patients who were either zzso for the zzso zzso or zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
