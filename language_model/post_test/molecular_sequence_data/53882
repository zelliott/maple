The zzso gene zzso on the zzso of zzso which is a temperate zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso (formerly zzso as zzso and the four attachment sites on the zzso of the zzso and its host were characterized by zzso The zzso zzso was found to belong to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The attachment sites shared a zzso common core within which an zzso zzso zzso zzso The common core was flanked on one side by an additional segment of high sequence zzso An integration zzso consisting of zzso the zzso attachment site zzso and a zzso marker, inserted zzso into the bacterial attachment site zzso within the common core, as did the complete zzso zzso at a frequency of more than zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was used as a test system for a preliminary zzso analysis of zzso and zzso The zzso common core was located within and near the end of an open reading frame that appears to zzso a zzso to zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso It is unlikely that the zzso integration zzso this zzso since a change of only the zzso zzso acid is predicted because of the sequence similarity between zzso and zzso
