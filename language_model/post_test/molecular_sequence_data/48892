zzso zzso Acquisition through Smart zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso platform that employs high resolution liquid zzso zzso zzso techniques to identify zzso hormones zzso from in zzso or ex zzso cultures enriched in zzso zzso Application of the methodology to the study of zzso pancreatic zzso has permitted evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, as well as comparison of our results with published zzso studies that employed traditional cellular zzso zzso We found that, while our zzso approach identified fewer peptides in total, we had greater representation of intact zzso zzso The technique was further refined to improve coverage of zzso as well as zzso peptides and subsequently applied to human pancreatic zzso cultures derived from normal donors or donors with type 2 zzso Interestingly, in addition to the expected zzso hormones, we identified zzso zzso zzso consistent with recent reports of zzso effects of this hormone on zzso zzso We also identified many novel peptides derived from zzso precursors and proteins related to the cell zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest the zzso strategy of focusing on cellular zzso products rather than the total tissue zzso may improve the probability of discovering novel zzso peptides and also has the potential to offer important new insights into the zzso and function of known zzso
