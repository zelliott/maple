zzso that exhibit zzso to zzso have been isolated and classified as zzso zzso in zzso zzso We cloned the zzso zzso which has been identified as a zzso of the zzso zzso and found a double point zzso altering two consecutive zzso acids zzso in the zzso region of the zzso B zzso The zzso B zzso was found to associate with the A zzso to make the zzso structure, and the zzso zzso showed an zzso reduction of specific activity in DNA zzso zzso the sensitivity to zzso was not different in the same unit of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso retained intrinsic zzso activity, but zzso stimulation was observed zzso A gel shift zzso showed that zzso inhibited the DNA binding of zzso The zzso zzso also reduced significantly the DNA binding of zzso but did not change the sensitivity to zzso These results revealed that the zzso zzso is related to the zzso mechanism of zzso and the zzso sensitivity of the zzso at least in zzso is caused mainly by reduction of the zzso zzso Further, our findings suggest that the zzso region of the B zzso is essential for the initial binding of zzso to the zzso zzso
