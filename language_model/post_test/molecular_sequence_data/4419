A cluster of genes involved in the production of zzso a zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso contains eight zzso through zzso zzso groups zzso zzso Zhang, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, sequencing of the region encompassing the zzso locus revealed six putative open reading frames zzso each preceded by a putative zzso binding site, and all oriented in the same zzso zzso zzso chain reaction suggested that the zzso locus is transcribed as one large zzso zzso transcript, indicating that the zzso constitute an zzso zzso extension analysis showed that the transcript begins at a zzso located 31 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the sequences of the putative zzso with the sequences of known genes revealed that zzso zzso a protein containing 395 zzso zzso has zzso similarity to the zzso zzso gene from zzso coli, and the zzso zzso genes from other zzso A zzso zzso that is a binding site for zzso zzso and an zzso zzso that is a binding site for the zzso group of the zzso are zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso encodes a protein involved in the zzso of zzso a constituent of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso possesses a zzso motif at the zzso end that is characteristic of the zzso family of zzso factors, and there is a possible zzso zzso at the zzso end of this zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso has about zzso similarity with the fatty acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and considerable similarity with fatty acid zzso genes from other zzso zzso and zzso show very similar zzso profiles and both contain a copper binding zzso Computer searches did not discover significant zzso in the data base for the other zzso but zzso analysis showed that all of them contain one to several zzso zzso suggesting that the gene products of these zzso may be membrane zzso
