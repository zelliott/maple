We have identified a total of 4 sequences coding for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Individual rabbits each yielded three different zzso zzso zzso or three zzso segments containing zzso 1 of the zzso zzso representing either three genes or zzso zzso of two zzso The three sequences were found in differing proportions in zzso zzso depending on the position along the small zzso from which the zzso was zzso If all these zzso are zzso zzso mechanisms previously implicated in the regulation of zzso in the rabbit will be acting on different zzso species in different parts of the zzso However, we find no evidence for more than one zzso gene in the zzso and have previously shown that humans have only one zzso zzso
