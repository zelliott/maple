The possible relationship between essential mixed zzso zzso and zzso C virus zzso has been investigated in eight patients with type II zzso and zzso signs of liver damage, whose serum tested positive in the zzso for zzso zzso were tested using the 2nd generation zzso zzso while serum zzso was measured zzso by a zzso in whole serum, zzso and zzso In all patients a zzso liver biopsy and a bone zzso biopsy were zzso At liver zzso chronic active zzso and/or zzso were present in 6 zzso in the remaining two, a zzso zzso of elements positive for zzso light chains was zzso In all patients a bone zzso biopsy showed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso elements similar to those found in the liver of the two patients described zzso zzso against structural and zzso zzso proteins were zzso in the serum of all zzso zzso was amplified from the whole zzso zzso and zzso significantly higher zzso were found in zzso than in zzso Our results confirm the high prevalence of zzso infection and ongoing viral replication in patients with type II zzso and suggest the possible implication of zzso in zzso zzso
