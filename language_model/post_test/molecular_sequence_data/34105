zzso zzso malaria is the most important zzso disease worldwide, responsible for an estimated 1 million deaths zzso Two zzso zzso genes code for putative zzso zzso zzso a widespread protein group characterized by the involvement of zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the zzso between 2 and zzso an intermediate step in the zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structures of one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a functionally distinct zzso zzso from zzso zzso a related zzso zzso We performed sequence and structural comparisons between the two structures, another zzso zzso zzso zzso and several other zzso family members from other zzso The comparisons revealed a distinct zzso of the zzso active zzso not seen in previously determined zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, characterization of their zzso activities revealed contrasting behaviors between the zzso and the classical zzso zzso from zzso zzso clearly establishing zzso as a zzso with a residual level of zzso zzso Further support for this function attribution was provided by our structural comparison with previously characterized zzso family zzso zzso characterization of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the protein might be essential to blood stage asexual growth, and a zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both blood and zzso zzso development and located in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso is either an zzso implicated in the zzso metabolism of the zzso or a regulator of its life zzso
