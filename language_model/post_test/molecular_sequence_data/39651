Active zzso transport of protein and zzso in zzso depends on the zzso system to regulate zzso zzso Several zzso including the zzso zzso zzso factors that alter nuclear transport with the aim of suppressing synthesis of zzso factors and promoting viral zzso zzso in the zzso zzso express a unique zzso Leader protein zzso known to alter the zzso distribution of zzso regulatory proteins targeted to the zzso We report here that L binds directly to Ran and blocks nuclear export of new zzso In zzso egg zzso zzso L also zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso function crucial to zzso zzso We propose that L zzso zzso transport during infection by zzso the zzso zzso This zzso triggers an zzso of nuclear proteins necessary for viral replication and causes zzso zzso To our knowledge, L is the first viral zzso protein to interact directly with Ran and zzso the zzso zzso zzso
