zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were isolated from the wild type and zzso zzso of soybean zzso zzso Two soybean zzso of zzso designated zzso and zzso are similar in zzso No zzso zzso in zzso and zzso between the wild type and zzso were zzso zzso was mapped at zzso 1 zzso from a restriction zzso length zzso marker on the linkage group H of the soybean molecular zzso DNA zzso using bacterial artificial zzso clones identified two zzso indicating there are two zzso for zzso in the soybean zzso One locus contains zzso and the other locus contains zzso and zzso Relative multiplex quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction analysis indicates that the two genes are transcribed in all zzso and at higher levels in floral zzso zzso expression patterns of the two genes suggest that the function of the two genes is slightly different in different zzso
