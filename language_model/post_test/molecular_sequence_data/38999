In Europe zzso zzso remains high and in some parts the disease is likely to be still endemic due to insufficient zzso zzso experienced an outbreak with at least 110 cases in 1996, and cases continued to be reported throughout zzso We used molecular epidemiology to investigate this apparent zzso On the basis of their N gene zzso the zzso were assigned to the typical European C2 and zzso zzso zzso diversity within the outbreak was zzso The zzso distance between the zzso of the outbreak and the other C2 zzso was at least three or four times higher, suggesting an independent origin of the latter zzso Similarly, the four zzso viruses found in zzso were thought to be of at least two or three zzso Thus, we propose here to use zzso sequence diversity to differentiate between sporadic endemic cases and a zzso of multiple unrelated imported zzso
