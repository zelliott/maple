The zzso zzso of Man alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso coupled via a zzso reaction to bovine serum zzso and the resulting zzso was used to zzso two zzso The zzso zzso were tested for zzso with a number of related zzso zzso and zzso to determine the zzso portion of this zzso Two populations of zzso resulted, one of which required the reducing end zzso and could react with either an zzso or a zzso as the penultimate zzso The other population reacted with the Man alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso and its zzso play an important role in determining the specificity of zzso to this synthetic zzso The similarity of this zzso to the zzso of zzso binding zzso is zzso
