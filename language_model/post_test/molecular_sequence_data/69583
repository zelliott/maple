X-ray crystal structures have been determined for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and both component zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso The primary zzso zzso located in the zzso binding pocket, greatly reduces zzso activity as compared to the zzso zzso The additional zzso zzso which partially restores zzso activity, is located on the surface of the zzso well outside of the zzso center and approximately 15 A from zzso zzso zzso of kinetic data for the zzso zzso zzso specifically constructed as a control, and for the zzso zzso indicates that the effects of the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso are zzso This result suggests that the zzso zzso might mediate its effects through a structural zzso zzso along the zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism by which the zzso substitution zzso the zzso activity of zzso we have determined the structure of the zzso double zzso We also present a zzso structure for the original zzso zzso and a preliminary structural interpretation for the zzso zzso zzso We find that while either single zzso shows little more than a simple zzso zzso the double zzso zzso an extended structural zzso which is zzso between these two widely separated sites via the zzso alpha zzso
