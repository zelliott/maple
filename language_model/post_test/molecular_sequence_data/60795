zzso we report the identification and characterization of two DNA zzso zzso factors from the zzso zzso zzso zzso They, referred to as zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 27 zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 27 zzso present significant primary structure similarity to zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso We demonstrate that both zzso and zzso form zzso in solution and are able to substantially activate the synthetic activity of the zzso family B DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA pol zzso on zzso as a zzso This zzso effect is the result of enhanced DNA zzso zzso as indicated by the analysis of the zzso products on zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA pol B1 synthetic activity was also observed on linear primed zzso zzso zzso DNA as a zzso By zzso analysis using specific rabbit zzso zzso and zzso were both detected in the zzso and stationary zzso of zzso zzso growth zzso This is the first report of the identification and zzso characterization of two distinct DNA zzso zzso factors from the same zzso The significance of these findings for the understanding of the DNA replication process in zzso is zzso
