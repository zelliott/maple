In this study, 197 strains of zzso zzso from different species and origins were evaluated with regard to their zzso to zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso the zzso dilution zzso The presence of zzso genes was also investigated by zzso chain zzso It was found that zzso of zzso strains among all origins showed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso varying from 4 to 16 zzso to at least one of the zzso studied without any known zzso gene zzso Also, we detected one strain isolated from a zzso aquatic environment in which one zzso gene was found and characterized as zzso B using restriction zzso length zzso and zzso zzso resistance to zzso should be monitored closely because they zzso among few drugs, the ones quite effective in treating zzso zzso
