After the context is set by a brief description of the plant cell surface, emphasis is placed on one class of cell surface zzso the zzso zzso An expansion of knowledge regarding the structure, zzso and function of these zzso has been initiated and is being sustained through new experimental approaches, including the development of zzso zzso zzso and the cloning of zzso corresponding to core zzso An examination of the structure of both the zzso and zzso components of zzso proteins is presented with emphasis placed on recently deduced core zzso zzso Information about the zzso and turnover of zzso proteins is incomplete, especially with regard to the zzso zzso Although functions of zzso proteins have not been clearly identified, regulated expression and several other lines of evidence point to involvement in plant zzso development, pattern formation, and zzso zzso as well as in the underlying processes of cell division, cell expansion, and cell zzso zzso proteins are compared with animal zzso and zzso and the results of searches for plant zzso of other animal zzso zzso components are zzso
