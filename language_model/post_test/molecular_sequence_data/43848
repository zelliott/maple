zzso of zzso precursors zzso occurs in a zzso complex, termed zzso which is comprised of zzso small nuclear zzso particles zzso and other protein factors including zzso proteins zzso zzso is thought to be a zzso of the essential zzso factor zzso and is involved in U2 zzso function in zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso protein with two zzso recognition motifs zzso which shows extensive similarity to the human zzso The primary transcript for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to contain at least two additional zzso and can be processed into three different mature zzso by zzso The zzso zzso like other zzso in the same zzso unit, is expressed in most of the zzso zzso consistent with its putative essential function for zzso zzso By means of an in zzso zzso selection system, we demonstrate that zzso possesses specific zzso activity which resides in its second zzso
