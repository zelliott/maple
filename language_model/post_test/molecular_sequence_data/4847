zzso binding zzso protein consists of two zzso alpha zzso On the basis of sequence zzso to other zzso proteins it is believed that the binding zzso are formed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso In the oxidized form of the protein the zzso are linked zzso with each other by a zzso bond between their zzso zzso A synthetic gene coding for bovine zzso alpha zzso was constructed and cloned into a zzso of zzso zzso The gene was expressed in zzso coli utilizing the zzso expression zzso The expression products were zzso and identified using mass zzso and by sequencing of their zzso and zzso Three different forms zzso zzso and c) of zzso alpha were zzso with the native zzso with the zzso zzso at the zzso and with an additional zzso at the zzso as well as with the zzso zzso The material was partly zzso Interestingly, only the zzso of zzso zzso and c species were zzso The total yield of the protein was about 50 zzso of zzso Genes coding for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso alpha were obtained by zzso zzso and expressed in the same zzso In both cases similar zzso of oxidized and reduced zzso zzso and c species have been zzso The total yield of zzso zzso is similar to that of the native protein and that of zzso lower by about a zzso As expected, the zzso of zzso alpha zzso bind only one calcium zzso
