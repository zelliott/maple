The structural gene of zzso strain K zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso namely zzso was successfully zzso to contain zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso deduced from the zzso zzso revealed that the mature zzso consists of 301 zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and contains a zzso motif zzso zinc zzso and zzso involved in the zzso of zzso strain zzso The structural gene was successfully cloned to a shuttle zzso zzso and transformed into zzso coli strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso with detection of significant protein zzso zzso was detected from zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso of zzso zzso with increases in zzso activity to zzso and zzso respectively relative to their zzso In addition, zzso zzso strain K showed considerable stability towards numerous organic zzso such as zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso which typically pose a zzso effect on zzso our finding provides further information to support the potential application of the zzso in synthetic industries, particularly zzso zzso
