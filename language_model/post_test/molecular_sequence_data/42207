Small zzso of the zzso zzso are involved in regulation of zzso membrane transport zzso We recently used a zzso approach to isolate short zzso fragments of a number of novel zzso zzso These zzso fragments have not been used with zzso library screening and zzso techniques to clone the zzso zzso three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso By northern zzso analysis, the messages were found to be present in a wide variety of mouse zzso However, quantitative differences in the zzso levels between the zzso were zzso We determined the zzso zzso of the zzso by expressing the zzso zzso proteins with the zzso Forest virus and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso was localized to the zzso zzso This zzso was confirmed using a zzso zzso zzso detecting the zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso expressed from the zzso was localized to zzso compartments and to the plasma zzso After longer periods of zzso the protein was found on zzso large zzso zzso structures, suggesting that it is a potent regulator of events in the zzso zzso Finally, zzso was found in the zzso zzso region and on late zzso zzso The zzso of zzso may indicate its involvement in zzso zzso
