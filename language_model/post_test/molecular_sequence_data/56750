zzso zzso cells zzso play a central role in the synthesis and turnover of the zzso zzso zzso Prior studies zzso Thomas, Martin and Lovett (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso Thomas and Lovett (1989) zzso zzso 36, zzso have characterized at the protein level a 72 zzso type IV zzso that is zzso by cultured human and rat zzso While exposure of most cell types to zzso beta zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso or zzso zzso has little or even an zzso effect on 72 zzso type IV zzso zzso these factors significantly increased the synthesis of this zzso by rat zzso Given this divergent pattern of zzso a zzso zzso cloning strategy using rat zzso zzso templates was employed to define at the molecular level the structure of the zzso 72 zzso type IV zzso The zzso sequence within the open reading frame of the rat zzso 72 zzso type IV zzso zzso zzso from the sequence of the human zzso by zzso zzso The divergence in the 3' untranslated region was much more zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso transcript of the 72 zzso type IV zzso were low or zzso in resting zzso but were greatly zzso following incubation with zzso zzso or zzso zzso None of these factors induced synthesis by zzso of the closely related 92 zzso type IV zzso zzso by zzso of the 72 zzso type IV zzso was also induced by zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso It is concluded that zzso regulate the expression of this zzso in an unusual, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to the enhanced expression of the zzso during zzso inflammatory zzso
