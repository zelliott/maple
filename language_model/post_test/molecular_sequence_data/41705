zzso are found in many regulators of zzso structure, and most of them recognize zzso zzso on zzso Here, we investigate the role of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is involved in both zzso and zzso of gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in transgenic flies shows that it is a zzso zzso critical for zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis reveals that zzso pulled down by zzso from nuclear extracts zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, real-time interaction analyses demonstrate that zzso binds with high affinity zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with active zzso marks on zzso zzso suggesting that both are involved in zzso zzso of genes in open zzso zzso based zzso of wing zzso discs zzso either zzso or zzso reveal that both factors zzso large sets of common zzso which are enriched in zzso and zzso protein zzso suggesting that they could be implicated in dynamic coordination of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso and zzso bind zzso and are similarly recruited on gene body after heat zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be involved together in regulation of gene zzso We discuss whether zzso complexes composed of various zzso proteins might participate in regulation of gene expression in connection with zzso zzso
