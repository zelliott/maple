A zzso short rod to zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the surface of leaves of the black zzso zzso zzso and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was moderately zzso growing at zzso zzso in the range zzso % zzso with optimum growth at 5 % zzso zzso Growth occurred at zzso degrees C zzso zzso degrees zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso was strictly zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene showed that the strain belongs to the zzso zzso The closest relative was zzso zzso with zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso which is in the range of values for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed a zzso of 42 % and lower values were obtained with respect to other related zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso Overall, the zzso zzso and zzso results presented in this study demonstrate that strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
