The molecular structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso a newly defined member of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso coli zzso has been solved by X-ray zzso analyses to a resolution of zzso A for the zzso form and to a resolution of zzso A for a complex with an zzso zzso analogue of zzso zzso Like two other structurally characterized members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso with each zzso chain composed of two structural zzso The larger zzso domain contains the active site while the smaller zzso motif is zzso and involved primarily in zzso Unlike the other members of the zzso zzso however, the zzso motif is folded back onto the zzso domain such that each active site is wholly contained within a single zzso The zzso group of the zzso analogue of zzso zzso is hydrogen bonded to the zzso zzso group of zzso 110 and the zzso ring of His zzso From modeling studies, it appears that zzso 140 is positioned within the active site to participate in the zzso reaction by zzso the zzso group of zzso zzso so that it is zzso to the plane of the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, while the active site of zzso contains zzso zzso which is zzso to the general zzso zzso 144 in the active site of zzso its zzso side chain is hydrogen bonded to zzso 86, suggesting that it is not directly involved in zzso The new constellation of putative functional groups observed in the active site of zzso underscores the diversity of function in this zzso
