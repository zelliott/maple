We have used protection against zzso H to investigate the mechanisms by which zzso small nuclear zzso particles zzso determine the use of two alternative zzso zzso zzso The initial binding of zzso zzso to alternative consensus zzso sites was zzso and on a high proportion of zzso molecules both sites were occupied zzso When the sites were close, this inhibited zzso We propose that double occupancy leads to the use of the downstream site for zzso and that this is the cause of the proximity effect seen with strong alternative zzso zzso This model predicts that zzso to an upstream site of any strength requires a low affinity of zzso zzso for the downstream zzso This prediction was tested both by zzso the zzso end of zzso zzso and by altering the sequence of the downstream site of an zzso zzso zzso The enhancement of downstream zzso zzso site use by zzso factor zzso appears to be zzso by an increase in the strength of zzso zzso binding to all sites zzso
