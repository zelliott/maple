The zzso gene cluster on the human Y zzso is a candidate for the zzso Factor zzso According to the current evolutionary model, the zzso cluster derived from the zzso zzso zzso through zzso and zzso and is confined to Old World zzso apes and zzso To study functional and evolutionary aspects of this gene family we have isolated from a zzso (Old zzso monkey zzso zzso library the Y zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso contains one zzso repeat and displays high zzso to human zzso zzso comprises 11 repeats, each consisting of zzso 7 and 8, whereas the human zzso zzso repeat units contain predominantly zzso zzso zzso studies revealed the same zzso zzso events of a zzso zzso zzso unit encompassing zzso 7 and 8 in both species, indicating that after splitting of the two zzso in the human mainly zzso 8 was converted to a zzso by zzso site zzso The structural features of zzso reveal a more detailed model for the sequence of events leading to the present form of human zzso Thus, in a monkey species zzso is present in a form more ancestral than that of the zzso Studies on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso monkey zzso revealed a zzso expression pattern with proteins being zzso in zzso to zzso late zzso and zzso but not in early zzso and late zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso an animal lacking zzso zzso protein was only expressed in late zzso and early zzso These findings point to an additional function of zzso zzso zzso during zzso genesis in the Old World monkey not needed in the New World zzso
