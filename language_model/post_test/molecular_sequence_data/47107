The zzso zzso region of zzso 54 zzso I) contains sequences that allow response to zzso zzso and inhibit initiation in the absence of zzso zzso zzso has been used to systematically define Region I elements that contribute to each of these zzso zzso acid zzso from 6 to 50 were zzso with zzso in groups of three consecutive zzso making a total of 15 zzso zzso were tested for their ability to mediate zzso in zzso and in zzso and to support zzso in the absence of zzso in zzso Most zzso located between zzso 15 and 47 altered zzso function, while zzso between zzso 6 and 14, and zzso had little zzso The defective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso define new zzso acids required for normal zzso zzso In general, there is an inverse correlation between the levels of activated and zzso transcription, suggesting that the two functions are zzso When zzso the defective zzso zzso except for zzso zzso formed zzso open complexes similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed zzso open complexes, suggesting that this zzso interferes with a different step in the initiation zzso
