It is known from experiments with bacteria and zzso viruses that zzso of termination zzso located within the open reading frame zzso of zzso depends on the availability of zzso zzso and the efficiency of termination in zzso zzso the yield of zzso products can be used as a measure of the activity of zzso chain release zzso zzso key components of the translation termination zzso zzso of the zzso zzso located at the end of the zzso zzso the coat protein of beet zzso yellow vein zzso is required for virus zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso zzso and derivatives containing a zzso or zzso zzso in place of the zzso zzso have been used in translation experiments in zzso in the absence or presence of human zzso zzso zzso can be virtually abolished by addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is functional towards all three termination zzso located in a natural zzso and efficiently competes in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso A zzso These results are consistent with a crucial role of zzso in translation termination and forms the essence of an in zzso zzso for zzso activity based on the zzso of zzso by zzso
