zzso zzso stem cells represent the most probable targets for genetic zzso due to exposure to zzso zzso or chemical zzso We have applied a zzso protocol for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso blood zzso zzso cells were isolated by zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso off the zzso cells by zzso treatment with zzso Due to zzso of zzso recognized by the used zzso purity control of zzso cells and separation into zzso and zzso zzso could be performed by using flow zzso Two zzso procedures were applied to isolate zzso zzso for the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso from small numbers of zzso zzso In five experiments, the mean purity of zzso isolated zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sorting of zzso cells resulted in pure zzso populations zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso viability zzso zzso with an average yield of zzso zzso 800 zzso zzso zzso low density CB zzso By zzso using both zzso zzso isolation procedures, sequences corresponding to zzso and beta zzso were amplified from as few as 20 zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso was applied to amplify the zzso derived from five zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso full-length zzso message was detected in the zzso amplified zzso Our data demonstrate that gene expression can be detected at the zzso level in small numbers of zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso may allow the amplification of unique zzso species when zzso zzso procedures are zzso The presented data should be useful to analyze gene expression in rare zzso of zzso immature zzso zzso zzso
