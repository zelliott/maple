A zzso family gene was identified in the zzso zzso zzso and designated zzso zzso zzso Muscle zzso zzso zzso of zzso was restricted to the muscle cells of the developing zzso and the zzso muscle of zzso Northern blots showed that two zzso regulated zzso transcripts were expressed during zzso A zzso zzso transcript zzso appeared first and was gradually replaced by a zzso zzso transcript zzso These transcripts zzso essentially identical zzso family proteins with the exception of a 68 zzso acid zzso sequence present in zzso that was absent from zzso Although both zzso and zzso contained the zzso loop zzso domain zzso present in all zzso family zzso only zzso contained the region near the C zzso zzso zzso characteristic of this gene zzso zzso Southern blots showed that zzso zzso has only one zzso family zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso result from differential processing of primary zzso The existence of two zzso family proteins that are zzso expressed during zzso zzso has novel parallels to zzso muscle development and may reflect zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms among zzso
