The zzso of zzso virus zzso following its introduction as a biological control into the European rabbit populations of Australia and Europe is the zzso study of the evolution of zzso However, the evolutionary zzso of this profound change in zzso relationship is zzso We describe the zzso evolution of zzso covering a range of zzso grades sampled over 49 years from the parallel Australian and European epidemics, including the zzso zzso strains released in the early zzso zzso evolved rapidly over the sampling period, exhibiting one of the highest zzso substitution rates ever reported for a zzso DNA virus, and indicative of a relatively high zzso rate and/or a continually changing selective zzso Our comparative sequence data reveal that changes in zzso involved multiple zzso likely losses of gene function due to zzso events, and no zzso common to specific zzso zzso zzso despite the similarity in selection pressures there are multiple genetic routes to attain either highly virulent or attenuated zzso in zzso resulting in convergence for zzso but not zzso
