The zzso gene encodes the human zzso zzso 4 zzso This inhibitor protein is believed to be a tumor zzso that plays an essential role in cell cycle zzso One half of all cancer cell lines and one fourth of lung cancer cell lines examined to date contain zzso deletions zzso both zzso zzso of zzso However, the relative frequency of zzso zzso deletions in zzso lung zzso zzso and in zzso lung zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso or loss of another tumor zzso zzso by the zzso gene (the zzso zzso is more common in zzso than in zzso 

We measured the frequency of zzso zzso deletions in 77 zzso and in 93 zzso tumor cell zzso In addition, possible associations were explored between zzso gene loss, the presence or absence of zzso zzso and the clinical status of lung cancer zzso 

DNA was isolated from each tumor cell line and from the primary tumor and normal tissue of one zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso gene were amplified by use of the zzso chain reaction, and the resulting amplification products were analyzed by zzso gel zzso and DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso was also used to evaluate zzso gene zzso The frequency of zzso zzso loss and the presence or absence of functional zzso protein zzso zzso in the cell lines were zzso 

zzso deletion of zzso was detected in 18 zzso of 77 cell lines established from patients with zzso compared with one zzso of 93 cell lines established from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso gene loss was observed in the normal tissue of an zzso patient whose tumor cell line showed zzso deletion of the zzso however, the primary tumor from this patient had evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion was detected in 13 zzso of 46 tumor cell lines from patients with stage III or stage IV zzso compared with zero of 10 tumor cell lines from patients with stage I or stage II zzso zzso loss of zzso genes and functional zzso protein was rarely observed (in two of 135 cell zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso gene deletion in zzso cell lines is greater than that observed for any other known, or candidate, tumor zzso zzso 

Further study of the role of zzso gene zzso in the zzso of zzso is zzso
