zzso have potential as therapeutic agents and in functional studies of genes of zzso The activities of zzso in zzso depend on the accessibility of zzso to a zzso site in the target zzso At present, the selection of a target site for zzso is often based on a zzso structural analysis of the target zzso or zzso experiments in which vast numbers of zzso are tested zzso To overcome this problem, we have engineered zzso produced zzso with unwinding activity in zzso We found that attachment to zzso zzso zzso of an zzso motif with the ability to interact with zzso zzso zzso which create hybrid zzso enhances zzso activity significantly in zzso Thus, hybrid zzso can catalyze zzso at the specified target site within an zzso in zzso almost independently of the secondary or zzso structure of the target zzso around the zzso zzso
