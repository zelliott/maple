zzso domain III zzso acid zzso involved in specificity for beet zzso zzso zzso were zzso For this purpose, zzso III hybrids between zzso zzso and zzso hybrid zzso zzso were zzso zzso points of these hybrids defined six sequence blocks containing between 1 and 19 of the zzso acid differences between zzso and zzso zzso B, C, D, and E of zzso were shown to be required for optimal activity against zzso zzso Block E was also required for optimal activity against the tobacco zzso zzso zzso whereas block D had a negative effect on toxicity for this zzso The zzso of individual zzso acids in block B identified zzso as the only zzso acid in this block essential, although not sufficient by itself, for full zzso zzso zzso In block D, we identified a zzso zzso in zzso that was not in zzso The deletion of either one of two groups of four consecutive zzso acids in this zzso completely abolished activity against zzso zzso but resulted in higher activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso of the first group had little effect on zzso whereas zzso zzso of the second group had the same effect as its zzso These results identify groups of zzso acids as well as some individual zzso in zzso domain III, which are strongly involved in zzso zzso activity as well as sometimes involved in zzso zzso zzso
