zzso in the muscular zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso and dominant zzso Here we zzso the effects of one dominant zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after functional expression in zzso zzso zzso 200 is a highly zzso zzso acid located in a zzso stretch in the zzso zzso loop between zzso zzso and zzso Similar to several other dominant zzso the zzso acid exchange zzso leads to a drastic shift by approximately 65 zzso of the open probability curve to more positive zzso As explored by zzso studies, the shift is intermediate in zzso zzso zzso Open channel properties such as single channel zzso zzso or zzso selectivity are not zzso Thus we identified a new region of the zzso protein in which zzso can lead to drastic shifts of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is located in a zzso region at the beginning of domain zzso leads to a drastic reduction of the single channel zzso from zzso zzso for zzso to approximately zzso zzso In addition, the zzso is strongly inwardly zzso and zzso incompletely at negative zzso zzso however, is zzso These zzso properties fully explain the zzso zzso of the zzso and identify a new region of the protein that is involved in zzso zzso and gating of the zzso zzso The other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso had been found in a compound zzso zzso Surprisingly, expression of these zzso in zzso yielded currents indistinguishable from zzso zzso when explored by zzso zzso clamp recording and patch clamping zzso zzso or both zzso zzso Other mechanisms that are not faithfully represented by the zzso expression system must therefore be responsible for the zzso symptoms associated with these zzso
