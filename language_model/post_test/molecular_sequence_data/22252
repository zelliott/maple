zzso is a requisite protein involved in the type 4 zzso zzso system from the zzso human zzso bacteria, zzso zzso We determined the zzso structure at a zzso zzso this includes six tandem zzso zzso repeat zzso units forming right-handed zzso zzso structure was similar to the heat shock protein organizing zzso which interacts with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso via a zzso zzso zzso in the inner groove of zzso zzso After simulated zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proved to be a likely candidate binding to zzso which are ones of 25 necessary components involved in the type 4 zzso zzso zzso We proposed that zzso would be critical as a zzso in zzso interaction and zzso zzso may bind a necessary zzso in type 4 zzso zzso system such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso
