The zzso protein zzso plays a critical role in zzso the zzso transition and progression through the S phase of the zzso cell zzso zzso is zzso in a broad spectrum of human zzso and the expression level zzso with tumor zzso However, the zzso gene is neither amplified nor rearranged in most human zzso and the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso remains poorly zzso We show here that the zzso gene contains a functional zzso response element zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso gene in human zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso of zzso in human tumor cell lines reduces expression of zzso zzso zzso The zzso element not only zzso in zzso of zzso promoter function during normal cell cycle progression into S phase, it is also required for the high-level zzso gene expression in many human tumor cell zzso These results reveal zzso as a novel target for zzso regulation that is disrupted in several human tumor cell zzso
