zzso of zzso zzso after interaction with the zzso zzso sequence present in zzso zzso triggers formation of focal zzso and stress fibers in zzso via zzso zzso A putative zzso domain is present in zzso raising the possibility that this membrane protein stimulates zzso zzso via engagement of an zzso and the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso treatment and zzso of the zzso zzso site each inhibited zzso zzso zzso as well as formation of focal zzso and stress fibers in zzso zzso zzso These responses required both zzso binding and zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso expression and by zzso a zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain, zzso Furthermore, lack of zzso zzso and zzso responses in the presence of a zzso inhibitor or a zzso form of zzso implicated zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso zzso combined interaction of the zzso zzso zzso pair with zzso promotes zzso to the underlying zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling events triggered by such zzso cooperation are shown here to be the consequence of zzso rather than zzso zzso These observations are likely to be of widespread biological relevance because zzso binding is reportedly relevant to melanoma invasion, zzso zzso through zzso cells and host defense zzso
