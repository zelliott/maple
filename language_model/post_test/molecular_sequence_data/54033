Maintenance of zzso is implicated in zzso stabilization and cell zzso zzso which zzso de zzso synthesis of zzso is activated in germ cells and most zzso zzso activity is regulated by gene expression for its zzso zzso zzso whereas several lines of evidence have suggested a zzso regulation of zzso zzso Here we identify the zzso signaling proteins as human zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso redistributed zzso which was normally zzso in the nucleus, into the zzso zzso with this zzso zzso a zzso that could not bind zzso was localized into the zzso zzso B, an inhibitor of zzso zzso nuclear export, or disruption of a nuclear export signal zzso motif located just upstream of the zzso binding site in zzso impaired the zzso zzso of zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso increased its association with zzso zzso binding was not required for zzso activity either in zzso or in cell zzso These observations suggest that zzso enhances nuclear zzso of zzso by zzso the zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso
