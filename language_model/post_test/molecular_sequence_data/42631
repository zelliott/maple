Four types of cells, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso were previously isolated from an zzso zzso induced rat peripheral zzso zzso In a phenomenon termed zzso conversion, zzso spontaneously and permanently gives rise to the three other cell types in zzso In the zzso system the expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso beta protein genes zzso in a zzso specific zzso To further characterize the zzso family, the expression of four zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso basic protein zzso been studied in the zzso cell zzso In addition to these zzso the expression of the zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso in immature zzso zzso has been zzso We have found the following zzso 1) The stem cell type zzso and the zzso cell type zzso express zzso transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso (the larger form, zzso zzso and the amount of zzso of these genes was increased by zzso 2) zzso and zzso also express a low level of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso 3) The zzso cell types zzso and zzso do not express any of these zzso zzso genes with or without zzso zzso 4) The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso and at a lower level in zzso its expression is zzso by zzso
