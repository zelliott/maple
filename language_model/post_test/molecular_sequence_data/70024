The genes directing the expression of group II capsules in zzso coli are organized into three zzso The central region 2 is type specific and thought to determine the synthesis of the respective zzso whilst the zzso regions 1 and 3 are common to all group II gene clusters and direct the surface expression of the zzso zzso In this communication we analyze the involvement of region 1 and 3 genes in the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli strains harboring all zzso specific region 2 genes and having various combinations of region 1 and 3 genes were studied using zzso zzso zzso from these bacteria were incubated with zzso and zzso in the absence or presence of zzso zzso as an zzso zzso It was found that zzso strains with only gene region 2 did not produce the zzso zzso zzso of such strains did not zzso the zzso and did not zzso zzso zzso added as an zzso zzso An involvement of genes from region 1 zzso zzso and zzso and from region 3 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso synthesis was apparent and is zzso
