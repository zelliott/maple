Two zzso zzso zzso strains were independently isolated from fermented zzso zzso were zzso to zzso by ammonium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso exchange, zzso interaction, and zzso liquid zzso Two zzso zzso zzso were zzso from each strain, denominated A and B for zzso zzso zzso and C and D for zzso zzso zzso zzso B was blocked for zzso acid sequencing by zzso degradation, while the zzso acid sequences obtained from peptides A, C, and D contained the zzso consensus motif in positions 5 to 9, and the zzso sequence in positions 1 to zzso By use of zzso techniques and zzso sequencing, the structural gene of zzso P was found both in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic features of the two strains suggest that they are slightly different, they may produce more than one zzso and both produce zzso zzso
