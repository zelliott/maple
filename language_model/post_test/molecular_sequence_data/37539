The mouse zinc finger protein zzso gene is zzso to human gene and encodes a protein of 368 zzso zzso which contains four tandem zzso zinc finger motifs in the zzso and one zzso domain in the zzso Some recent studies suggest that zzso might be a zzso zzso We screened a mouse zzso zzso library with a human zzso zzso probe and isolated a zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso This zzso gene closely resembles zzso but displays several zzso suggesting that zzso represents a zzso zzso zzso analysis on total zzso from mouse tissue and zzso analysis on promoter region of zzso zzso suggest the transcripts of zzso may be not zzso zzso on the data of the human zzso in the zzso with zzso zzso and Southern zzso show there is no any zzso related to zzso gene in the human zzso The high similarity of zzso to zzso might be of considerable importance for zzso and evolution analysis of zzso
