The zzso function of the zzso protein zzso zzso whose synthesis is zzso at an early stage after the addition of zzso to growing cells of a zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso 23, zzso has been zzso The following findings clearly show that the zzso protein is a binding protein of an zzso transport zzso zzso zzso protein was found in a zzso zzso zzso When the restriction map of a clone for the zzso protein gene was compared with zzso physical map zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell 50, zzso the gene was found at 27 zzso of the zzso coli zzso where genes for an zzso transport system were zzso zzso The clone contained a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso acid protein whose calculated Mr was zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequence from this open reading frame was quite similar to that of an zzso binding protein of zzso zzso zzso When the transport activity of a zzso zzso was measured in a zzso zzso of zzso coli growing both in the presence and absence of zzso the activity was higher in the cells growing in its zzso zzso zzso stimulation of cell growth was greater when an zzso rather than corresponding zzso acids was added to the zzso These results suggest that the zzso stimulation of zzso protein synthesis at the early stage after the addition of zzso contributes to the zzso stimulation of cell growth through the supply of zzso
