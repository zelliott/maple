Previous investigations have shown that zzso and its light chain bind zzso preventing the enhancement of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso of plasma zzso by zzso We found that both zzso and zzso bound zzso but zzso exhibited a greater zzso We therefore localized the binding sites for zzso on zzso zzso zzso 5 and 6 of the light chain as well as domain 3 from the heavy chain, expressed as zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins in zzso coli, were tested for binding to immobilized zzso by surface zzso resonance using a zzso 2000 zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso bound to zzso when the zzso zzso were present at a concentration of 70 zzso To zzso more precisely the zzso acid sequences on zzso both of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed and tested for binding to immobilized zzso The zzso was much lower for zzso than for zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso was effective in decreasing the rate of zzso of zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso while zzso had no zzso We conclude that the binding of zzso to zzso is a complex function of zzso interacting with zzso in the sequence zzso to create zzso binding zzso zzso has the potential to be an important zzso of zzso zzso
