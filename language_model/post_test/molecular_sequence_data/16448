zzso is responsible for the majority of life-threatening cases of human zzso The global emergence of drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso identification and characterization of novel drug zzso zzso zzso zzso is present at high levels in human red cells and in zzso zzso zzso of at least three zzso of the alpha zzso class was demonstrated in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso and partially characterized from zzso zzso zzso A search of the zzso zzso database yielded an open reading frame similar to the zzso from various organisms, including zzso The primary zzso acid sequence of the zzso has zzso identity with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The single open reading frames zzso 235 and 252 zzso acid proteins for zzso and zzso zzso The highly zzso active site zzso were also found among organisms having zzso The zzso gene was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso It was sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso revealed the authenticity to the wild type zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed good zzso effect on the in zzso growth of zzso zzso Our molecular tools developed for the zzso zzso expression will be useful for developing potential zzso directed at zzso zzso zzso zzso
