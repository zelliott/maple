The enhancement of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso of that zzso with zzso and with zzso and zzso zzso acid, circular zzso zzso the release of zzso and polarized infrared attenuated total reflection zzso zzso were used to study the interaction of zzso with intact zzso zzso and flat zzso zzso bound the zzso only below the main transition temperature, thus confirming earlier results of zzso et zzso zzso However, the zzso is also bound by zzso of zzso lipids above their transition temperature, suggesting an influence of zzso area on the binding zzso zzso zzso showed that binding to such zzso also increases the zzso content of zzso The zzso study and a comparison with zzso revealed profound differences in orientation of the two zzso The zzso ratios and the derived order parameters indicated an zzso orientation of the zzso segments of zzso but did not exclude a principal orientation of the molecules lying flat on the membrane zzso In contrast, the axis of the zzso zzso is clearly oriented normal to the zzso The two peptides also differ in their rates of zzso release, suggesting a deeper penetration of the primary zzso zzso of zzso zzso than of the secondary zzso zzso of zzso
