A zzso protein interacting with a specific sequence motif zzso to the zzso start site of the zzso promoter has been observed previously zzso zzso zzso zzso Reeves, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Reynolds, Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments in which protein extracts of zzso zzso and developing zzso were used suggested a bacterial origin for the zzso binding protein zzso zzso tests were performed by using different zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso revealed a correlation between the presence of zzso in the zzso structures and the ability of zzso protein extracts to bind the zzso binding domain zzso Through the use of zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence was identified as zzso The zzso protein was isolated from zzso zzso zzso by multiple zzso procedures and affinity separation by using zzso of zzso attached to magnetic zzso zzso of the recovered protein resulted in identification of the zzso protein as the zzso zzso alpha zzso This was confirmed by expression of the gene zzso the zzso zzso alpha zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso When the expressed zzso was bound to zzso the gel zzso result was identical to the result obtained with zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso
