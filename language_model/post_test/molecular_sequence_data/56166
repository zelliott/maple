The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso integration into the zzso zzso We present the zzso sequence of the terminal regions of the zzso and its target site in the zzso zzso No zzso repeats were found at the zzso of the zzso A zzso region of the target was present on either side following the zzso of zzso and appeared to serve as a signal for its integration and zzso The data suggest that the left copy of the zzso segment was a part of the zzso element, the crossover point of integration was zzso within this region, and the mechanism of zzso could resemble that of the zzso temperate zzso
