Tight junction zzso constitutes the barrier by controlling the passage of zzso and molecules via zzso zzso and the movement of proteins and lipids between zzso and zzso zzso of the plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules are the major three zzso proteins at zzso This study focuses a newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Mouse zzso composes of 224 zzso acids and shares zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso with rat and human, zzso the most zzso zzso are zzso and zzso which share approximately zzso DNA sequence zzso with zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the mouse and rat zzso among the zzso examined by Northern zzso and to a much less extent, also found in brain by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are localized at zzso regions of zzso canine kidney zzso cells by zzso zzso In addition, zzso is found in the zzso protein complexes in zzso cells by zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso as markers for different zzso segment, strong expression of zzso was observed in zzso zzso of the zzso as well as in the collecting ducts of the zzso To less extent, zzso is also present in the zzso zzso zzso and in the loop of zzso zzso Furthermore, intense zzso zzso is found zzso with the zzso in zzso from zzso day 15, day 45, and adult rats and zzso Similar zzso of zzso and zzso are also observed in human zzso Since these zzso segments are mainly for controlling the zzso zzso zzso it is suggested that zzso may participate in these zzso In human zzso zzso decreased expression and zzso of zzso are noticed, suggesting a possible correlation between zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, zzso is a zzso zzso that is highly and specifically expressed in zzso zzso with a putative role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
