zzso A zzso zzso the zzso synthesis of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso and belongs to a family of zzso zzso that generate an zzso zzso This family includes other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the modular zzso zzso zzso We have determined the X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The structure identifies the zzso binding pocket as well as a new zzso for members of this zzso family in which the approximately zzso zzso domain exhibits a large rotation compared to structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso This domain movement presents a new set of zzso to the active site and removes a zzso zzso zzso that was previously shown to be important for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of our structure with kinetic and structural data of closely related zzso suggests that the members of the zzso family of zzso may adopt two different zzso to catalyze the two zzso Additionally, we provide a structural explanation for the recently shown control of zzso activity by zzso of an active site zzso
