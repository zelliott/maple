We partially zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to c) which appeared in the cells undergoing a zzso process from immature zzso grains to zzso cells, caused by zzso in zzso All the zzso had a highly zzso zzso zzso acid zzso Using zzso zzso zzso designed from the zzso acid zzso the zzso for zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso cultured in zzso medium The zzso sequence showed moderate zzso with several zzso zzso zzso and with a kind of early zzso though its function could not be zzso zzso analysis revealed that the level of zzso for zzso was high during the zzso and also in the very early period of zzso zzso but it was low in the zzso process of zzso in zzso in the in zzso maturation process and both in the zzso and zzso growth zzso of tobacco zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso medium zzso which promoted the induction of zzso increased the level of zzso for zzso whereas the presence of zzso which inhibited it, decreased the zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso gene is correlated with the zzso but not with zzso development or cell zzso
