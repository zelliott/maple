The zzso X zzso zzso a member of the zzso of hormone nuclear zzso is a zzso zzso factor that is activated by the vitamin A zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso into zzso with a high affinity and that zzso binding zzso rapid zzso of zzso zzso to smaller zzso Here, the zzso region that is responsible for zzso zzso formation is zzso It is shown that this zzso which we term the zzso zzso critically contains two consecutive zzso zzso located at the zzso region of the zzso zzso of these zzso is sufficient to disrupt zzso zzso without affecting the overall fold of the protein or interfering with zzso zzso zzso formation, or DNA binding by the zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso The newly characterized zzso domain and the previously identified main zzso interface of zzso act autonomously to affect separate zzso interactions that, overall, lead to formation of zzso zzso interactions zzso by the zzso domain, but not those that involve the zzso zzso are disrupted following zzso binding by zzso Overall, these data attest to the specificity of the interaction and zzso the zzso interface in playing a direct role in regulating zzso zzso by zzso
