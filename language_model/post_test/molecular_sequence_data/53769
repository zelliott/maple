zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso intermediate at sites containing the sequence zzso downward zzso The zzso bound zzso can zzso the zzso strand to a zzso zzso or else transfer the strand to a zzso zzso such a water or zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso also zzso strand transfer to hydrogen zzso The observed alkaline zzso of zzso is consistent with zzso attack by zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The reaction displays apparent zzso zzso From a zzso plot of zzso versus zzso at pH 10, we determined a rate constant for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This rate is slower by a factor of 200 than the rate of zzso strand transfer to a perfectly aligned zzso DNA strand but is comparable to the rate of DNA strand transfer across a zzso zzso Strand transfer to zzso hydrogen zzso is 300 times faster than strand transfer to zzso zzso and approximately 2000 times faster than zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is also an effective zzso in zzso strand transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rates of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso reactions zzso by the zzso zzso zzso were reduced by factors of zzso in accordance with the zzso to zzso rate zzso in DNA zzso and zzso by zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso strand transfer to DNA and zzso zzso via a common reaction zzso in which zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the transition state rather than acting as a general acid or zzso
