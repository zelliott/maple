zzso is a mouse zzso zzso which has a high specificity for melanoma, zzso zzso and breast cancer, making it a promising candidate for cancer targeting zzso We have therefore attempted to construct a humanized zzso of zzso to minimize its zzso for potential clinical zzso Using a molecular model of zzso built by zzso zzso zzso framework region zzso zzso of potential importance to the zzso binding were zzso Then, a humanized version of zzso was generated by transferring these mouse key zzso zzso onto a human framework that was selected based on zzso to the mouse zzso together with the mouse zzso region zzso zzso This humanized zzso retained only six zzso zzso outside of the zzso but was shown to possess affinity and specificity comparable to that of the parental zzso suggesting that it might have the potential to be developed for future clinical zzso
