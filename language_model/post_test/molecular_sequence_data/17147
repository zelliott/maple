Human zzso protein is an zzso filament binding protein but does not bind to zzso zzso It associates with zzso both in zzso and in zzso playing important roles in modulating the activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the capping activity of capping protein which zzso the zzso zzso We determined the crystal structures of human zzso protein by zzso anomalous zzso zzso The structure showed a high level of similarity to zzso domain, although their zzso acid sequences share low degree of zzso A few zzso zzso zzso that may contribute to the folding were zzso This structure suggests zzso protein bind to zzso in a different way from zzso zzso Combined with the information from previous zzso studies, the binding sites for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso These two sites are quite close, which might prevent zzso and zzso from binding to zzso zzso
