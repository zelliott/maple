The entire sequences of the type A zzso gene and an adjacent open reading frame designated as zzso zzso which are located between the zzso and the zzso genes were zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analyses of the zzso type A zzso toxins zzso zzso and zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso and zzso are single peptides of approximately zzso but that of zzso has a zzso at the site between zzso and zzso of this zzso
