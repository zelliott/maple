It remains unclear whether zzso are the same among the sibling species of zzso zzso zzso zzso This study was carried out to compare the zzso acid sequences of three major zzso s 1, 2 and zzso and one minor zzso s 9) zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found 2 (out of zzso 1 (out of zzso and 29 (out of zzso zzso acid variable sites for Ani s 1, 2, and 12, zzso However, as both zzso and zzso variations were present at the same zzso acid positions, no zzso acid variations clearly distinguished the two sibling zzso zzso zzso zzso s 1) and a binding motif of human zzso zzso zzso s 2 and 9) demonstrated by previous studies were zzso The similarities of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso indicate possible similar zzso health risks in humans infected with or accidentally ingesting either zzso zzso
