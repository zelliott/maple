The zzso restriction zzso isolated from zzso zzso recognizes the sequence zzso zzso after the G to generate a four base 3' zzso The zzso zzso and a portion of the zzso zzso gene were cloned into zzso coli by the zzso selection method, and the remaining portion of the zzso zzso gene was cloned by inverse zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene and the zzso gene were zzso The zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso zzso a protein with predicted molecular weight of zzso The zzso zzso gene was identical with that previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cloning and characterization of two zzso arranged DNA zzso genes of zzso zzso an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes overlap by four bases and are transcribed in the same zzso The zzso gene was cloned into an improved zzso zzso and a high level of zzso zzso expression was achieved in zzso zzso
