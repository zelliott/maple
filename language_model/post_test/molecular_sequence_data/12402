Recently we reported the basic phenomenon of an interaction between the envelope zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and components of the human complement system, zzso activated C4 zzso and activated zzso zzso and the complement regulator proteins factor H and zzso In this study we analyze these interactions in zzso Using 46 overlapping peptides of zzso attached to zzso plates, binding of activated human zzso to 6 regions in zzso was found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In competition zzso with soluble zzso representatives of four of these regions were capable to partially inhibit zzso binding to immobilized zzso zzso human C4 zzso only with peptides covering zzso zzso but both in direct binding zzso and fluid phase zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with zzso was also supported by the fact that zzso zzso zzso coated with zzso zzso by partial zzso sequence zzso of zzso and human zzso binding protein zzso as well as human zzso we detected binding of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso This zzso was also confirmed by a zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso of zzso which could be shown to bind zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso part of the zzso were found to show an zzso sequence similarity to human complement zzso type 3 zzso zzso of the 4 (or possibly 6) interaction sites of zzso with activated human zzso 3 may bind due to zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso In addition to zzso and zzso we detected interaction of factor H with zzso it selectively bound to zzso zzso Using 14 overlapping peptides of zzso attached to plates, we identified 4 areas in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which bound human factor zzso All of them except the first region partially inhibited factor H binding to zzso in competition zzso with soluble zzso zzso bound only to 2 regions zzso zzso zzso The first 3 sites in zzso were already shown by us to share zzso to sites in human zzso The region around zzso zzso now also turned out to be similar to human zzso These data demonstrate that the interaction of both, zzso and zzso with the complement system is zzso and zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
