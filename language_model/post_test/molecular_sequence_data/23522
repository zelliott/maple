Metal zzso play significant roles in most biological zzso Over the past two decades, there has been significant interest in the redesign of existing metal binding sites in zzso and the introduction of metals into folded zzso Recent research has focused on the effects of metal binding on the overall secondary and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this context, de zzso design of zzso has become a valuable approach for studying the consequence of metal zzso It has been seen that metal zzso not only direct folding of partially folded peptides but have at times also been the elixir for properly folding zzso structures in stable secondary zzso Work in our group has focused on binding of heavy metal zzso such as zzso to de zzso designed zzso three stranded coiled zzso peptides with sequences based on the zzso repeat zzso zzso from or addition of a zzso to the parent zzso zzso zzso with the zzso acid sequence zzso generated peptides whose zzso affinities were seen to be dependent on their zzso It was noted that adjustment in the position of the zzso from an zzso position in the case of the shorter zzso to a zzso position for zzso resulted in a zzso with low association affinities for itself, weaker binding with zzso and a considerably faster kinetic profile for metal zzso Similar differences in zzso and kinetic parameters were also noted for the longer zzso zzso At the same time, metal zzso into the zzso and longer zzso and Grand peptides has clearly demonstrated that the metal binding is both zzso as well zzso different from that to zzso zzso
