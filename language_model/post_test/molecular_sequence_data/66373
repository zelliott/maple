All human zzso zzso zzso zzso until now identified predict a protein of 362 zzso acids having zzso activity highly restricted to zzso In this report we describe the identification of a new zzso zzso transcript containing an additional translation start zzso located upstream and zzso with that up to now considered unique translation initiation site in the human zzso zzso zzso In zzso expression studies showed that the new transcript produces a longer form of human zzso zzso that is efficiently zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, stable zzso zzso into zzso cells gives rise to a zzso increase of zzso zzso activity, associated to a broader zzso zzso Although this transcript has been initially identified in the human zzso zzso analyses verified the expression of an identical zzso also in zzso zzso cells, but not in the zzso zzso Altogether, these results are the first demonstration of the existence of a new zzso of human zzso zzso which could play an important role during zzso cell zzso The functional relevance of the existence of two zzso of zzso zzso is also zzso
