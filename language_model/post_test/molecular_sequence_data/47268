zzso A is an abundant zzso zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso whose zzso activity has been exploited for the manufacture of zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of zzso A zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains the zzso features of plant zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and revealed the presence of an zzso zzso zzso which is known to function in cell surface zzso binding by zzso zzso zzso A zzso was detected predominantly in young flower buds but not in mature or zzso zzso suggesting that its expression is likely to be zzso zzso zzso A, the single chain zzso was found associated with zzso zzso of flower zzso whereas the active zzso zzso generated upon removal of zzso is zzso This result implies a role for zzso in promoting the association of plant zzso zzso precursors to cell zzso To get further insights about zzso A, the functional relevance of the zzso motif was also zzso A zzso protein that interacts specifically with the zzso sequence was isolated from zzso zzso zzso extracts by affinity zzso on zzso zzso This result suggests that the zzso protein is a zzso A zzso and indicates that the interaction between these two proteins is apparently zzso through zzso zzso It is possible therefore that zzso A may have a role in zzso zzso mechanisms involved in zzso recognition and zzso
