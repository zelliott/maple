The zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of genes that share zzso with the viral zzso zzso of the avian leukemia virus zzso By using expression zzso we demonstrate that the zzso gene zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso cells form colonies in soft zzso and induce tumors in nude zzso We have also determined that the zzso protein contains zzso with the zzso motif of the zzso family zzso but lacks the basic domain upstream of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells with zzso zzso results in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso that can distinguish between transcripts from zzso and zzso templates, we show that the zzso zzso gene is activated by the expression of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso zzso has no effect on the zzso zzso gene zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso is positively zzso by its zzso
