zzso systems have been implicated in zzso states, as caffeine can induce a state of anxiety in human zzso zzso is an zzso at zzso and zzso zzso receptors but it remains unclear whether anxiety is zzso by one or both of zzso As the zzso system is rather zzso we opted to pursue these questions using zzso a widely used model zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors conserve zzso zzso in zzso and zzso that are responsible for affinity in bovine A1 zzso We investigated the effects of caffeine, zzso (an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and locomotor activity of zzso in the zzso test as well as evaluated the effects of these drugs on zzso zzso zzso increased anxiety at the dose of 100 zzso while locomotion at the dose of 10 zzso was zzso Both doses of 10 and 100 zzso induced zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, increased anxiety at a dose of 6 zzso and induced zzso zzso at the doses of zzso and 6 zzso but did not produce a locomotor zzso zzso in turn, increased locomotion at the dose of 6 zzso but did not produce any effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results indicate that blockade of zzso but not zzso zzso anxiety and zzso zzso while the blockade of zzso zzso zzso Thus, as in zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects are probably zzso by zzso receptors in zzso and its locomotor zzso effect is probably zzso by zzso zzso
