The liver plays a central role in zzso metabolism and plasma zzso zzso This dynamic process is regulated by a variety of zzso zzso However, the specific liver cells that express these proteins are largely zzso In the current study we measured zzso levels for 13 genes zzso proteins involved in zzso metabolism in isolated rabbit zzso zzso and zzso zzso For these analyses we cloned partial rabbit zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso transfer protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso The zzso provided the basis for developing quantitative zzso protection zzso for each zzso These zzso were used to determine whether differential patterns of zzso expression existed between liver and other zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data demonstrate a diverse range in tissue distribution and zzso zzso Liver expressed all zzso except for zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in isolated liver cell populations zzso to total zzso revealed a cell segregation pattern for zzso gene expression: zzso cells showed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso compared to zzso cells while zzso cells showed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso These data demonstrate the existence of differential zzso expression patterns in rabbit liver cell populations for genes zzso proteins affecting zzso zzso
