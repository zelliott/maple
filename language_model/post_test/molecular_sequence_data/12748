We have zzso cloned zzso zzso a new zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the product is most zzso to zzso zzso in its zzso zzso Furthermore, the putative protein zzso A zzso site zzso found in most of the zzso family zzso but replaced by zzso in zzso zzso is replaced by zzso indicating that our zzso most likely encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso As in the case of mouse zzso zzso alone does not bind to DNA zzso while zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso B sites and activate zzso zzso transcripts are present at all stages of zzso maturation and in adult zzso zzso However, in staged zzso zzso is zzso from zzso to stage 28 and resumes expression at stage 47, while zzso the zzso zzso of zzso has been demonstrated to be expressed throughout zzso These results raise the possibility that zzso and zzso play different roles in the development of zzso
