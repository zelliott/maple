A zzso zzso toxin in which the cell binding domain of zzso zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso 4 zzso was produced in zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso cell lines but had little effect on human cell lines lacking receptors capable of binding zzso zzso A zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso with very low zzso activity displayed zzso activity similar to that of zzso rather than zzso zzso Because the zzso effects of zzso were blocked by excess zzso or by zzso zzso to zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso effect of zzso is specifically zzso through zzso zzso zzso could be a useful zzso for specific elimination of cells bearing zzso zzso
