We have isolated a gene coding for a fourth human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This additional zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in human fetal and adult brain and lung zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso displays both sequence and structural zzso to three cloned zzso receptors as well as to other members of the family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the expressed zzso reveals specific, zzso binding of zzso 14 and zzso zzso Surprisingly, several zzso synthetic zzso zzso fail to exhibit zzso binding to zzso indicating the existence of zzso different zzso zzso Our data suggest that the diverse biological effects exerted by zzso are zzso by a family of receptors with discrete patterns of expression and different pharmacological zzso
