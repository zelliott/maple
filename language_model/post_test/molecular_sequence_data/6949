zzso diverse forms of the zzso zzso zzso are formed by alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso of three zzso generates as many as eight zzso zzso zzso seven of which have been identified in zzso zzso The alternatively spliced zzso zzso a 21 zzso acid sequence in the zzso domain zzso zzso and adjacent sequences of 37 and 38 zzso acids in the zzso domain zzso C1 and zzso zzso zzso out the zzso segment that encodes the C2 cassette removes the first stop zzso resulting in a new open reading frame that encodes an unrelated sequence of 22 zzso acids zzso before a second stop zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso alters the zzso zzso and pharmacological properties of receptors that comprise zzso zzso Diversity of zzso receptors is also caused by differential association with members of the zzso gene zzso The finding of zzso expression and zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso provides an explanation for the diversity of properties of zzso receptors in different zzso zzso
