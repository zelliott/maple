Three zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso of a strictly zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a highly saline zzso brine from an oil zzso in central Oklahoma, zzso The optimal concentration of zzso for growth of these three strains was 2 M zzso and the strains also grew in the presence of an additional 1 M zzso The strains were zzso and grew at a pH range of zzso zzso used by all three strains included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products included ethanol, zzso zzso and zzso with zzso produced by two of the three zzso zzso were noted among strains in the optimal temperature and pH for growth, the maximum and minimum zzso concentration that supported growth, zzso zzso and cellular fatty acid zzso Despite the zzso differences among the three zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences and zzso zzso showed that these three strains were members of the same zzso which belonged to the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso characteristics of strains zzso zzso and zzso are different from those of previously described species of zzso It is proposed that strain zzso zzso zzso be established as the type strain of a new species, zzso zzso
