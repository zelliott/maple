We established an efficient zzso system for zzso S zzso zzso using the zzso cloned from zzso zzso The estimated molecular mass of the zzso zzso indicated zzso was a zzso This zzso form was very resistant to zzso by zzso and showed zzso behavior on zzso zzso zzso migrated much slower (as a single band of 36 zzso in its active zzso than its completely zzso zzso (13 zzso if heat treatment in zzso zzso was not performed before zzso As predicted from the presence of the zzso zzso sequence motif zzso in the zzso zzso zzso family, zzso also contained one zinc per zzso zzso However, the predicted zzso function appeared not to be the only role of this zinc in the zzso First, zzso of the zzso zzso groups with zzso led to zzso of the zzso zzso into unstable zzso or zzso Second, depletion of zinc on zzso of chemically zzso zzso (with either zzso or zzso zzso resulted in improper folding of the zzso These results suggest that zinc also plays a structural role in maintenance of the protein zzso When we introduced zzso at zzso (the proposed active zzso and zzso (a proposed zzso zzso zzso in zzso none of the resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed any zzso activity, as judged with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in gross zzso of the zzso structure although the zzso essential zzso was not necessarily required for proper folding of the zzso These results further support our proposal that the zzso zinc coordinated by the zzso sequence motif is also structural in zzso
