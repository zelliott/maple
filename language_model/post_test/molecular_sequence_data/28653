A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been obtained by zzso expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso comparisons show that this protein belongs to the extended family of zzso and zzso zzso zzso but also indicate that it is not closely similar to either the zzso or zzso zzso Instead, it appears to bear some similarity to novel members of this family, in particular the zzso zzso involved in the assembly of zzso clusters in zzso The two zzso levels of the zzso metal site of zzso zzso zzso have been studied by zzso resonance zzso zzso variable temperature magnetic circular zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis is given for the zzso zzso In aggregate, the zzso data reveal differences with both the zzso and zzso zzso in keeping with the sequence zzso The zzso potential of the zzso couple, at zzso zzso versus the normal hydrogen zzso is more negative than those of zzso zzso and at the upper end of the range covered by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso in addition to the four that are committed as zzso of the zzso zzso These two zzso have been shown by chemical modification and zzso zzso to form a zzso bridge in the native zzso While that zzso unit plays a significant role in the exceptional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 121 degrees C at pH 7 versus zzso zzso 113 degrees C in a molecular zzso where the zzso bridge has been zzso it does not bear on the properties of the zzso zzso This observation is consistent with the large distance zzso 20 zzso that is predicted to separate the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
