The zzso acid sequence of the fusion protein zzso was measured by two types of zzso and its primary structure was zzso After reduction and zzso the protein was zzso with zzso and zzso groups in zzso were removed by zzso zzso The mixed peptides were separated by zzso then zzso and Ion trap tandem mass zzso were used to measure zzso y zzso zzso of each zzso to analyze the zzso acid sequence of fusion protein zzso zzso percent of full zzso acid sequence of the fusion protein zzso was measured by zzso with the remaining zzso completed by zzso As zzso and tandem mass zzso are zzso sensitive, accurate to measure the protein zzso acid zzso they are important approach to structure analysis and identification of zzso zzso
