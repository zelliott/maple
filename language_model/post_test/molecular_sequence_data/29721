The zzso zzso zzso system mediates the transport of proteins across the bacterial plasma membrane and zzso zzso zzso zzso in parallel with zzso systems in these zzso the zzso system is completely different in both structural and zzso terms, and is uniquely able to catalyze the zzso of fully folded proteins across coupled zzso zzso is an essential, zzso component that has been proposed to form part of the binding site for zzso precursor zzso In this study we have tested the importance of zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso face of the zzso coli zzso We find that many of the zzso on the zzso face have little or no zzso However, substitution at several positions in the extreme zzso zzso region or the predicted first zzso loop lead to a significant or complete loss of zzso zzso The zzso strains are unable to grow zzso on zzso zzso minimal media and are unable to export zzso zzso zzso The same zzso are completely unable to export a zzso zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso linked to green fluorescent zzso indicating that zzso is blocked rather than zzso zzso into the zzso mature zzso The data point to two essential zzso zzso on the zzso protein that are essential for zzso
