zzso and zzso zzso techniques have been used to characterize the zzso and dynamics associated with the interaction of an zzso coli 16 S zzso zzso model zzso and four zzso antibiotics that exhibit a broad range of zzso zzso The results of these zzso suggest that zzso reduction in the mobility of an zzso zzso at position 1492 of the zzso zzso is a more important zzso of zzso activity than drug affinity for the zzso This observation is consistent with a recently proposed model for the mechanism of protein synthesis zzso by zzso that zzso a drug-induced zzso in the zzso equilibrium of the zzso zzso zzso around the zzso zzso zzso at positions 1492 and zzso which, in turn, promotes an enhanced interaction between the zzso and the zzso formed by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso even when the zzso is zzso zzso as a whole, the results reported here indicate that the rational design of antibiotics that target the 16 S zzso zzso requires consideration of not only the structure and zzso of the zzso complex but also the dynamics associated with that zzso
