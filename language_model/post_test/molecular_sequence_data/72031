Two major zzso are zzso by the fungus zzso zzso in zzso zzso One is similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso The second protein zzso although catalyzing the zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso differs from the above zzso by its zzso activity enabling it to zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is by a mechanism similar to that reported for zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso yielding zzso The apparent kinetic zzso showed high activity on zzso but zzso was the natural zzso with the highest zzso affinity (this and other zzso zzso are not efficiently oxidized by the zzso zzso zzso A three-dimensional model was built using crystal models from four zzso zzso as zzso The model suggests high structural affinity of this versatile zzso with zzso but shows a putative zzso binding site near the internal zzso zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso A specific zzso interaction site for zzso is supported by kinetic data showing zzso zzso with other zzso zzso Moreover, zzso reported as involved in zzso interaction with zzso alcohol and other aromatic zzso are present in zzso zzso such as zzso at the zzso zzso which is remarkably similar to that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the protein zzso These zzso could be involved in two different hypothetical long range electron transfer pathways from zzso zzso and zzso similar to those zzso for zzso
