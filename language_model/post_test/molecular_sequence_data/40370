A zzso bacterial strain, zzso isolated from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (a zzso of zzso zzso was studied using a zzso zzso zzso of the isolate were zzso and stained zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso gene sequence of this zzso with sequences of type strains of the most closely related species clearly showed an allocation to the zzso zzso with the highest sequence similarities (all zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities to type strains of other zzso species were below zzso The fatty acid profile of strain zzso included the major fatty acids zzso summed feature 4 zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results and the zzso zzso and zzso properties show that strain zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
