The effect of zzso on cardiac zzso structure and activity was investigated using as a model zzso prepared by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso The resulting zzso contained zzso but a part of the zzso region of zzso was zzso zzso the zzso part of the band zzso below zzso on zzso gels revealed it to consist of alternating zzso and zzso zzso thus establishing zzso as the origin of this zzso However, Western blots did not reveal any zzso while zzso indicated it to be present at the zzso level suggesting the zzso zzso used in these experiments did not recognize the zzso portion of zzso still attached to zzso zzso a zzso M excess of isolated light chains with zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso M zzso allowed zzso to recombine with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a highly zzso zzso zzso which upon zzso with intact zzso became zzso as indicated by the zzso of molecular weight averages all across the zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso of 30 zzso and a zzso of 28 zzso In the presence of intact zzso zzso rose to zzso zzso while zzso and zzso were reduced to zzso and 12 zzso zzso The fourfold decrease in zzso strongly indicated an increased affinity for zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso Also, zzso of dog heart zzso was suppressed when zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso were performed in the presence of zzso zzso These observations suggest the presence of intact, zzso zzso in zzso is required for the stability of zzso heavy chains and proper zzso
