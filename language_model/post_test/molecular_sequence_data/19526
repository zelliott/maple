The regulation of viral gene expression is a compilation of virus and host factors influencing the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso a distinct regulatory element utilizing the zzso was zzso The motif is present in promoters of zzso cycle genes and resembles a crucial host zzso motif zzso Since the binding specificity of zzso proteins recognizing zzso zzso was determined and no specific preference for interaction with zzso motif was found, we performed a zzso fold recognition search to identify viral proteins potentially recognizing the zzso By applying zzso comparisons and zzso protein structure prediction we identified a protein of unknown function from zzso zzso of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso of zzso as proteins zzso zzso zzso Although overall sequence identity is very low zzso zzso the zzso fold and presence of important zzso on a surface of zzso interface marked both proteins as zzso related to zzso and permitted the characterization of a putative molecular basis of selective recognition of zzso by zzso
