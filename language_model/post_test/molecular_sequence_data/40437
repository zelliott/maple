zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been investigated using zzso zzso The mature protein is predicted to contain 31 zzso consensus sites with approximately one third being found in the zzso domain spanning zzso zzso Since this domain is rich in zzso and zzso and therefore relatively zzso to zzso analysis, this study has focused on mapping its zzso Our analysis identified nine of the 11 consensus sequence sites, and all were found to be zzso This constitutes a remarkably high zzso density in the zzso domain averaging one site for each stretch of zzso zzso Each of the zzso sites observed was shown to be modified with a zzso family of zzso with the largest having a composition zzso plus zzso zzso consistent with the zzso zzso previously reported in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso species whose zzso are known to be linked via the zzso core zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso
