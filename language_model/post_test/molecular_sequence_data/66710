zzso proteins are key regulators of zzso structure and function in plants, zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to animals and zzso plants contain numerous zzso zzso zzso the members of which form a discrete zzso The zzso and zzso proteins associate with zzso and possess zzso zzso activity, indicating that they participate in the organization of zzso repressive zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains 10 zzso zzso belonging to four zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The structure and expression of zzso a member of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso was shown to be broadly expressed during plant development with the highest levels found in zzso zzso The zzso protein localized in zzso zzso and remained associated with condensed zzso throughout zzso A deletion analysis of the zzso upstream region further revealed that an zzso located in the zzso zzso is a key regulator of strong and zzso zzso zzso
