zzso from zzso organisms are eliminated in a variety of zzso and zzso processes by zzso In this report, we describe the cloning and characterization of molecules from the marine sponges zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso show a high similarity to those that are found in molecules of the zzso zzso zzso and of the death zzso The zzso proteins contain up to four zzso zzso regions zzso Two zzso molecules have been identified from sponges that are provided with two of those regions, zzso and zzso and are termed zzso zzso proteins zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a putative size of zzso while the related sequence from zzso zzso zzso has a zzso of zzso zzso analyses of the entire two sponge zzso revealed a high similarity to members of the zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso When the two zzso zzso and zzso are analyzed zzso again the highest similarity was found to the members of the zzso zzso but a clearly lower relationship to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso trees the sponge zzso and zzso are grouped among the zzso sequences and are only zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the gene structure of the zzso zzso zzso showed that the single zzso present is located within the zzso domain at the same position as in zzso zzso and rat zzso In addition, a sponge zzso zzso two death zzso has been characterized from zzso zzso The two death zzso of the potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso share a high similarity with the zzso zzso A death zzso zzso has not been identified in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis revealed that the sponge domain originated from an zzso building block from which the zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso pathways that involve members of the zzso zzso and of the death receptors are already present in the lowest zzso zzso the zzso
