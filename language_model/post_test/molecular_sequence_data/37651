A zzso family zzso male specific serum zzso zzso that show significant structural similarity to the family of insect zzso binding zzso has been characterized in the zzso zzso zzso This family comprises seven members classified in three subgroups, zzso zzso and zzso The genes of zzso alpha and beta are clustered in tandem in a zzso zzso region, and present an exceptionally high degree of similarity not only in their coding but also in the surrounding regions, while the genes of the gamma zzso are drastically zzso Although zzso are predominantly expressed in the male fat body, detailed expression studies suggest that individual members of this family are expressed in a distinct zzso and zzso zzso
