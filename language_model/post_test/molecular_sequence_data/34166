During zzso zzso field infectious zzso viruses zzso were isolated from commercial chicken farms in zzso After sequencing of the complete zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed and this found that the Thai zzso zzso were divided into three distinct groups, unique to Thailand zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Massachusetts type zzso zzso This finding indicated that the recent Thai zzso evolved separately and that at least three groups of viruses are circulating in zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso gene demonstrated that the zzso of the group I was similar to isolate zzso which was unique to zzso isolated in 1998 whereas the zzso was similar to the group zzso Moreover, the analysis of the zzso gene of the group II showed that the zzso was similar to zzso isolated in China whereas the remaining region at the zzso was similar to the Chinese strain zzso The results indicated that the zzso events occurred in the zzso gene between the field zzso Based on these facts, the field zzso in Thailand has undergone genetic zzso
