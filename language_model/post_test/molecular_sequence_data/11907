zzso zzso and human zzso have a very limited lifespan in culture and are not readily zzso to transformation studies in zzso To facilitate the investigation of early genetic events involved in zzso we examined a transformation zzso system utilizing zzso immortalized mouse liver zzso cells as an alternative to primary zzso By infecting primary mouse zzso with a zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso virus 40 large T zzso zzso two mouse liver zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were zzso Because of the zzso nature of the large T zzso the cell lines proliferated rapidly at 33 degrees C, but were zzso at 39 degrees zzso Because activated zzso and zzso zzso are frequently found to be involved in mouse zzso in zzso we assessed whether those zzso can complement the zzso function of the large T zzso at the zzso zzso When zzso cells were doubly zzso with activated zzso and zzso at 33 degrees C, they exhibited zzso growth ability even after shifting the temperature to 39 degrees zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso alone allowed growth at 39 degrees zzso On the other hand, zzso alone was sufficient for overcoming the growth zzso of zzso cells at 39 degrees C, whereas zzso alone was again zzso Northern zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso expression was significantly zzso in the parental zzso cells after a temperature shift from 33 to 39 degrees zzso In contrast, in the parental zzso cells, appreciable zzso expression was observed at both zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso can cooperate in zzso the ability of the zzso large T zzso to zzso mouse liver cells at the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso but not zzso cooperated with the functional T zzso at 33 degrees C to allow growth in soft zzso of the zzso and zzso cell zzso However, cell lines carrying zzso zzso and zzso zzso were unable to grow in soft zzso at 39 degrees zzso Thus, the two cellular zzso were insufficient for full transformation of the liver zzso zzso The present in zzso model should be useful for investigating molecular events involved in both early and late stages of zzso
