The zzso zzso zzso zzso described in zzso major as a highly zzso zzso zzso been zzso The zzso zzso coding region is zzso with respect to the zzso major gene zzso sequence zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso sequence reveals structural motifs showing zzso with the class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is a zzso zzso probably consisting of two gene zzso The zzso zzso protein expressed in fusion with the zzso coli zzso protein shows a tendency to form zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso open reading frame are highly zzso and tend to delete or modify the zzso which suggests that expression of zzso is toxic for the zzso
