zzso to zzso zzso zzso is produced spontaneously in mice, by approximately zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso B cells in the zzso Much of this zzso is zzso by the zzso gene associated with a specific V zzso 9 zzso zzso on the size and structure of the H chain zzso have been defined from zzso sequences of genes expressed by zzso and zzso derived from adult zzso All employ zzso and all zzso zzso as the first zzso acid in zzso which is either nine or 10 zzso acids zzso the last six are always the same, start with zzso and are rich in aromatic zzso zzso Those with nine zzso acids in zzso have zzso or zzso in the second position and zzso zzso or zzso in the third; those with 10 have an additional zzso or zzso inserted after the first zzso zzso genes are used by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso rearranged zzso genes in zzso and in 18 day fetal liver display a greater, but still limited degree of zzso All four zzso genes are used and the length of zzso varies from three to 12 zzso zzso but the first is zzso in 58 of 61 and zzso genes are used by zzso of these productive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in fetal liver show a different zzso zzso use zzso genes and only zzso have a zzso zzso in the first position of zzso All zzso show evidence of a bias in favor of joining the zzso gene to D genes at positions of matching zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
