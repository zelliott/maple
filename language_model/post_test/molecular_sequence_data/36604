zzso was zzso from larvae of the blowfly zzso zzso and studied in its zzso form and after zzso at pH zzso into native zzso In accordance with earlier literature, it was zzso shown to be a 500 zzso zzso (1 zzso 6) consisting of 78 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso stained zzso show a characteristic zzso zzso triangle of 12 zzso in diameter zzso zzso and a rectangle measuring 10 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso particles in the top view orientation exhibit a roughly circular shape 12 zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of a major zzso type; the nature of a very minor and a third zzso separated component remains zzso A novel 2 zzso 6 zzso particle was detected and zzso It comprises less than zzso of the total zzso material and shows a long, narrow zzso bridge in the electron zzso An zzso zzso intermediate identified as a zzso zzso zzso 6) was zzso its possible zzso structure is discussed on the basis of electron zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso d and also zzso to zzso zzso was traced to a highly zzso zzso of 27 zzso acids localized in the center of the zzso The primary structure of zzso zzso as published in our preceding paper zzso and zzso zzso is compared in detail to the sequences of zzso and zzso lobster zzso This revealed a basic framework of 103 strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso exchanges are proposed for another 76 zzso On the basis of these similarities, and the published three-dimensional model of zzso lobster zzso a detailed model of the zzso structure of zzso zzso is zzso A second zzso storage protein previously termed protein II was zzso from zzso zzso It was demonstrated to be a 500 zzso zzso of 83 zzso zzso In the electron microscope it shows a cubic view 9 zzso in length with a large central hole and a zzso view (9 zzso 10 zzso with a large central zzso A zzso very similar zzso protein was detected in zzso zzso zzso From its structural appearance it is uncertain whether protein II belongs to the zzso zzso or zzso
