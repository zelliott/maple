zzso zzso is recognized as opportunistic pathogen that can cause lung infections in zzso zzso zzso A hallmark of zzso zzso infections is the inability to eradicate the zzso because of multiple intrinsic zzso zzso As zzso zzso zzso systems are responsible for much of the intrinsic zzso resistance in zzso bacteria, this study aims to identify zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso and start to investigate their involvement into zzso zzso 

Genome analysis and zzso searches revealed 14 open reading frames zzso putative drug zzso pumps belonging to zzso family in zzso zzso zzso zzso By reverse zzso zzso analysis, it was found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at zzso levels, while zzso appeared to be zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso was strongly induced by zzso The zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso a strain lacking the zzso zzso pump zzso The zzso zzso coli also accumulate low zzso of zzso zzso which was restored to wild type level in the presence of zzso an energy zzso altering the energy of the drug zzso zzso 

The 14 zzso pumps gene we have identified in the zzso of zzso zzso suggest that active zzso could be a major mechanism underlying zzso resistance in this zzso We have characterized the zzso zzso one of these 14 potential zzso zzso zzso Its zzso in zzso coli zzso resistance to several antibiotics and to zzso zzso but it remains to be determined if this pump play a significant role in the zzso intrinsic resistance of zzso zzso The characterization of zzso zzso pumps in zzso zzso is an obligatory step prior to the design of specific, potent bacterial zzso for the improved control of infectious zzso zzso the topic deserves to be further investigated and future studies will involve systematic investigation on the function and expression of each of the zzso zzso pump zzso
