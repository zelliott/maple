The peripheral detection of painful stimuli requires the zzso of zzso primary zzso zzso known as zzso We have exploited two features of zzso biology, expression of the high affinity zzso for nerve growth factor zzso and sensitivity to zzso to isolate novel proteins using a differential display cloning zzso A resulting approximately zzso zzso was isolated and sequence analysis zzso a approximately zzso protein containing a zzso targeting zzso zzso Due to its molecular weight and significant zzso acid identity with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso motif containing zzso we termed the zzso candidate zzso protein 157 zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso cells zzso the candidate zzso showed a single protein product of similar size to that found in rat zzso root zzso as well as in other zzso zzso and cell zzso Although expressed in a wide variety of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso root zzso revealed that zzso expression was restricted to the zzso zzso zzso identity with previously characterized zzso binding proteins and its zzso zzso in sensory zzso suggest that zzso is associated with zzso zzso Moreover, the genetic basis of zzso Leigh syndrome, which zzso a loss of zzso zzso c zzso and is characterized by zzso was recently mapped to a zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together with its expression in zzso sensory zzso we zzso that zzso the rat zzso of the human zzso may play a role in the zzso of peripheral pain zzso and serve as a novel marker for zzso zzso
