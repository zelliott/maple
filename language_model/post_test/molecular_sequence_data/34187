The gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as its zzso zzso in zzso is involved in viral zzso For a better understanding of its role in the viral life cycle, a library of random zzso zzso was generated by modified zzso zzso scanning zzso A comprehensive set of zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso and tested for their capacity to complement the zzso zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso of zzso were identified, which were tested in a second screen for their capacity to inhibit virus zzso This analysis identified two zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a dominant negative zzso We compared zzso induced by the conditional expression of these dominant negative zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The viral gene expression cascade and the nuclear zzso steps were not affected in either zzso In both cases, however, secondary zzso did not proceed in the absence of functional zzso and zzso subsequently accumulated in the center of the zzso assembly zzso In addition, deletion of zzso resulted in a block of zzso zzso Moreover, the dominant negative zzso of zzso demonstrated a zzso in interacting with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso
