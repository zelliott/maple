A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a pediatric patient with two zzso primary zzso that are constituent tumors of the zzso zzso zzso DNA from the second tumor showed the same zzso and loss of zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and protein were present in the tumor zzso In contrast, in the normal zzso bearing the zzso zzso in the zzso state, predominantly normal zzso was expressed and the zzso zzso protein was not zzso The functional silence and relative lack of zzso zzso zzso expression in the normal zzso of this patient may be caused by decreased stability or decreased zzso If this proves a more general pattern of expression of zzso zzso in individuals with zzso zzso these findings may explain the paucity of tumors in individuals affected with the zzso zzso
