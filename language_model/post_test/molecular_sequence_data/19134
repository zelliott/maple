We report a new step in the zzso in zzso zzso which has been found to involve zzso of zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso which increases zzso zzso zzso to release zzso calcium zzso zzso species analysis and mass zzso suggested that zzso activate zzso D zzso to elevate zzso acid zzso We now report that PA mass increased zzso fold by 1 zzso after zzso and zzso of PA production by two methods inhibited zzso of zzso and zzso increased zzso and other zzso zzso As compared to 14 other zzso PA specifically bound zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of synthetic PA activated egg zzso (an action requiring intact zzso zzso and zzso as well as doubling the amount of zzso in zzso In the absence of elevated zzso PA addition elevated zzso mass to levels equivalent to that induced by zzso (but twice that achieved by calcium zzso Finally, PA induced zzso release that was blocked by an zzso zzso zzso As only zzso message was zzso and Western zzso did not detect zzso we suggest that zzso activate zzso to elevate PA which then binds to and activates zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Due to these and other studies, PA may also play a role in membrane fusion events such as zzso fusion, cortical zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and the large, late increase in zzso zzso in zzso
