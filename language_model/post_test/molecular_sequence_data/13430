The zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso gene zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso gene codes for a 191 zzso acid protein with a predicted zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in a rabbit zzso system generated a protein with an zzso of zzso in close agreement with the molecular mass predicted from the zzso zzso zzso is not significantly zzso to any known zzso nor is a zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression studies indicated that the zzso gene was transcribed at readily zzso levels in the presence of zzso zzso were detected immediately after the virus zzso period and throughout the infection zzso The early zzso start sites of zzso map to a sequence that resembles a subset of zzso zzso II zzso sites that are found upstream of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes which lack zzso box zzso Several consensus late zzso zzso start site sequences zzso were identified upstream of the zzso gene start zzso
