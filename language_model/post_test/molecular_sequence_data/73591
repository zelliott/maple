A zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso gene has been tested for biological zzso The zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso repeats that are expressed zzso in the zzso of liver zzso zzso by the single copy zzso When human zzso cells are zzso with expression plasmids carrying this zzso in forward zzso zzso or replacing zzso zzso in the 3' ends of the zzso units, zzso reporter gene expression is attenuated 47 to 59% or zzso zzso In contrast, when the zzso is tested similarly in reverse orientation, there is significantly less or no zzso of gene zzso These zzso and computer models of partial zzso repeat DNA zzso and zzso secondary structures, suggest that this zzso might regulate gene expression by orientation and zzso mechanisms at zzso and zzso zzso
