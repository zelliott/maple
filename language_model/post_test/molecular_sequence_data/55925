In previous work, we have shown that the first (and, presumably, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been lowered by about 2 units zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso One reason for the zzso zzso of this zzso appears to be its location at the zzso of a short zzso that runs from zzso 95 to zzso Fortuitously, the zzso at the zzso of this zzso is also a zzso zzso zzso and the existence of a zzso side chain at each end has allowed us directly to zzso the zzso in the zzso of the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the native zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso show that while the zzso of zzso is lowered by a least 2 units in the folded versus the unfolded state, the zzso of zzso is raised by about zzso unit on protein zzso These complementary effects on the zzso values of zzso and zzso suggest that the zzso is indeed responsible for the zzso of the zzso zzso The larger effect on the zzso of zzso is readily rationalized in terms of the local structure of the zzso The disparity in the zzso for the two zzso side chains illustrates how an zzso can be functionally zzso by zzso directly to affect (as in the present zzso the chemistry of zzso by an zzso
