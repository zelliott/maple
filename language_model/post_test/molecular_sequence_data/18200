zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to efficiently terminate zzso at the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso In this study, efficient zzso termination by the zzso zzso zzso was observed at a second zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso occurred regardless of the orientation of either zzso In zzso zzso DNA, the genes for the beta zzso of the zzso zzso and the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are adjacent and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso were constructed to analyze the zzso oriented zzso and zzso zzso One zzso construction, zzso contained two tandem copies of the zzso zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso and zzso each contained zzso oriented copies of zzso and zzso A DNA zzso containing the zzso and zzso promoters was inserted between the two zzso present in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso by spinach zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso sized zzso and zzso zzso In addition, these zzso zzso zzso were used to identify previously zzso zzso zzso
