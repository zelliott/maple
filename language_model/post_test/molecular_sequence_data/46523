Four zzso zzso II promoters have been mapped in the DNA sequence of the zzso and zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso transcribed from three of these promoters are dramatically induced by treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso The other promoter is active with or without zzso treatment of the cells and is thus active in the zzso virus zzso zzso mapping suggests that DNA sequence zzso between some of the promoters lie in the same region as essential upstream promoter zzso
