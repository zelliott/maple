The promise of zzso to provide a vast library of protein structural data is exciting to scientists zzso an unprecedented understanding of the relationship between protein structure and zzso This powerful knowledge will provide insight into the design rules for zzso which are zzso and zzso that can be more stable and inexpensive to produce than natural zzso but still emulate the main biological function of the natural zzso This Emerging Area article is intended to stimulate discussion on innovative strategies to design the next generation of zzso zzso we will examine the design evolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds that act as synthetic mimics of zzso peptides zzso and are known to interact with zzso zzso An increasingly important goal in the field of zzso zzso is to develop strategies to rationally design zzso zzso that are highly zzso from any preferred backbone and molecular zzso It is expected that lessons learned from studying these zzso can be applied to other systems where mimics are desired to interact with extended surfaces and where it would be most productive to consider mimicking the protein of interest with a large zzso zzso examples include zzso zzso interactions or binding long tracts of DNA to control gene zzso
