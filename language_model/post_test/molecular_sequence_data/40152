An zzso mixture of avian pancreatic zzso zzso fragments zzso and zzso had an electronic circular zzso zzso spectrum that was similar to that of whole zzso in zzso and even more so in zzso zzso zzso zzso in 15 zzso zzso but was different from the sum of the zzso of the individual zzso The zzso circular zzso zzso spectrum of the combined fragments in zzso zzso zzso in 15 zzso zzso in zzso was also similar to that of the intact zzso and unlike the sum of the zzso zzso of the zzso The interaction of these fragments is thus sufficient to support the zzso of whole zzso This study demonstrates that zzso in combination with zzso is useful for the study of zzso zzso
