zzso zzso bind to zzso receptors and are integral in transmission of signals from outside the zzso Upon zzso of the zzso zzso by binding of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and interact with zzso proteins for signal zzso Regulatory proteins with the zzso zzso motif can bind to zzso zzso and maintain zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Here we describe the structural zzso of zzso activity as revealed by the crystal structure of zzso zzso bound to the zzso region of the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso Key contacts are described between the zzso motif and zzso zzso including the extension of zzso highly zzso zzso zzso into the zzso pocket of zzso to make direct contact with the zzso zzso and zzso The structural organization of the zzso zzso complex, when combined with supporting data from zzso experiments, suggests that the zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso control the specificity of zzso zzso zzso
