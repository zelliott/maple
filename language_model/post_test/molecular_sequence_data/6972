The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has a structure similar to other zzso zzso The DNA sequence immediately zzso to the termination site is zzso and contains a region of zzso symmetry that, when transcribed into zzso encodes a hairpin structure in the zzso It also contains a stretch of 9 consecutive zzso zzso immediately zzso to the region of zzso symmetry which zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end of the terminated zzso In addition, the zzso zzso has a stretch of 6 zzso zzso immediately upstream of the region of zzso symmetry which zzso 6 zzso These zzso could potentially pair with the zzso zzso to form a hairpin structure extended by as much as 6 zzso base zzso In this report we have examined the role of the upstream zzso in zzso zzso We used templates that specify zzso or create new base pairs in the potential zzso secondary structure of the transcript as well as templates that delete segments of the A zzso upstream of the zzso We conclude that zzso pairing is not required for efficient zzso termination at the zzso zzso This conclusion is likely to apply to other zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso
