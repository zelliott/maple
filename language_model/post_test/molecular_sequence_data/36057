zzso zzso a zzso fever agent, zzso zzso zzso variation to evade its zzso immune zzso zzso specificity is determined by variable membrane zzso zzso which are expressed from genes located near the end of a linear zzso Using the zzso chain reaction and zzso representing the promoter of the active zzso and a zzso zzso zzso we characterized the zzso expression regions of the 25 known zzso of strain zzso The distance from the promoter to the zzso fell into three size classes of approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the size differences were accounted for by variable lengths of the zzso genes and intervening sequences between 3' end of the zzso gene and the start of a downstream zzso zzso The degree of zzso identity between different zzso zzso or between the different 3' zzso DNA varied from zzso Thus, there is length and sequence zzso not only between zzso genes themselves but also between the 3' zzso regions of zzso zzso
