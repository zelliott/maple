We established new methods for cloning zzso ends that start with reverse zzso zzso and soon proceed with the synthesis of the second zzso zzso avoiding zzso of fragile zzso Our zzso cloning method does not involve zzso zzso and zzso chain reactions zzso is low in efficiency but high in zzso and can clone those zzso without a zzso zzso We also established a zzso protection zzso to zzso zzso protection zzso The protected zzso can be zzso cloned and zzso enhancing sensitivity and zzso We report that zzso product using zzso primer zzso cannot be zzso or zzso because zzso sample contains zzso random zzso zzso The zzso may be improved by adding a zzso sequence at the zzso of the zzso to prime zzso and using the zzso as a primer in the ensuing zzso The zzso may be improved by using zzso DNA zzso in our protection zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso are transcribed from the opposite DNA strands and overlap at their 3' zzso Using this relationship as a model, we found that the overlapped sequence might serve as a primer with its zzso as the template to create a zzso extension in zzso or zzso We zzso that two unrelated zzso or zzso overlapping at the zzso or zzso might create a zzso zzso in this way, and many zzso with a zzso sequence may be such zzso The zzso and overlapping zzso together set complex zzso which one should be aware zzso
