zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso selectively prevents colonization by zzso zzso in humans zzso zzso Ashley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protective zzso recognizes the beta component of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is formed by zzso processing of a zzso precursor termed zzso This zzso is both a zzso and an zzso which is recognized by zzso from patients with zzso In this study the relationship was investigated between a colonization zzso which is recognized by the zzso zzso a zzso and B cell zzso which are recognized by zzso from patients with zzso B cell zzso were mapped by Western zzso with a series of truncated zzso zzso spanning the zzso domain within zzso zzso of zzso and by zzso using a panel of synthetic peptides spanning the same zzso The zzso which is recognized by the protective zzso was mapped within zzso zzso of zzso while serum responses of patients were directed predominantly to the adjacent zzso sequence within zzso zzso The zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso In view of our previous findings that the zzso zzso prevents colonization of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso these two zzso may be in proximity in the native zzso Active or passive zzso strategies which target the protective or zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso may provide a means of preventing infection with zzso zzso
