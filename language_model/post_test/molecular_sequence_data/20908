The aim of the present study was to investigate zzso dynamics of the zzso zzso gene relative to two zzso genes zzso and zzso in batch cultures of three zzso zzso strains with low, zzso and high levels of zzso production, zzso The zzso transcript level was always low in the low zzso producing zzso For the two other zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso pattern and reached a maximum level in the late exponential growth zzso The zzso levels were however zzso correlated to zzso production for the two zzso We propose that this zzso is due to differences in zzso translation rates between the strains and that zzso zzso rates therefore must be determined before zzso production can be zzso from transcript levels in zzso zzso
