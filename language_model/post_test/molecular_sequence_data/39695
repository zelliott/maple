zzso is an zzso protein that is highly expressed in advanced zzso Several strategies have been employed to target the expression of this zzso including zzso an zzso zzso zzso targeted to the initiation region of the zzso zzso This compound has recently completed phase III global clinical zzso but the function of zzso as a target in melanoma has not been completely zzso To help resolve this question, we have permanently and zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso expression in zzso cells by two different technologies and evaluated the resulting clones both in zzso and in zzso 

zzso melanoma cells were zzso with plasmids engineered to produce either a zzso zzso zzso targeted to the initiation zzso region of the zzso zzso or a short hairpin zzso also targeted to the zzso zzso In zzso growth, the zzso response to zzso and the zzso release of zzso c from isolated zzso were zzso zzso were then zzso into severe combined zzso mice and tumor growth was zzso 

In zzso zzso of zzso expression by either method produced no change either in the rate of growth or in sensitivity to standard zzso zzso zzso Likewise, the induction of zzso by zzso was entirely zzso zzso In addition, the zzso release from isolated zzso was also relatively independent of zzso zzso However, when zzso into severe combined zzso mice, cells with silenced zzso using either technology, either failed to grow at all or grew to tumors of low volume and then completely zzso In contrast, control cells with zzso levels of zzso protein expression expanded to be large, zzso zzso 

The presence of zzso protein profoundly affects the ability of zzso melanoma cells to grow as human tumor zzso in severe combined zzso zzso The in zzso role of zzso in melanoma cells thus differs significantly from its in zzso role, and these experiments further suggest that zzso may be an important therapeutic target even in tumors that do not contain the zzso zzso
