A dysfunctional protein C zzso zzso zzso C zzso 2) was found in a 40-year-old man presenting with zzso deep vein zzso embolism and a family history of zzso zzso The patient exhibited a normal PC zzso level, normal zzso activity zzso zzso as PC zzso but markedly reduced zzso zzso After zzso of patient plasma onto zzso between zzso and zzso PC zzso activity but no zzso activity was zzso in the zzso The dysfunctional zzso exhibited reduced affinity for a zzso dependent zzso C zzso zzso as detected by specific zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that PC zzso 2 had an increased zzso (95 zzso v 65 zzso for normal zzso The zzso responsible was determined by zzso sequencing to be a zzso zzso transition in zzso 3 of the protein C gene resulting in the substitution of zzso by zzso at zzso in the zzso leader zzso The presence of a high zzso PC was consistent with the fact that zzso zzso the zzso (at least zzso still was attached to the protein C zzso This finding could also explain the strongly reduced affinity of PC zzso 2 for the zzso dependent zzso C zzso
