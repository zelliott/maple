zzso zzso play multiple roles in cell cycle regulation in zzso zzso In addition to the zzso domain, conservation at the primary sequence level is also found in the zzso region mainly in three blocks, namely the polo zzso Although several studies have implicated the polo boxes in protein zzso no systematic study to zzso the roles of individual polo boxes has been carried zzso Here we show, by using zzso zzso that the polo boxes form a single functional unit that is essential for both cellular function and zzso zzso to the zzso pole zzso Various polo box zzso abolish the zzso arrest seen upon zzso of zzso but do not prevent the untimely zzso seen under these conditions, showing that the functions of zzso may be zzso zzso interacts with multiple proteins including cell cycle regulators in a zzso zzso Isolation of zzso that zzso disrupt these interactions revealed a role for the polo boxes in zzso zzso zzso
