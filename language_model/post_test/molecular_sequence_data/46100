zzso zzso acid zzso zzso typically use zzso zzso as the zzso The zzso zzso zzso major requires zzso for growth and expresses strong salvage and zzso systems to maintain zzso zzso Here we explored the consequences of genetic manipulation of the sole zzso major zzso zzso zzso to explore whether it could account for the zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso resembles zzso of other organisms, bearing zzso domain organization, and conservation of key zzso zzso including those implicated in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were readily zzso and zzso labeling studies established that zzso was required to zzso zzso to zzso Neither zzso nor zzso lines were able to zzso zzso zzso or zzso nor to zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso showed zzso with an zzso to zzso when grown with zzso zzso although the zzso product is unlikely to be zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso activity was insufficient to meet normal zzso zzso However, zzso showed an increased sensitivity to zzso zzso while the zzso zzso showed increased survival and could be adapted to grow well without added zzso zzso showed no zzso in zzso zzso as established by in zzso zzso or survival in mouse or zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso may mitigate but not alleviate zzso zzso but plays no essential role in the steps of the zzso infectious zzso These findings suggest zzso is unlikely to explain the zzso requirement for zzso
