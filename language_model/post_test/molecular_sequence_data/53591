zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are reported to be capable of zzso all or two of the following three types of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso CDs and starch to zzso and zzso to zzso by zzso of zzso zzso bonds whereas zzso essentially lack activity on CDs and zzso They also catalyze zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso groups of various zzso sugar zzso The present review surveys the zzso zzso and structural properties of three types of such zzso as defined based on the zzso specificity toward the zzso type I, zzso and zzso zzso that zzso CDs much faster than zzso and zzso type II, zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso that zzso CDs much less efficiently than zzso and type III, zzso that zzso zzso zzso but remains to be reported to zzso zzso These three types of zzso exhibit zzso zzso acid sequence zzso They occur in the zzso of bacteria and have molecular masses from 62 to 90 zzso which are slightly larger than those of most zzso Multiple zzso acid sequence alignment and crystal structures of zzso zzso and zzso II reveal the presence of an zzso extension of approximately 130 zzso not found in zzso This unique zzso domain as seen in the crystal structures apparently contributes to the active site structure leading to the distinct zzso specificity through a zzso zzso In zzso solution, most of these zzso show a zzso zzso The present review discusses the multiple specificity in the light of the zzso and the molecular structures arriving at a clarified zzso zzso Finally, a zzso role of the zzso is zzso
