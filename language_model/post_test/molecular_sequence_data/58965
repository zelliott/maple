In the zzso zzso at specific choice points along the major motor nerves, zzso of motor zzso zzso and then steer into their muscle target zzso Here we describe the analysis of beaten path zzso a gene required for the selective zzso of motor zzso at these choice zzso In beat zzso zzso motor zzso fail to zzso and bypass their zzso This zzso is suppressed by zzso in zzso and zzso two genes zzso cell zzso molecules expressed on motor zzso suggesting that beat provides an zzso zzso beat encodes a novel zzso protein that is expressed by zzso during zzso zzso and zzso expression experiments support the model that Beat protein is zzso by motor zzso where it functions to regulate their selective zzso at specific choice zzso
