zzso zzso zzso is the second zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, an essential zzso zzso identified as a potential target for new zzso The sequence similarity among putative zzso is limited and zzso itself belongs to a large zzso of zzso zzso zzso it is necessary to discriminate between true and other zzso In this paper, we describe a systematic analysis of putative zzso in the context of this zzso zzso structural analysis allowed us to define key zzso for zzso activity and we classified eight structural zzso structures of the zzso family into four functional zzso We proposed a zzso zzso using zzso zzso recognition scores, for assigning zzso and related proteins to these zzso and applied it to a representative set of 103 completely zzso bacterial zzso A similar approach can be applied to other zzso families, which would aid the correct identification of drug targets and help design novel specific zzso
