Three strains of zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso M 1973 and M zzso isolated from milk of camels at a zzso production farm in the United Arab Emirates, were investigated for their zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, all three strains were shown to belong to the zzso and were most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence similarity to the respective type zzso zzso acid was detected as the characteristic zzso zzso zzso The zzso compound in the zzso pattern was zzso and zzso was not zzso The zzso system was zzso zzso The polar zzso profile included the major compounds zzso and zzso and moderate amounts of zzso zzso an unidentified zzso and two unidentified zzso Minor lipids were also zzso The major fatty acid profile, consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso as the major zzso fatty acid, was similar to those of the zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso experiments and zzso and zzso tests allowed both zzso and zzso differentiation of the zzso from described zzso zzso zzso M zzso M 1973 and M zzso were closely related on the basis of zzso zzso and therefore represent a single novel zzso In zzso low zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso with zzso zzso and marked differences in polar zzso profiles as well as in zzso patterns support the description of a novel zzso and species to accommodate these zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
