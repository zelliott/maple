zzso are zzso that zzso link proteins to the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene product anchors zzso and some other zzso proteins to the zzso zzso Here, we focus on the role of the second zzso zzso Whereas zzso acts on most of the proteins in the zzso zzso zzso appears to target minor amounts of surface zzso We identified one of the zzso proteins as the zzso factor zzso a zzso protein which does not contain the zzso zzso zzso as in zzso zzso the zzso zzso represents a second class of zzso in zzso zzso involved in the attachment of a subset of proteins to the cell wall, most likely by recognizing an zzso sorting zzso The zzso zzso strain does not have defects in bacterial entry, growth, or zzso in zzso cells and does not show attenuated zzso in zzso zzso zzso could therefore be required to anchor surface proteins involved in the adaptation of this zzso to different environmental zzso
