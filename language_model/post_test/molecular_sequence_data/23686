An important zzso factor of the opportunistic human pathogen zzso zzso is zzso a zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a larger precursor with an zzso 18 zzso zzso and was the first zzso shown to require its zzso as an zzso zzso zzso for activity and zzso This paper reports the analysis of the zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso among other zzso precursors that may be critical for its zzso zzso The zzso of zzso precursors from both zzso zzso species and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bacteria were found to show zzso to the zzso zzso Two regions of zzso zzso were zzso a zzso region zzso found in the middle of the zzso zzso and a more zzso region zzso located zzso to the zzso zzso To test whether such zzso motifs were important to function, single zzso zzso at eight zzso zzso acids were introduced within the full-length zzso precursor by zzso zzso of zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed from plasmids within a zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso and the effects of these zzso zzso on zzso zzso activity, processing, stability and zzso inside and outside of the cell were zzso Within the zzso region, substitution at zzso resulted in a dramatic zzso of zzso in the cell, suggesting a zzso zzso and a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso adversely affected the amount of zzso in the culture zzso apparently as a result of the reduced stability of the zzso zzso in the zzso Within the zzso region, zzso at zzso and zzso abolished the zzso of a stable zzso zzso in the zzso Most zzso produced a zzso consistent with a zzso in protein folding and zzso Overall, the data from this preliminary study show that zzso zzso within the zzso zzso are essential for its function and begin to define the mechanisms of action of zzso in the zzso zzso
