zzso are increasingly used to block the transmission of diseases spread by Aedes aegypti such as dengue and yellow zzso However, zzso resistance poses a serious threat, thus there is an urgent need to identify the genes and proteins associated with zzso resistance in order to produce effective counter zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso such as the zzso gene have been linked with zzso zzso Our aim was to confirm the role of zzso and other zzso in zzso metabolism in order to identify potential diagnostic resistance zzso 

We have expressed zzso in zzso coli and show that the zzso can metabolize the zzso zzso and zzso In addition, three other zzso aegypti zzso zzso zzso zzso were found capable of zzso zzso albeit with lower zzso Both zzso aegypti and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened against zzso and zzso zzso to identify potential diagnostic zzso for zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso by the three major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identifying a potential diagnostic zzso for these zzso 

zzso have been identified with the potential to zzso zzso resistance in zzso It is recommended that over expression of these zzso should be monitored as indicators of resistance where zzso are zzso
