A comprehensive zzso sample zzso with an integrated two-dimensional zzso system was developed for the analysis of natural zzso zzso comprised of zzso peptides with molecular weights up to 20 zzso were generated from human zzso zzso obtained from patients with chronic zzso zzso The zzso were separated using novel zzso restricted access materials with strong zzso zzso zzso The zzso sample zzso step is followed by zzso zzso as the first zzso The subsequent second dimension of separation is based on zzso interaction using four parallel short zzso zzso columns implemented via a fully automated column switching zzso More than 1000 zzso were resolved within the total analysis time of 96 zzso Substances of selected zzso were sampled to zzso their molecular weights by zzso zzso mass zzso and to determine their zzso acid sequence by zzso zzso The potential for comprehensive zzso mapping and identification is zzso
