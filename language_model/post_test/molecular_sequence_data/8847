zzso of zzso by diverse zzso signals is dependent on zzso of zzso zzso This process of cell death can be blocked by zzso D, indicating that it requires gene zzso zzso To identify genes that are required for zzso we used zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso and thereby increases zzso zzso Exposure to zzso led to induction of the zinc finger zzso factor, zzso and zzso in human melanoma cells, zzso To determine the functional relevance of zzso expression in zzso zzso we employed a dominant negative zzso which functionally competes with zzso in these zzso Interestingly, the dominant negative zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso with this zzso an zzso zzso directed against zzso also led to a diminution of the number of cells that undergo zzso zzso These results suggest a novel regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso that is induced by zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that in these melanoma cells, zzso acts to inhibit the growth arresting action of zzso Together, these results imply that zzso plays zzso roles in growth zzso
