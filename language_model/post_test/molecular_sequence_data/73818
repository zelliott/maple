The zzso gene zzso the alpha zzso of the Go protein generates by alternative zzso two zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso which differ in their zzso zzso We report here the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso which encodes a protein corresponding to the zzso alpha zzso zzso In its 3' untranslated region, the transcript contains a repetitive motif made up of zzso AT zzso By zzso amplification, we showed that zzso alpha zzso transcripts are both maternal and zzso As alpha zzso transcripts have been shown to be maternal and devoid of AT repeats, the repetitive motif could play a role in the differential expression of each zzso
