The zzso genes of zzso are expressed in early zzso but are silenced during fetal and adult zzso As a guide to defining the regulatory elements involved in this zzso switch, we have searched the sequences of zzso genes from different zzso for highly zzso zzso The search was facilitated by the development of a new program, called zzso to generate a multiple alignment of very long sequences using an improved scoring zzso This allowed us to generate a multiple alignment of sequences from a more divergent group than previously zzso as demonstrated here for representatives of four zzso zzso In parallel experiments, we constructed a series of deletion zzso in the zzso flank of the rabbit zzso gene and tested their effect on an zzso hybrid reporter zzso These results show that 121 zzso of zzso flank, containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso is sufficient for expression in zzso zzso zzso Both positive and negative zzso control sequences are located between 218 and zzso zzso zzso to the cap site, in a region previously proposed to be a zzso The positive regulatory sequence contains zzso binding sites for the nuclear protein zzso adjacent to another highly zzso zzso The negative element contains a zzso sequence followed by a zzso zzso This analysis maps the upstream control sequences more precisely and points to a very complex regulatory scheme for this zzso
