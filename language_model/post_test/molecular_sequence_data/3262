zzso signaling controls many fundamental processes during animal zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the association of zzso with nuclear zzso DNA binding zzso Here we report the identification of two segment polarity genes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and we show that their products are required for zzso signal zzso at the level of nuclear zzso zzso encodes the zzso of human zzso and we provide genetic and molecular evidence that these proteins exert their function by physically linking zzso to zzso Our results suggest that the recruitment of zzso permits zzso to zzso activate zzso target genes and raise the possibility that a deregulation of these events may play a zzso role in the development of B cell zzso
