zzso are potent zzso zzso toxins specific for zzso zzso They are structurally similar to members of the zzso zzso zzso family that bind zzso exposed zzso zzso In the present study we found a number of sequences in public databases with similarity to zzso They originate from three animal and two plant zzso and can be classified in three families according to zzso zzso The sequence similarity is confined to a region from the zzso half of the zzso zzso and comprises the membrane binding site with a highly zzso zzso zzso A member of this novel zzso protein family from zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso It displays zzso zzso but does not have zzso activity or zzso zzso two properties typical of zzso We propose that the three families of zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso family comprise a novel zzso of membrane binding zzso tentatively called zzso zzso zzso from zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso
