A method to analyze the performance of an zzso capture method using fluorescent peptides by zzso zone zzso using zzso zzso zzso for detection has been zzso Fluorescent peptides from the prion protein were zzso and the corresponding zzso were produced in rabbits against these zzso The zzso were used to capture the fluorescent zzso The zzso were then bound to protein A zzso After zzso the amount of fluorescent zzso that was captured zzso the total amount placed in the zzso was evaluated by zzso Of the three peptides used in this zzso it was found that the recovery was approximately zzso When the abnormal prion protein was prepared from zzso brain samples from zzso and a sheep using the previously described extraction method and this method, the amount of abnormal prion protein that was measured in the zzso zzso correlated with amounts estimated from Western zzso We conclude that this method can be used to detect abnormal prion protein in a tissue zzso
