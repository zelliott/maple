The planted zzso zzso search problem is a mathematical abstraction of the DNA functional site discovery zzso In this paper, we propose a zzso zzso that can find planted zzso zzso in a given set of DNA zzso zzso on simulated data sets demonstrate that the proposed zzso zzso current widely used motif finding zzso We also report the results of experiments on real biological data zzso
