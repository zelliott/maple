zzso peptides of integral membrane proteins often exhibit extremely high zzso zzso the zzso of such peptides in zzso commonly used in zzso is usually very low and the interaction with generally applied stationary zzso such as zzso gel or zzso reversed zzso appears to be extremely strong, which makes the characterization and zzso of these peptides zzso The zzso characterization and zzso separation of the zzso zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and some of its fragments is zzso zzso and its larger fragments could be dissolved in a zzso mixture containing a trace amount of zzso for their separation on a C4 phase by employing linear zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with ratios up to zzso zzso zzso to avoid zzso of the peptides are zzso
