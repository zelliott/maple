A zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso was characterized and its zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso A1 did not show any similarity to those of other zzso zzso that has been zzso the zzso part, containing both a putative zzso domain and zzso repeating units, showed a similarity zzso to that of zzso D from zzso zzso A site of initiation of zzso was found approximately 51 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso The promoter region of the zzso gene was zzso on a zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso zzso expression of the zzso resistance zzso One of the deleted zzso which contained a zzso sequence upstream from the translation start zzso retained both zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso zzso production was lost in an other deleted zzso containing the zzso upstream zzso
