zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common fatal zzso and chronic infection with zzso C virus zzso is thought to be one of the main causes in zzso To identify diagnostic or therapeutic zzso for zzso associated with zzso zzso we tried to zzso the factors related to the products from zzso zzso of zzso zzso From zzso differential display analysis of liver tissue samples from zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso from patients, three protein spots of the same molecular mass zzso zzso whose expression increased in zzso zzso zzso were zzso Although their zzso were different, they were identified as zzso zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso and by Western zzso using zzso specific zzso zzso analysis showed that tumor tissue consists of two parts, zzso cell and zzso cell regions, suggesting that zzso cells grew in the tumor tissue as a zzso in zzso The zzso peptides of the most zzso zzso zzso lost the signal of zzso zzso corresponding a zzso of zzso and gained a signal of zzso zzso which was submitted to zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the neutral loss by elimination of two zzso groups, supposed to be on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso 320 to zzso zzso in zzso zzso followed by zzso analysis is thought to be useful for the determination of zzso sites of proteins showing molecular zzso
