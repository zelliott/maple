zzso protein is a putative zzso zzso regulator from zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso was determined at zzso A resolution by zzso anomalous zzso zzso phasing using the S atoms of the native zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso motif in its zzso region and forms a zzso The overall structure of zzso shows significant similarity to other zzso zzso A systematic evolution of zzso by exponential enrichment zzso analysis indicated that zzso has zzso zzso ability and determined the position of the operator element of zzso on the zzso DNA of zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso binds to the operator sequence upstream of the zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso that regulates zzso gene zzso
