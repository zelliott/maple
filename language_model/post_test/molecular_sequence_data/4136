We report the isolation of a novel zzso zzso bass zzso from the zzso of hybrid striped zzso white bass zzso zzso zzso striped bass zzso zzso After the zzso injection of zzso zzso and zzso coli, the zzso was zzso from zzso zzso with zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso by zzso degradation revealed a zzso zzso zzso with eight putative zzso zzso mass zzso of the native zzso and the reduced and zzso zzso confirmed the sequence with four zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso to human zzso and other predicted zzso indicated that the zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso zzso sequences for zzso and zzso DNA were determined for white zzso A predicted zzso (85 zzso zzso consists of three zzso a signal zzso (24 zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso zzso and a mature zzso (21 zzso zzso The gene has two zzso and three zzso A zzso box and several zzso motifs for zzso factors including zzso nuclear zzso and zzso nuclear factor were found in the region upstream of the zzso start zzso In white bass liver, zzso gene expression was induced zzso following challenge with the fish zzso zzso zzso while expression levels remained low in all other zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso from the zzso bass zzso is predominantly expressed in the liver and highly zzso by bacterial zzso
