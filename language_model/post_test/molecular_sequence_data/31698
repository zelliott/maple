Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso recovered from spruce litter were examined using a zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties of the zzso were found to be consistent with their zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso were shown to have identical zzso zzso gene sequences and were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso However, zzso zzso between isolate zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso was found to be low at zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso features, including zzso and nutritional characteristics were shown to distinguish the zzso from their nearest zzso zzso Data from this study show that the zzso form a novel species in the zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
