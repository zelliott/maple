The origin recognition complex zzso is an zzso protein for DNA zzso but also effects zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso It is not known, however, whether any of these functions of zzso is zzso in zzso We report the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso that interacts with human zzso zzso the largest zzso of zzso zzso exists as part of a zzso complex that possesses zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A fraction of the relatively abundant zzso protein associates with zzso in human cell zzso zzso is a member of the zzso domain family that includes zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in control of zzso zzso that also has been genetically linked to zzso zzso Thus the interaction between zzso and a zzso domain zzso is widely zzso We suggest roles for zzso zzso of zzso in control of both DNA replication and gene zzso
