The soybean zzso family of zzso zzso encodes an zzso gene zzso We zzso the DNA sequences of nine zzso insertions and observed that the zzso and zzso genes are in the same reading frame and separated by a single zzso stop zzso The six zzso immediately downstream of the stop zzso conform to a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is sufficient to facilitate stop zzso suppression in tobacco mosaic zzso In zzso stop zzso suppression zzso indicate that zzso sequences zzso zzso to the zzso stop zzso at an efficiency of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso use zzso suppression to express their zzso zzso this is in contrast with all characterized zzso which express the envelope protein from a spliced zzso zzso zzso
