Mice zzso for a disrupted transforming growth factor alpha zzso zzso gene are healthy and zzso although some older mice show evidence of zzso zzso In contrast with zzso alpha zzso and zzso animals, zzso alpha zzso mice have a pronounced zzso of the zzso zzso examination of the skin from zzso alpha zzso mice reveals a dramatic zzso of hair zzso Mice with a disrupted zzso alpha gene also have zzso zzso first evident on the day of zzso The zzso of zzso alpha zzso mice is remarkably similar to that of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting from crosses between zzso alpha zzso and zzso mice display the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the basis of the zzso zzso is a zzso in the zzso alpha zzso These observations suggest that zzso alpha plays a pivotal role in determining skin architecture and in regulating hair zzso
