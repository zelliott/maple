zzso zzso in patients with familial zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso products from zzso patients for deletions of this gene formed four distinct bands on zzso gel zzso The four fragments were subsequently zzso and both strands of each zzso were directly zzso using an automated DNA zzso and the same zzso as those for zzso zzso It was found that the two slower zzso fragments were zzso zzso while the other two were zzso made up of two zzso strands and two zzso zzso zzso The sites of deletions in the zzso zzso coli gene could be exactly determined in four of the five zzso In an attempt to identify zzso of familial zzso zzso at the zzso stage, a family study was also carried out, and two children were found to have the same zzso as those of their affected zzso The direct sequencing of zzso fragments generated during zzso amplification is a potentially useful method for detecting zzso of not only the zzso zzso coli gene but also many other genes of genetic zzso
