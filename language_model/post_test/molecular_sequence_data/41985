zzso receptors on the zzso terminals of a zzso can be located a considerable distance away from comparable receptors on the cell body or zzso of the same zzso We examined the effects of zzso either nerve terminal receptors or those located on or near the zzso of chick zzso zzso Cell body responses were measured via zzso recording in a brain slice zzso To measure nerve terminal responses, zzso recordings were obtained from the large, zzso nerve endings in intact zzso zzso which zzso from zzso of the lateral zzso zzso Cell bodies of zzso zzso responded to zzso with a zzso zzso that was associated with a decrease in input zzso In spontaneously active zzso zzso zzso caused marked zzso of zzso and zzso activity, indicating that, as with a number of other central zzso the major effect of zzso was to reduce zzso The response to zzso was sensitive to zzso (1 zzso and was a direct effect, since it was not blocked by either zzso zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso More selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced effects similar to those of zzso zzso produced zzso different effects in the nerve terminals of zzso zzso where the major effect was a zzso associated with a decrease in input zzso The effects of zzso in the terminals were reduced in a low sodium zzso indicating that they were dependent on the presence of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
