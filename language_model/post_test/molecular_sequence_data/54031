zzso plasma zzso contain a small 55 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which has high sequence similarity to a novel family of plant zzso that are zzso under high salt concentration or low temperature zzso The zzso gene is not essential under normal growth zzso However, its deletion increases the plasma membrane potential and zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the disruption of zzso zzso the zzso sensitivity zzso of a zzso strain lacking the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and suppresses the zzso dependency of a strain lacking the zzso zzso zzso and zzso All these zzso could be reversed by the addition of high zzso concentration to the zzso These genetic interactions indicate that the major effect of the zzso deletion is a zzso of the plasma membrane potential that probably promotes a zzso influx of zzso zzso zzso of plant zzso in zzso could substitute for the loss of zzso indicating a common role for zzso and the plant zzso
