The presence of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined among 76 common zzso zzso zzso from Northwest zzso zzso zzso DNA was recovered from the blood of 1 shrew zzso with the amplified zzso zzso sequence identical to one previously reported from a bank zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in 9 zzso zzso the amplified zzso zzso fragments being indistinguishable from one another, and distinct from previously published zzso This represents the first report of zzso infection in zzso zzso and suggests they are susceptible to an zzso zzso zzso Blood from 11 zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso with characterization of zzso using comparative sequence analysis of partial zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regions revealing 2 different zzso zzso zzso from alignment of partial zzso sequences found that both UK zzso zzso types formed a zzso cluster with zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso in zzso No significant effect of host age, sex, or year of collection was found on prevalence of zzso or zzso zzso The results of this survey demonstrate that common zzso in the UK are susceptible to zzso infections, at zzso similar to those reported from zzso zzso
