zzso zzso zzso requires the concerted action of numerous zzso assembly factors, for most of which structural and functional information is currently zzso zzso which can be identified in zzso and zzso is required for the final maturation of the small zzso zzso zzso in zzso by catalyzing zzso at site D after export of the zzso zzso into the zzso Here, we show that this also holds true for zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which efficiently zzso zzso containing the zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The structure of zzso solved by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso revealed a zzso domain common with many zzso and a zinc ribbon domain, which are structurally connected by a flexible zzso We show that zzso acid zzso required for zzso binding reside in the zzso domain whereas the zinc ribbon domain alone is sufficient to bind zzso 40 of the small zzso zzso This suggests that the zinc ribbon domain acts as an anchor point for the protein on the nascent zzso positioning it in the proximity of the zzso zzso
