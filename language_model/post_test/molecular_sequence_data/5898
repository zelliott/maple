zzso zzso strains isolated from most patients with zzso zzso disease and zzso express the zzso toxin zzso and contain a zzso island named zzso The zzso zzso island codes for more than 40 putative proteins with features similar to bacterial zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso is an zzso zzso with unknown function zzso by the zzso zzso In the present study, we have zzso the functional promoter elements of the zzso zzso zzso gene as well as of the zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso extension analyses identified a single zzso end of the zzso zzso while two initiation sites were mapped in the case of the zzso zzso The promoters deduced upstream of these start points of zzso contained zzso zzso regions but no zzso regions with respect to the zzso coli zzso consensus zzso Nevertheless, they could be activated in zzso coli and in zzso by zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso and zzso genes are transcribed by overlapping promoters and that full zzso requires sequences up to zzso and zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso is likely to be zzso by zzso extended zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to bind the zzso to zzso region of the zzso promoter, and its binding is zzso by the zzso This region resembles the UP elements of zzso promoters in location, sequence and mechanism of interaction with the zzso zzso We discuss the features of these promoters and propose that they could represent a class of minimum zzso which ensures a basic level of transcription, while full zzso requires regulatory elements or a defined promoter zzso
