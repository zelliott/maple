The zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with considerable sequence identity and zzso similarity to the zzso inhibitor zzso It is closely linked to the zzso gene zzso and is zzso deleted in many tumor cell zzso These features suggest that zzso may be a tumor zzso We have determined the zzso structure of zzso and examined its pattern of zzso zzso In addition, we have shown that zzso expression of zzso zzso growth of zzso cell zzso We have also searched for zzso zzso in tumor cell lines and in zzso melanoma zzso Other than the previously described zzso zzso no zzso of zzso were zzso zzso these observations suggest a role for zzso in growth regulation, but a limited role for zzso in tumor zzso
