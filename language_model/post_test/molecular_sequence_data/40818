zzso zzso have the ability to maintain their zzso in their host, a process called zzso For most, passive replication of the zzso zzso relies on integration into the zzso zzso and becoming a zzso zzso remain silent in the absence of stress and replicate passively within their host zzso However, when stressful conditions occur, a zzso zzso itself and resumes the viral zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are zzso by regulated zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso We previously described a zzso of temperate zzso that is characterized by an unusual organization of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso region zzso with the zzso promoter, and the zzso and zzso genes do not share a common activated promoter upon zzso induction as in the zzso zzso In this study, we show that the zzso gene is tightly regulated by its own product as well as by the zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis revealed that overlap of the zzso region with the zzso promoter is widely encountered in zzso present in zzso zzso suggesting a general occurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The prediction that these zzso genes are zzso zzso was biologically assessed by studying the regulation of several zzso genes from two different zzso coli zzso Our results suggest that the majority of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso could be zzso and that this might be correlated with the zzso efficiency as in zzso The consequences of this unprecedented regulation for excessive zzso are zzso
