zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in the in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been zzso and separated by differential zzso extraction from a membrane preparation of zzso embryonic chicken zzso The separated zzso activity had a pH zzso of zzso and the separated zzso activity a single pH optimum of zzso Furthermore, the partially zzso zzso preparation zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to only zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso activities were zzso to approximately zzso and zzso respectively, by use of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the partially zzso zzso preparation appeared to be active only with zzso zzso and zzso The proposed linkage of the zzso unit incorporated into zzso is zzso from the isolation of zzso after zzso of the zzso lead zzso zzso product, zzso zzso In addition, zzso was produced, as shown by the identification of zzso after zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso product, zzso
