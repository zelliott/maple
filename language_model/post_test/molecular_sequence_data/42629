In this study we used as zzso cell models, early and late passage zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and advanced passages of zzso cells derived from aged mouse cerebral zzso zzso to examine responsiveness to zzso We have previously reported that early passage zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso are zzso and can be geared toward zzso or zzso zzso whereas late passage zzso zzso cells are zzso In addition, zzso cultures have been previously characterized and consist of zzso type 1 and 2, some zzso and few zzso zzso In this study, early passage zzso and late passage zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso cells of passages zzso were grown from zzso time until zzso day 7 or 8, in zzso + zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso or its synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso We examined for the activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markers for zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso activity was markedly increased in the early passage following zzso treatment, indicative of a shift to zzso zzso In the late passage cells, already committed to zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced zzso activity suggesting that zzso respond to zzso zzso activity was markedly increased in zzso cultures grown in the presence of zzso with no changes in zzso Thus, type 1 zzso the zzso zzso type in zzso cultures, responded to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
