The precursor to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso II zzso is zzso it is a zzso zzso on zzso zzso and transported to the zzso apparatus prior to zzso zzso A zzso corresponding to the zzso end of zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this zzso indicates that zzso zzso contains a zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso extension contains three zzso zzso and a potential signal zzso zzso site at zzso acid zzso zzso processing by canine zzso removed approximately 35 zzso acids from an in zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of a zzso acid zzso extension and a zzso acid partial zzso unit truncated at the beginning of the third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso indicating that it had not been zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with zzso M zzso pH zzso did not remove the processed zzso from the zzso zzso A zzso membrane anchor sequence appears to anchor the nascent protein within the zzso preventing zzso into the zzso Taken together, these results provide zzso evidence for a functional zzso signal sequence within the zzso extension of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
