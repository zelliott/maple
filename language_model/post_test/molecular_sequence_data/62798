zzso a member of the zzso zzso factor family, is believed to regulate zzso and cell cycle zzso Here, a zzso zzso screen for zzso zzso in the developing nervous system identified a novel zzso protein named zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was confirmed by the in zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso and by zzso of the proteins zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso documented that zzso is a zzso zzso and in zzso zzso identified the developing nervous system and the adult zzso as two sites of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated zzso binding to the zzso gene while transient zzso zzso documented zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso Additional tests revealed that distinct structural motifs of zzso direct interaction with zzso and shuttling between the nucleus and zzso of zzso cycling zzso Altogether, our results strongly suggest that zzso and zzso interact functionally to regulate gene expression during cell differentiation and identify the cell cycle regulator zzso as one of the targeted zzso
