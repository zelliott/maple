A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the South China Sea and investigated in a zzso study using a zzso zzso The zzso type determined for strain zzso was zzso with zzso as the diagnostic zzso zzso acid and an zzso bridge of zzso The polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an unknown zzso and an unknown zzso The only detected zzso was zzso and the major fatty acids were summed feature 8 zzso , zzso and summed feature 3 zzso significant amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso with those of related type strains demonstrated that it represented a novel lineage within the family zzso zzso zzso being closely related to species of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso These results demonstrate that strain zzso is a member of a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
