We constructed four zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by synthetic zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso protein contained zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso proteins contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to maintain normal cell growth in a zzso triple zzso at 42 degrees C, zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso development in a zzso double zzso whereas zzso and zzso supported these cellular zzso zzso column zzso showed that the zzso and zzso had reduced affinities to zzso These observations indicate that two highly zzso zzso zzso in the arm structure of the zzso half of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in the short zzso connecting the two halves of the zzso are important for the zzso ability and biological functions of this zzso
