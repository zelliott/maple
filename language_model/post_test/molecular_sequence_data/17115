Although the importance of zzso T cell responses to human zzso zzso has recently been recognized in transplant and zzso patients, the precise specificity and nature of this response has remained largely zzso In the present study we have isolated zzso zzso which recognize zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso in association with two different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso sequences recognized by human zzso T cells were not only zzso in clinical zzso from zzso but also in zzso zzso from higher primates zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, these zzso sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso are efficiently recognized by human zzso zzso More importantly, we show that zzso T cells from humans can also efficiently lyse zzso zzso cells from zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be considered while designing a zzso vaccine against zzso In addition, they also provide a functional basis for the conservation of zzso class II lineages between humans and Old World primates and open the possibility for the use of such zzso models in vaccine development against zzso
