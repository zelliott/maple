zzso engagement of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso that results in zzso events and recruitment and zzso of zzso zzso The formation of zzso scaffolds with zzso are important zzso events that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we describe a novel interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso is zzso associated with zzso in resting, zzso activated and zzso human zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso directly interacts with a zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the sequences zzso This zzso interaction has a zzso higher affinity than zzso zzso It is zzso by the addition of calcium zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso triggers zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, this membrane zzso portion of zzso is zzso across zzso species and the zzso representation of zzso zzso reveals a charge distribution analogous to other zzso motifs in other zzso Taken together, these results suggest that this highly charged cluster of zzso acids in the zzso zzso domain directly interacts with zzso and this novel interaction appears to regulate zzso of zzso
