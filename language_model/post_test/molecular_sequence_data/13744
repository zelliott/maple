The human zzso human zzso and mouse zzso genes have zzso islands near their zzso zzso These islands are typical in that they span about zzso zzso contain zzso initiation sites, and zzso some zzso untranslated zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso sequencing of these human and mouse islands provided evidence of evolutionary conservation to a degree unprecedented among zzso zzso zzso zzso In one stretch of 165 zzso containing 19 zzso mouse zzso and human zzso are identical to each other and differ from human zzso at only 9 zzso In contrast, we found no evidence of zzso zzso islands in the mouse zzso zzso whose zzso is more circumscribed than that of human zzso human zzso and mouse zzso Using the zzso zzso and zzso to examine a highly zzso segment of the zzso zzso island, we detected zzso on inactive mouse X zzso but not on inactive human X zzso These observations parallel the previous findings that mouse zzso zzso X zzso while human zzso escapes zzso
