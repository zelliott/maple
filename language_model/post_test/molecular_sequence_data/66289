zzso zzso can zzso humans and multiple species of animals, causing a wide spectrum of zzso The coronavirus main zzso zzso which plays a pivotal role in viral gene expression and replication through the zzso processing of zzso zzso is an attractive target for zzso drug zzso In this study, the crystal structures of infectious zzso virus zzso zzso and a severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with an zzso zzso zzso were individually determined to zzso the structural flexibility and zzso binding of zzso A zzso form of zzso zzso was identified for the first time in zzso zzso zzso A comparison of these two structures to other available zzso structures provides new insights for the design of zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso Furthermore, a Michael zzso inhibitor (named zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and was found to demonstrate in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and potent zzso activity against zzso in chicken zzso This provides a feasible animal model for designing zzso zzso against zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso has yielded two more zzso lead compounds, zzso and zzso with potent zzso against zzso zzso
