zzso has been shown to be a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso This is evidenced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso a dependence of zzso on the presence of zzso and oxygen zzso the ability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to protect against zzso and a high affinity of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is accompanied by zzso zzso modification of the zzso Analysis of the zzso map following zzso by zzso reveals that the zzso is associated with a single, 25 zzso acid zzso The sequence of the modified zzso is shown to be zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso to a zzso modified zzso zzso In studies using the separated zzso of zzso we have found the R zzso to be a zzso competitive inhibitor versus zzso zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso zzso zzso The S zzso while also being a competitive inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso to give the expected zzso product and also efficiently zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 57 zzso 8 zzso The partition ratio for this process is very low and has been estimated to be about zzso This establishes an approximate value for zzso of zzso zzso and reveals that zzso zzso a slow turnover relative to that of zzso zzso approximately 50 zzso despite the nearly zzso higher affinity of the zzso for zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
