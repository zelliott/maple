Loss of zzso zzso of the entire zzso 10 is the most frequent genetic zzso in human zzso zzso In addition to zzso on zzso zzso of partial deletion zzso on zzso points to a second zzso zzso The proposed target gene zzso was not zzso By zzso deletion mapping of this region, we identified the complementary DNA zzso the human zzso of rat orphan G zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in fetal and adult brain, but frequently reduced or absent in zzso cells and zzso due to de zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was reversed with zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso cells increased zzso zzso concentration which is considered to induce zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso a DNA repair gene zzso on zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a common mechanism in zzso zzso that simultaneously zzso zzso and zzso The zzso region may contain an important zzso zzso in brain zzso
