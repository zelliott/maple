zzso belonging to the zzso zzso 20 zzso family are involved in the removal of terminal zzso linked zzso zzso These zzso widely distributed in zzso animals and plants, are involved in many important zzso and pathological zzso such as cell structural integrity, energy storage, pathogen zzso viral zzso cellular zzso zzso development of zzso inflammatory events and zzso storage zzso Nevertheless, only limited analyses of zzso relationships between zzso genes have been performed until zzso 

zzso zzso analyses of 233 zzso protein sequences from zzso and zzso reveal a complex history for the zzso zzso In bacteria, multiple gene zzso and lineage specific gene loss zzso horizontal gene zzso are required to explain the observed zzso zzso The last common zzso of extant zzso is likely to have possessed at least one zzso family zzso At least one gene zzso before the divergence of animals, plants and zzso as well as other lineage specific zzso events have given rise to multiple zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses also suggest that a second, divergent zzso of zzso family genes present in animals derive from an independent zzso zzso Our data suggest multiple zzso changes of functional roles of zzso family members in zzso 

This study represents the first detailed evolutionary analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of data concerning zzso function of zzso family members onto the zzso tree reveals that apparently zzso and highly lineage specific changes in zzso specificity have occurred in multiple zzso zzso
