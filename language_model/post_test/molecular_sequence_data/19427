zzso zzso Body zzso zzso is the most common acquired muscle disease in patients above 50 years of zzso Apart from inflammation in the skeletal muscle, zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso and zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso play a central role in the zzso of zzso In neurodegenerative disorders, similar zzso of zzso proteins have recently been shown to be susceptible to zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso of zzso in human muscle cell lines and zzso muscle zzso 

zzso of zzso with the essential zzso protein zzso which associates with zzso and zzso zzso via zzso was analyzed in the zzso muscle cell line and muscle zzso by zzso While zzso was zzso with specific zzso in the muscle cell line and in tissue zzso zzso zzso was analyzed after zzso zzso or with an zzso specific zzso zzso 

We demonstrate here that zzso zzso with zzso in cultured human muscle zzso In addition, zzso zzso can be observed at increased frequency in muscle fibers of zzso muscle zzso but not in zzso muscle or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compartments were almost exclusively observed in zzso muscle fibers of the type II zzso and were in part associated with zzso of major zzso complex zzso class I and II on zzso and invasion by zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso is targeted for zzso degradation via zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso should be explored for its potential therapeutic merit in zzso
