zzso have been isolated from several species of sea zzso and shown to block currents through various zzso zzso channels, particularly in excitable zzso The toxins can be grouped into four structural zzso type 1 with zzso zzso acid zzso and three zzso zzso type 2 with zzso zzso and three zzso zzso type 3 with zzso zzso and three zzso zzso and type 4 with 28 zzso and two zzso zzso Examples from the first class are zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso from zzso zzso (now zzso zzso These interfere with binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and block currents through channels with various zzso zzso and also intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso in the second class are zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso these toxins include zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso they block zzso zzso The third structural group includes zzso zzso (from zzso zzso and zzso 1 (from zzso zzso Their pharmacological specificity zzso zzso and zzso block currents involving zzso zzso while zzso blocks zzso zzso The fourth group comprises the more recently discovered zzso I and II from zzso zzso Their channel blocking specificity is not yet known but they zzso zzso binding from zzso zzso Sea zzso can be predicted to be a continued source of new toxins that will serve as molecular zzso of various zzso zzso
