The zzso H zzso of zzso zzso zzso forms one of the peripheral stalks connecting the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of the zzso part zzso of zzso H of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso have been performed by zzso zzso Our initial zzso structural calculations for zzso indicate that zzso acid zzso zzso fold into a single zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso interact specifically with the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso A more detailed picture regarding the zzso of zzso involved in this association was obtained by zzso studies using the zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso These data indicate that the zzso tail zzso interacts with the zzso zzso acids of zzso and this has been confirmed by zzso correlation zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso single quantum zzso zzso zzso of the central stalk zzso F in the presence and absence of zzso show no obvious interaction between the zzso domain of E and zzso zzso The data presented zzso for the first time, structural insights into the interaction of zzso E and zzso and their arrangement within zzso zzso zzso
