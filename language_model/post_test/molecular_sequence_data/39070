Members of the zzso gene family zzso proteins with zzso to the zzso box zzso domain of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed during zzso and are involved in the development of a wide range of different zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be responsible for zzso sex zzso zzso zzso and zzso disease, zzso It is likely that zzso in other zzso genes are responsible for a variety of human genetic zzso zzso has been identified from a human zzso library and the mouse and chicken sequences obtained by zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is highly zzso across these species, suggesting an important role for this protein in zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the neural tube and zzso zzso zzso of the developing chicken zzso This is the only zzso gene known to be expressed in the zzso zzso zzso a structure that directs outgrowth of the embryonic limb zzso Human zzso is zzso to a zzso zzso artificial zzso on zzso zzso close to zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso maps outside these zzso its expression pattern and zzso zzso suggest that it is a candidate gene for the limb defects frequently associated with these zzso
