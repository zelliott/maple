Multiple mechanisms regulate zzso growth zzso zzso gene expression in zzso including zzso from two zzso alternative zzso zzso and differential zzso zzso In previous studies we demonstrated that zzso promoter 1, the major human promoter, initiated zzso within a dispersed 158 zzso segment of zzso 1, and showed that full promoter activity required the entire zzso zzso zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso We now have examined the functional significance of this highly zzso region by testing the activity of hybrid zzso genes containing various portions of the zzso zzso after transient zzso into the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso plasmids containing the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 and a zzso zzso segment of zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso activity nearly 70 times higher than a zzso control zzso zzso to zzso had little effect on promoter function, while subsequent 3' deletions (to zzso zzso and zzso led to a zzso decrease in reporter gene zzso Internal deletions of zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso led to 65, 25, and less than zzso decreases in promoter function, zzso zzso of the entire segment from zzso to zzso caused a complete loss of zzso Analysis for zzso interactions by in zzso zzso zzso identified a broad region of protection extending from zzso zzso to zzso Further characterization by gel mobility shift zzso indicated that several specific zzso complexes could be formed in this region with nuclear protein extracts from zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso segment had deleterious effects on promoter function, and one zzso involving zzso zzso to zzso resulted in a greater than zzso decline in reporter gene zzso Our results demonstrate that the initial portion of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso 1 is required for high level zzso zzso of promoter 1 and provide a starting point for defining the nuclear factors regulating this component of zzso gene zzso
