We have identified a zzso termination site in the 3' zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso A downstream zzso regulatory element in the mouse zzso gene was characterized by transferring its zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso Analysis of zzso plasmids zzso into mouse zzso cells by zzso zzso showed the possible region of zzso There were two direct repeat structures containing zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso in this zzso The precise location of zzso termination was mapped by zzso zzso analysis of the transcripts from zzso plasmids zzso into zzso zzso It was approximately 20 zzso upstream of the first zzso repeat within the zzso sequences of the first element of the two direct zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that nuclear DNA binding proteins bound specifically to the sequences where the termination occurred as well as the other sequences in the second element of the direct zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear proteins bound to the region of the zzso It is possible that one or more of those proteins are involved in blocking the zzso of the mouse zzso gene transcript and then result in zzso
