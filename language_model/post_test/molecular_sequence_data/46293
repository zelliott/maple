Basic zzso properties including their apparent zzso in zzso buffer and vegetable oils of a series of 11 zzso varying with respect to chain length and degree of zzso were zzso It was observed that the compounds in contact with water transformed into zzso slowly zzso zzso zzso Based on these zzso the in zzso release behavior of selected zzso derivatives from oil solutions and in zzso formed zzso was investigated using a validated in zzso release zzso 

The results of this investigation suggest that both types of zzso drug delivery systems might constitute alternative sustained release zzso principles of such zzso zzso derivatives for the zzso route of zzso
