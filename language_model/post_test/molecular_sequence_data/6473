We have measured the zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 1) of retinal zzso zzso also zzso using a new zzso zzso cells are zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta 1 and gamma zzso In the zzso of these cells, incubated with zzso light causes the rapid zzso of zzso as measured by the ability of zzso gamma S to protect alpha zzso fragments from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is also observed when zzso is added to zzso under constant zzso zzso depends on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with known defects in zzso zzso show similar defects in this zzso alpha zzso zzso that mimic the corresponding zzso in the zzso of zzso also produce zzso similar effects in this zzso As a first step in a strategy aimed at exploring the relationships between structure and function in the interactions of receptors with G zzso we tested zzso alpha zzso proteins with zzso zzso for each of the 10 zzso acids at the zzso a region known to be crucial for interactions with zzso zzso substitution at four positions moderately zzso or severely zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of alpha 1 to zzso by zzso All four zzso retain their ability to be activated by zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso resulted in very mild zzso while zzso at the remaining four positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso In combination with previous zzso these results zzso models of the interaction of the zzso of alpha zzso with zzso
