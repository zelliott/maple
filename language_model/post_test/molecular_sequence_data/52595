zzso zzso virus zzso the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso virus that expresses its zzso in the form of two large zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The functional zzso zzso zzso zzso which drive zzso zzso replication and zzso zzso transcription, are generated by extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involves an unusual zzso step and generates the zzso for structural protein zzso Previously, the zzso of zzso zzso which carries a single zzso point zzso zzso had implicated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in viral zzso zzso and in particular in zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso domain zzso located just upstream of the zzso zzso and a zzso activity in its zzso zzso We have now analyzed the zzso domain of zzso in considerable zzso A total of 38 zzso most of them carrying specific single point zzso were tested in the context of an zzso infectious zzso zzso zzso effects on viral zzso replication and zzso zzso zzso were zzso In general, our results indicated that the zzso region, and in particular a set of 13 zzso zzso and His zzso that are assumed to be involved in zinc zzso is essential for viral zzso zzso On the basis of these data and comparative sequence zzso we zzso that the zzso may employ a rather unusual mode of zinc binding that could result in the association of up to four zinc zzso with this zzso The region containing zzso zzso may play the role of zzso zzso which connects the zzso to the rest of zzso Several zzso in this region specifically affected zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, one of the zzso zzso was replication and zzso competent but did not produce infectious progeny zzso This suggests that zzso is involved in an as yet unidentified step of zzso zzso
