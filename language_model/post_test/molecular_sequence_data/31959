zzso disease is a major cause of morbidity and death for millions of people in Latin zzso The drugs currently available exhibit poor efficacy and severe side zzso zzso there is an urgent need for new, safe and effective drugs against zzso zzso The vital dependence on zzso as energy source makes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, attractive targets for drug zzso In this work, zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was employed as molecular target for the discovery of new zzso as zzso 

Integrated zzso zzso and zzso virtual screening approaches resulted in the identification of three hits from three chemical classes with moderate zzso activity against zzso The zzso showed zzso values in the high zzso zzso 

The new zzso are attractive molecules for future medicinal chemistry efforts aimed at developing new lead compounds for zzso zzso
