zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso in many parts of the world, especially in Asia and zzso Loss of zzso zzso on the long arm of zzso 13 has been reported in zzso In search of tumor zzso genes in this region, here we have identified zzso (for deleted in liver cancer 2) at zzso zzso a novel zzso family zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in normal zzso but was significantly zzso in zzso zzso of human zzso zzso is zzso to zzso a previously identified tumor zzso gene at zzso frequently deleted in zzso zzso encodes a novel protein with a zzso domain, a SAM zzso alpha zzso domain related to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso protein has GAP activity specific for small zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the GAP domain of zzso sufficiently zzso the zzso formation of zzso stress zzso Introduction of human zzso into mouse zzso suppresses Ras signaling and zzso cellular transformation in a zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest a role for zzso in growth suppression and zzso
