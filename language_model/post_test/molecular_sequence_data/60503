zzso is the most potent regulator of pancreatic zzso zzso and volume zzso In this report, the organization of the human zzso zzso zzso gene was characterized by overlapping zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of 13 zzso and 12 zzso with all the zzso donor and zzso sites zzso to the zzso zzso zzso By transient reporter gene zzso the zzso promoter, containing zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso region, was able to drive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso activities in pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso By subsequent zzso and 3' deletion analysis, a promoter element was identified within zzso to zzso relative to the zzso zzso This promoter element was found to be zzso since it could drive reporter gene expression in zzso and zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The study of the zzso control of human zzso and its zzso should shed light on the pathological developments of pancreatic cancer and zzso in the zzso
