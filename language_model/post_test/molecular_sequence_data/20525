zzso one of the major nitrogen sources for plants, is stored in the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso is primarily zzso by the zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso suggested that the zzso domain, composed by two zzso zzso motifs in all zzso members of the zzso family is able to interact with zzso However, interaction of zzso with a functional zzso protein has not been zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso the patch clamp technique to isolated zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso reduces zzso activity with a maximum zzso of zzso zzso zzso of nitrate influx into the zzso at zzso zzso nitrate zzso suggests that zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not decrease the zzso transport zzso nonetheless, zzso (but not zzso competes with zzso preventing zzso A molecular model of the C zzso of zzso was built by zzso to zzso C zzso The model predicted the effects of zzso of the zzso binding site on the interaction energy between zzso and zzso that were further confirmed by functional expression of zzso zzso zzso
