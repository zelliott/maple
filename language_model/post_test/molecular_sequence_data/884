One defining characteristic of zzso zzso peptides is the high frequency of zzso modifications zzso We report the discovery and initial characterization of three novel zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso of the zzso cone snail zzso zzso zzso zzso a 50 zzso acid zzso zzso carries eight zzso zzso arranged in a novel zzso pattern, and five zzso acid zzso The zzso molecular mass was determined by zzso zzso mass zzso to zzso zzso consistent with the zzso having the zzso zzso zzso and having a free acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso each contain two zzso acid zzso and share little sequence similarity to previously identified zzso Both peptides contain four zzso zzso that are positioned in the linear sequence in a manner reminiscent of zzso belonging to zzso scaffold zzso T zzso zzso zzso of the zzso molecular masses revealed that zzso is zzso at its zzso while zzso has a free zzso zzso
