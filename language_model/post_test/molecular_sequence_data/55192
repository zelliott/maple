The zzso zzso box protein zzso is a member of a family of DEAD box zzso active in zzso processing and zzso The authors used genetic mosaics to identify zzso in zzso that affect zzso zzso and the maintenance of zzso zzso Analysis of a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso construct placed under control of a heat shock promoter showed that zzso fails to efficiently transport zzso from the zzso cell body to the zzso zzso zzso is not dependent on the zzso transport zzso The authors also showed that zzso and red fluorescent protein zzso zzso proteins are localized to discrete zzso structures that are not associated with zzso known to be active in zzso zzso The molecular genetic analysis described here reveals an unexpected role for the zzso zzso and provides an experimental system to further characterize its zzso
