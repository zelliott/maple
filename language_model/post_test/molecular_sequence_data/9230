Human zzso has been increasingly prevalent in recent years and results in a threat to the public health in epidemic regions, motivating current strategies of vaccines to combat zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso wall proteins of zzso by zzso approaches and characterized the expressed zzso zzso protein (101 zzso zzso analysis indicated that full-length sequences of zzso are zzso in zzso and numerous zzso zzso were predicted in zzso acid sequence of zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso was expressed at four life stages of zzso zzso both zzso wall proteins and soluble zzso components could be zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso results revealed that zzso was specifically localized at zzso wall and zzso zzso of zzso as well as the zzso oral zzso and zzso of adult zzso Both zzso and zzso results demonstrated that zzso was highly expressed at the stage of adult worm, zzso and zzso which could be supported by real-time zzso zzso Both zzso protein and zzso acid of zzso showed strong zzso in rats and induced combined zzso immune responses, which were reflected by continuous high level of zzso zzso and increased level of zzso zzso in zzso In vaccine trials, comparing with control groups, both zzso protein and DNA vaccine exhibited protective effect with significant zzso reduction rate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso with immune responses in zzso elevated level of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso suggested that zzso could induce combined cellular immunity and zzso immunity in zzso Taken together, zzso could be a promising vaccine candidate in the prevention of zzso zzso regarding its high zzso and surface zzso
