zzso zzso and zzso enrichment were employed to isolate a zzso of zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso that had lost the ability to grow on zzso and to produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso in the zzso strain was used as a probe for the identification and cloning of the zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was isolated and shown to complement the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required that a promoter of the zzso zzso be present, suggesting that the zzso gene is part of a larger zzso Using zzso derived from the zzso sequence of zzso as zzso zzso was located on the zzso zzso and the gene was zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a protein of zzso Da with an zzso sequence identical to that obtained from zzso acid analysis of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibits distant similarity to the zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso with zzso and zzso identity, zzso zzso strains deficient in zzso displayed substantial levels of zzso zzso activity, originally thought to be only a minor activity associated with the zzso zzso It is likely that we have uncovered an additional zzso zzso with activity for zzso The zzso gene can be used for zzso of zzso in zzso coli in order to obtain sufficient amounts of zzso for further investigations and zzso
