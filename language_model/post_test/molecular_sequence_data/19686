zzso inherited zzso zzso or zzso body zzso are zzso at the molecular level and are due to zzso at or near the zzso gene zzso Many of these involve zzso of zzso 3 of the zzso zzso They include zzso premature chain termination zzso zzso and complex zzso that lead to the synthesis of truncated or zzso and highly unstable zzso gene zzso The resulting beta chain zzso are very zzso and in many cases, the products of the zzso inherited zzso are not zzso zzso and clinical observations made in several families with comparable forms of zzso and with certain highly unstable zzso zzso zzso have indicated a striking zzso many subjects with zzso unstable zzso zzso and with a dominant type of zzso without a zzso abnormal zzso have similar zzso Here, a review of zzso inherited zzso is given, and new examples of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The first example is a zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso that was found in a 2-year-old Bulgarian zzso The abnormal zzso is associated with severe zzso anemia as a consequence of its zzso zzso The anemia was noticed at the age of 2 months and since then he has been on a regular monthly blood zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed no zzso except the presence of inclusion zzso zzso of the zzso gene revealed a zzso for a 6 zzso deletion zzso at zzso 137 (the second and third zzso 138 and 139 (the first zzso thus forming a new zzso at position 139 zzso This event eliminates three zzso acids zzso and introduces a new zzso zzso It creates a new restriction site for zzso The parents and his twin brother had no history of zzso The zzso of the child was confirmed by DNA zzso The second example is a new zzso zzso named zzso zzso found as a de zzso zzso in a 2-year-old Bulgarian girl with severe zzso zzso The zzso was detected through zzso zzso It represents a complex zzso zzso involving an zzso of 23 zzso zzso after zzso a deletion of 310 zzso extending from zzso to the first zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso of 28 zzso at the deletion junctions zzso from zzso sequence between zzso zzso and zzso 3' to the zzso gene termination zzso At the protein level, this zzso leads to a deletion of four zzso acid zzso zzso at positions 105, zzso 107 and zzso and an zzso of nine zzso zzso at the same location, creating an abnormal zzso beta chain of 151 zzso acid zzso The parents had no history of zzso The zzso of the child was confirmed by DNA zzso
