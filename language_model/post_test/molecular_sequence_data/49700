zzso zzso zzso a bovine zzso zzso expresses the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a new zzso domain called zzso located 100 zzso acid zzso to the primary repetitive zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso region of zzso zzso and this binding was mostly zzso by type I module pair 2-3 of zzso fragment, whereas zzso mainly bound to type I module pair zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited adherence of zzso zzso to zzso but at lower level as compared to zzso zzso exclusively shared zzso properties with the zzso unit zzso of zzso from zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso or motifs of other zzso while zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso appeared to be zzso zzso zzso with this, a zzso zzso zzso generated from a mouse zzso with zzso and that recognized zzso did not zzso with zzso The zzso for zzso was mapped to 40 zzso acid long segment within zzso and interaction between the zzso and the zzso was specifically induced by zzso or zzso A similar zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso strains suggesting the presence of an zzso bearing zzso related to zzso
