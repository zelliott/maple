zzso liver 3 zzso zzso zzso was previously cloned by zzso In this study, we used the rat zzso as the probe to screen a human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of four different zzso were identified and zzso The sequence of one of the zzso is identical to that of the human zzso zzso zzso except that our clone contains a much longer zzso sequence than previously zzso The other three zzso display high degrees of sequence zzso to those of both rat 3 zzso zzso and human zzso zzso Because 3 zzso zzso and human zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso we named these human clones zzso to zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the liver expresses the highest levels of all four zzso zzso of all four clones was also detected in the brain, zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso expressed only the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso as the probe detected multiple DNA fragments zzso to the probe and a high degree of restriction zzso length zzso suggesting the complexity of this zzso zzso
