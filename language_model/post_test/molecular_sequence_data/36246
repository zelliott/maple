zzso of cadmium into cultured cells and its effects on cell growth and DNA synthesis are measured over a range of zzso zzso of seven orders of zzso zzso zzso is found to be zzso to the external zzso concentration and to incubation time over a very broad range of zzso At least 200 zzso cadmium per zzso dry weight of cells can be accumulated in this way, leading to exhaustion of the major zzso zzso binding sites before cell zzso On the other hand, very low cadmium zzso down to 100 zzso stimulate cell growth and DNA synthesis zzso zzso is found in all three zzso cell types zzso namely zzso a rat permanent zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and a primary rat zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso with serum in zzso cultures, but is zzso only in zzso cultures of zzso zzso occurs at zzso zzso too low to result in a measurable induction of zzso This might zzso the action of response amplifiers in the chain of events leading to zzso DNA replication and cell zzso
