The development of zzso zzso representations for DNA sequences was very important for qualitative and quantitative comparison of zzso zzso of zzso features for these representations is useful for zzso zzso Most of all zzso representations identify each one of the four bases with a zzso walk in one zzso direction in the zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso acids instead of four bases have to be zzso This fact has limited the introduction of useful zzso Cartesian representations and the corresponding sequences zzso to zzso protein sequence zzso In this study, we overcome this problem grouping zzso acids into four groups: acid, zzso polar and zzso zzso zzso The identification of each group with one of the four axis directions determines a novel zzso representation and zzso zzso for proteins zzso zzso a zzso model has been used to calculate new zzso zzso of the protein zzso These zzso are called zzso the sequence zzso zzso numbers zzso In this work, we calculated the zzso values for 108 sequences of different zzso zzso and for 100 sequences of other zzso A Linear zzso Analysis model derived here zzso successfully discriminates between zzso and other zzso The model correctly classified zzso of a subset of 81 zzso and 75 zzso proteins sequences used to train the zzso The model also correctly classified 51 out of 52 zzso of proteins sequences used as external validation zzso The uses of different group of zzso acids and/or axes orientation give different results, so it is suggested to be explored for other zzso Finally, to illustrates the use of the model we report the isolation and prediction of the PG action for a novel sequence zzso isolated by our group from zzso zzso zzso This prediction zzso very well with sequence alignment results found by the zzso zzso These findings illustrate the possibilities of the sequence zzso derived for this novel zzso sequence representation in proteins sequence zzso zzso
