One restriction to the zzso of common zzso zzso zzso zzso is its limited tolerance to low zzso In the present study, zzso suppression zzso was employed to enrich for stress responsive genes in both a zzso common bean and a relatively more zzso wild bean species, zzso zzso For each species, approximately 11 zzso expressed sequence tags were zzso Comparative sequence analysis of the zzso collection with the available zzso zzso sequences of the model zzso species zzso zzso and zzso max identified protein zzso for approximately zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This difference reflects the closer zzso relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso of the zzso sequences was facilitated through this comparative analysis and indicated that several heat shock zzso zzso zzso and DNA binding factors were uniquely found among the sequences from the wild species zzso zzso The zzso sequences have been made available on a zzso zzso using zzso zzso as the reference zzso providing rapid access to the sequence data and associated comparative zzso zzso
