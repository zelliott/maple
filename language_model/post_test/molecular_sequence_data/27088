In most algae, the zzso division rate is held constant to maintain the proper number of zzso per zzso By contrast, land plants evolved cell and zzso differentiation systems in which the size and number of zzso change along with their respective cellular function by regulation of the division zzso Here, we show that zzso DIVISION zzso zzso land zzso components of the division apparatus, determine the rate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso and the moss zzso zzso increased the number but decreased the size of zzso reduction of zzso levels resulted in the opposite zzso The level of zzso zzso but not other division zzso decreased during leaf development, during which the zzso division rate also zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso division rate, where zzso zzso but not other components of the division apparatus, were zzso These results suggest that the integration of zzso proteins into the division machinery enabled land plant cells to change zzso size and number in zzso with the fate of cell zzso
