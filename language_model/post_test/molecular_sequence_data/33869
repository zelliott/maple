The zzso binding zzso flowering control locus A, zzso regulates flowering in rice and zzso zzso interacts with zzso to zzso its own transcripts as well as to control flowering by zzso flowering locus C zzso We report the cloning and characterization of the gamma zzso zzso of zzso from barley zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein contained two zzso recognition motifs zzso a zzso region at the zzso end, a zzso region immediately downstream of a WW zzso zzso zzso had greater protein sequence zzso to wheat and rice zzso than to its zzso zzso In developing barley zzso zzso transcripts could be detected from 2 days after zzso zzso up to 40 zzso zzso transcript levels in mature barley zzso were more abundant in zzso than in zzso seeds, with the levels declining as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the decline of barley zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or a truncated zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso promoter or wheat zzso gene promoter in barley zzso zzso led to increased zzso and zzso gene promoter zzso zzso zzso or truncated zzso localized in the nucleus suggested its role in gene zzso
