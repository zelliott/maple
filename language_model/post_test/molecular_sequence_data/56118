zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen which causes a wide range of diseases in zzso To identify putative zzso zzso a zzso library of zzso zzso in zzso coli was screened for zzso red zzso a property associated with zzso in zzso bacteria, and subsequently with bovine zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone carrying a zzso DNA insert was found to zzso a strongly zzso zzso protein with an apparent molecular weight of zzso The zzso sequence of the entire DNA insert was zzso Two open reading frames coding for zzso with calculated molecular weights of zzso and zzso were zzso The larger open reading frame zzso zzso while the smaller reading frame zzso a zzso protein with a relative molecular mass of approximately 18 zzso The 16 zzso zzso acids of the deduced zzso zzso showed strong sequence zzso to the signal zzso of zzso bacterial zzso and the sequence zzso at the putative zzso site zzso to the consensus zzso sequence of bacterial zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso in zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso a specific inhibitor of signal zzso zzso zzso was localized to the outer membrane of zzso zzso
