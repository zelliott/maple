A group of zzso strains zzso group zzso isolated from the feces of healthy people, was characterized by zzso tests, fatty acid analysis, cell wall zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that group zzso is zzso a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Despite a zzso resemblance to the zzso zzso group zzso was shown to be zzso zzso related to the type species of the zzso zzso zzso Group zzso showed a specific zzso association with zzso zzso Group zzso resembled zzso in possessing the uncommon type B cell wall zzso zzso zzso however, revealed the presence of a previously unknown B1 delta zzso zzso zzso Based on a zzso zzso sequence divergence of greater than zzso with zzso zzso and the presence of a unique zzso type, a new zzso zzso is proposed for group zzso with one species, zzso zzso Type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso
