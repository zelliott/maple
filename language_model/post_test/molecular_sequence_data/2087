We found that the zzso zzso zzso inhibited spreading of human zzso inside collagen gels and markedly decreased gel contraction, but this zzso had no effect on cell spreading on zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso which inhibited cell spreading on zzso surfaces, did not inhibit cell spreading within collagen gels and was a less effective inhibitor of collagen gel contraction than zzso Based on these findings, we conclude that human zzso can interact with different collagen cell recognition sequences depending upon topographical organization of the zzso
