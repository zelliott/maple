Genes zzso zzso were isolated and cloned from zzso libraries of hard tick zzso zzso and soft tick zzso zzso Both tick zzso are composed of zzso zzso zzso and their calculated mass is zzso Da and zzso Da for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequences of both proteins are closely related to each other as well as to the zzso from another tick species zzso zzso zzso zzso The proteins contain the zzso motifs for zzso center typical for heavy chains of zzso zzso The zzso structure of a putative iron responsive element was found in the zzso untranslated region of zzso zzso of both zzso zzso against fusion zzso from zzso zzso were raised in a rabbit and used to monitor the zzso of a small amount of zzso from both tick zzso The authenticity of zzso zzso from zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso In the native state, the tick zzso are apparently larger zzso zzso than horse zzso zzso zzso zzso On zzso tick zzso migrate as a single band of about 21 zzso These results suggest that tick zzso are zzso of 24 identical zzso of zzso zzso The Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso level is likely not zzso after zzso of a blood zzso
