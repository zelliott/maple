To investigate whether zzso zzso can sense and directly respond to the presence of zzso zzso peptides zzso 

We performed zzso zzso to investigate the responsive proteins of zzso zzso on exposure to zzso zzso zzso expression patterns of the outer zzso inner membrane and zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso from the bacteria with or without zzso treatment were obtained using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction was also performed to determine the zzso expression level of the target zzso 

Our results suggested that zzso zzso may directly respond to zzso through the zzso of the zzso channel, increased yield of energy, effective repair of damaged zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso metabolism for energy zzso 

zzso proteins identified in the current study could serve as attractive targets for developing more effective zzso zzso
