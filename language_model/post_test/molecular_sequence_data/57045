Two distinct diseases, adult zzso leukemia zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso develop in a minor population of zzso zzso We examined the relationship between the viral zzso dose in the zzso zzso cells and the zzso response in zzso carriers and patients with zzso The zzso zzso to zzso gag and zzso zzso as well as the frequency of an zzso response to viral protein zzso and the zzso increased with increasing viral zzso zzso However, the number of abnormal zzso was not directly related to the host viral zzso Patients with zzso generally showed a higher zzso dose than healthy carriers and also had higher zzso zzso than healthy carriers with the same zzso load, supporting the existence of an zzso immune response in these zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso products, and not the number of abnormal zzso intimately reflects the approximate viral load in zzso zzso
