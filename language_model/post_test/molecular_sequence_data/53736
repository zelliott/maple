The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined and the tested strains were separated into two groups by sequence zzso In group 1, the length and secondary structure of zzso zzso corresponded to those of typical zzso In group 2, the zzso zzso gene sequences were about 150 zzso shorter than those of most other zzso and the predicted secondary structure lacked zzso 10 and zzso Many zzso and some deletions in group 2 zzso zzso gene were not only found in variable regions, but also in regions that are highly zzso among zzso Despite the considerable differences in zzso zzso gene sequence and secondary structure between group 2 and other zzso including group 1, zzso analysis revealed that groups 1 and 2 are closely zzso These findings suggest that a number of deletions occurred in the zzso zzso of the common zzso of group 2 zzso
