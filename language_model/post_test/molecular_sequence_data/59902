The differential display technique was used to identify genes whose expression was regulated by zzso zzso zzso of a novel sequence was zzso in a zzso fashion in liver of zzso male rats exposed to both chronic and acute treatment with zzso as measured by zzso of Northern zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso A rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso procedure was used to isolate a zzso zzso zzso from a rat liver zzso zzso This cloned zzso called zzso was zzso and found to zzso a zzso of 223 zzso zzso In control rats, the zzso gene was expressed at high levels in lung and zzso A zzso domain of 14 zzso followed by a zzso domain, both located in the zzso region, showed zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the precursor for the zzso zzso and a zzso consensus sequence found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
