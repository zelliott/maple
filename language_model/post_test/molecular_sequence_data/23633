zzso and zzso zzso genes are expected to be regulated by common zzso factors and therefore to share zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequences and zzso gene expression profiles allow the use of zzso techniques to investigate zzso that control zzso We collected zzso zzso sequences of 50 zzso genes from zzso databases of zzso zzso and a closely related species zzso zzso We searched for DNA motifs zzso in upstream regions of a group of zzso zzso Several motifs were distributed predominantly in upstream regions of zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso One zzso zzso zzso was distributed zzso in regions from zzso to zzso zzso relative to the zzso start zzso zzso of zzso genes of zzso zzso were isolated, connected with a green fluorescent protein gene zzso and introduced into zzso zzso zzso In muscle cells, these promoters specifically drove zzso zzso which zzso of the zzso sites greatly zzso When zzso sites were located upstream of a zzso promoter, the reporter zzso was specifically expressed in muscle zzso These results suggest the zzso of our zzso prediction of zzso zzso Thus, zzso can help identify zzso elements involved in zzso zzso
