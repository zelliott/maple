Gene expression in zzso zzso petals zzso major changes following compatible zzso Severe flower zzso occurs zzso within 36 hours, providing an excellent model for investigation of zzso zzso and programmed cell zzso zzso of a number of genes and various zzso activities involved in the degradation and zzso of zzso have been found to be zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso 

By performing differential display of zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of the complete zzso sequence revealed that the predicted protein is a member of the zzso family zzso and is highly similar to a tomato zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso that is known to be active on zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso DNA revealed an zzso gene with a promoter region that carries signals found in zzso genes and potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso were present at zzso levels in root and zzso but were 40 times more abundant in flowers 36 hours after zzso zzso and zzso treatment resulted in zzso increases in expression in detached zzso A protein fusion of the zzso coding region to a zzso zzso was found to be located in the zzso 

Though zzso particularly zzso are known to be involved in stress responses, the role of other products of zzso zzso is less well zzso The identification of a zzso family member as a highly zzso gene during zzso zzso suggests that additional products of fatty acid metabolism may play important roles during programmed cell zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso fusion data indicates that the zzso zzso zzso is in the zzso This result suggests that the highly similar zzso zzso that have been identified in two other zzso plants may also be associated with the zzso an zzso known to have a prominent role in programmed cell zzso
