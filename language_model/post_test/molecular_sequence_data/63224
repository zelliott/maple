The zzso zzso zzso causes the development of male sex characteristics in females of some zzso species, a phenomenon known as zzso Recent evidence suggests that the zzso X zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso may contribute to the seasonal development of the male zzso tract in zzso and would be expressed in concert with this zzso zzso was cloned and zzso from an zzso species, the eastern mud snail zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso protein was 100 and zzso identical to those of the rock shell zzso zzso and the freshwater snail zzso zzso The zzso domain was 93 and zzso zzso the zzso of these two zzso species, zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is an ancient nuclear zzso whose origin predates the emergence of the zzso Interestingly, though zzso the zzso zzso were more similar to sequences of zzso zzso than to the zzso of other zzso zzso Next, the expression of zzso zzso levels in the zzso tract was determined through the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels increased commensurate with zzso tract zzso in both zzso However, the timing of coordinate zzso expression differed between zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso expression is associated with zzso tract zzso in both zzso although, the timing of zzso may dictate zzso zzso zzso signaling initiated by zzso during an inappropriate time in females may result in zzso
