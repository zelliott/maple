zzso zzso complex zzso is an zzso pathogen which causes zzso bacterial infection in zzso zzso This zzso predominantly zzso zzso zzso of MAC to zzso is the first step prior to zzso We have previously shown that a 70 zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso is one of nine zzso zzso In the present study, we have zzso this protein from sonic extracts of Ma and studied some of its zzso The zzso sequence of this protein was identified and found to exhibit a strong zzso to the 70 zzso heat shock protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso This protein was found to be present on the surface of the zzso and was able to inhibit the attachment of intact Ma to human zzso derived zzso zzso up to zzso in an in zzso attachment zzso using intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso 70 zzso zzso from zzso which were used as controls, inhibited this attachment by zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the 70 zzso protein may have a role in the attachment of intact Ma to zzso When tested in zzso zzso zzso this protein did not appear to significantly stimulate zzso However, it was found to stimulate the production of tumor necrosis factor zzso by zzso This protein may be one of several Ma zzso that trigger host immune response by binding to zzso and stimulating the production of inflammatory zzso such as zzso by these zzso
