Although gene flow is an important zzso of evolutionary change, the role of ecological factors such as specialization in determining migration and gene flow has rarely been explored zzso To examine the consequences of zzso ability and habitat zzso on gene flow, migration rates were compared in three zzso zzso zzso using zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso of zzso were used to identify the roles of zzso ability and habitat distribution in determining migration zzso zzso ability was a highly significant predictor of gene flow zzso zzso and was more important than any other zzso These findings predict that zzso ability may be an import factor shaping both zzso and zzso zzso this prediction is borne out by comparisons of species diversity in zzso zzso
