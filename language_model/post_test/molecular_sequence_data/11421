A zzso zzso protocol for the efficient synthesis of zzso zzso is zzso The protocol exploits the efficiency of zzso K for zzso zzso with the capability of the hard acid zzso acid zzso for zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso This procedure has proven to be an effective method for the synthesis of zzso zzso The formation of zzso zzso derivatives were observed with zzso peptides as a minor side reaction product of this zzso but this zzso zzso could be successfully suppressed by employing low temperature zzso The zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso also only occurred to a minor extent under these synthetic zzso
