The zzso locus control region zzso is required for high-level expression of the complex of genes zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Several major zzso hypersensitive sites zzso zzso mark the zzso zzso conservation and direct experimental evidence have implicated sequences within and between the HS zzso in function of the zzso In this report we confirm the mapping of a minor HS between zzso and zzso called zzso and show that sequences including it increase the number of random integration sites at which a drug resistance gene is zzso We also show that nuclear proteins including zzso and zzso bind specifically to sequences within zzso However, the protein zzso whose binding site is the best match to one highly zzso zzso does not bind zzso zzso and zzso also bind in the HS zzso of the zzso and to promoters in zzso Their binding to this minor HS suggests that they may be used in assembly of a large complex containing multiple regulatory zzso
