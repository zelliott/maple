We have recently investigated the specificity of T cells induced in a human volunteer and a zzso zzso by multiple zzso to the bites of large numbers of zzso zzso T cell lines and clones have been obtained from a human volunteer zzso with zzso zzso zzso These zzso T cell clones specifically recognize the native zzso zzso protein expressed on zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso specific human T cells mapped to the zzso repeat region of the zzso protein and was contained in the zzso zzso A T cell line has also been isolated from zzso obtained from a zzso zzso by multiple zzso to the bits of zzso zzso infected zzso The zzso zzso T cells were used to identify a T cell zzso within a repeat region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
