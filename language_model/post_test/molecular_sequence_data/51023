zzso is a dominant loss of function zzso in zzso affecting the formation of adult sensory zzso In the zzso zzso precursor cells do not zzso suggesting that zzso might be involved in specifying or realizing zzso fate in the fly, similar to the zzso genes of the zzso zzso As highlighted by the zzso zzso interactions of zzso with most of the zzso zzso the gene might play an important role in nervous system zzso zzso we initiated a molecular analysis of the zzso locus in order to zzso the function of its gene product and gain insight into the zzso nature of the observed genetic interactions in which it zzso Here, we report the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso confirmed by zzso and transformation zzso zzso zzso activity zzso during zzso where transcripts accumulate primarily in zzso and zzso cell zzso and is lowest during zzso zzso the lethal phase of zzso zzso The putative zzso protein deduced from DNA sequencing is extremely basic and highly enriched in zzso zzso zzso appears to zzso a novel protein without compelling zzso to other known proteins which function in specifying peripheral nervous system development in zzso
