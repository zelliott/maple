The primary sequence and three-dimensional structure of a novel zzso toxin isolated from the Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso contains 38 zzso zzso including zzso zzso that form four zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso bonds were previously unknown but have been zzso determined in this zzso Three of these zzso bonds are arranged in an inhibitor zzso zzso zzso which is observed in a range of other zzso zzso zzso The motif incorporates an embedded ring in the structure formed by two of the zzso and their connecting backbone segments penetrated by a third zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we determined that despite the isolation of a single native zzso product by zzso zzso possesses two equally populated zzso in zzso These two zzso were determined to arise from zzso zzso of the bond preceding zzso Full assignment of the zzso zzso for both zzso allowed for the calculation of their structures, revealing the presence of a zzso zzso beta sheet consistent with the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso
