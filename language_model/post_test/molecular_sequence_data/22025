Species of the zzso zzso are of great interest due to their strict extreme zzso growth zzso zzso there is no known molecular characteristic which is unique to this group of zzso This work describes six zzso zzso and deletions zzso or signature zzso in four widely distributed proteins that are distinctive features of species from the zzso zzso These include three signatures consisting of a 2 zzso zzso a 5-6 zzso insert and a 6 zzso deletion in DNA zzso I zzso a zzso zzso insert in zzso protein A zzso a 52 zzso insert in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a 4 zzso insert in zzso factor Tu zzso zzso of these genes were amplified in most cases from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and combined with available sequence data from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in all of the species zzso provides evidence that they are probably distinctive characteristics of the entire zzso The zzso in zzso which is shared by zzso species and zzso but not zzso and zzso may provide a molecular marker for the family zzso We have also identified a 51 zzso insert in zzso zzso zzso that is commonly shared by various species of the zzso as well as two zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso which may be due to lateral gene transfer between these zzso In zzso trees based on a zzso zzso of fragments from eight different proteins as well as zzso zzso the observed branching pattern of these species was very similar and it was consistent with the relationships zzso from various zzso The identified zzso provide a novel means for distinguishing species of the zzso from all other bacteria in molecular terms and may prove useful for functional studies aimed at understanding the unique zzso and zzso characteristics of the zzso
