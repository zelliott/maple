zzso zzso zzso is a zzso transformation conducted by zzso acid bacteria zzso that occurs in wine at the end of alcoholic zzso zzso zzso is the main species responsible for zzso in most zzso As in other fermented foods, where zzso represent a potential risk for the zzso process, zzso zzso zzso have been reported to be a possible cause of unsuccessful zzso in zzso Thus, preparation of commercial starters that take into account the different sensitivities of zzso zzso strains to different zzso would be zzso However, zzso no methods have been described to identify zzso infecting zzso zzso In this study, two factors are zzso detection and typing of zzso First, a simple zzso method was devised targeting a zzso region of the zzso zzso gene to detect temperate zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, 37 zzso zzso strains isolated from Italian wines during different zzso of the zzso process were analyzed by zzso for the presence of the zzso zzso and 25 strains gave a band of the expected size zzso zzso This is the first method to be developed that allows identification of zzso zzso zzso strains without the need for time-consuming zzso zzso induction zzso Moreover, a zzso analysis was conducted to type zzso After the treatment of bacteria with zzso light, zzso was obtained for 15 zzso and the 15 zzso zzso isolated were subjected to two randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso By combining the zzso profiles and zzso zzso 12 different zzso zzso zzso were clearly zzso
