zzso viruses of zzso zzso fall into two broad categories, those that contain zzso zzso zzso zzso in rigid particles and those that are more closely related to zzso zzso zzso viruses with zzso zzso zzso found within zzso zzso zzso zzso systems have been described for the latter, using zzso zzso but not for the zzso We report the characterization of a zzso from zzso zzso the zzso fungus that causes chestnut blight zzso The virus substantially reduces the zzso of the fungus and results in dramatically altered colony zzso as well as changes in other associated zzso traits, relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso particles from infected zzso contained 11 segments of zzso and showed characteristics typical of the family zzso zzso of the largest three segments revealed that the virus is closely related to the zzso zzso of animal zzso which includes the human pathogen Colorado tick fever zzso The introduction of zzso virus particles into zzso from zzso zzso of the fungus resulted in a newly infected zzso with the same zzso and virus composition as the original zzso zzso This represents the completion of Koch's zzso for a true zzso virus from a zzso fungus and the description of a definitive zzso member of the family zzso
