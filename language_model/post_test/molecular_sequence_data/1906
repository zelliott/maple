zzso zzso 37 zzso belongs to species D and can cause epidemic zzso whereas the closely related zzso does zzso zzso cell attachment by zzso is zzso through zzso binding of the zzso domain of the fiber zzso The knobs of zzso and zzso differ at only two positions, zzso and zzso We report the high-resolution crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso both native and in complex with zzso acid, which has been proposed as a zzso for zzso Overall, the zzso and zzso knobs are very similar to previously reported zzso structures, especially to that of zzso which binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso knobs are structurally identical with the exception of the changed side chains and are structurally most similar to zzso knobs zzso that of zzso rather than zzso knobs zzso that of zzso The two zzso in zzso result in a partial loss of the exceptionally high positive surface charge of the zzso zzso but do not affect zzso acid zzso This site is located on the top of the zzso and binds both zzso and zzso zzso although only the zzso acid zzso makes direct zzso zzso acid alignment suggests that the zzso acid binding site is zzso in several species D zzso Our results show that the altered viral zzso and cell binding of zzso relative to those of zzso are not explained by a different binding ability toward zzso
