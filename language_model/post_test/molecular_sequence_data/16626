zzso resistance to zzso in clinical zzso of zzso zzso arises from zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Whether these are the only zzso zzso that zzso zzso resistance or simply those that survive in the clinic is zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were therefore generated to examine their zzso zzso and the in zzso and in zzso fitness costs associated with them before and after zzso zzso Most spontaneous zzso zzso zzso carried zzso or zzso zzso in zzso but a new zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso carried combinations of previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but additional combinations also occurred involving novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were not associated with substantial fitness costs, a finding that is consistent with the occurrence of zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso of clinical zzso zzso zzso were zzso but fitness could be restored by subculture in the absence of zzso In most cases, this was the result of zzso zzso that also suppressed zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso despite retention of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso explanations for zzso resistance and loss of fitness were obtained by molecular modeling of zzso zzso zzso which provided data on zzso binding and interaction with the zzso zzso zzso
