The zzso zzso gene derived from a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso has a sequence identical to that of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso studies with DNA fragments obtained by restriction zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that the identical zzso sequences were zzso on dissimilar plasmids from the two zzso
