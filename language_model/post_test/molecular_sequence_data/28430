A complementary DNA library from zzso cells was screened using zzso derived from a breast zzso and from normal breast zzso From zzso plaques zzso of zzso we obtained a clone zzso which was zzso expressed in the zzso The distribution of its corresponding transcript of zzso zzso was examined in normal and zzso cells, by filter and in zzso zzso We observed zzso of zzso to the zzso cells of breast zzso with no significant reaction over zzso or vascular elements or on normal zzso zzso zzso sequencing showed zzso to be 250 zzso in zzso of which 197 were zzso to the zzso region and a short open reading frame of the zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso was found principally in breast zzso cell lines and zzso with low levels in benign breast disease and no expression in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso contained this zzso zzso from + to + + + + zzso it was present in zzso zzso of zzso positive zzso compared to zzso zzso of zzso negative zzso In 21 patients who had undergone primary zzso therapy for zzso disease expression of zzso in the primary zzso correlated with the subsequent response to treatment zzso zzso zzso and was of similar zzso value as zzso zzso Both tests correctly predicted outcome in about zzso of zzso
