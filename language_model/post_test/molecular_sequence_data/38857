A rapid zzso screening method for zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso genes was developed for monitoring zzso zzso This method determines the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso from viral DNA using a procedure as zzso The zzso gene of each sample virus strain is amplified and isolated under the control of a zzso promoter by zzso The zzso products are transcribed with zzso zzso zzso and translated in a rabbit zzso zzso Using this method, zzso characteristics and the size of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA were defined in less than 2 days without virus zzso The zzso should be a powerful tool in monitoring drug-resistant zzso especially in cases in which virus isolation is zzso
