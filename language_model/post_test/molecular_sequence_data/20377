The relation of zzso zzso zzso to Parkinson's disease has long been zzso but the zzso species and its molecular properties have yet to be zzso To obtain insight into the properties of zzso in an zzso state, we studied the structural properties of zzso at zzso pH using zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso remains zzso unfolded at lower zzso but secondary structure zzso were changed in proximity to zzso zzso The ensemble of zzso of zzso at zzso pH is characterized by a zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso region, an increased probability for proximity between the zzso and the zzso region and a lower probability for interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso
