A gene cloning strategy based on the screening of the zzso zzso zzso database zzso using sequences of zzso zzso proteins of zzso was employed to identify the zzso zzso the precursor of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 1230 zzso acid zzso The protein sequence shows significant zzso with sequences corresponding to zzso zzso zzso from lower zzso and to zzso zzso from several zzso The zzso zzso zzso carries out the central activity of zzso gene expression and, by providing the zzso zzso for zzso is also implicated in the maintenance and propagation of the zzso zzso Genes involved in the control of zzso replication and gene expression are attractive candidates for human disorders due to abnormalities of zzso zzso zzso The availability of the zzso zzso will allow us to test its role in zzso zzso In addition, we propose the zzso of zzso based on zzso zzso comparison, as a powerful, simple, rapid and inexpensive method, that may accelerate zzso the molecular dissection of the human zzso zzso
