Although zzso zzso are increasingly recognized as widespread in insects, no systematic screens for such zzso have been conducted in zzso species (the primary insect genetic models for studies of evolution, development, and innate zzso Previous efforts screened relatively few zzso zzso mainly for zzso We conducted an extensive survey of potentially zzso zzso from any bacterial lineage via zzso screens of mature zzso in 181 recently collected fly strains representing 35 species from 11 species zzso Due to our fly sampling methods, however, we are likely to have missed fly strains infected with sex zzso zzso Only zzso and zzso both widespread in insects, were confirmed as zzso These findings indicate that in contrast to some other insect groups, other zzso zzso are uncommon in zzso species, possibly reflecting a robust innate immune response that eliminates many zzso A more extensive survey targeted these two zzso types through diagnostic zzso in zzso strains representing 225 species from 32 species zzso Of these, 19 species were infected by zzso while only 3 species had zzso Several new strains of zzso and zzso were discovered, including ones divergent from any reported to zzso The zzso distribution of zzso and zzso in zzso is zzso
