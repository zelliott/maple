In the process of analyzing the contribution of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso to the zzso exclusion of zzso gene zzso we have found a novel type of zzso zzso zzso In one zzso of the mouse zzso T cell zzso a J alpha gene segment has been zzso precisely to a sequence that does not display any zzso to known V and D gene zzso The appended sequence originates from within the V alpha locus and is located, in the zzso 1 zzso upstream of a member of the V alpha zzso segment zzso No zzso signal sequences have been found zzso to the zzso zzso These observations indicate that in normal T zzso zzso zzso may be affected by zzso zzso similar to those that predominate in human T cell tumors containing zzso 14 inversion or zzso Furthermore, compilation of published data and cloning and sequencing of three additional zzso has allowed us to examine the status of zzso in nine mouse T cell clones expressing functional alpha zzso Interestingly, in contrast to the situation observed at the zzso only 1 of 18 analyzed zzso has retained a zzso zzso zzso In addition, in each T cell zzso zzso on zzso zzso were zzso distributed over the J alpha region and shown to generally involve neighboring J alpha gene zzso
