Natural zzso zzso to band 3 zzso of zzso membrane zzso 3 zzso are known to bind to zzso zzso and believed to initiate zzso zzso removal of the zzso cells from blood zzso zzso 3 zzso also bind to the zzso with zzso zzso abnormalities such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stress appears to be responsible for the generation of zzso cell zzso on zzso to which zzso 3 zzso zzso since zzso oxidized in zzso bind zzso 3 zzso and various zzso modifications are observed in zzso zzso as well as the zzso with abnormal zzso Major zzso sites of band 3 for zzso 3 zzso zzso are its zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso chains on zzso zzso are indeed involved in the zzso sites on zzso zzso The finding of the zzso zzso and possible involvement of zzso mechanism are compatible with the band 3 zzso hypothesis, in which zzso of band 3 molecules in zzso membrane is supposed to be responsible for effective binding of zzso 3 zzso to the cell surface, because the zzso zzso of band 3 can form zzso zzso on cell surface when band 3 molecules zzso and zzso stress can induce such zzso Interestingly, zzso chains of band 3 on oxidized zzso are also recognized by zzso zzso Thus, zzso chains may play dual roles as zzso for recognition by zzso 3 zzso and by zzso
