To analyze the genetic characterization of epidemic zzso virus strains isolated in zzso from zzso a total of 145 zzso virus strains were isolated using zzso cell line from the patients' throat zzso during zzso outbreaks and zzso cases in zzso Province from 2007 to zzso zzso of 945 zzso containing zzso gene from 145 zzso virus zzso were amplified by zzso the zzso products were zzso and zzso Based on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso trees were constructed with 32 WHO zzso reference strains of 13 zzso downloaded from zzso and 145 zzso virus zzso The results showed that the 145 zzso virus strains in 2007 zzso belonged to zzso zzso zzso acids and zzso acids similarities were zzso and zzso zzso Compared to the zzso reference zzso zzso zzso the zzso acids and zzso acids similarities were zzso and zzso respectively except for one zzso acid change zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso there had no change found in the important zzso zzso sites, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the other zzso zzso All the 145 strains isolated had the same zzso acid change zzso in E1 zzso These findings suggested that zzso zzso of zzso virus was the zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso prevailed in recent six years was mainly caused by zzso viruses zzso zzso with zzso zzso
