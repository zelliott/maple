The zzso proteins zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso for the zzso zzso system and leading candidates for zzso vaccine zzso Although zzso has been a useful zzso this method can be insensitive to critical sequence changes in the zzso zzso including those in zzso variable regions zzso A sensitive and specific typing system for zzso zzso has been developed that uses zzso zzso zzso with zzso detection to type zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso types of geographically and temporally diverse zzso strains and sexual contact zzso were zzso zzso zzso typing zzso between most unrelated zzso and provided information about individual zzso type that was not apparent from zzso zzso zzso zzso typing avoids limited zzso zzso zzso zzso variation, and the requirement for zzso surveillance associated with zzso zzso and provides useful information about the molecular epidemiology of individual zzso gene zzso
