zzso plasma of zzso fish contains zzso zzso zzso related to those present in zzso These zzso can be bound to zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso zzso In the present study, using a zzso zzso we zzso zzso to zzso and characterized the inhibitor zzso as the second fraction of zzso activity zzso zzso from zzso The molecular weight of this inhibitor was estimated to be 56 zzso with an zzso point of zzso It effectively inhibited zzso and zzso but was less effective against zzso It formed zzso complexes with cod and bovine zzso zzso II appeared to be a zzso zzso content was determined to be zzso zzso zzso sequencing allowed identification of the first 30 zzso zzso acids zzso and 25 zzso acids within the zzso loop zzso The zzso sequence did not match any known zzso however, the sequence within the zzso loop was significantly similar to carp and zzso zzso Both sequences were used to construct zzso and obtain a zzso sequence from zzso The zzso coding the protein is zzso zzso in length including a single open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso acid zzso Analysis of this sequence indicated the presence of putative zzso zzso zzso and confirmed the similarity to carp zzso and zzso zzso Our results indicate that inhibitor II belongs to the zzso zzso and is similar to zzso
