zzso removal from zzso precursors involves zzso by a zzso zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso beginning with a zzso and zzso ending in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso then incorporates this zzso into the zzso bond that joins the two zzso Although this zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected almost three decades ago in extracts from animal and later zzso cells, the protein responsible was not yet zzso Here we report the zzso of this zzso from zzso zzso cells, and its assignment to the still zzso zzso protein zzso Studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso is able to join spliced zzso halves to zzso zzso where the joining zzso linkage contains the zzso originally present in the zzso zzso The data confirm zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efforts previously yielded a crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso protein containing a new protein fold and a zzso putative zzso binding zzso This structure guided our zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of highly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso rendered the zzso inactive suggesting these zzso to be part of the active site of the zzso zzso zzso There is no significant sequence similarity between the active sites of zzso zzso zzso and that of T4 zzso zzso nor zzso from plants and zzso zzso sequence conservation in zzso and in zzso implicates zzso zzso as the zzso animal zzso zzso zzso
