The heat shock protein zzso has been shown to associate with various cellular zzso proteins such as steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso While the interaction between steroid hormone receptors and zzso appears to be essential for zzso binding and zzso of the zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso is less zzso We have identified zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in a search for dominant zzso that zzso zzso from zzso in the developing zzso The zzso result in single zzso acid zzso in the zzso protein and cause a zzso effect on the function of the zzso zzso We show that both zzso and zzso forms of zzso bind to the activated zzso zzso but the zzso zzso protein causes a reduction in the zzso activity of zzso Our results indicate that zzso is essential for zzso function in zzso
