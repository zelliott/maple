The study of zzso zzso requires detailed knowledge of the zzso relationships of closely related zzso distributed across zzso The zzso poison frogs of the zzso zzso have undergone many zzso zzso but the zzso relationships within this group remain poorly zzso Most previous zzso were based on zzso and skin toxin zzso with limited use of DNA sequence zzso Using zzso sequence data from four gene regions zzso zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso we present a molecular zzso analysis of the evolutionary relationships within a representative group of zzso zzso We use the resulting zzso hypothesis to investigate different zzso hypotheses concerning genetic divergence and species diversity in zzso The results of the analysis support the presence of ancient zzso barriers to gene flow between eastern and western zzso and indicate substantial genetic divergence between species found in the northern and southern regions of western zzso
