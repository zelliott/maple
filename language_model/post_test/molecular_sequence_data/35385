High zzso Group A proteins zzso and zzso are architectural nuclear factors involved in development, cell zzso and cancer formation and zzso Here we report the zzso zzso expression and functional analysis of a new zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso that exists in three different zzso zzso and 3 zzso but not zzso 2, are expressed throughout the entire development of zzso both in the maternal and zzso zzso zzso transcripts are present in the animal pole in the early maternal zzso during the zzso phase, zzso can be detected in the developing central nervous system zzso including the eye, and in the neural zzso We show evidence that zzso proteins differ from typical zzso proteins in terms of their properties in DNA binding and in zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence that they are involved in early zzso development and in neural crest zzso
