To study the signal zzso of zzso we characterized zzso proteins zzso isolated from tobacco callus zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the soluble fraction of tobacco callus zzso cells by zzso exchange zzso on a zzso column and affinity zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by the equilibrium dialysis zzso The degree of zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso These proteins had molecular masses of 34 zzso and 26 zzso and to bind zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso of BA to zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso or zzso The optimum pH for binding of BA to zzso and zzso was approximately pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso protein zzso These findings and the results of zzso analysis and zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that zzso is zzso a stress zzso
