zzso bond zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the candidate processing zzso of zzso zzso factor, are prepared in high yield and purity by novel synthetic zzso The zzso compounds retain essential zzso for zzso zzso but place the zzso zzso site in the midst of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso can be considered zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The most potent zzso zzso zzso zzso is about fivefold less potent than the best zzso inhibitor zzso and both the zzso and zzso compounds are competitive, zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso peptides containing two zzso zzso zzso are three- to tenfold more potent than the analogous compounds containing only one zzso zzso zzso confirming the importance of both zzso zzso in the zzso processing recognition zzso As expected, because of their moderate zzso the zzso are not useful affinity zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but both zzso zzso are effective affinity zzso
