Although zzso zzso on zzso zzso regulates the activity of many zzso zzso there are few examples of this type of regulation in zzso We have identified the first essential zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with altered zzso zzso are zzso and depletion of zzso yields chains of cells with zzso outer zzso linked by unresolved zzso zzso zzso reduces cell zzso in a manner similar to deleting the intermediate filament protein zzso but it does not disrupt zzso zzso or membrane zzso Although it has no obvious signal sequence or zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso inner zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso accumulates at the division site during the last quarter of the cell zzso We propose that zzso zzso one or more proteins involved in zzso zzso or zzso which in turn affect cell zzso cell envelope integrity, and zzso zzso
