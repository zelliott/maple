In a previous report, zzso et zzso zzso described a zzso family in which severe zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso mental zzso as an zzso zzso zzso mapping to the broad zzso between zzso We zzso this family, initially analyzing zzso a gene in the disease zzso that was identified as a cause of zzso after the initial report of this zzso We found that the male zzso lacked the zzso three zzso of zzso and that zzso marks the zzso boundary of a zzso zzso deletion that includes two other zzso genes zzso zzso one predicted transcript zzso a zinc finger protein zzso and two highly zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that this family is segregating a zzso gene deletion and that the absence of a functional zzso accounts, at least in part, for the retinal zzso while deletion of one or more of the other genes is likely responsible for the mental zzso zzso
