zzso editing sites and their zzso zzso recognition factors are thought to have zzso zzso evolutionary loss of an editing site by a zzso zzso is normally followed by the loss of the specific recognition factor for this site, due to the absence of selective pressure for its zzso Here, we have tested this scenario for the only zzso zzso zzso editing zzso A single zzso editing site in the tomato zzso gene is absent from the tobacco and zzso zzso zzso where the presence of a zzso T zzso zzso the need for editing of the zzso zzso We have introduced the tomato editing site into the tobacco zzso gene by zzso transformation and find that, surprisingly, this zzso site is efficiently edited in the zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso recognition factor for the zzso editing site has been zzso presumably because it serves another function in tobacco zzso zzso analyses identified an editing site in the zzso gene of tobacco and tomato whose sequence context exhibits striking similarity to that of the tomato zzso editing zzso This may suggest that requirement for zzso editing resulted in maintenance of the zzso editing activity or, zzso the pre-existing zzso editing activity facilitated the evolution of a novel editing site in zzso
