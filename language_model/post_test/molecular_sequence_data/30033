The zzso sequence of the long terminal repeats zzso of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined and compared with that of the zzso zzso Both shared the typical zzso R zzso structure together with unusual features of zzso in the zzso primer binding site and adjacent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were almost identical and differed from the zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso analysis of cellular and zzso zzso suggested that zzso and zzso elements zzso with comparable efficiency but that in contrast to zzso zzso expression which affects all types of zzso element, only zzso elements were found to be serum zzso Both modes of zzso regulation were found to be coupled through protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all classes of zzso However the same region of zzso zzso did not zzso serum responsiveness zzso that zzso regulatory zzso of zzso elements zzso growth factor responsiveness are at least in part zzso from those responsible for cell zzso zzso
