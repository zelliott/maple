zzso zzso zzso is responsible for extensive tissue destruction in gas zzso and its activity is enhanced by calcium zzso The zzso domain is the minimal segment of the zzso required for binding to zzso collagen zzso and for subsequent zzso The zzso domain is joined to another binding module by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso secondary structural transformation from an zzso to a zzso and forms a zzso zzso in the presence of calcium zzso In this study, various zzso methods were zzso to better understand the structure and functional role of the novel zzso zzso Two zzso zzso bind zzso with zzso association zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the second calcium zzso is zzso zzso which could be a result of zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso protein is more stable than the zzso protein against zzso zzso zzso approximately 20 degrees zzso and chemical zzso zzso approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The compact zzso zzso domain is more resistant to zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso The orientation of the zzso appears to play a crucial role in the stability and dynamics of the zzso zzso
