zzso zzso zzso specimens were collected from representative areas in China, including the major production provinces of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Seven zzso related to soybean mosaic virus zzso which could be zzso on zzso zzso and some soybean zzso max zzso zzso zzso were detected using double zzso sandwich zzso zzso zzso and zzso amplification performed with zzso primer of zzso It is revealed that the common zzso infecting zzso zzso is, indeed, only zzso rather than zzso mosaic virus zzso as previously zzso Further molecular zzso analysis of the coat protein zzso genes of these zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with some other zzso members, such as zzso and Watermelon mosaic virus zzso reconstructed the evolutionary route on both zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso of zzso sequences for zzso zzso genes demonstrated high host correlation and low partial habitat zzso while those of zzso acid sequences also showed that the host correlation was more notable than the habitat zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso region within zzso determines the main function, which shows high zzso between zzso This study zzso from the viruses themselves and their relationship to the infected hosts and revealed the evolutionary strategies, especially the rapid variation or zzso of zzso of zzso zzso in order to adapt itself naturally to the special zzso
