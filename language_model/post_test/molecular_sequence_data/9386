Recent studies suggest reduction of zzso fatty acid zzso to zzso zzso by interaction with zzso zzso zzso may represent an zzso function for zzso The nature and structural consequences of this selective interaction are zzso 

zzso we used molecular dynamics zzso analysis to address these zzso zzso simulations of zzso suggest zzso molecules are bound zzso with the molecules free to explore multiple zzso in a binding site at the entrance to the classical zzso zzso zzso Models of zzso zzso and zzso acids were created and the lipids found to wrap around zzso thus providing a plausible mechanism by which zzso acids bearing zzso on different carbon atoms can interact with zzso to yield zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that a second zzso exposed Met at position 49 was zzso by a zzso zzso attached to zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso MD simulations of zzso showed zzso of the loop containing zzso were higher in the oxidized zzso indicating increased flexibility that is predicted to destabilize the protein and promote zzso 

These studies provide novel insights into the mechanisms that may contribute to the zzso function of zzso and the structural consequences that result if zzso is not zzso back to its native zzso
