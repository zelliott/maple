zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of six zzso species zzso zzso display differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso that reflect evolution at different habitat zzso zzso increases in zzso with increasing measurement temperature occur for all zzso yet zzso at normal body temperatures is similar among species because of the inverse relationship between adaptation temperature and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso also zzso To determine the zzso acid zzso responsible for differences in zzso and zzso stability, zzso mapping of the zzso of all six species was first zzso Then, the zzso acid sequences of the three zzso having the most similar zzso zzso those of the north temperate species, zzso zzso the zzso species, zzso zzso and the south temperate species, zzso zzso were deduced from the respective zzso zzso At most, there were four zzso acid zzso between any pair of species, none of which occurred in the loop or zzso binding sites of the zzso The sequence of zzso from zzso zzso differs from that of zzso zzso only at position zzso The zzso of zzso zzso differs from the other two sequences at positions 8, 61, 68, and zzso We used a full-length zzso clone of zzso of zzso zzso to test, by zzso zzso the importance of these sequence changes in establishing the observed differences in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in sequence at sites 61 and/or 68 appear to account for the differences in zzso between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at position 8 appear to account for the difference in zzso stability between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso adaptation of proteins to temperature thus may be achieved by minor changes in sequence at locations outside of active sites, and these changes may independently affect kinetic properties and zzso zzso
