zzso cloning of a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was performed using a zzso mouse zzso line L cell and zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library generated with zzso zzso of a mouse zzso line zzso and zzso zzso T zzso were zzso into L zzso The isolated zzso clone zzso predicted a type II membrane protein with 13 zzso acids of zzso domain, 17 zzso acids of zzso region, and a large zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso Introduction of the zzso clone into L cells resulted in the zzso of zzso and high activity of zzso Among zzso only zzso showed significant activity as an zzso indicating that this gene product is a zzso specific for the synthesis of zzso An zzso acid sequence deduced from the cloned zzso showed the typical zzso motif with common features among zzso Among various mouse zzso brain, liver, and zzso showed relatively high expression of a zzso zzso whereas all zzso more or less, expressed this zzso
