The efficient production of zzso proteins by Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells in modern zzso is often zzso by the use of proliferation control zzso The most common method is to shift the culture temperature from 37 zzso to zzso zzso though genetic approaches to achieving the same effect are also of zzso In this work we used zzso expression profiling using zzso cards to identify zzso displaying differential expression zzso after zzso zzso from 37 zzso to 31 zzso Six zzso were found to be significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of zzso expression over a 6 day batch culture, with and without zzso demonstrated decreased expression over time in both cultures but to a significantly greater extent in cells shifted to a lower culture zzso zzso when zzso levels were increased zzso by zzso with zzso mimic in zzso cells, cell proliferation at 37 zzso was effectively blocked over a 96 h culture zzso On the other hand, transient zzso of zzso zzso levels using zzso had no impact on cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso production at 37 zzso though the yield was lower than cells grown at reduced zzso This is the first report demonstrating a functional impact of specific zzso zzso on zzso cell behavior in batch culture and provides some evidence of the potential which these molecules may have in terms of engineering targets in zzso production zzso Finally, we report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso
