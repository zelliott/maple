To zzso the sequence diversity of the zzso resistance gene zzso in zzso zzso from humans and animals and to determine mobile elements associated with zzso in zzso zzso 

In total, 205 zzso zzso were screened for zzso by zzso zzso genes were zzso and compared with zzso deposited in zzso Based on zzso analysis zzso were screened for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed by linking zzso spa typing was performed and selected zzso were used as donors in a filter mating zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the human, zzso poultry and cattle zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso was located on zzso and zzso zzso in humans and on a specific zzso element in zzso Human zzso were of different spa types zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to different zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso Animal zzso were of spa type zzso zzso or zzso corresponding to zzso zzso sequence types correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were able to transfer to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of human origin contained diverse zzso located on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of animal origin contained zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso plays an important role in the evolution and horizontal spread of zzso in zzso zzso This is the first study showing horizontal transfer of zzso zzso
