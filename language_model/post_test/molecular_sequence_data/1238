We previously reported a zzso mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso gene sequence in approximately 38% of human breast cancer DNA, but not in normal breasts or other zzso This zzso zzso gene sequence was expressed in zzso of the zzso zzso human breast zzso An entire zzso structure was identified in human breast cancer DNA with high zzso to zzso and low zzso to known human zzso zzso zzso long terminal repeat zzso sequences were also detected in zzso of human breast zzso They contain zzso zzso zzso family zzso and the open reading frame for the zzso zzso We have now amplified and zzso zzso sag sequences from 10 human breast zzso and we found that they are highly zzso to those of zzso However, deletions and insertions at the zzso of sag were zzso The immune function of the human zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The sag gene was cloned and expressed in a human zzso line zzso zzso proliferation and zzso releasing zzso were performed after zzso of T cells with zzso Ramos zzso zzso The results indicate that expression of the human zzso stimulates zzso zzso in zzso as the mouse zzso zzso Because the zzso responses in zzso are considered similar to those in zzso these results suggest that the human zzso zzso might also play a role in human breast zzso
