A zzso zzso method of detecting zzso species which contain the zzso zzso has been developed using the zzso chain reaction zzso A pair of zzso have been zzso encompassing a 500 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA consisting of the zzso gene with a 94 zzso deletion situated between the primer recognition zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso target salmonella DNA with known quantities of competitor DNA in the same reaction tube gave zzso products of 500 and zzso zzso zzso Visual assessment of the ratio of the two products on zzso zzso stained zzso gels provided an estimate of the approximate number of salmonella cells present in avian zzso The technique could be applied to detect zzso any zzso DNA in clinical samples if a suitable DNA sequence for primer construction is zzso
