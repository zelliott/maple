This study presents a zzso zzso analysis of zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso grown in zzso without nutritional zzso Using a combination of strong zzso exchange zzso and immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso followed by zzso we identified zzso putative zzso with zzso matches to zzso different zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein set revealed that zzso from nuclear proteins with zzso function were the most zzso There are indications that zzso sites from zzso zzso representing diverse biological processes are zzso in zzso zzso sequences of three zzso from known zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso site zzso
