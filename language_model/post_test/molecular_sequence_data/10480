Y zzso zzso are particularly useful in deciphering human evolutionary history because they accentuate the effects of zzso migration, and range zzso zzso acceleration of Y zzso marker discovery and subsequent typing involving zzso detection has been achieved by implementing an innovative and zzso method called zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The power of the method resides in its sensitivity and ability to rapidly compare amplified sequences in an automated zzso We have determined the zzso states of 22 Y zzso 19 of which are zzso in zzso diverse extant zzso established zzso zzso and deduced a zzso All major geographic regions, including zzso are characterized by zzso reflecting episodes of genetic drift and zzso Most zzso markers are localized zzso However, some show wider zzso and designate older, core zzso One zzso defines a major zzso that zzso a previously unknown deep, apparently zzso zzso It provides evidence of an ancient bottleneck zzso It is now possible to anticipate the inevitable detailed reconstruction of human Y zzso zzso based on several tens to even hundreds of these important zzso
