When a genetically engineered zzso zzso is released into a natural ecosystem, its survival, and hence its potential environmental impact, depends on its genetic stability and potential for growth under highly zzso zzso In this study, we compared zzso stability and potential for growth on low zzso of organic nutrients of strains of zzso zzso serving as model zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and two zzso zzso all containing zzso resistance zzso were held physically separate from but in chemical contact with lake water containing the natural zzso microbial zzso zzso were zzso at intervals over a zzso period to determine the percent retaining the zzso and the specific growth rate on various zzso zzso stability in lake water was strongly strain zzso the zzso zzso was zzso maintained by the zzso strain for the duration of the test but was lost within 24 h by both of the zzso zzso growth rates of zzso compared with those of the corresponding zzso zzso strains zzso parental zzso were not different when measured in rich medium zzso zzso However, specific growth rates were 42, 55, and zzso higher in zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso respectively, when measured in zzso medium after exposure of 15 days or longer to lake zzso Moreover, lake zzso strains grew actively when reintroduced into sterile lake water zzso to zzso increase in numbers over 7 zzso while the corresponding zzso parental strains exhibited no growth over the same zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
