We recently described zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso Marcus, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now present the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the heavy and light chains of these zzso The zzso were generated in a single fusion, their heavy as well as their light chains are almost zzso and they appear to be zzso zzso The light chains were zzso by J zzso 5 and a V zzso gene belonging to the zzso family, but they are only zzso zzso to the most closely related zzso zzso and they are probably zzso by a zzso gene that has not yet been zzso The heavy chains were all zzso by zzso and zzso and have identical N zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a potential zzso site at zzso in the zzso region zzso This site, which has been retained in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso out by a single base change in all four zzso zzso
