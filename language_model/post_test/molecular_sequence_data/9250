zzso shows zzso activity against zzso bacteria, but its therapeutic potential is limited by its zzso In this study, eight zzso zzso with altered zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso by substituting neutral and zzso zzso acid zzso on the zzso face of the zzso by five or six zzso increased zzso potency approximately zzso to zzso although when the number of positive charges was increased from zzso to zzso the zzso potency was not additionally zzso The substitution of an zzso with a zzso meanwhile maintaining the net charge and the mean zzso values, had only a minor effect on its zzso activity, whereas significantly led a decrease in its zzso zzso Of all the zzso zzso has the best potential as an zzso agent because its zzso activity against both zzso and zzso bacteria is substantial, and its zzso activity is zzso zzso adopts an zzso in 50% zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso killed zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso zzso in zzso and its zzso effect was zzso zzso affects the integrity of zzso and zzso plasma zzso by rapidly inducing membrane zzso
