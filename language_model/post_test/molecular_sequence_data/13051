zzso zzso is an essential component of the import zzso complex in the zzso zzso outer zzso zzso consists of three distinct zzso the zzso zzso domain, the internal zzso domain, and the zzso zzso space zzso In the present study, we examined the roles of the zzso domain of zzso which is rich in zzso zzso zzso in protein import into zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso expressing zzso delta zzso a zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso domain, could grow as fast as those expressing zzso zzso while cells expressing zzso delta zzso a zzso zzso lacking both the zzso space and the zzso zzso stopped growing as soon as zzso zzso was zzso zzso delta zzso was correctly integrated into the zzso outer membrane like zzso zzso zzso containing zzso delta zzso instead of zzso zzso could import both authentic and artificial zzso precursor proteins nearly as efficiently as zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso space domain of zzso is not essential for targeting or functions of zzso
