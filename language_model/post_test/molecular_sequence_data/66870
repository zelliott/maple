zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso protein 2) is induced by zzso zzso factor zzso when cells need to respond quickly to different zzso zzso A recent study using zzso zzso technology has suggested that zzso zzso is regulated in a cell zzso manner, although the mechanism for such regulation is zzso In this study, we confirmed the cell zzso regulation of zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso Additionally, we found that a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cycle gene zzso zzso element in the zzso promoter mediates zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso expression is enhanced by zzso zzso and selective zzso of zzso causes cells blocked in zzso with zzso to become susceptible to zzso indicating that the zzso expression of zzso contributes to the survival of zzso arrested zzso Our studies describing the zzso zzso expression of zzso will help in further understanding the molecular basis of zzso zzso in a variety of human zzso
