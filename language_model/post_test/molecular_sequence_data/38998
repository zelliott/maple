We defined an zzso on the Japanese encephalitis virus zzso envelope zzso protein recognized by zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso induced in zzso zzso zzso mice recognized E and/or zzso zzso zzso while zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice did zzso zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which had binding motifs for zzso zzso or zzso were zzso according to the zzso acid sequences of zzso and E zzso zzso induced by zzso infection recognized only the zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice with only a group of peptides including zzso induced zzso which recognized the zzso zzso zzso while zzso with other peptides did zzso The zzso zzso had a binding motif for zzso This is consistent with the finding that zzso zzso in zzso mice was zzso These results indicate that the zzso recognized by zzso in zzso mice is located between zzso 60 and 68 on the E zzso corresponding to an zzso sequence of zzso
