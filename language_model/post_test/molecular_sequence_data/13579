Control of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso is zzso primarily by the zzso factor zzso zzso In the absence of zzso and zzso cell viability is lost, but can be regained by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso gene can also bypass the normally essential requirement for zzso zzso encodes a zinc finger protein which is able to repress zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and thereby inhibit cells from entering zzso We have found that expression of zzso from a high copy number zzso can specifically induce zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone shows no discernible effect on zzso growth, however, deletion of zzso in a zzso delta zzso strain results in a lowering of the zzso temperature for zzso This suggests that zzso plays a significant but ancillary role in zzso in inducing zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts directly with the zzso promoter and have mapped the region of the zzso promoter required for zzso zzso zzso with zzso having a cell cycle role in zzso we have found that zzso zzso is zzso periodically in the cell cycle, with maximum zzso occurring at the zzso zzso Thus zzso may act both to promote zzso by zzso zzso zzso and prevent zzso by zzso zzso zzso
