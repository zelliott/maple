We employed the zzso chain reaction and zzso DNA library screening to clone novel human zzso zzso and zzso and a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each zzso G zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso within their coding regions, while zzso contains at least one zzso The zzso zzso by zzso shares the highest identity with human zzso zzso type B zzso overall and zzso in the zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso type A zzso overall and 51% in the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso that shares highest identity with the zzso Y zzso zzso overall and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso shares highest identity with the zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso overall and zzso in the zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis localized zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso
