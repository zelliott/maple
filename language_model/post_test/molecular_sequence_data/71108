The low zzso and high nuclear concentration of the zzso form of Ran provides zzso for both nuclear protein import and zzso Both import and export factors bind zzso directly, yet this interaction produces opposite zzso in the former case, zzso binding zzso nuclear cargo release, whereas in the latter, zzso binding zzso nuclear cargo zzso zzso nuclear import and export receptors and their protein recognition sites are predicted to be zzso Nevertheless, the approximately zzso acid zzso sequence present in zzso nuclear zzso A1 has been reported to serve as both a nuclear zzso signal and a nuclear export zzso even though only one zzso the nuclear import factor zzso has been shown to bind zzso zzso We have used a combination of zzso zzso followed by selection for zzso binding to zzso define zzso acids in zzso that are critical for zzso binding in zzso As expected, the zzso approximately zzso acid zzso consensus sequence is also zzso of nuclear zzso signal zzso Surprisingly, however, this extensive zzso analysis failed to dissect zzso nuclear zzso signal and nuclear export signal zzso Nevertheless, zzso appears unlikely to be the zzso export zzso as zzso can be shown to block zzso binding by zzso not only in zzso but also in the nucleus in zzso This analysis therefore predicts the existence of a nuclear export zzso distinct from zzso that nevertheless shares a common zzso site on zzso nuclear zzso zzso
