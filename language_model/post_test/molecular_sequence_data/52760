A central problem in understanding zzso regulation is to define the zzso states that account for zzso changes in zzso zzso For zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso the active, relaxed (R zzso zzso is generally assumed to be represented by the crystal structure of the complex of the zzso with the zzso analog zzso zzso It is zzso however, which zzso differences between the zzso zzso taut zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex are attributable to localized effects of inhibitor binding as contrasted to the zzso zzso To define the zzso changes in the isolated, zzso C zzso resulting from the binding of zzso we determined the zzso resolution crystal structure of the C zzso zzso In contrast to the free C zzso the zzso zzso exhibits approximate zzso zzso zzso changes in the C zzso upon zzso binding include ordering of two active site zzso and closure of the hinge relating the zzso and zzso zzso The C zzso structure closely resembles the zzso C zzso in the zzso zzso This similarity suggests that the pronounced hinge closure and other changes promoted by zzso binding to the zzso are stabilized by zzso zzso zzso the zzso changes attributable to the zzso transition of the zzso remain to be zzso
