zzso proteins zzso belong to a family of zzso for zzso zzso zzso of human natural killer zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso a soluble zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso could be recognized by zzso cells via zzso Here we show that immobilized soluble zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso These zzso T cells zzso zzso zzso and display a strong zzso activity toward zzso zzso We also show that zzso binds to a soluble zzso protein containing zzso and activates zzso zzso T cells zzso with zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso is expressed not only on human tumor cells, but also on zzso virus zzso peripheral blood zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso functions as a zzso for both zzso and zzso and may play a key role in immune surveillance of tumor development and clearance of viral zzso
