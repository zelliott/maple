All zzso receptors zzso share a common molecular architecture (with seven putative zzso zzso and a common signaling zzso in that they interact with G proteins zzso zzso to regulate the synthesis of zzso second zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso Historically, zzso have been classified into six families, which were thought to be zzso three of these are found in zzso Recent work has identified several new zzso families and suggested the possibility of a common evolutionary origin for all of zzso Family B (the zzso family or zzso zzso of the zzso is a small but structurally and functionally diverse group of proteins that includes receptors for zzso hormones, molecules thought to mediate zzso interactions at the plasma membrane and a group of zzso proteins that regulate stress responses and zzso zzso zzso have been found in all animal species investigated, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in plants, zzso or zzso In this article, I describe the structures and functions of zzso zzso and propose a simplified nomenclature for these zzso
