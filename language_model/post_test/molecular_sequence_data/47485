Three zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso were identified in a screen of barley zzso zzso expression libraries, and their binding and expression characteristics were zzso Two of these zzso designated zzso and zzso are closely related to group II, whereas the third, zzso is more similar to group III of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso from sections of primary leaves by Northern zzso showed that the expression of these genes zzso with the stage of leaf zzso The steady state transcript levels of the two genes zzso zzso and zzso but not of the gene for zzso were positively affected by zzso Moreover, a zzso factor is required for zzso of zzso zzso as revealed by the low level of zzso zzso in white leaves of the zzso zzso and of zzso treated with zzso zzso we propose the existence of a zzso zzso signal chain that regulates the expression of zzso
