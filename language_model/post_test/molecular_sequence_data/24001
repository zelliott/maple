Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike many animal zzso zzso are unable to bind DNA as zzso To investigate the molecular basis of their different behavior, we have constructed zzso between the HD of the sunflower zzso protein zzso and that of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the interaction of these proteins with the zzso zzso binding site and the zzso zzso binding site suggests that the loop located between zzso I and zzso II zzso acids zzso of zzso is enough to zzso efficient DNA binding activity to the zzso zzso zzso the combined zzso of zzso 24 and 25 of zzso to those present in zzso zzso originated an HD able to interact with the zzso binding site, while single zzso were zzso We have also determined that a protein with the zzso zzso and zzso III of zzso fused to the rest of the zzso HD binds to the zzso zzso binding site with increased affinity and shows extended contacts with DNA respective to zzso We conclude that the loop located between zzso I and zzso II of the HD must be regarded as one of the segments that contribute to the zzso diversity in the properties of different zzso
