Heat stress zzso treatment of cell cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to the heat stress consensus element zzso Using appropriate synthetic zzso zzso three types of clones with potential zzso binding zzso were isolated from a tomato zzso zzso expression library by zzso zzso One of the potential zzso genes is zzso zzso the other two are zzso zzso comparison defines a single domain of approximately 90 zzso acid zzso common to all three genes and to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The domain is flanked by zzso zzso and characterized by two long overlapping zzso We speculate that the derived consensus sequence is also representative for other zzso zzso and that the existence of several different zzso is not unique to zzso
