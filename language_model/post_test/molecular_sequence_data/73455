zzso were resolved at the zzso acid level for nine zzso zzso zzso directed against the central zzso region of protein G of bovine respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso binding studies showed which zzso acids in the zzso contributed to zzso zzso The details of the zzso were compared with the high-resolution structure of a synthetic zzso corresponding to the central zzso region of zzso and this indicated which face of the central zzso region is the zzso zzso The major linear zzso of the central zzso region of zzso is located at the tip of the loop, overlapping a relatively flat surface formed by a double zzso zzso zzso At least one, but possibly two sulfur atoms of a zzso bridge that line the zzso pocket at the center of the flat surface, is a major contributor to zzso zzso Some of the zzso positions in the zzso have zzso during the evolution of zzso which suggests that the virus escaped zzso recognition with these zzso zzso that occur at positions 177 and 180 may have only a local effect on the zzso surface, without influencing the structure of the zzso whereas zzso at positions 183 and 184 will probably have major structural zzso The study explains the zzso zzso and functional importance of each zzso in the zzso noose which provides information for zzso vaccine zzso Additionally, analysis of the zzso demonstrated that two point zzso at positions 180 and 205 define the preliminary zzso of zzso zzso
