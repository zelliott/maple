Blood samples to be tested for the presence of zzso DNA by using specific DNA zzso are routinely stored in our laboratory as zzso zzso zzso To safeguard against the risk of accidental infection with zzso agents such as the human zzso virus type 1 zzso while manipulating large numbers of blood samples in preparation for DNA zzso we determined the residual zzso of zzso after exposure to zzso zzso Both zzso virus stocks or zzso cells, suspended either in tissue culture medium or freshly drawn blood, were completely zzso upon contact with the zzso zzso This was verified by the absence of any zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of long-term cultures and the absence of zzso DNA fragments after amplification by zzso chain reaction with DNA from such cultures as target zzso These results support the conclusion that the virus is in fact completely zzso by contact with the zzso zzso rendering blood specimens stored as zzso zzso in regard to zzso
