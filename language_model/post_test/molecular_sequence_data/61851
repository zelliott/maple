To develop a diagnostic tool to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso in clinical zzso we developed a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso using zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso of zzso zzso One pair of zzso zzso reacted specifically with two reference strains of zzso zzso tested and seven samples isolated from naturally infected zzso The primer pair did not produce zzso products of the correct size from any other zzso or human zzso or cellular DNA from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was confirmed by Southern zzso with probe specific for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso established in this study is suitable for diagnosis of zzso zzso infection in clinical zzso
