With the growing number of completely zzso bacterial zzso accurate gene prediction in bacterial zzso remains an important zzso Although the existing tools predict genes in bacterial zzso with high overall zzso their ability to pinpoint the translation start site remains zzso In this paper, we present a novel approach to bacterial start site prediction that takes into account multiple features of a potential start site, zzso zzso binding site zzso binding energy, distance of the zzso from the start zzso distance from the beginning of the zzso zzso to the start zzso the start zzso itself and the zzso potential around the start zzso Mixed zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso The accuracy of this approach is up to zzso compared to zzso using the most common tools in fully automated mode zzso is, without expert human zzso of zzso The approach is evaluated using zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso These three zzso cover a broad spectrum of bacterial zzso since zzso is a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso is an zzso A significant problem is generating a set of zzso start sites for zzso training, in the absence of experimental zzso We found that sequence conservation between zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso clearly zzso the gene start in many cases, providing a sufficient training zzso
