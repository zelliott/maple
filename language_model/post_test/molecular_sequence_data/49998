We have reported on zzso and zzso which inhibit zzso zzso zzso by interacting with zzso and zzso Here, we report the cloning of a third member in this family, zzso zzso is expressed exclusively in the brain and its gene locates in zzso zzso in zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso contains an zzso domain in the zzso and a zzso zzso region zzso zzso in the zzso that is necessary for membrane zzso However, zzso does not possess a functional zzso binding domain zzso since the critical zzso acid zzso zzso in this region was replaced with zzso in zzso Although zzso suppressed growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was lower than that of zzso or zzso By the analysis of zzso molecules between zzso and zzso we found that the zzso domain, rather than zzso is responsible for efficient zzso zzso The finding of zzso revealed the presence of a novel family of regulators for the zzso zzso pathway, each member of which may have different zzso for zzso zzso
