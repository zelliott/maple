zzso and molecular modeling studies of human zzso virus type 1 reverse zzso zzso have revealed that a structural element, the minor groove binding track zzso is important for both replication zzso zzso and zzso The zzso interactions occur in the DNA minor groove from the second through sixth base pair from the primer zzso where the DNA zzso a structural transition from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso had previously demonstrated that zzso and zzso of the zzso contributes important DNA zzso To probe the molecular interactions occurring in this critical region, eight zzso of zzso were studied in which alternate zzso were zzso for zzso These zzso were characterized in primer extension zzso in which the template DNA was zzso at a single zzso by either zzso or zzso of zzso zzso These zzso failed to block DNA zzso by zzso zzso yet the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso terminated synthesis on zzso zzso zzso zzso the sites of termination occurred primarily 1 and 3 bases following zzso zzso when the zzso was positioned in the major groove of the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso serves as a zzso zzso of altered minor groove interactions and identifies which base pair interactions are altered by these zzso In addition, the major groove zzso must alter important structural transitions in the zzso zzso such as minor groove zzso that allow zzso access to the minor zzso
