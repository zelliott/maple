In the framework of the international project aimed at the sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso segment, which contains the zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso This region (40 zzso zzso 73 zzso degrees on the genetic zzso contains 38 complete zzso and one partial zzso Three zzso the closest to the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso search for the products deduced from the 39 zzso revealed that 23 exhibit significant similarity to known zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the gene organization and the results of the zzso search, it is predicted that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form an zzso zzso system zzso regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E1 beta and E1 alpha zzso zzso an extremely large zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to zzso to the fusion of the genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
