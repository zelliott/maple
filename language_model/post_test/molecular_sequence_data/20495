The association of DNA with zzso results in a zzso complex called zzso that consists of repetitive zzso zzso zzso are joined together in the zzso fiber by short stretches of zzso DNA that interact with a wide diversity of zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso Although the long-term evolution of the zzso family has been the subject of different studies during the last 5 years, the lack of molecular data on zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso has been zzso attempts to complete the evolutionary picture of this zzso family in zzso especially as it zzso to the functional specialization they impart to the zzso structure in members of this zzso zzso In an attempt to fill this zzso the present work characterizes the zzso gene complement from the zzso clam zzso zzso zzso evolutionary analyses reveal that the zzso gene from this zzso represents one of the few zzso zzso zzso genes known to date, a notion which is further supported by its location within the zzso group encompassing the zzso zzso zzso in the overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although the detailed characterization of the zzso substitution patterns in zzso zzso zzso agrees with the model of zzso evolution under strong zzso selection, zzso approaches unveil the presence of zzso selection during at least part of the evolutionary differentiation between zzso and zzso The presence of increased levels of specialization in zzso zzso proteins from zzso as well as the significant differences observed in zzso properties between zzso and zzso zzso zzso represent novel and important preliminary results for future studies of the functional differentiation of this zzso zzso lineage across zzso
