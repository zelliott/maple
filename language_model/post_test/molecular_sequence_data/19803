The zzso barrier zzso remains a significant obstacle to the delivery of therapeutic agents into the central nervous system zzso zzso cell cultures of brain zzso zzso cells represent the closest possible zzso to the in zzso zzso cell providing a convenient model for the study of transport systems and events that mediate zzso delivery to the zzso In this investigation we have characterized an in zzso primary zzso model from zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso cells after recovery from zzso of zzso 12 months and studied their zzso by zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso electrical resistance of up to approximately zzso zzso and marked discrimination between the zzso and zzso cellular markers zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso showed the presence of tight junction complexes and zzso with the zzso characteristics of either zzso or zzso coated zzso zzso zzso evaluation highlighted the expression of tight junction zzso ABC zzso zzso zzso and select zzso zzso zzso studies examined the zzso of transport of zzso large neutral zzso acids and zzso zzso Our findings indicate primary zzso retain many barrier characteristics and transport pathways of the in zzso zzso Further, primary cells can be stored as frozen stocks which can be thawed and cultured without zzso drift many months after zzso Frozen zzso therefore serve as a robust and convenient in zzso cell culture tool for research programs involving zzso drug delivery and targeting and in studies addressing zzso barrier transport zzso
