Regulators of zzso zzso zzso are a family of proteins that interact with zzso to regulate zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso In addition to a zzso core domain that is necessary and sufficient for their zzso zzso protein zzso like activity, zzso possess zzso and zzso motifs that zzso distinct functional zzso In order to identify the role of the zzso region of human zzso we have characterized a series of zzso between zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso lacking the zzso containing zzso zzso Using both halo zzso as well as a zzso responsive zzso reporter zzso we demonstrate that a zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso in zzso while zzso zzso containing either the zzso non zzso sequence of zzso or the sequence containing the zzso box of zzso produce proteins that retain zzso zzso These results suggest that both the zzso and the zzso box of zzso function to inhibit zzso Analysis of a series of zzso spanning the entire zzso zzso region of zzso produced by conservative segment exchange zzso zzso showed little loss of function in zzso This suggests that the overall structure of the zzso region of zzso rather than specific motifs or zzso is required for its zzso
