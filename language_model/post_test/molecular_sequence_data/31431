zzso zzso zzso are known to be distributed throughout the animal kingdom, but have recently been discovered in some zzso and bacterial zzso Within animal species, these zzso play a critical role in energy zzso by catalyzing the zzso transfer of a zzso zzso group from zzso to an zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso In this work, a putative zzso gene was identified in the zzso zzso zzso that was predicted, based on sequence zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and shown to catalyze zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso but lacked any zzso zzso activity with the more ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso or zzso Additionally, the zzso was observed to be zzso but lacked zzso between the zzso in forming a transition state analog zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may exhibit more diversity in zzso specificity than was previously zzso
