zzso the spreading and the thinning of the zzso to cover the zzso cell and close the zzso in fish zzso is central to the process of zzso Despite its fundamental importance, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control this coordinated cell zzso By a combination of zzso studies and rescue experiments in zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso relies on the molecular networking of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which act as zzso for zzso molecules and growth zzso Furthermore, we show that the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and with the small zzso zzso factor 6 zzso which regulate the zzso recycling of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso Analysis of the earliest cellular defects suggests a role for zzso in the autonomous vegetal expansion of the zzso zzso layer and the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not in embryonic cell fate zzso This study identifies the importance of the zzso complex for the progression of fish zzso and establishes its key role in directional cell movements during early zzso
