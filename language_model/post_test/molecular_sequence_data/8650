The zzso growth factors zzso and zzso participate in the control of cell proliferation in normal and zzso lung zzso To examine the role of zzso binding proteins zzso in modulating zzso actions in zzso we examined the production and regulation of zzso from zzso cells, a human zzso lung cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso media zzso from zzso cells demonstrated zzso bands of relative molecular mass zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso 30,000 zzso and 24,000 zzso zzso abundance in zzso cell CM increased following exposure to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso without a change in zzso transcript zzso suggesting zzso is zzso zzso zzso almost completely zzso the zzso increase in CM zzso suggesting that ongoing protein synthesis is necessary for the zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso in zzso occurred by at least two mechanisms, through zzso of the type 1 zzso zzso and by a type 1 zzso zzso independent zzso The increase in zzso was due, in part, to zzso of the type 1 zzso zzso because blocking type 1 zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso increase in zzso and insulin, at doses that stimulate the type 1 zzso zzso increased zzso zzso The increase in zzso was partially independent of type 1 zzso zzso zzso because zzso an analog of zzso that binds the type 1 zzso zzso but not zzso was less potent than zzso in stimulating zzso zzso and zzso which binds zzso zzso but binds the type 1 zzso zzso with lower affinity than zzso was nearly zzso to zzso in its stimulation of zzso zzso at low zzso These results suggest that zzso binding decreases zzso clearance or increases zzso zzso in zzso zzso decreased zzso abundance in zzso cell CM without decreasing zzso zzso transcripts and without increasing the amount of zzso zzso To determine whether the decrease in zzso was due to increased degradation, zzso CM was incubated with and without zzso and zzso abundance measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
