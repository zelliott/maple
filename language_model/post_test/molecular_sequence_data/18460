Several strains of zzso zzso had strong activities of zzso zzso zzso and were markedly tolerant in the presence of oxygen in 13 strains of zzso zzso species zzso Thus, the strains were maintained and incubated in the either zzso or zzso zzso It was found that the zzso activity was significantly induced by zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso from the extracts of zzso zzso zzso cells, each was zzso by zzso zzso followed by zzso exchange zzso and then by gel zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso having molecular weight of about 46,000 consisted of two zzso of equal zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso had the characteristic zzso of zzso but zzso exhibited zzso of zzso Both samples contained three zzso with identical zzso points of zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of zzso of zzso by zzso it was shown that zzso consisted of one zzso and a small quantity of two zzso whereas zzso contained only zzso To ascertain whether or not the zzso of zzso is the same as that of zzso each zzso was prepared by dialysis in zzso zzso plus zzso Only one protein band with the same zzso point of zzso on an zzso focusing gel was obtained in each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso significantly restored their zzso These zzso zzso showed only one protein band with zzso activity on zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined by automated zzso degradation of the zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence consisted of 191 zzso corresponding to a molecular weight of zzso per zzso Furthermore, the first 36 zzso acid sequence of zzso was determined following zzso zzso The two zzso had similar zzso acid compositions, and their zzso sequences were identical through the first 36 zzso acids in which zzso zzso was present at zzso These results suggest the three zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso may be formed from the same zzso
