Numerous zzso and proteins form zzso deposits in zzso or in zzso The mechanism of zzso formation is not zzso particularly in the case where zzso zzso assemble to form zzso zzso interactions are known to be important in zzso zzso and the possibility that they might play a key role in zzso formation has been zzso The results of zzso experiments on short zzso derived from zzso have suggested that aromatic interactions could be particularly important for this zzso Here, we examine a set of zzso zzso in which the single aromatic zzso has been zzso with a zzso and zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso zzso with a zzso to zzso zzso a free N zzso and zzso C zzso readily forms zzso zzso peptides derived from the putative minimal zzso segment of zzso zzso zzso also form zzso when zzso is replaced by zzso zzso formation is more facile when the N zzso is zzso and the zzso is zzso zzso of the zzso with Ala results in a zzso that is noticeably less prone to form zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of human zzso with blocked zzso and the sole aromatic zzso zzso zzso by zzso readily forms zzso A zzso to Ala substitution reduces significantly the ability to form zzso These results indicate that an aromatic zzso is not required for zzso formation in these systems and indicates that other factors such as size, zzso zzso and zzso of the side chain in question are also zzso
