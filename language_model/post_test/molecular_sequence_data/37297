We have isolated zzso responsible for a zzso zzso in zzso zzso using the gene coding for a zzso zzso zzso as a marker for zzso These zzso defined two groups, dominant and zzso The zzso zzso strain, which zzso the zzso protein in zzso excess compared to the zzso strain, was used for the cloning of zzso restraining the zzso zzso In screening for genes affecting zzso zzso we found that multiple copies of 10 different independently isolated DNA sequences suppressed the zzso zzso The first among the genes zzso named zzso zzso zzso showed zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso containing a putative zzso domain and zzso domain, characteristic for the zzso zzso We demonstrated that the disruption of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso strain, likewise zzso zzso No other zzso features for strains lacking the zzso gene were noticed except for the zzso zzso zzso growth being notably slower than in a zzso zzso No growth changes were observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The set of genes zzso of zzso zzso could be attractive for further analysis of gene functions, zzso mechanisms and construction of new zzso This collection could be useful for the zzso construction of reduced zzso zzso zzso for zzso protein zzso
