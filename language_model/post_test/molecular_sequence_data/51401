The expression of zzso in zzso coli from a synthetic gene results in the production of multiple species of zzso These include not only biologically active zzso but also a variety of inactive species, which include inactive zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso Identification of these species and their separation from the biologically active zzso toxin is necessary for the use of the toxin in zzso and zzso zzso This has been accomplished by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso which results in a homogeneous toxin zzso The active material produced is sufficient for many types of biological studies and for zzso experiments directed at determining the structure function relationships of toxin interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso produced in this manner has the distinct advantage over zzso zzso of not being contaminated with other zzso components which could potentially affect experimental zzso
