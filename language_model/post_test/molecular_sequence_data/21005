In the ten years since the first zzso type III zzso domain library was published, zzso has continued to show promise as a scaffold for the generation of stable protein zzso that bind to targets with high zzso A variety of display systems, library designs and affinity maturation strategies have been used to generate zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso The first crystal structures of engineered zzso molecules in complex with their targets have been zzso and structural studies of engineered zzso have begun to reveal zzso of stability and to define zones that accept zzso with minimal zzso between affinity and zzso zzso the first engineered zzso to enter clinical development, is now entering Phase II trials for zzso zzso
