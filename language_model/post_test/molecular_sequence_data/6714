zzso of DNA from old skeletal material is of great importance in the identification of human remains, but is particularly difficult because the methods currently zzso especially those using zzso are not always zzso A simple technique based on the removal of zzso acid material by zzso out zzso with saturated sodium zzso is zzso the presence of DNA in the extract being confirmed by amplification of selected sequences of the zzso gene using the zzso chain reaction zzso The method was applied to fresh bone (five zzso heads and six zzso zzso and to bone from two forensic cases, 3 and 9 months post-mortem, zzso Parallel zzso using the zzso technique were performed on all samples in order to compare the efficiency of the two zzso Using sodium zzso zzso zzso DNA was consistently extracted from fresh bone, as well as from the two forensic zzso With the zzso method, amplification was successful in only 7 out of 11 instances with the fresh bone samples and failed in both forensic zzso The studies also showed that an effective way of removing zzso zzso is to subject the extract to zzso gel zzso isolate the high molecular weight area and zzso the DNA from the gel by zzso It was concluded that the sodium zzso method is a valid alternative to established techniques for zzso DNA from bone and that it offers the advantages of being simple, zzso inexpensive and avoids using hazardous zzso
