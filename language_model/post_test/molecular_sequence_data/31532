zzso are the largest zzso of genetic zzso Here we describe the novel zzso zzso This natural isolate from marine zzso zzso possesses very few gene contents relevant to other well-studied marine zzso zzso To better understand its evolutionary history, we built a mathematical model of zzso relationships among zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso are linked by edges representing the zzso number of shared zzso protein zzso This weighted network revealed that zzso was connected to only five members of the zzso zzso zzso family in an isolated network, strongly indicating that it belongs to this zzso zzso However, comparative zzso analyses highlighted an almost complete loss of zzso with the zzso zzso and little conservation of gene order, probably reflecting the action of distinct evolutionary forces on the zzso of zzso In this zzso typical zzso core zzso including six zzso zzso zzso were frequently displaced and the zzso regions were rich in both unique genes and predicted zzso promoters with highly correlated zzso Further, analysis of the zzso zzso showed that segments of the zzso zzso parts of zzso tail fiber zzso exhibited evidence of zzso assortment, having switched zzso orientation, and there was recruitment and/or structural changes among zzso zzso and tail spike zzso Thus, this naturally occurring zzso appears to have zzso from a common zzso of the zzso groups, showing a distinct zzso architecture and unique genes that most likely reflect adaptation to its chosen host and zzso
