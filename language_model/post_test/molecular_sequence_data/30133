zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso binding protein that is zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso by protein zzso C has been shown to abolish the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Meier, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and we have proposed that the concentration of free zzso in zzso may be regulated by zzso and zzso of zzso The purpose of this study was to identify the protein zzso C zzso zzso in zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso Toward this end, it was demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and bovine zzso were zzso with similar zzso values and zzso and that protein zzso C zzso zzso of both proteins abolished binding to zzso zzso zzso was zzso by using protein zzso C and zzso and zzso with zzso and the resulting peptides were separated by zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso was generated from zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso was zzso The zzso in this zzso zzso to position 41 of the entire zzso which is adjacent to or contained within the zzso binding domain of zzso A synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso binding domain with a few zzso zzso including zzso was also zzso by protein zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is the protein zzso C zzso site of zzso and that zzso of this zzso acid zzso blocks binding of zzso to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
