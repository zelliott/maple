zzso zzso is a zzso zzso class II zzso zzso protein that acts as a zzso editor to mediate the exchange of peptides loaded onto zzso II during zzso zzso Although the ability of zzso to promote zzso exchange in zzso and in zzso is well established, the role of zzso in zzso selection is still zzso especially in human response to infectious zzso In this study, we addressed this question in the context of the human zzso T cell response to zzso zzso We measured the zzso intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for a large set of peptides derived from the major core protein zzso and other known zzso zzso bound to zzso and compared these properties to the presence and magnitude of zzso zzso T cell zzso We found that zzso zzso complex kinetic stability in the presence of zzso zzso T cell zzso from zzso peptides in zzso peptides and also in a set of predicted tight zzso from the entire zzso zzso Taken together, these analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is a strong and independent factor governing zzso zzso by favoring the presentation of peptides with greater kinetic stability in the presence of zzso
