zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso reduction of zzso in higher zzso zzso zzso zzso two distinct zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso prepared from the zzso of zzso white pine zzso zzso zzso and a nuclear gene zzso analogous to one of these zzso has been characterized from zzso pine zzso zzso The pine gene encodes an approximately 43 zzso precursor zzso consisting of a zzso acid mature protein and a zzso acid transit zzso The deduced primary structures for the pine proteins are highly zzso to those reported from zzso and zzso The coding portion of the pine zzso gene is interrupted by four zzso The placement of these zzso within the pine zzso gene is identical to that observed in pea zzso zzso suggesting conservation in gene organization between zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso detected in extracts of zzso pine zzso a single zzso zzso which declined in abundance during a 48 h period of zzso with white zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also found to accumulate high levels of zzso zzso zzso however, little or no change in the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in these zzso following zzso Stem tissue of zzso zzso did not contain significant levels of zzso zzso zzso whereas stems of zzso plants of the same age accumulated substantial amounts of the zzso These results suggest that light and the zzso age of the tissue affect regulation of zzso expression in zzso
