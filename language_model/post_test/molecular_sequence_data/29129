The present study compared the recently developed zzso sequence typing zzso approach with a well-established molecular typing technique, zzso gel zzso zzso for subspecies differentiation of zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso regions of three zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso a collagen and zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso a cell wall associated zzso and one zzso gene zzso of 22 zzso zzso zzso chosen largely for their zzso and geographical diversity, but also including some outbreak zzso zzso analysis of zzso regions of these four genes identified 13 distinct sequence types zzso with different zzso zzso the composite sequences generated from the four zzso gene fragments of individual zzso showed zzso to zzso identity among the 22 zzso We also found that the zzso profiles from two zzso ace and zzso were sufficient to distinguish all 13 zzso of this zzso The 13 zzso corresponded to 12 different zzso types, with one previously designated zzso clone (a widespread zzso clone of zzso zzso being classified into two highly related zzso which differed at 2 of zzso zzso both in the same zzso zzso also confirmed the zzso relationships among the zzso of two other zzso zzso groups, including zzso resistant zzso Thus, this pilot study with representative zzso zzso zzso suggests that, similar to zzso the zzso typing method may be useful for zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the subspecies level in addition to identifying outbreak zzso
