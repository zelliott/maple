The diagnosis of invasive zzso is difficult because there are no specific clinical manifestations of the disease and colonization and infection are difficult to zzso In the last decade, much effort has been made to develop reliable tests for rapid diagnosis of invasive zzso but none of them have found widespread clinical zzso 

zzso against a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso germ zzso zzso zzso wall protein 1 zzso generated in zzso coli were detected by both zzso and zzso tests in a group of 36 zzso or zzso Care Unit patients with invasive zzso and in a group of 45 control patients at high risk for the zzso who did not have clinical or zzso data to document invasive zzso zzso were compared with an zzso test to detect zzso to zzso zzso germ tubes zzso The sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso values of a diagnostic test based on the detection of zzso against the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso increased the sensitivity zzso zzso and the negative zzso value zzso zzso but slightly decreased the specificity zzso zzso and positive zzso values zzso zzso The zzso of zzso response to the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was very similar to that observed by detecting zzso to zzso 

An zzso test to detect zzso against a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso germ tube cell wall zzso zzso allows the diagnosis of invasive zzso with similar results to those obtained by detecting zzso to zzso but without the need of treating the zzso to zzso the zzso against the cell wall surface of the zzso
