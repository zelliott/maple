Fish zzso are commonly motivated to pursue their research driven by their own interests in these aquatic zzso However, the data obtained in fish studies not only satisfy their own interests but often contribute more generally to the studies of other zzso including zzso The life of zzso is characterized by the aquatic habitat, which demands many zzso adjustments distinct from the zzso zzso Among them, body fluid regulation is of particular importance as the body zzso are exposed to media of varying zzso only across the thin respiratory zzso of the zzso zzso systems play pivotal roles in the zzso control of body fluid zzso Judging from the zzso control mechanisms, some zzso hormones of fish should have undergone functional and molecular evolution during the ecological transition to the zzso zzso In fact, zzso hormones such as zzso are essential for survival on the land, whereas zzso hormones such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are diversified and exhibit more critical functions in aquatic zzso In this short review, we introduce some examples illustrating how comparative fish studies contribute to general zzso by taking advantage of such differences between zzso and zzso In a functional context, fish studies often afford a deeper understanding of the essential actions of a hormone across zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso family as an example, we suggest that more functional studies on zzso will bring similar rewards of zzso At the molecular level, recent establishment of zzso databases in zzso and zzso brings clues to the evolutionary history of hormone molecules via a comparative zzso zzso Because of the functional and molecular diversification of zzso hormones in fishes, this approach sometimes leads to the discovery of new hormones in zzso as exemplified by zzso zzso
