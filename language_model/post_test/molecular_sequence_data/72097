zzso was originally isolated as the gene affected by the zzso limb zzso zzso zzso which disrupt the zzso interactions regulating patterning of the zzso limb zzso More recently, a rapidly growing number of genes with similarity to zzso have been isolated from many different species including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis shows that zzso family members function in cellular processes regulating either zzso and/or cell zzso Another common feature among zzso family members is their requirement in zzso processes such as budding and zzso of zzso establishment of zzso zzso polarity and zzso limb pattern zzso zzso zzso are predominantly nuclear proteins which control zzso activity in limb buds through establishment of the zzso feedback zzso zzso acts in the limb bud zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso Finally, disruption of the zzso interactions controlling induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso might function more generally in zzso of zzso signals during embryonic pattern zzso
