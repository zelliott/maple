zzso is the most common toxic substance in the environment, ranking first on the Superfund list of hazardous zzso It is introduced primarily from zzso sources and is acted on biologically, creating an zzso zzso zzso environments are known for their elevated zzso content and thus provide an excellent setting in which to study microbial zzso transformations of zzso To date, most studies of microbial communities in geothermal environments have focused on zzso and zzso with little attention to zzso zzso Here, we show the potential of an zzso zzso zzso of the order zzso to influence zzso cycling at elevated zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso oxidized zzso zzso to zzso zzso reduced zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from this zzso and demonstrated to zzso resistance to zzso in an zzso hypersensitive strain of zzso zzso The 2 zzso zzso were zzso and shown to transform zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso gas, with a zzso of zzso degrees zzso These studies illustrate the importance of zzso zzso to the zzso cycling of zzso in geothermal systems, offer a molecular explanation for how these algae tolerate zzso in their environment, and provide the characterization of zzso zzso
