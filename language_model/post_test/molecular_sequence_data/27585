It is observed that a putative DNA binding domain in nuclear factor I zzso I) which is a zzso zzso DNA binding protein participating in both regulation of DNA replication and zzso displays sequence zzso with zzso zzso in various protein zzso In addition, zzso analysis reveals that the zzso I zzso chain is likely to fold into similar secondary and zzso structures to those of the protein zzso Although it is not known whether zzso I functions as a protein zzso in addition to recognizing a specific sequence on DNA, it is concluded that some of the zzso DNA binding proteins and protein zzso may belong to a gene family, various members of which are zzso related and responsible for the regulation of metabolism in diverse compartments of the zzso The present finding also suggests that a number of zzso may to varying zzso be capable of direct interaction with zzso
