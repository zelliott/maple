zzso zzso zzso originated in zzso while zzso zzso zzso evolved in East zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso have been isolated from bean zzso in Spain, suggesting the occurrence of zzso transfer events between introduced and native zzso In zzso zzso zzso transfer of the symbiotic zzso zzso requires zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at further understanding the generation of diversity among bean zzso zzso we analyzed the plasmids of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso transfer of the plasmids of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso was zzso and required for transfer of the symbiotic zzso We zzso zzso finding 166 zzso zzso showed three large segments of different evolutionary zzso the first one presented 38 zzso that were highly similar to genes located on the zzso of zzso strain zzso the second one zzso 51 zzso with highest similarity to genes from zzso including the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso was incompatible with the zzso zzso zzso symbiotic zzso but did not contribute to zzso The third segment contained 36 zzso with highest similarity to genes localized on zzso 20 of them involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso was unable to substitute zzso for induction of zzso transfer, and its own transfer was significantly diminished in zzso zzso The symbiotic zzso zzso was found to differ from typical zzso zzso symbiotic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso with segments from two zzso zzso plasmids and a zzso zzso zzso and a symbiotic zzso different from the one usually found in zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that these plasmids originated through the transfer of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso to a zzso zzso strain, and at least two zzso events among the zzso zzso plasmids and the zzso zzso zzso As in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso transfer of the symbiotic zzso In spite of the similarity in the zzso related zzso the transfer process of these plasmids shows a zzso zzso
