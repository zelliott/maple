Several families of putative zzso elements zzso in both zzso plants and zzso zzso have been identified by screening the DNA data base for zzso repeated zzso present in multiple copies in the zzso The elements are localized within zzso and zzso regions of many zzso These elements consist of two zzso repeats zzso sequences ranging from 5 zzso to zzso 500 zzso Identification of multiple elements in which sequence conservation includes both the zzso and internal regions implies that these zzso are capable of duplicative zzso Two of the elements were identified in promoter regions of the tomato zzso zzso zzso and potato zzso zzso zzso zzso The element in the zzso promoter spans a known regulatory zzso In both cases, ancestral DNA zzso which represent potential zzso target sequences prior to zzso of the zzso have been cloned from related zzso The sequences of the zzso repeated zzso in plants and zzso zzso show a high degree of zzso zzso While frequency of the different elements is zzso some are present in very high copy zzso A member of a single zzso zzso zzso family is observed approximately once every 20 zzso in the zzso The abundance of the described zzso suggests utility in the zzso analysis of these and related zzso
