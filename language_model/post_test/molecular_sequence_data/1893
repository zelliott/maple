zzso are both zzso and targets of zzso gene zzso zzso a natural defense mechanism in zzso Here we report molecular evidence of the ability of zzso DNA zzso viruses to induce zzso in infected plants irrespective of the severity of or recovery from the zzso Our results reveal that five distinct species of zzso zzso were capable of triggering zzso by producing two classes of zzso short interfering zzso zzso of 21 to 26 zzso in two plant zzso tobacco zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the efficacy of zzso zzso varied depending on the intrinsic features of the virus and its interaction with the plant zzso We found that symptom recovery over time in plants infected with the zzso of African zzso mosaic virus zzso or Sri zzso zzso mosaic virus was associated with a much higher level of zzso zzso zzso compared to plants infected with viruses that do not show symptom zzso Furthermore, we determined that the C zzso of zzso that zzso with the N zzso of zzso early viral genes involved in virus replication were the primary targets for zzso zzso whereas the C zzso of zzso was targeted for the East African zzso mosaic Cameroon zzso In addition, our results reveal the possibility for zzso zzso formation during zzso in zzso zzso which explains in part how these viruses can trigger zzso in zzso
