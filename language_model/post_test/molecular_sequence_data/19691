zzso modification is essential for development and early cell division in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso attachment sites is defined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we evaluate the zzso specificity of this zzso for its downstream targets by using reporter proteins containing zzso modification sites from zzso zzso zzso The N zzso of the zzso contains a zzso zzso site at zzso flanked by potential zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso was exclusively used as a zzso site in zzso based on mapping studies with a zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso To zzso the zzso requirements of this zzso a library of 42 point zzso of the zzso reporter was expressed in tissue zzso The zzso zzso modification site in zzso required zzso (not zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and either one zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso or a pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although present in many zzso modification sites, had minimal impact on zzso at zzso zzso inhibited zzso when present at zzso zzso or zzso The position of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids allows the zzso machinery to discriminate between zzso and zzso modification zzso The key zzso that define zzso modification sites also function with the zzso zzso zzso indicating that the specificity in the zzso process is zzso zzso Using a neural network method, a preliminary zzso predictor has been zzso
