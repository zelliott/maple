zzso zzso lethal zzso zzso syndrome zzso is a severe form of zzso zzso We previously showed that this zzso is caused in two unrelated zzso zzso tribes by different defects in the zzso zzso However, the molecular basis of the same zzso in other tribes remained zzso Whole zzso sequencing identified a novel zzso founder zzso within a minimal shared zzso locus of approximately 1 zzso in two affected individuals of different zzso a zzso premature stop producing zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein C, slow zzso A dominant zzso zzso in zzso was previously shown to cause mild zzso zzso We now show that a zzso zzso zzso all functional zzso in the same gene leads to zzso
