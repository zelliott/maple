More than zzso of alternatively spliced internal zzso in the human zzso are derived from zzso elements in a process termed zzso zzso are comprised of two zzso arms separated by an internal zzso tract zzso In most zzso zzso sites are selected from within the same zzso We hypothesized that the internal zzso may prevent selection of a zzso site further zzso Here, we demonstrate that this zzso enhanced the selection of an upstream zzso zzso site zzso even in the presence of a stronger zzso zzso zzso of this zzso shifted selection to the stronger downstream zzso This enhancing effect depended on the strength of the downstream zzso on the efficiency of zzso to zzso zzso and on the length of the zzso This effect of the zzso was zzso by the binding of zzso proteins and was dependent on the distance between the zzso and the upstream zzso A zzso evolutionary analysis of zzso across 22 zzso revealed an enrichment in zzso within approximately 20 zzso downstream of the zzso For most zzso the strength of the zzso zzso correlated with the presence of a downstream zzso indicative of the functional role of the zzso Finally, we found that the proteins that mediate this effect, zzso and zzso and in particular their functional zzso are highly zzso across zzso Overall, these findings expand our understanding of the role of zzso proteins in enhancing recognition of zzso in general, and zzso zzso in zzso
