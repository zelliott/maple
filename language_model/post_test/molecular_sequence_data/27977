The locations of crossover junctions and gene conversion zzso isolated in the rosy gene of zzso zzso were determined using DNA sequencing and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso DNA sequence zzso between the parental genes served as zzso genetic zzso All conversion tracts were zzso and half of the zzso crossover events had conversion tracts at the crossover zzso These experiments have also identified the sequence zzso responsible for altered gene expression in two naturally occurring rosy zzso
