A zzso hormone, zzso zzso shows various effects on cellular metabolism in zzso such as stimulation of zzso tissue growth and zzso of zzso zzso All these effects are zzso by its cell surface zzso However, lack of information on zzso zzso zzso gene expression has made the zzso importance of the zzso system obscure in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso its structure was zzso and specific binding of zzso to zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells was zzso In adult zzso high level expression was found in the zzso heart, brain, zzso and skin, and low level in the zzso kidney and spinal zzso The zzso expression pattern showed that zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was expressed in the brain and tail from zzso and the level increased toward late zzso suggesting that zzso may inhibit the zzso changes in those zzso The level of brain zzso zzso reached a peak just at the start of the zzso climax stages and then zzso whereas in the tail, zzso expression peaked at late zzso In the zzso zzso expression increased and reached a maximum level at the end of zzso The results obtained were discussed in relation to zzso
