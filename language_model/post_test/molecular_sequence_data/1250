zzso in genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso cause zzso dominant zzso kidney zzso The zzso protein family is composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso integral membrane zzso Here we describe a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso which has various alternative zzso forms with two translation initiation zzso zzso short form starts in zzso 12 of the long zzso The longest open reading frame of zzso short form, determined from human zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein and 32 zzso whereas the long form is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso Both forms have a small zzso for egg jelly domain, a zzso zzso zzso site, an zzso and 11 putative zzso zzso as well as a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the short form, but not the long form, of human zzso is expressed in the developing and adult heart and zzso Furthermore, by zzso pull-down zzso we observed that zzso and zzso are able to bind to specific zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso zzso domain binds to zzso zzso and zzso while it zzso interacts with zzso Our results indicate that both zzso molecules may act as zzso zzso
