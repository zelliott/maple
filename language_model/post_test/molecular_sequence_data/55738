The zzso of vascular disease is zzso but genetic factors play an important zzso In this study we performed linkage analyses in two families with zzso zzso zzso an inherited vascular disorder that causes narrowing of major arteries and may lead to cardiac overload and zzso DNA markers on the long arm of zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were linked to zzso zzso zzso in both families with a combined zzso of likelihood for linkage zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso These findings indicate that a gene for zzso zzso zzso is located in the same zzso zzso as zzso which becomes a candidate for the disease zzso
