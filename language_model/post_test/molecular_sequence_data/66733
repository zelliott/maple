We identified zebra fish zzso zzso factor zzso zzso as a gene strongly expressed in neural zzso such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso at the early embryonic zzso Loss of the function of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso resulted in defects in zzso and eye development, and in that of formation of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression of zzso in the zzso and elevated zzso expression in the zzso stalk were observed in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso was suppressed in the zzso and zzso regions, supporting the idea of zzso of the zzso signaling zzso by suppression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso resulted in a zzso similar to that induced by zzso suggesting that zzso may act as a zzso zzso of zzso in zebra fish zzso Supporting this notion, zzso suppressed isolated zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso cells, and the minimal region of zzso required for its zzso zzso activity showed strong zzso with the zzso binding zzso which is found in genes zzso various zzso zzso In view of all of our data taken together, we propose zzso to be a novel regulator of neural development that acts by suppressing zzso zzso
