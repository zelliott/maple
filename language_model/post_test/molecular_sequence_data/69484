The aim of the present study was to zzso in a population of 70 zzso infected patients with zzso to zzso the percentages of individuals with an active replication of zzso zzso or zzso During a one year follow-up of these patients at different stages of disease, blood samples were regularly collected for determination of zzso beta 2 zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso were extracted from the zzso zzso with zzso reverse zzso and zzso zzso zzso were carried out separately with sets of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso region of zzso and in zzso zzso The amplified products were subjected to zzso and observed under zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso For some samples, the identity of the amplified products was confirmed by Southern zzso by zzso with zzso zzso A total of 57% of the patients were found to produce zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso produced zzso zzso zzso production was correlated with beta 2 zzso and zzso zzso active replication of zzso was correlated with zzso but not with zzso levels nor with zzso zzso zzso
