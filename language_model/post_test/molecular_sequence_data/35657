To explore the mechanisms regulating expression of zzso zzso light chain 1, the human gene including zzso DNA was cloned and characterized by Southern zzso and restriction zzso A 2 zzso zzso DNA was zzso and linked to a zzso zzso reporter zzso The zzso then were zzso into cultured human and rat zzso as well as rat zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that the zzso promoter zzso which were located within 62 base pairs of the cap site, could direct high levels of zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso and zzso zzso The region between zzso to zzso base pairs strongly zzso the zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso and zzso zzso Positive elements were found between zzso and zzso base pairs of the cap zzso These results are zzso among other possibilities, that the human zzso zzso light chain 1 gene is turned on in zzso by the presence of zzso factors that are bound to upstream positive elements and is turned off in zzso cells by the presence of zzso zzso But this mechanism remains to be zzso
