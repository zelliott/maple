zzso zzso II zzso is an inhibitor of zzso in plasma that is activated by zzso zzso or zzso An apparently full-length zzso for zzso was isolated from a human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso consisted of zzso base pairs zzso including an zzso frame of zzso zzso a stop zzso a zzso region of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contained a signal zzso of 19 zzso acid zzso and a mature protein of zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso demonstrated zzso with zzso III and other members of the alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso of an zzso probe to DNA isolated from sorted human zzso indicated that the zzso gene is located on zzso zzso Twenty human zzso DNA samples were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and Southern blots of the zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso A restriction zzso length zzso was identified with zzso A slightly truncated form of the zzso coding for zzso instead of the zzso 18 zzso acids of mature zzso was cloned into the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein of apparent molecular weight zzso was identified on an zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso formed a complex with zzso in a reaction that required the presence of zzso or zzso zzso
