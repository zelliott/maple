A clone containing the open reading frame of zzso an zzso involved in early zzso zzso processing, has been isolated from a rat liver zzso zzso zzso This was accomplished by a strategy that involved zzso of the zzso from rat liver zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by sequence zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso based on these zzso the zzso chain reaction with rat liver zzso as a template yielded a zzso pair product suitable for library screening as well as Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso DNA released a zzso zzso that was amplified in zzso II zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the deduced open reading frame of the zzso extended from zzso 89 to zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids and corresponding to a molecular mass of 52 zzso Data base searches revealed no zzso with any other known zzso When a zzso coding for this protein fused to an zzso zzso containing a zzso region was introduced into zzso coli, high levels of the zzso were expressed upon induction with zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso was accomplished by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against this protein reacted with zzso zzso By both zzso and silver zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately 8 zzso smaller than anticipated from the open reading zzso timed induction studies indicated that this was due to zzso of the zzso zzso end by host cell zzso All rat zzso examined demonstrated zzso levels zzso zzso for the zzso that correlated well with their zzso zzso
