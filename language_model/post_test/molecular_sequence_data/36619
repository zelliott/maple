Two zzso zzso I and II, have been characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso They contain 10 zzso zzso of a total of zzso zzso have zzso zzso identity, and exhibit similarities to zzso zzso zzso and segments of adhesive zzso zzso I contains the sequence zzso known to inhibit zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso II has Met instead of zzso in this zzso and an adjacent zzso zzso The latter is also typical of adhesive zzso thus linking two potentially functional segments in one zzso zzso are zzso in these zzso suggesting that the zzso exhibit functional divergence with zzso differences in important zzso
