The zzso of the blood zzso into the untranslated region of zzso 7 of the zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso alters the pattern of expression of the three normal zzso to zzso The process of transcript zzso formation inside the zzso zzso reduces the level of the zzso transcript that contains zzso 8 and increases the level of the transcript that contains zzso zzso The induced zzso zzso is a translation product of the three transcripts that contain fragments of the blood zzso The mechanism of zzso by the blood zzso is zzso to involve the pause or termination of zzso within the blood zzso which in turn is caused by the interference of a zzso protein with the zzso zzso Thus, we show the formation of a new functional zzso protein by the zzso of a zzso element and discuss the evolutionary significance of this zzso
