We studied a zzso family with an inherited syndrome of prominent zzso nerves and zzso of the tongue resembling zzso without the characteristic zzso of the multiple zzso zzso type zzso zzso Several different point zzso in the zzso zzso on zzso 10 have been associated with the multiple zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso genetic studies of families with partial zzso expression of these syndromes may aid in further understanding the origin of the variety of clinical manifestations observed in multiple zzso zzso type zzso 

A family consisting of an 8-year-old male zzso his 10-year-old sister, and 40-year-old mother was identified as having prominent zzso nerves and zzso of the tongue resembling zzso zzso serum zzso levels were measured in the mother and zzso zzso genetic studies were performed on all three affected members, to look for the specific point zzso seen in over zzso of patients with multiple zzso zzso type zzso 

zzso zzso levels were normal, indicating no zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic studies on these individuals did not disclose the specific point zzso seen in multiple zzso zzso type zzso 

This family demonstrates some of the zzso features of the multiple zzso zzso type zzso syndrome without the characteristic zzso or the zzso in the zzso zzso associated with multiple zzso zzso type zzso Their physical findings may be caused by genetic zzso within the zzso zzso on zzso 10 at yet zzso zzso
