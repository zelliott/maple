zzso sequence typing zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was developed for zzso and its zzso ability was compared to those of zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso differentiated several strains zzso by zzso and 78 distinct zzso types were identified among 231 zzso zzso grouped into 22 zzso and 12 strains of zzso zzso The strains of several zzso types were further differentiated by zzso which suggests that the zzso ability of zzso for the typing of zzso is better than that of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso sequence typing identified two distinct genetic clusters containing 32 of 54 zzso clinical zzso whose zzso gene sequences were zzso The zzso contents and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso indicated that the genes differ in their evolutionary origins and that zzso played a significant role in their zzso
