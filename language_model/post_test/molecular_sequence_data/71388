zzso differentiation in zzso zzso is a zzso process, which is controlled by the sequential action of the two zzso signals, nitrogen zzso and blue zzso The zzso genes zzso and zzso are expressed in the late phase of zzso Their zzso expression is restricted to cells that have completed the first, nitrogen zzso phase of zzso A comparison of the two genes revealed striking similarities as well as zzso Their most prominent shared feature is an extended sequence zzso of over zzso in their zzso regions, suggesting a role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso both zzso zzso proteins zzso of very similar sizes that exhibit typical features of zzso cell wall zzso zzso shows a high degree of zzso with the zzso zzso gene family, suggesting a relationship between these zzso
