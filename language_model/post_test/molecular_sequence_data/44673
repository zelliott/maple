The gene zzso the high potential zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso strain D zzso zzso was cloned from an zzso digest of zzso zzso A zzso sequence of zzso zzso length was determined which contained the coding region and putative promoter and termination zzso The gene codes for a 122 zzso zzso Da zzso The zzso 85 zzso are those of the previously zzso determined zzso whereas the zzso 37 zzso constitute a leader zzso which shows characteristics of the double zzso signal sequences of complex zzso containing zzso zzso
