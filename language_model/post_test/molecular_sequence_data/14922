A zzso positive, zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from soil from west coast of the Korean peninsula, and its zzso position was investigated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at around zzso at zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso fell into a zzso zzso the type strains of zzso species, with which it exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso zzso zzso contained a cell wall zzso based on zzso acid and zzso as the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and two unidentified zzso a minor amount of zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso could be differentiated from zzso related zzso species by differences in zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
