zzso relationships of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from Southeast Asia were zzso from DNA sequences of one nuclear zzso and two zzso zzso zzso regions of 48 zzso (21 zzso 25 other zzso 2 zzso zzso of the combined zzso with zzso maximum likelihood and zzso methods revealed that zzso is zzso and consists of three zzso zzso which are only partly in accordance with previous zzso zzso based on floral zzso The two different flower types in zzso zzso versus open spur zzso seem to have evolved at least twice in geographically distinct zzso The zzso presented here is yet another example in zzso where floral zzso cannot be relied on to reconstruct zzso history but rather is the result of zzso zzso The zzso zzso are characterized by three different length classes of the zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first time that the zzso region was studied in zzso The zzso gene has been assumed to be a zzso in zzso due to occasional occurrence of zzso zzso low zzso zzso ratios and low substitution rates at the 3rd zzso zzso However, zzso does not appear to be a zzso in zzso and a comparison with data from other zzso suggests that zzso ratios and low substitution rates have been overestimated as arguments for a zzso status of zzso in zzso
