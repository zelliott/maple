zzso of zzso DNA containing zzso or zzso zzso or containing two tandem zzso bases occurred in zzso with zzso egg extracts as detected by a physical zzso The repair was accompanied by a zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso separated from zzso zzso showed a zzso to zzso increase in DNA synthesis in the region of the mismatch compared to regions distant from the zzso The remaining zzso zzso DNA included molecules that also displayed zzso DNA synthesis in the zzso zzso These may represent zzso in the repair zzso The patterns of DNA synthesis suggest that repair begins at some distance from the mismatch and that as much as 1 zzso or more can be involved in the zzso zzso
