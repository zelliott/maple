zzso similarities among zzso animals displaying zzso characters zzso reduced eyes and lack of zzso have induced a long-term discussion about the forces driving zzso zzso Here we introduce zzso zzso zzso & zzso 1956, as an interesting system to study the evolution of zzso zzso The only zzso known zzso population of this species lives in Al zzso Cave zzso of zzso close to a surface zzso As a first approach, we assessed the genetic differentiation between the two zzso of zzso zzso to determine whether gene flow still zzso 

We zzso the zzso control region zzso In zzso zzso the zzso starts immediately downstream of the zzso zzso while the zzso gene is missing at this zzso zzso Interestingly, a putative zzso sequence is found within the zzso The zzso analyses of the zzso sequences yielded a tree divided into three zzso zzso 1 has a high genetic distance to the other zzso and contains the individuals of three populations which are separated by a watershed from all the zzso zzso 2 comprises the individuals from zzso zzso zzso the geographically most remote zzso zzso 3 comprises all other populations investigated including that of Al zzso zzso The latter forms a zzso which also includes individuals from the adjacent surface zzso 

Our data indicates that the zzso cave population is of quite recent origin supporting the hypothesis that selection drives the fast evolution of zzso zzso In this context zzso effects might play an important role as it has been shown for zzso There seems to be some gene flow from the cave population into the adjacent surface zzso One blind individual, found at a surface locality geographically distinct from Al zzso Cave, is genetically differentiated from the other blind specimens indicating the probable existence of another cave population of zzso zzso The zzso analyses show that while some of the surface populations are either still in contact or have been until recently, the population zzso zzso Khalid is genetically zzso One group consisting of three populations is genetically highly differentiated questioning the zzso with zzso zzso
