There is an ongoing discussion on whether zzso in different zzso has a common origin sharing a common genetic zzso However, before comparing zzso between zzso it is necessary to identify the ancestral condition within each zzso Even within the zzso it is not clear which parts of the genetic network leading to zzso are zzso in all zzso In this paper, we analyze the expression of three zzso genes of the zzso class in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are representatives of the zzso a zzso basic zzso zzso We find that in zzso zzso the zzso for the zzso primary zzso genes hairy, zzso and zzso are expressed in stripes in the growth zone, where the segments are zzso suggesting a role for these genes in zzso zzso These data imply that the involvement of hairy, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is an ancestral character for zzso and is not restricted to a particular group of zzso
