Merkel cell zzso zzso is a recently discovered human zzso causing the majority of human Merkel cell zzso We mapped a zzso minimal zzso replication core origin sufficient for initiating zzso DNA replication in the presence of zzso zzso large T protein zzso The origin includes a zzso tract and eight zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso that serve as zzso recognition zzso zzso analysis shows that only four of the eight zzso are required for origin zzso A single point zzso in one origin zzso from a naturally zzso zzso virus reduces zzso assembly on the origin and eliminates viral DNA zzso zzso zzso having zzso zzso either the zzso domain or the zzso domain also prevent zzso zzso zzso zzso replication requires zzso of zzso small T protein zzso together with zzso An intact zzso domain on the zzso is required for replication but is zzso on the zzso In contrast, zzso targeting by zzso is required for enhanced zzso The zzso origin provides a novel model for zzso replication from a defined DNA element and illustrates the selective pressure within tumors to abrogate independent zzso zzso
