We recently reported the zzso cloning of a zzso gene involved in the zzso of zzso syndrome, zzso , and its mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso (also independently described as zzso is highly zzso to the zzso gene product, suggesting that there may be additional members of this novel zzso zzso The zzso genes play an important role in eye, zzso zzso and zzso region development as evidenced by zzso syndrome and iris zzso zzso resulting from zzso in the zzso gene and by expression zzso In order to characterize further the zzso gene family we searched mouse zzso libraries to identify additional zzso A new gene was isolated which encodes a zzso with strong zzso to the other zzso proteins and zzso identity in the zzso itself, suggesting that this is a third member of the family, zzso zzso In whole mount in zzso zzso on mouse zzso ranging from zzso to zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen only in the developing lens starting at day zzso zzso on zzso revealed strong signals in the lens zzso in 11 zzso zzso and throughout the zzso particularly in the anterior zzso and zzso region in 15 zzso zzso zzso was mapped close to zzso on mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso mouse is characterized by small eyes lacking a zzso which fail to develop beyond 11 zzso These data make zzso a strong candidate gene for the zzso zzso in the mouse and suggest a role for the human zzso in zzso lens zzso
