An zzso zzso zzso was converted to a corresponding zzso through in zzso zzso The zzso was prepared as a DNA zzso of the same zzso and had no zzso zzso A population of zzso zzso of this DNA was constructed and evolved to perform zzso zzso at a rate similar to that of the starting zzso When the zzso was prepared as an zzso zzso of the same zzso it had no zzso zzso Thus, the evolutionary transition from an zzso to a DNA zzso represents a switch, rather than a zzso of the chemical basis for zzso zzso This transfer of both information and function is relevant to the transition between two different genetic systems based on zzso zzso zzso as zzso to have occurred during the early history of life on zzso
