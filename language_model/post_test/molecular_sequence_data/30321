We have isolated a gene coding for a G protein alpha zzso from the flowering plant zzso zzso This zzso named zzso was isolated by using a DNA probe generated by zzso chain reaction based on protein sequences from zzso and zzso G protein alpha zzso The sequences of zzso and zzso clones indicate that zzso has 14 zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence shows that the zzso gene product zzso alpha 1) has zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso The zzso alpha 1 protein exhibits similarity to all known G protein alpha zzso of its zzso acids are identical and zzso are similar zzso and conservative zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor alpha zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso alpha 1 protein has all of the consensus regions for a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is most abundant in zzso plant zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso mapping experiments show that zzso is approximately zzso zzso from the visible marker zzso on zzso zzso
