The genetic diversity of zzso zzso from natural populations zzso Bermuda in the zzso Sea and off North Australia in the zzso and Coral zzso and of culture zzso from two regions zzso Sea and Indian zzso was zzso Three independent techniques were used, including a DNA zzso method based on a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of a zzso fragment, and sequencing of the internal transcribed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Low genetic diversity was observed in natural populations of zzso zzso from the two zzso Culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed remarkable similarity when these techniques were used, suggesting that zzso zzso is very closely related to the zzso zzso The largest genetic variation was found between zzso zzso and all other species of zzso including a species of zzso Our data obtained with all three techniques suggest that there are two major zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and ITS sequence analyses allowed the closely related species to be zzso This is the first report of the presence of zzso in marine zzso
