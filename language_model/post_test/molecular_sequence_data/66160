zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are primary events in vascular zzso and zzso An zzso delivery system that can carry zzso selectively to the sites of active zzso zzso has immense potential in minimally invasive targeted therapy of vascular zzso To this end we are studying zzso zzso by zzso zzso motifs that can selectively target and bind zzso zzso on activated zzso Here we report zzso zzso with a zzso constrained high affinity zzso zzso motif to zzso the zzso capability of the zzso Such affinity enhancement is important for practical in zzso applications to compete with native zzso towards binding zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was studied by zzso and scanning electron zzso and flow zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also tested in zzso in a rat carotid injury model and analyzed ex zzso by zzso zzso The results from all experiments show that zzso zzso bind activated zzso significantly higher compared to linear zzso zzso the results establish the feasibility of modulating the zzso and binding ability of zzso targeted zzso by manipulating the affinity of zzso zzso
