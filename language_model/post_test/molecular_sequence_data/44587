Several zzso species have a long variable arm composed of over ten zzso which are relevant to those specific to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso while there are only zzso and zzso zzso in zzso To clarify the evolutionary aspects of the identity determination mechanism of these zzso the zzso recognition in zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso transcript had zzso ability of low efficiency, but native zzso did not, indicating that some modification of zzso serves as a negative identity zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso base did not seriously affect the zzso accepting zzso The zzso transcript possessing the variable arm of zzso was efficiently zzso with zzso Eventually, it was found that only one zzso zzso to the variable arm of zzso was sufficient to zzso an efficient zzso accepting zzso The mode of zzso zzso recognition is similar to that in zzso coli in that the end of the long variable arm, but not the zzso or zzso base, is zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso adopts a substantially different mechanism for rejection of zzso from that of its zzso coli zzso
