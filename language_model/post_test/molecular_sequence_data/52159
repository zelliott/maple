zzso originally isolated as an essential component for the zzso of the type IV zzso of zzso zzso is a unique zzso responsible for processing the precursors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also required for the zzso of the leader peptides from the zzso zzso which are essential components of an zzso zzso zzso specific for the export of a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso are initially zzso with short, zzso 6- to zzso leader peptides with a net basic charge and share a high degree of zzso acid zzso through the first 16 to 30 zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, they all have a zzso zzso at the zzso site relative to the zzso site, which is N zzso prior to assembly into the zzso zzso In this study, the zzso of leader zzso zzso from the precursor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was determined in zzso The rates of zzso were compared for zzso zzso and zzso as well as for zzso and zzso contained within total zzso extracted from zzso zzso strains zzso the cloned zzso or zzso zzso zzso conditions were obtained only when both zzso and zzso were contained within total zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso followed normal zzso zzso with a measured apparent zzso of approximately 650 zzso and a zzso of 180 zzso The zzso of zzso processing of another type IV zzso zzso that from zzso zzso with a zzso leader zzso were essentially the same as that measured for zzso zzso zzso zzso Quite different results were obtained for a number of zzso zzso containing zzso at the zzso zzso at the zzso position relative to the zzso site, which were previously shown to be well tolerated in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso show that zzso values remain close to that measured for zzso zzso while zzso and zzso values were significantly zzso This indicates that while the affinity of zzso for zzso is relatively unaffected by the zzso the maximum rate of zzso favors a zzso at this zzso zzso zzso zzso of one zzso zzso zzso resulted in a lower zzso value of zzso zzso which indicates a higher affinity for the zzso as well as a lower zzso value of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that it may be feasible to design zzso zzso of zzso
