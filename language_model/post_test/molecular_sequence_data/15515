zzso X zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor, regulating gene expression of zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso Here, we report that protein zzso zzso 1 zzso is required for the zzso activity of zzso zzso regulates expression of numerous zzso including nuclear zzso transcription, through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is a major zzso zzso associated with zzso The zzso zzso domain is responsible for zzso interaction as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was recruited to the regulatory region of the zzso target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso 3 of zzso zzso in response to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, small interfering zzso zzso zzso and gene deletion of zzso greatly diminished the zzso activity of zzso suggesting an indispensable role of zzso in zzso gene zzso Interestingly, zzso appears to have a zzso effect on the zzso functions by regulating its cellular zzso as well as its zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrated mutual interactions and functional zzso between zzso and zzso and this interaction may be important for the zzso of zzso gene zzso
