Using a defined zzso zzso zzso as an affinity zzso zzso we have developed a zzso scheme for a unique human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bennett, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Clausen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report detailed studies of the zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso by this scheme as well as the zzso activity, which, upon repeated affinity zzso evaded zzso by this affinity zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso a qualitative difference in specificity between these separated zzso activities in four rat zzso and two human zzso also revealed qualitative differences in zzso The results support the existence of multiple zzso activities and suggest that these are zzso expressed in different zzso As the number of zzso existing is unknown, as is the specificity of the until now cloned and expressed zzso zzso and zzso it is as yet impossible to relate the results obtained to specific zzso zzso The identification of zzso peptides that can be used to discriminate zzso activities is an important step toward understanding the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso in cells and zzso and in pathological zzso
