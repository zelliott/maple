In this study, we have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which is localized in the zzso outer zzso zzso possesses a Plant zzso zzso motif responsible for zzso zzso zzso activity and predicted zzso zzso zzso displayed a rapid degradation by zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing a zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso activity or zzso cells by small interfering zzso showed an zzso zzso zzso such as zzso suggesting the enhancement of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Indeed, a zzso expression of zzso zzso blocked zzso fragmentation induced by zzso zzso We found that zzso associated with and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso experiment showed that zzso zzso increased turnover of these zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso could be reverted by zzso zzso Our finding indicates that zzso plays a critical role in zzso dynamics through the control of zzso zzso zzso
