zzso zzso zzso is commonly used for the detection of human zzso zzso infected cells in tissue sections as well as in cultured zzso The specificity of zzso was determined by screening a zzso zzso zzso gene bank from zzso zzso By sequencing a zzso zzso the zzso was identified to be the zzso DNA binding protein zzso of zzso zzso reading zzso The viral insert from the zzso clone was zzso in bacterial expression zzso For this, a new zzso zzso was zzso The resulting clones were tested in zzso zzso They were zzso with zzso as well as with zzso zzso positive for zzso against zzso by this proving the specificity of zzso Using this zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in infected cells was zzso In these zzso zzso was found to be nuclear and to be associated with the nuclear membrane at late times after zzso
