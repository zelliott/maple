The zzso protein is a key regulator of the zzso zzso zzso Control of zzso function is critical for normal cell proliferation and stress responses, and it is becoming evident that multiple modifications of zzso can regulate its function within zzso In this study we show that zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso in response to growth factor stimulation of human primary zzso This association was concurrent with zzso of zzso (at zzso zzso and resulted in elevated expression of zzso and enhanced nuclear zzso However, analysis of zzso proteins zzso at the consensus zzso recognition sites at zzso 166 and 186 indicated that modification at these zzso was not sufficient for the increased expression of the zzso which was blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed evidence for an zzso zzso site in zzso additional to the two consensus zzso
