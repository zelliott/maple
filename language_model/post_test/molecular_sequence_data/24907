zzso stored under adverse conditions will reduce the viability of zzso as a result of induced zzso We have established a procedure to induce accelerated aging for studying the process of aging in zzso bean zzso zzso seeds at the molecular zzso A full-length zzso was isolated from zzso aged zzso bean zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of 713 zzso zzso zzso has seven highly zzso motifs including the DEAD box as in the case of other plant zzso zzso zzso was zzso into an expression zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso 21 and zzso by a zzso zzso The expressed protein showed zzso zzso unwinding and zzso zzso Either zzso or zzso is required for the unwinding activity, indicating that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the presence of zzso zzso with a full-length zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso bean seeds that were zzso for 16 to 32 h after accelerated aging zzso The amount of these zzso reached a maximum in 24 h zzso seeds after the zzso The zzso of zzso transcripts was shown to lead to the appearance of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso aging zzso bean zzso The results suggest that zzso may play a role in the viability of zzso bean zzso
