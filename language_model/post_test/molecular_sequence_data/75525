A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encompassing sequences zzso to zzso zzso and zzso has been passed through a zzso column in order to compare its zzso with that of the zzso intermediate precursor isolated from guinea zzso Whereas the zzso possesses 8 zzso zzso only two zzso were observed located in a putative zzso sequence (at zzso and zzso Because free zzso has been isolated from the frog, it is assumed that zzso has a zzso zzso similar to that of zzso but processing in zzso involves only one step rather than two steps as in zzso
