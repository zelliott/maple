A zzso zzso factor, zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso of mouse zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso similarly to zzso To determine whether zzso zzso is a functional zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the mouse zzso locus by zzso zzso Introduced zzso almost rescued the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a functional zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso were clearly observed although the partial fusion of the zzso columns still zzso Interestingly, however, the nature and dosage of the zzso gene affected the rescue zzso A mouse line, which has a zzso zzso zzso generated by the introduction of zzso gave rise to an zzso zzso without normal zzso zzso zzso zzso polarity was also lacking in the zzso zzso The defects in zzso polarity were determined by the altered expressions of zzso and zzso in the segmented zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso zzso zzso fringe or zzso thought to be involved in segment border formation, was fairly normal in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso family of zzso factors is involved in both segment border formation and establishment of zzso polarity through different genetic zzso
