To examine whether constituent proteins of zzso structures can be used as markers for certain pathways of zzso differentiation we have examined the occurrence of the major zzso approximately 230,000 plaque zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso rat and human zzso and bovine cell culture lines were zzso using different human zzso preparations in zzso and zzso We report that this zzso also unequivocally identified by zzso cloning from expression libraries and DNA sequencing, occurs not only in different zzso zzso but also, apparently always in zzso structures, in zzso of zzso and the complex zzso of zzso zzso and several zzso notably zzso skin zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein is zzso however, in all zzso zzso and in several zzso reported to have zzso zzso structurally similar to zzso such as zzso fibers of heart, zzso and zzso A zzso zzso cell line zzso + zzso is particularly rich in zzso This has been used to study the zzso zzso of zzso plasma membrane zzso into zzso zzso upon detachment of cell sheets during treatment with zzso a zzso zzso We propose to use the zzso approximately 230,000 plaque protein as a marker selective for certain zzso of zzso cell types and zzso tumors in studies of fetal and tumor development, including differentiation diagnosis of zzso
