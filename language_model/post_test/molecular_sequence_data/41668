zzso is the sole zzso storage protein identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is required for optimal zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso activity has been observed with this zzso Thus far, zzso structure and zzso mechanism are zzso 

We report the first crystal structure of zzso in a zzso determined at zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure adopted a typical zzso zzso Through a zzso study and zzso zzso a zzso model for the zzso zzso is zzso Very interestingly, structural zzso of zzso and its zzso protein zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited a structural mismatch of one zzso acid zzso in zzso of zzso although zzso involved in this region are highly zzso in both zzso zzso zzso models of different single point zzso with model evaluations suggested that zzso of zzso corresponding to zzso of zzso might have been the main contributor to the structural zzso This mismatch zzso more divergent structural characteristics towards their zzso regions, which are essential features for the zzso of zzso as a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity might derive from its zzso shift relative to the zzso zzso zzso This zzso shift also emphasized a limitation of the traditional template selection criterion for zzso zzso
