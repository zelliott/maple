The zzso virus zzso 2 zzso locus encodes a dominant host factor that zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso We mapped zzso to a zzso zzso that also contained the gene zzso zzso the stem cell zzso zzso zzso A truncated form of zzso zzso which was the most abundant form of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, was not expressed in zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso to zzso disease, whereas targeted disruption of Ron caused zzso We conclude that the zzso locus encodes zzso and that a naturally zzso truncated form of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
