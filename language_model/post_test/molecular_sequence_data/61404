zzso binding zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso was cloned from the hearts of Syrian zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sequence had zzso zzso to the human zzso An zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso was used to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso expression in the setting of zzso heart zzso zzso zzso revealed significant zzso of the left zzso and a decrease of left zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso expression in the hearts of zzso was significantly higher than in those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arbitrary units, p zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 in each zzso These results suggest that an enhanced zzso expression might play a role in the reduced responsiveness to catecholamines in failing hearts via zzso zzso zzso
