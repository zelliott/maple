A novel method, which involves a zzso zzso in a single closed tube, was developed for the sensitive detection of zzso zzso in plant zzso The external and internal primer pairs used had different zzso temperatures and directed the amplification of a specific DNA zzso from zzso zzso The procedure involved two consecutive zzso the first of which was performed at a higher zzso temperature that allowed amplification only by the external primer zzso Using pure cultures of zzso zzso the sensitivity of the zzso zzso in one tube was similar to that of a standard zzso zzso in two zzso The specificity and sensitivity were greater than those of standard zzso procedures that used a single primer zzso The presence of zzso in plant material, very common in zzso zzso zzso is overcome with this system in combination with a simple DNA extraction protocol because it eliminates many of the zzso zzso In addition, it needs a very small sample volume (1 zzso of DNA zzso With 83 samples of naturally infected material, this method achieved better results than any other zzso zzso standard zzso detected zzso of positive samples, zzso zzso zzso detected zzso of positive samples, and zzso zzso in a single closed tube detected zzso of positive zzso When analyzing zzso plant material, the number of positive samples detected by the developed zzso zzso was also the zzso compared with the zzso protocols indicated previously zzso 20, and zzso of 251 samples zzso zzso This method is proposed for the detection of zzso and zzso populations of zzso zzso in zzso studies and for routine use in zzso surveys, due to its high sensitivity, zzso speed, and zzso
