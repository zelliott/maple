The zzso toxin zzso represents the major and one of the most toxic components of the zzso of the Mexican scorpion zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso has been shown previously to be able to neutralize the toxic effect of zzso and of the whole zzso of zzso zzso In the present study the zzso was mapped to a surface region zzso the zzso and zzso segments of zzso using continuous and zzso synthetic zzso designed on the basis of the sequence and a three-dimensional model of zzso The study of peptides of varying length resulted in the identification of segments zzso and zzso containing zzso essential for recognition by zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the highest affinity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was a synthetic zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence from position zzso zzso of zzso bridged by zzso to zzso from position zzso zzso and zzso Similar affinity was found with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso bridged with synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to induce zzso zzso in mouse and zzso Both peptides were highly zzso The zzso obtained were able to recognize zzso and to neutralize zzso in zzso The most efficient protection zzso zzso zzso neutralized per zzso of zzso was induced by rabbit zzso zzso
