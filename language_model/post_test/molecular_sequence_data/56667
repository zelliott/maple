zzso zzso zzso of zzso and many drugs can react with serum zzso in zzso to form zzso zzso Such zzso may be responsible for some toxic effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of formation of the zzso and their chemical structures are zzso In this paper we describe the use of tandem mass zzso to locate binding sites and zzso the binding mechanism involved in the formation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Human serum zzso and excess zzso zzso were zzso in the presence of sodium zzso to trap zzso zzso The total protein product was reduced, zzso and zzso with zzso Six zzso peptides zzso by zzso at 313 zzso were isolated by zzso liquid zzso and analyzed by liquid zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso using a zzso tandem mass zzso All six peptides contained zzso linked zzso via a zzso acid to protein zzso zzso Major attachment sites on the protein were zzso zzso and zzso minor sites were identified as zzso zzso and zzso Our results show zzso that the zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso can be retained within the structure when these zzso zzso bind zzso to zzso and they suggest that zzso migration followed by Schiff base zzso formation is a credible mechanism for the generation of zzso zzso in zzso
