zzso zzso form a zzso association with the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in specialized host cells called zzso The adult zzso display zzso In which there are winged and wingless zzso We previously reported that the zzso density in zzso of the winged zzso zzso decreases around final zzso whereas that in the wingless zzso zzso does not zzso the decrease in density in zzso is accompanied by zzso of the host zzso system and by zzso zzso In the present study, we performed a zzso analysis to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the decrease in zzso zzso By comparing the protein expression profiles of zzso in zzso and zzso Just after final zzso we identified three and one protein spots that were zzso expressed in zzso and zzso zzso Among the three zzso spots, two were an identical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the other was a mixture of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso short chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso spot was zzso outer membrane protein zzso zzso and zzso analyses using zzso zzso Just after final zzso revealed that expression of zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and was localized around zzso cells in the zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in zzso degradation in zzso
