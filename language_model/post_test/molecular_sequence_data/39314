In zzso C virus zzso patients, it is generally assumed that the pattern of response to zzso therapy remains zzso after liver transplantation zzso However, changes in the circulating zzso zzso and in the gene expression profiles of the graft might influence response to treatment after zzso We evaluated 22 zzso patients who received zzso treatment while awaiting zzso and in whom zzso infection zzso Eleven of these patients underwent a new zzso treatment zzso Our study analyses the early zzso response to both treatment courses to assess the influence of the changes in zzso on the response to zzso Patients were considered early zzso zzso zzso if viral load declined zzso or zzso 2 zzso during the first 12 weeks of zzso The remaining individuals were considered zzso zzso zzso sequences from zzso region 1 and zzso zzso zzso region before both treatment regimens were zzso Of 11 patients, 8 zzso showed identical early response to both courses of therapy zzso zzso five zzso three zzso Interestingly, the response changed in three patients zzso zzso zzso two zzso became zzso after zzso whereas one zzso became zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso occurred zzso in group B zzso compared with group A zzso zzso zzso However, the number of fixed zzso was not significantly different between groups, suggesting that the changes in sensitivity to therapy after zzso are not exclusively dependent on variations in zzso zzso In conclusion, in zzso patients undergoing zzso the pattern of response to zzso treatment may change after zzso and this possibility needs to be incorporated in clinical zzso
