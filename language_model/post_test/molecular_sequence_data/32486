Human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection of the central nervous system frequently causes zzso zzso zzso and other neurological zzso The role of zzso regulatory and accessory proteins in the zzso of these disorders is zzso Here we analyzed sequences of zzso zzso and zzso genes in 55 zzso clones previously shown to zzso functional zzso genes from brain and zzso zzso of four AIDS patients with zzso zzso analysis showed distinct zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes in brain versus zzso zzso Nine of 19 zzso sequences from brain of two patients had premature stop zzso at positions between zzso acids 2 and 30, compared with 0 of 8 from zzso zzso zzso sequences from brain zzso zzso 8 of 8) but not zzso zzso zzso 0 of 6) tissue from one patient had a 35 zzso acid zzso at the zzso Rev sequences from the brain of one patient zzso zzso 6 of 8) had a 5 zzso acid zzso These results demonstrate a high frequency of defective zzso compared with zzso and rev genes in brain from HAD patients, and identify sequence zzso of these zzso genes that may influence the zzso of zzso neurological zzso
