The zzso gene mushroom bodies tiny zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso a family of proteins that has been implicated in a multitude of cellular processes including regulation of the zzso cell zzso control of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by fewer zzso in the brain and the eye, indicating a role of the protein in cell zzso differentiation or zzso We show that zzso in zzso interfere with zzso cell zzso zzso specifically zzso at zzso junctions of the developing zzso zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso protein in zzso and in zzso revealed that the zzso zzso domain and the zzso binding domain, which specifically interacts with zzso zzso are important for zzso zzso Besides regulation of zzso activity, another important function of zzso is to recruit zzso to zzso zzso We propose a role for zzso as a downstream zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso
