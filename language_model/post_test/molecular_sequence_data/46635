Human zzso genes have been reported to be zzso or to show limited zzso Recently, certain functions of zzso zzso have been described to include the presentation zzso and zzso zzso These observations prompted a thorough survey of the genetic zzso in the five human zzso genes zzso Using zzso chain zzso stranded zzso zzso zzso combined with sequence zzso zzso 2 and 3 from zzso were characterized from a total of 110 unrelated healthy zzso zzso showed that all five genes zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso are silent, zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso result in zzso acid replacements in the deduced protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso are prevalent in the zzso The zzso in zzso have characteristics that may influence interactions with zzso zzso or accessory zzso The substitution in zzso is located in the region predicted to interact with zzso and may zzso impact the ability of zzso zzso to bind zzso
