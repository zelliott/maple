The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso has long been a matter of zzso To re-evaluate this, a worldwide collection of 117 zzso assigned to either zzso zzso zzso zzso or their sister zzso zzso zzso were assessed for zzso zzso zzso cultural, temperature relations, zzso and molecular zzso Multiple gene zzso analysis was performed on DNA sequences of nuclear zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso translation zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso c zzso zzso I) zzso zzso was observed between the different zzso data sets and established that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are distinct zzso zzso of zzso zzso form a zzso grouping with low levels of zzso diversity whereas zzso zzso is more zzso Three distinct zzso groups were noted within zzso zzso with an intermediate group providing strong evidence for zzso of previously isolated zzso This evidence suggests that zzso zzso is an operational zzso unit and should remain a single zzso Of all the zzso and zzso traits only growth rate at higher temperatures reliably zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a zzso zzso zzso zzso considered the cause of potato pink zzso is clearly different in mating zzso from the other two zzso zzso however, was not a reliable characteristic as all zzso of the three species formed pink rot in potato zzso The zzso evidence suggests zzso zzso has evolved from zzso zzso more recently than the split from the most recent common zzso of all three zzso However, more data and more zzso of authentic zzso zzso are needed to fully evaluate the zzso position of this zzso
