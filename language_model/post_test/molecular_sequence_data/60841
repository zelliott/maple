zzso initiated by a variety of zzso is a zzso process that engages a zzso signaling zzso eventually leading to the controlled death of the zzso The most extensively studied zzso stimulus is the binding of death receptors related to zzso zzso by their respective zzso During the last years, a considerable number of proteins have been identified which act together in the zzso part of the signaling zzso Based on localized regions of sequence zzso it has been predicted that these proteins consist of several independently folding zzso In several cases these predictions have been confirmed by structural zzso in other cases they are at least supported by experimental zzso This review focuses on the three most widespread domain families found in the zzso signaling zzso the death domain, the death zzso domain and the zzso recruitment zzso The recently discovered analogies between these zzso both in structure and in function, have shed some light on the overall architecture of the zzso leading from death zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso and eventually to the zzso zzso
