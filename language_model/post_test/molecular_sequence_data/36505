The recent finding that zzso and drugs that affect zzso have important influences on gene expression suggests that drug-induced zzso in gene expression may zzso many long-term effects of addictive drugs, for example, dependence and zzso zzso These long-term zzso responses to zzso drugs have been particularly difficult to understand at a zzso zzso Data presented here indicate that the gene zzso the zzso precursor zzso is highly regulated by neural activity, zzso zzso and zzso These observations raise the possibility that drugs of abuse zzso zzso acting through zzso zzso may act at the genetic level to zzso the expression of zzso zzso and that these effects may zzso one component of the zzso long-term zzso response to zzso zzso The transgenic animals described above can be used to investigate zzso drug-induced changes in zzso gene zzso allowing rapid analysis of changes in zzso gene expression in highly restricted populations of zzso in a fashion previously zzso In addition, by analyzing the effects of specific zzso zzso on zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso transgenic models will permit zzso investigations within the intact nervous system that cannot otherwise be zzso Investigation of mechanisms underlying this process requires the analysis of zzso signaling zzso responsive DNA regulatory zzso and the zzso factors zzso synaptic signals into gene zzso In the studies described zzso we demonstrate that zzso complexes consisting of different zzso proteins zzso regulate zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso transcription, whereas zzso activates in a fashion completely dependent on the zzso of zzso pathways and the zzso zzso zzso alone has no effect on zzso gene zzso yet this zzso effectively blocks zzso zzso by zzso and, zzso may act as a zzso These data are consistent with a model zzso 4) in which zzso zzso mediates the rapid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso whereas zzso such as zzso or zzso mediate the protein zzso zzso Because zzso activates zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso may lead to a further and prolonged zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso the ratio of zzso to zzso induction may determine whether zzso is zzso or further zzso
