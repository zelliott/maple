The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an unusually abundant and homogeneous satellite DNA which constitutes up to zzso of its zzso The satellite DNA is shown to be present in all of the zzso by in zzso zzso 18 zzso of the repeat unit were cloned and zzso The consensus sequence is 142 zzso long and lacks any internal repeat zzso zzso of the sequence are very similar, showing on average a zzso divergence from the calculated zzso zzso zzso are scattered randomly throughout the sequence although some zzso are more common than zzso zzso repeat units are no more alike than randomly chosen zzso The results suggest that some zzso perhaps gene conversion, is acting to maintain the zzso of the satellite DNA despite its abundance and distribution on all of the zzso
