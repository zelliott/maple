The primary structure of rat zzso zzso having the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with that of the mouse zzso is presented using a limited amount of the homogeneous zzso The study strategy was principally to compare the molecular masses of liberated peptides determined by three specific zzso methods with those expected from known zzso zzso acid sequences of mouse and human zzso using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The zzso methods involved two zzso methods using zzso and zzso and a chemical method for zzso at the zzso zzso using zzso zzso Their usefulness was clearly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which permits application of the entire reaction mixture, was useful for collecting a small amount of peptides containing the zzso zzso acid, to confirm zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso It was necessary in this approach to examine the zzso acid sequence of certain zzso The zzso method was used for the sequence analysis, and this will be replaced by an improved zzso zzso now available in a few zzso
