zzso zzso zzso is a well-known zzso modification that has been shown to occur in rabbit zzso in zzso translation zzso zzso however, it is not known whether this is a general feature of in zzso proteins from other zzso zzso translation systems, particularly zzso zzso zzso Because zzso can affect protein zzso zzso binding and zzso interactions this may be of great importance as in zzso proteins are often used in zzso of protein zzso Here, I report the presence of zzso and zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso and wheat germ in zzso extracts zzso Indeed, the presence of zzso in zzso and zzso and a class II protein zzso zzso activity zzso is documented in all three zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso was detected in zzso and zzso zzso using a defined set of zzso under identical conditions I show that all three in zzso systems contain different zzso of the various zzso These data suggest that three systems can be used in a complementary fashion to investigate the zzso of zzso modification on protein zzso
