We have identified and cloned a novel zinc finger zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso as a potential downstream zzso of anterior neural plate formation in zzso zzso was isolated as one of several zzso genes that was induced by the zzso factor, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell 70, zzso in zzso zzso zzso has an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso and contains six zzso type zinc finger zzso which are highly zzso among zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the expression of zzso begins at stage 12 in the zzso end of the neural plate, and by stage 45, it is localized to several zzso regions, including the zzso bulbs, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mouse zzso of zzso is similarly expressed in the mouse zzso by embryonic day zzso
