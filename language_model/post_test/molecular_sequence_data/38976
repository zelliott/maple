Modern zzso brewing zzso used in beer production are hybrid strains consisting of at least two different zzso To obtain information on the identity of the parental strains that gave rise to industrial zzso zzso we used two-dimensional zzso gel zzso and zzso the zzso of different zzso species isolated from zzso We found that the zzso of zzso brewing zzso and of the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be interpreted as the zzso of two elementary zzso One originates from proteins zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The other zzso to a divergent zzso species whose best representative is a particular zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso A map of industrial zzso brewing zzso has been established, with the individual origin of proteins and with identification of protein spots by comparison to known zzso zzso zzso This zzso map can be zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso server through the World Wide zzso This study provides the first example of the use of zzso analysis for investigating zzso relationships between divergent zzso zzso
