The human zzso gene encodes type zzso collagen (also known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso an integral component of zzso attachment complexes providing integrity to the zzso zzso zzso a useful model system to study skin development, displays fully developed zzso at approximately 5 days zzso zzso We have identified two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in the skin and the neural system, zzso The proteins coded by these genes have structural module organizations zzso to the human type zzso zzso zzso of the expression of zzso with a specific zzso targeting the zzso zzso of the gene resulted in a blistering zzso and in zzso in the basement membrane zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in zzso or in marked reduction of zzso in the lateral zzso Thus, zzso has two zzso zzso which may have evolved zzso functions during zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a model system to study the molecular aspects of skin development and offers insights into the corresponding human zzso
