Although reliable zzso are available that distinguish human zzso T zzso cells from zzso and other T cells, few are available for zzso zzso zzso We have developed a zzso zzso that, in the presence of complement, zzso zzso zzso cells but not zzso This zzso recognizes activated zzso cells but not their zzso In these studies, flow zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso with several zzso cell zzso cloned zzso cell lines and zzso (a zzso tumor cell zzso zzso was not detected with zzso zzso cell zzso cloned zzso cells, zzso lines and zzso B cell lines, zzso zzso bone zzso cells nor a variety of tumor zzso Among zzso positive lines, expression is zzso and the number of cells expressing high levels of the zzso is increased when the zzso are maintained at a relatively high cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso also reduce expression of this zzso These observations suggest that the zzso recognized by zzso is a zzso linked to a zzso This zzso was tested by zzso for binding to a large panel of carbohydrates and zzso coupled to zzso The only one that bound zzso was zzso zzso c zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso an zzso zzso Comparative analysis shows that both the sequence and the linkage of these zzso are essential to the zzso with the zzso zzso This zzso is expressed by a zzso of approximately 200 zzso as shown by Western zzso The identity of this zzso remains to be determined, but indirect evidence suggests that it is not zzso
