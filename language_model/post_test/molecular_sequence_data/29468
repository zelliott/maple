Intermediate filaments zzso are key components of the zzso in higher zzso zzso The elementary IF zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso consisting of four consecutive zzso zzso The segments zzso and zzso include highly zzso sequences and are critically involved in IF zzso Based on the crystal structures of three human zzso fragments at zzso A resolution zzso entries zzso zzso and zzso we have established the molecular organization of these two zzso The zzso corresponding to segment zzso forms a single, zzso zzso which is compatible with a zzso zzso While this segment might yield a coiled zzso within an isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso are likely to play a role in specific zzso interactions during IF zzso The zzso segment reveals a zzso coiled zzso which zzso near zzso zzso to accommodate a zzso A zzso containing the last seven zzso of zzso interferes heavily with IF assembly and also zzso mature zzso filaments into a new kind of zzso These results provide the first insight into the architecture and functioning of zzso at the atomic zzso
