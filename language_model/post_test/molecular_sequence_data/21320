zzso is the mechanism by which dormant seeds become zzso during their dry storage after zzso The absence of free water in mature seeds does not allow zzso zzso thus, the processes associated with dormancy release under these conditions are largely zzso We show here that sunflower zzso zzso seed zzso of dormancy during zzso is associated with zzso zzso and that this zzso is prevented when seeds are maintained zzso In zzso approaches demonstrate that zzso zzso results in artifacts in zzso zzso length zzso analysis and alters protein zzso The zzso of transcripts is not random but selective, and, using zzso we identified 24 stored zzso that became highly oxidized during zzso zzso transcripts mainly zzso to genes involved in responses to stress and in cell zzso Among them, protein zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso zzso 1 were zzso We propose that targeted zzso zzso during dry zzso of dormant seeds could be a process that zzso cell signaling toward zzso in the early steps of seed zzso
