zzso in the zzso regulatory cascade in zzso zzso activates a number of genes required for secondary metabolism and zzso zzso forming an zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was transcribed in response to zzso showing that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso bound a single site upstream of the zzso promoter at approximately position zzso with respect to its zzso start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso site showed that the zzso site was essential for zzso zzso zzso in which zzso was disrupted had higher zzso zzso zzso and total zzso activities than the zzso strain, which showed that zzso modulated the activities of these zzso produced zzso Because a number of genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso most of which are zzso zzso are also under the control of zzso the zzso regulatory cascade was thought to play a crucial role in modulating the zzso zzso activities by triggering simultaneous production of the zzso and their inhibitor at a specific timing during zzso zzso in which zzso was disrupted grew normally and formed aerial zzso and spores with the same time course as the zzso zzso However, zzso addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso grown on zzso medium resulted in a delay in aerial zzso formation, indicating that zzso is involved in aerial zzso formation in conjunction with zzso
