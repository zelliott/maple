Members of a highly abundant restriction satellite family have been isolated from the wild beet species zzso zzso The satellite DNA sequence is characterized by a zzso zzso restriction site and is present in three of four sections of the zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso It was not detected in species of the evolutionary old section zzso suggesting its amplification after separation of this zzso zzso of eight zzso were aligned revealing a size variation from 209 to 233 zzso and an AT content ranging from zzso to zzso The similarity between zzso in zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso zzso were identified by sequence analysis and Southern zzso A comparative study of this repetitive DNA element by fluorescent in zzso zzso and Southern analyses in three representative species was performed showing a variable zzso organization and zzso zzso along zzso zzso both within and between zzso In zzso zzso the copy number of this satellite, with some 30,000 per zzso zzso is more than tenfold higher than in zzso zzso and up to 200 times higher than in zzso zzso indicating different levels of sequence amplification during evolution in the zzso zzso In sugar beet zzso zzso the large-scale organization of this tandem repeat was examined by zzso gel zzso Southern zzso to zzso DNA zzso with zzso demonstrated that satellite zzso are located in zzso regions and the tandem repeat is a useful probe for the detection of genetic variation in closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
