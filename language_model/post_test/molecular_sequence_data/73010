Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared using zzso zzso zzso to examine the zzso affinity relationships of zzso zzso zzso in calcium binding sites III and zzso The zzso zzso was prepared to produce a strong fluorescent label to follow the zzso structural changes in the zzso domain of the zzso A second zzso zzso was prepared to destroy the calcium binding to site IV and thereby eliminate zzso between sites III and zzso The zzso calcium zzso zzso of the two sites in the zzso domain were derived from the calcium zzso data that had been fitted to a zzso Hill zzso The calcium zzso zzso of site III and site IV in the zzso zzso were 335 zzso and zzso zzso zzso These values were significantly greater than the values of 14 and 1 zzso for site III and site IV in zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that a very conservative zzso zzso in the zzso position of the site IV zzso loop drastically decreased the calcium binding affinity of the site zzso and also significantly reduced that of site III in the same domain zzso The zzso zzso zzso also had a zzso lower zzso zzso activity with a zzso lower affinity for this zzso than that of zzso zzso in the presence of low calcium concentration zzso zzso However, the maximum zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso and the affinity of this zzso for the zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso in the presence of high calcium concentration (15 zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso altered calcium regulation of zzso zzso zzso activity without affecting zzso interaction with the zzso
