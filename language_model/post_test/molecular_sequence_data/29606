In contrast to animals, little is known about pattern formation in zzso zzso and genetic data suggest the involvement of the zzso zzso in this zzso Here, we characterize a novel member of the zzso family of putative zzso zzso carriers, zzso zzso that is localized in developing and mature root zzso zzso zzso are defective in establishment and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso fail to zzso zzso applied zzso and display various patterning defects in both embryonic and zzso zzso We propose a role for zzso in generating a sink for zzso below the zzso center of the root zzso that is essential for zzso distribution and zzso
