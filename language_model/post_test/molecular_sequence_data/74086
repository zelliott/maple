Twelve infectious zzso virus zzso zzso obtained from commercial chickens in China between 2005 and 2006 were characterized by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and the sequencing of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was unlike the zzso zzso zzso found in zzso an affinity for the respiratory zzso The zzso was identified by zzso analysis and basic local alignment search tool zzso searches of the entire zzso gene and by the zzso test that was performed using zzso zzso Further, it was demonstrated that the commercially used zzso vaccine did not provide sufficient protection against this zzso however, the attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso whose parent virus was isolated in China, showed a better efficacy of protection against zzso This study thus may demonstrate that the use of a combination of commercially available vaccines or of attenuated zzso strains would provide satisfactory protection against the zzso zzso In addition, the study also revealed that zzso strains exhibiting different zzso were found zzso in the chicken flock in zzso
