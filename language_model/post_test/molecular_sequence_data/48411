A novel zzso zzso was isolated from a lung sample from a zzso using continuous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic studies indicated that this zzso virus zzso belongs to the species zzso 5 in the family zzso We attempted to determine the complete zzso sequence of the first Korean zzso zzso designated zzso The full-length zzso of zzso was found to be zzso zzso in length and consist of seven zzso genes zzso predicted to zzso eight zzso The overall degree of zzso sequence identity was zzso between zzso and zzso (formerly zzso virus 5, zzso a zzso zzso and the putative proteins had zzso to zzso zzso acid identity to those of zzso zzso analysis further demonstrated that the novel zzso isolate is a member of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The present study describes the identification and zzso characterization of a zzso isolate in South zzso
