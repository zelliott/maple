The zzso gene of zzso zzso has been cloned and the gene product zzso We have found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein displays an zzso activity that zzso zzso closed circular DNA in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso unlike human zzso which shows zzso activity only in the presence of zzso We report in the present paper that the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso acids zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso equilibrium and dynamic light scattering experiments show zzso to be a zzso The probable zzso active site is localized to a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso activity is dependent on the integrity of this zzso By in zzso comparison of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso we show that the latter protein exhibits highly reduced zzso zzso We therefore suggest that the mode of zzso initiation in DNA mismatch repair may be different in organisms that lack zzso zzso but have zzso proteins that zzso the zzso zzso
