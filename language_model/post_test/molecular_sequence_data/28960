We report a comprehensive comparative analysis of human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The OR family is the largest zzso gene family zzso We identify approximately zzso of an estimated 1500 mouse zzso exceeding previous estimates and the number of human zzso by zzso Only zzso are zzso giving a functional OR repertoire in mice that is three times larger than that of zzso The proteins zzso by intact human zzso are less highly zzso than those of zzso in patterns that suggest that even some apparently intact human OR genes may zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso are clustered in 46 zzso locations, compared to a much more dispersed pattern in zzso We find zzso clusters at zzso human locations for most mouse zzso indicating that most OR gene clusters zzso zzso zzso However, many recent local OR zzso in both zzso obscure zzso zzso zzso thereby complicating zzso zzso about zzso zzso Local zzso are the major force shaping the gene zzso Recent zzso zzso of zzso have also occurred, but much more frequently in human than in zzso In addition to clarifying the evolutionary forces shaping this gene family, our study provides the basis for functional studies of the zzso regulation and zzso capabilities of the OR gene zzso
