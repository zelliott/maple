Growth cones of developing zzso are guided to their targets by attractive and repulsive zzso We have isolated three mouse zzso of the chick zzso guidance zzso zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso and characterized their expression zzso zzso and zzso are predominantly expressed in the developing and adult central nervous system in distinct patterns with little zzso The third member of the zzso gene family, zzso shows exclusive expression in the muscle cell zzso From sequence and expression data, we suggest zzso to be the mouse zzso of chick zzso
