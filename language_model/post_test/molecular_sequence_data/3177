An zzso induced by cold shock in zzso coli, designated zzso incorporates a zzso zzso into nascent zzso A in place of the secondary zzso chain normally added by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso alters the properties of the outer membrane and zzso zzso benefits at low growth temperatures, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso in zzso the structural gene for the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso grown at 12 degrees C lacked the zzso zzso present in zzso of zzso wild type cells but retained normal levels of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso When examined by mass zzso about two-thirds of the zzso A molecules isolated from wild type zzso coli grown at 12 degrees C contained zzso in place of zzso whereas the zzso A of zzso zzso contained only zzso in amounts comparable with those seen in wild type cells grown at 30 degrees C or zzso To probe the integrity of the outer zzso zzso and an zzso wild type strain were grown at 30 or 12 degrees C and then tested for their zzso to zzso zzso exhibited a zzso increase in sensitivity to zzso and zzso at 12 degrees C compared with wild type cells but showed identical resistance when grown at 30 degrees zzso We suggest that the zzso may zzso a selective advantage upon zzso coli cells growing at lower temperatures by making the outer membrane a more effective barrier to harmful zzso
