In zzso transforming growth zzso zzso is found in 3 highly zzso zzso that exert their effects via zzso complexes of zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso regulates the growth and metabolism of various cell types, including zzso We have investigated the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in normal human skin, zzso zzso zzso zzso disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using frozen tissue zzso In normal human skin, the zzso zzso but not zzso was detected predominantly in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso was very weak in the majority of normal zzso In zzso zzso expression was markedly reduced or completely zzso In addition, zzso and zzso zzso cells were accumulated in the zzso zzso in some zzso These zzso cells were partly but moderately positive for zzso zzso expression of zzso was likely to be associated with the differentiation state of zzso cells, since zzso expression was clearly observed in the zzso zzso of zzso In addition, no expression of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso portion or in zzso zzso but it was detected in the upper zzso ducts and in zzso zzso
