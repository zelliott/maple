To probe the protein environment of an zzso channel, we have zzso the structure of a zzso domain by substituting side chains with those of two different sizes by using zzso zzso We have used zzso and Ala as a zzso and a zzso zzso probe, respectively, to replace each of 18 consecutive zzso within the putative second zzso segment, zzso of an inwardly zzso zzso channel, zzso Our rationale is that a change in the channel function as a consequence of these zzso at a particular position will reflect the structural environment of the altered side zzso Each position can then be assigned to one of three classes of zzso as grated by different levels of zzso very tolerant zzso functions with both zzso and Ala zzso tolerant zzso preserved with Ala but not with zzso zzso and intolerant zzso Ala or zzso substitution destroys zzso We identify the very tolerant environment as being zzso tolerant as zzso and intolerant as zzso We observe a zzso ordered pattern of zzso of all three environmental zzso This result indicates that zzso is a straight zzso
