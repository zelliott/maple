zzso infected with zzso virus strain Lister zzso a zzso of approximate molecular weight 35,000 zzso into the zzso Previous studies identified a zzso zzso region of 17 zzso acids in the zzso protein which could potentially function as a signal zzso to target the protein to the zzso zzso Here we report the use of the zzso signals derived from the zzso gene to direct export and zzso of a foreign zzso zzso virus zzso carrying the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene zzso immediately downstream from the promoter and the zzso coding sequences of the zzso gene were zzso Our studies show that the zzso 22 or 42 zzso acids of the zzso protein direct efficient zzso of the zzso zzso However, due to a cryptic zzso site within zzso zzso protein was zzso which reduced zzso zzso zzso was restored in the presence of zzso zzso of the zzso site by zzso zzso abolished zzso with no effect on zzso although zzso activity was again reduced, possibly due to an effect on the active zzso The results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of using the promoter and the signal sequence of the zzso gene to generate zzso viruses for zzso and zzso of foreign zzso
