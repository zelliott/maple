zzso free zzso serves as an important second zzso participating in signal zzso of various environmental zzso However, molecular bases for the plasma membrane zzso influx and its regulation remain largely zzso We here identified a gene zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso channel from rice, zzso expressed in mature leaves, shoots and roots as well as in cultured zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso activity and growth rate of a zzso zzso zzso To zzso its zzso roles, we generated transgenic rice plants and cultured cells zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso of zzso was zzso zzso cells showed hypersensitivity to excess zzso but higher growth rate under zzso zzso while growth of the zzso cultured cells was less sensitive to zzso free zzso zzso suggesting that zzso has zzso transport activity across the plasma zzso zzso plants showed reduced growth and abnormal zzso of zzso Growth of zzso zzso was comparable to the control on zzso plates, while significantly reduced in adult zzso These results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso channel involved in the regulation of growth and zzso
