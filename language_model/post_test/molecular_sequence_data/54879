The function of the human zzso sodium channel zzso is regulated in part by zzso calcium zzso The ubiquitous calcium sensor protein zzso zzso is an important part of the complex zzso apparatus in zzso zzso interacts with an zzso zzso motif in the large zzso zzso domain of the zzso Using zzso and zzso we have been able to isolate a zzso motif complex and to determine its high-resolution structure in absence of calcium using zzso solution zzso Under these conditions, the zzso zzso motif interacts with the zzso domain zzso of zzso with the zzso domain remaining free in zzso The structure reveals that the zzso adopts a semi-open zzso with the zzso motif bound in a narrow zzso zzso zzso similarities between zzso sodium channels and zzso calcium channels suggest that the structure of the zzso zzso motif complex can serve as a general model for the interaction between zzso and zzso channel zzso motifs under zzso zzso The structure also provides insight into the zzso basis for zzso zzso that map to the zzso motif in zzso
