The zzso zzso zzso arose spontaneously in a zzso colony and is the only known, naturally occurring zzso of zzso This zzso mouse was first identified based on its zzso and zzso zzso zzso and molecular data presented here demonstrate that the type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which serves as an zzso channel to release calcium from zzso stores, is altered in the opt zzso A zzso deletion in the zzso gene removes two zzso from the zzso zzso but does not interrupt the zzso reading zzso The altered protein is predicted to have lost several zzso sites and is present at markedly reduced levels in opt zzso Nonetheless, a strong calcium release from zzso stores can be zzso in zzso zzso zzso treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates Group 1 zzso linked to zzso proteins that stimulate zzso C and subsequent production of the zzso zzso zzso leading to calcium zzso via the zzso zzso The calcium response in opt zzso shows less zzso to repeated zzso application than in control zzso These data suggest that the convulsions and zzso observed in opt mice may be caused by the zzso zzso of a functional zzso zzso
