Recently, novel hybrid zzso zzso zzso proteins fused with a zzso zzso were found from some zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree analysis that was constructed from the aligned sequences showed two major zzso zzso zzso zzso was grouped in one branch as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso were grouped in the zzso zzso To explain the existence of two zzso in novel hybrid zzso zzso we have compared the zzso given by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso their separated zzso zzso and a set of zzso devoid of the zzso zzso The kinetic study described here demonstrates clearly that zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso For the first time, we also demonstrate the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso fusion and suggest the in zzso function of zzso zzso fusion serving as a zzso zzso
