zzso zzso zzso is alternatively spliced in human zzso tissue to produce several zzso zzso called zzso to zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso designed to amplify both zzso and zzso amplified three additional bands in different zzso two representing different zzso species both zzso zzso and one representing zzso for a novel zzso zzso named zzso cloned from zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected both zzso and zzso in multiple zzso Whereas zzso was found in all cardiovascular zzso zzso zzso was mainly present in zzso However, quantitative zzso indicated zzso expression also in cardiac zzso The pharmacological profiles and ability to activate zzso zzso zzso were compared between four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g and zzso expressed zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso with ten zzso revealed identical pharmacological profiles zzso rank order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells zzso was a partial zzso compared to zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso from zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were full zzso while zzso was full zzso at zzso and partial zzso at zzso probably due to different zzso expression zzso At both zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso At high zzso levels, zzso and zzso and to a variable extent zzso and zzso displayed some partial zzso activity, whereas zzso and zzso reduced the zzso activity below zzso indicating both receptors to be zzso zzso We conclude that the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso indistinguishable from other zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso tail does not influence zzso to zzso
