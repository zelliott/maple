An extensive study was carried out on zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with the aim of identifying specific zzso peptides zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso They may be considered, in zzso as advanced zzso end zzso These compounds, important at a systemic level in diabetic and zzso subjects, are produced by zzso zzso of in zzso zzso zzso They are related to the pathological state of patients and have been invoked as responsible for tissue zzso The zzso zzso obtained by the two zzso were analyzed by zzso and zzso and clear cut differences were zzso First of all, the zzso products of zzso zzso are generally less abundant than those observed in the case of zzso zzso accounting for the lower zzso of the former to zzso zzso zzso experiments on doubly charged zzso comparisons with a protein database, and molecular modeling to identify the zzso zzso groups most exposed to zzso identified some zzso peptides in zzso zzso obtained from both types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso seem to be privileged zzso sites, in agreement with the fractional zzso accessible surface values calculated by molecular zzso
