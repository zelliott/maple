zzso signaling plays a key role in zzso zzso A major zzso downstream regulator of this zzso is the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso of zzso 1 zzso Here we investigated the function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression decreases during progression of bone cell zzso development in zzso zzso suggesting that it is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, and zzso zzso indicate that zzso directly zzso OC promoter zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso interaction zzso reveal that zzso zzso binds specifically to an zzso in the zzso promoter of the OC zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso that recruits the zzso Groucho abrogates repression of OC promoter activity by zzso but also blocks zzso binding to the zzso The latter result suggests that zzso zzso may be recruited to the OC promoter by both zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso protein is capable of zzso OC gene zzso in zzso cells through an zzso in the zzso zzso zzso may contribute to zzso growth and differentiation by controlling zzso zzso zzso directly through interactions with zzso regulators that are known to bind to the OC gene zzso
