The prevalence and clinical significance of naturally occurring zzso in the full-length surface and overlapping zzso genes of zzso B virus zzso were analyzed in 42 patients with chronic zzso zzso were observed in 10 patients zzso in the a zzso region, which is the zzso zzso within the major zzso region of the surface zzso A high proportion of these zzso zzso zzso occurred in the first loop, unlike zzso induced by zzso The presence of serum zzso to zzso B surface zzso was significantly associated with these zzso No other region of the surface gene contained any cluster of zzso These results suggest that escape zzso commonly contribute to zzso in the natural course of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso affecting the major zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which could alter zzso to zzso zzso zzso were not detected at zzso
