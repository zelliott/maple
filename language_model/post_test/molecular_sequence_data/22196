Selective protein degradation is an efficient and rapid way of terminating protein zzso zzso in protein degradation are associated with a number of human diseases, including potentially zzso syndrome, which is zzso by abnormal development of the neural crest lineage during zzso We describe the identification of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and show that blocking the function of zzso zzso leads to zzso defects in zzso zzso there is an increased allocation of cells to a neural crest fate and within this zzso an increase in zzso at the expense of zzso zzso zzso Most of the observed effects can be attributed to zzso of zzso a known target of zzso degradation from other zzso Indeed, we show that blocking the function of zzso leads to a decrease in zzso zzso and an increase in total zzso Our results show that zzso protein degradation plays an essential role in the correct allocation of neural crest fates during zzso
