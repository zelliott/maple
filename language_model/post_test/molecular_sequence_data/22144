In zzso of membrane proteins on the zzso zzso the orientation of the zzso zzso zzso segment is influenced by the charge of the zzso zzso acid zzso We assessed the function of the positive charges downstream of the zzso segment using zzso zzso The positive charges were systematically replaced with zzso zzso Although the original TM segment zzso the N zzso the zzso was zzso depending on the zzso Orientation was affected in zzso in which 6 zzso were shifted zzso even when the 6 zzso were 25 zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso was functionally replaced by zzso but not by zzso or zzso The timing of action during zzso zzso indicated that the zzso functions at the zzso exit zzso We suggest that the commitment of the TM segment to a particular orientation is influenced by far downstream parts of the zzso chain and that the positive charges are zzso after zzso the zzso
