More than 40 nitrate zzso zzso of zzso zzso belonging to three different zzso classes were zzso All 15 zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso library of the wild zzso zzso copies of zzso genes were recovered from zzso zzso using two different zzso The DNA sequences of 13 isolated fragments were zzso Five fragments were found to zzso therefore nine different zzso regions containing genes essential for nitrate zzso could be zzso Three zzso regions containing genes coding for zzso of ABC zzso were further zzso In two cases, genes coding for an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were clustered and overlapped by four zzso The third gene for a zzso zzso had no additional ABC zzso gene in zzso One ABC zzso was found to be zzso zzso The zzso reveals that the ABC zzso solely mediates zzso zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso the second ABC zzso is proposed to be zzso specific, explaining its essential role in nitrate zzso The third ABC zzso is proposed to be zzso zzso Genome sequencing has shown that ABC zzso are widespread in zzso Nevertheless, this study represents only the second example of a functional zzso
