The molten zzso structure of zzso zzso has been zzso from the hydrogen exchange protection of the backbone zzso zzso In order to make it possible to measure the hydrogen exchange zzso of the individual backbone zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso peak assignment was obtained for most of the backbone zzso The chemical shift and zzso results obtained under the condition where the protein assumes the native structure are fully consistent with the known secondary structure of bovine zzso indicating that the zzso protein has a similar native zzso to that of the bovine zzso The hydrogen exchange rate of the individual backbone zzso zzso was measured under the conditions where the protein assumes the native and molten zzso zzso In the native state, strong protection was observed for the zzso located in the eight (A to zzso zzso which form a barrel structure, and zzso of a major zzso In the molten zzso state at zzso pH conditions, significant protection from the exchange has been observed for zzso located in the A, zzso G and H strands in the native zzso The pattern of protection is consistent with a zzso zzso formation by these zzso The zzso located in a major zzso of the native structure are also protected, suggesting that this zzso is formed in the molten zzso and is packed against the sheet as in the native zzso These results indicate that a zzso zzso is formed in the molten zzso state of zzso zzso
