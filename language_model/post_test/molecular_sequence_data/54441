Due to the environmental problems associated with disposal of livestock zzso many stabilization studies emphasizing on the sludge volume reduction were zzso However, little is known about the microbial risk present in sludge and its stabilized zzso This study zzso explored the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso risk of raw zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing zzso In raw zzso manure, clones closely related to pathogens such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Meanwhile, in the zzso zzso zzso manure, bacterial community clones closely related to pathogens such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were still zzso Interestingly, the zzso treatment resulted in no detection of clones closely related to pathogens in the stabilized zzso bacterial community, with the predominance of novel zzso class zzso These findings support the superiority of zzso in selectively reducing potential human and animal pathogens compared to zzso which is a typical zzso stabilization method used in livestock zzso
