Genes of the zzso family are known to be critical regulators of the cell zzso They have already been established as possible zzso zzso regulation mechanisms result in numerous zzso and protein zzso being expressed from each gene of the zzso zzso Their similarity caused an often misleading nomenclature in zzso zzso The aim of the present work is a clarification of the nomenclature of zzso zzso family zzso an essential prerequisite for reliable interpretation of gene expression and protein function zzso Here, we report five partial zzso and one partial zzso zzso zzso all originating from two zzso zzso zzso DNA, deduced protein zzso and the zzso architecture were analyzed and compared to zzso zzso and zzso sequences from other zzso Along with our zzso we analyzed all similar zzso sequences found in the zzso zzso The analysis showed our zzso sequences code for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and identified all other zzso zzso family sequences as zzso genes or their expression zzso Our results also indicate zzso as the ancestral gene of the zzso family as well as the only gene of the family present in zzso zzso zzso
