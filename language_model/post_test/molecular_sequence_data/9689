The zzso protein activates zzso as part of a zzso complex with zzso However, zzso cells are characterized by loss of expression of several zzso suggesting that zzso may also repress gene zzso zzso cloning identifies a novel zzso domain zzso finger protein zzso zzso zzso finger zzso that specifically interacts with zzso but not with Max or zzso zzso binds to start sites of the zzso major late and zzso D1 promoters and activates zzso from both zzso zzso has a potent growth arrest zzso zzso of zzso to zzso requires the zzso domain of zzso and a short zzso zzso located in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso overcomes zzso growth arrest and renders zzso zzso in zzso These processes depend on zzso and zzso association and on the integrity of the zzso domain of zzso suggesting that zzso binding activates a zzso zzso function of this zzso Fusion of a nuclear zzso signal zzso efficient nuclear transport of zzso and zzso the ability of zzso to overcome zzso zzso and growth arrest by zzso Our data suggest a model for how gene repression by zzso may occur in zzso
