The zzso zzso zzso zzso the gastric zzso of half of the human population, resulting in chronic zzso ulcers, and zzso We zzso ten gene fragments from pairs of strains isolated zzso at a mean zzso of zzso years from 26 zzso Several zzso had acquired small mosaic segments from other zzso zzso or point zzso The zzso zzso rate, the import size, and the frequency of zzso were calculated by using a zzso zzso The calculations indicate that the last common zzso of zzso zzso existed at least zzso years zzso zzso mosaics have a median size of zzso zzso much smaller than for other bacteria, and zzso occurs frequently zzso imports spanning 25,000 zzso per zzso per zzso Thus, the zzso population structure of zzso zzso results from very frequent zzso during mixed colonization by unrelated zzso
