zzso zzso is the first zzso of the zzso shunt which is required for the zzso of fatty acids and zzso The zzso pathogen zzso zzso contains high activities of this zzso following growth on zzso and zzso indicating that it plays an important role in the metabolism of these zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso It specifies a zzso Da zzso which was shown to be functional by expressing it in zzso zzso A gene similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso was located 90 zzso downstream from zzso Northern zzso and zzso experiments showed that zzso and zzso are zzso into a zzso zzso zzso A smaller zzso zzso zzso transcript was also observed which was zzso more abundant than the zzso zzso It is proposed that a stable hairpin structure with a free energy zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and located in the 90 zzso zzso zzso region is involved in stabilizing the zzso zzso
