zzso zzso is a recently described zzso zzso zzso associated with respiratory tract infections in zzso In order to determine the molecular epidemiology of this zzso we characterized 55 zzso zzso zzso from eight countries on four zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso repetitive sequence zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso into six zzso types zzso of which only three zzso were recovered from zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence and zzso analyses confirmed the results obtained by zzso and indicated limited zzso among zzso of zzso zzso recovered from zzso Taken together, the results of our analysis demonstrate that the majority of zzso zzso zzso recovered from zzso poultry throughout the world are represented by a small group of closely related clones and suggest that the zzso was recently introduced to zzso poultry from wild bird zzso
