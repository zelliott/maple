The most abundant zzso viral transcripts in the zzso virus zzso tumor zzso zzso are a family zzso sizes, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of highly spliced zzso zzso expressed from the zzso and zzso regions of the viral zzso in an zzso direction with respect to several viral zzso functions zzso within the same region and concerned with the zzso cycle of the zzso We have called these zzso zzso They are also expressed in B cells, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, and tumors generated in zzso zzso in response to zzso infection, but at a lower zzso The complete structure of the major zzso zzso zzso or eight zzso was determined in this study; the larger, but zzso transcripts appear to be produced by differential zzso The zzso promoter for the major zzso zzso located in zzso contains several zzso zzso control elements zzso zzso and zzso and is functionally active in both B zzso and zzso zzso It appears to be a zzso viral promoter, as it also contains the initiation zzso for a gene zzso that encodes a zzso that is expressed off the other zzso zzso events create a number of small zzso open reading zzso one of which has zzso to functionally significant regions of the zzso nuclear zzso 2 and to zzso (in zzso The complex nature of these transcripts and their potential role in the virus association with zzso are zzso
