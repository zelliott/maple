zzso specificity zzso of human zzso were examined by zzso zzso and by kinetic analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso By comparing zzso differences among sequences of 12- and zzso a small region responsible for functional differences between 12- and zzso has been zzso Furthermore, the replacement of only two zzso acids in zzso (at zzso and zzso in the primary zzso by those found in certain zzso results in an zzso that has activity similar to zzso An examination of the activity of nine zzso of zzso demonstrated that the zzso acid zzso bulk and geometry of zzso zzso and zzso are the key components of the zzso specificity zzso of zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso that performs predominantly zzso was achieved in a zzso cell culture zzso This zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso and its zzso were compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has no change in its apparent zzso for zzso acid and a minor zzso change in its zzso For zzso acid, the zzso has no change in its zzso and a zzso reduction in its zzso as expected for an zzso performing predominantly zzso The results are consistent with a model in which two zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute a structural element which contributes to the zzso of the zzso Replacement of these zzso acids with those found in certain zzso results in an zzso which can bind zzso acid in a zzso register that prefers zzso
