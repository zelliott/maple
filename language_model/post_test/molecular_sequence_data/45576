Few zzso membrane proteins have had their zzso determined zzso Often, researchers turn to an zzso to predict where the zzso zzso might zzso Here we use a consensus method, using six different zzso domain prediction zzso on six members of the zzso transport family, all of which have been zzso zzso zzso results indicate that the six chosen zzso transport family members are distributed throughout most branches of the zzso suggesting that these members represent a broad view of the zzso transport zzso We combined the prediction zzso with a multiple sequence zzso and consensus zzso zzso were assigned not only based on zzso zzso but also based on zzso familial motifs found by analysis of the zzso zzso The consensus method combined with the zzso zzso yields a model zzso for the family containing 12 zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso facing zzso
