The zzso zzso is the zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso in pig hind limb and zzso Thus, vascular responses to zzso and zzso zzso were almost or totally abolished in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso was evoked by a zzso but not a zzso zzso zzso and this could be strongly reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso receptors in pig kidney and zzso artery was indicated by zzso and zzso for zzso receptors was detected in small zzso arteries using in zzso zzso In contrast, the pig zzso contains both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso zzso zzso which was strongly reduced and not zzso respectively, by zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated expression of both zzso and zzso receptors in pig zzso zzso of pig zzso zzso but not zzso receptors was also demonstrated in zzso and membrane zzso binding zzso The presence of zzso receptors in dog zzso was demonstrated in zzso by zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso the latter also indicating existence of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was also demonstrated in dog kidney in zzso and by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso receptors was demonstrated, as zzso zzso binding in dog zzso was displaced with great zzso in contrast to zzso zzso binding in dog and pig zzso Furthermore, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displaced zzso zzso zzso binding from zzso receptors in dog zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted potent and zzso zzso effects on zzso evoked by zzso in guinea-pig zzso vein in zzso The zzso was competitive as the slope of the zzso plot was not significantly different from zzso zzso zzso appeared as effective as zzso zzso to antagonize zzso zzso in this vessel and neither zzso affected zzso evoked by zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonized zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked in pig kidney and zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso responses in zzso zzso via other zzso including zzso were not zzso zzso zzso was also shown to have a long duration of action in zzso zzso zzso exerted zzso and equally potent antagonism on vascular responses to zzso and zzso zzso released, zzso in zzso The elimination of zzso zzso from plasma fit a zzso model, resulting in a zzso of 2 and 20 zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso It is concluded that continuous infusions of this latter zzso are preferable to infections during in zzso experiments, since zzso effects can be avoided, and the duration of zzso action is under better zzso zzso This study presents the final pharmacological evidence for the involvement of zzso zzso in sympathetic zzso It was demonstrated that zzso released zzso acting on zzso receptors mediates long-lasting zzso of the guinea-pig zzso zzso in zzso Thus, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso almost abolished the long-lasting phase of contraction evoked by high frequency stimulation of zzso sympathetic nerves in this vessel, leaving merely an initial zzso peak zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso vein was demonstrated, as zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and virtually devoid of zzso zzso zzso was largely without zzso Evidence was also presented for the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso zzso abolished the long-lasting phase of zzso zzso evoked in hind limb and zzso zzso upon high frequency stimulation of sympathetic nerves in the zzso pig in zzso zzso zzso
