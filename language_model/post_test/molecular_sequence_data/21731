Based on projections that climate changes are will intensify in the near future, it is important to understand how plants respond to zzso zzso we have been studying the effect of contrasting temperatures on leaf metabolism of zzso zzso an important Mediterranean zzso zzso plants were grown under controlled conditions for 53 days at zzso or zzso The zzso of major soluble zzso was analyzed by zzso The relative levels of transcripts of genes zzso key zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined by means of zzso real-time zzso At zzso in the pre-existing leaves, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were higher, as were PAL and zzso zzso At zzso however, it was the concentration of zzso acid that was higher, as were the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that contrasting temperatures greatly influence zzso zzso metabolism and that a deeper analysis of the effects of more extreme temperatures is needed to understand the possible effects of temperature changes on zzso zzso metabolism and zzso
