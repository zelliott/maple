A number of insects produce acoustic signals during zzso Genes involved in the control of the courtship song are particularly interesting from an evolutionary viewpoint because zzso variation in this signal is potentially important as a zzso isolation mechanism and, as a consequence, in the zzso zzso The cacophony gene was identified by a zzso affecting the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also produce acoustic stimuli during courtship and therefore cacophony can be used as an interesting molecular marker in evolutionary studies in these important disease zzso In this paper we have studied the molecular evolution of the zzso region of cacophony in zzso We compared the level of divergence in the zzso sequences zzso this zzso domain in zzso and zzso We also zzso the high level of variation in an zzso that is present in zzso but that was lost in zzso during zzso The available cacophony sequences were also used for a zzso analysis of some species of the zzso zzso zzso
