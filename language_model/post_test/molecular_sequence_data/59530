All zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso require zzso modification of their constituent zzso carrier protein zzso to become zzso zzso The inactive zzso are converted to their active zzso by zzso transfer of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso A to the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in each zzso carrier protein zzso The first zzso zzso to be cloned and characterized was the recently reported zzso coli zzso zzso responsible for zzso to zzso conversion of fatty acid zzso Surprisingly, initial searches of sequence databases did not reveal any proteins with significant zzso sequence similarity with zzso 

Through refinement of sequence alignments that indicated low level similarity with the zzso zzso zzso we identified two consensus motifs shared among several potential zzso zzso This has led to the identification of a large family of proteins having zzso % similarity with zzso which are putative zzso zzso Three of these zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and found to have zzso zzso activity, confirming that the observed low level of sequence zzso correctly predicted zzso zzso Three zzso zzso are now known to be present in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are specific for the zzso of fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso has not yet been zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of the zzso zzso 

The specificity of zzso and zzso for distinct zzso zzso suggests that each zzso zzso has its own partner zzso responsible for zzso to zzso zzso of its zzso carrier zzso This is the first direct evidence that in organisms containing multiple zzso zzso each zzso has its own zzso zzso zzso
