To identify the genes responsible for blood pressure in the spontaneously zzso rat strain, we performed a zzso analysis between the zzso and blood pressure in a set of male zzso rats obtained by zzso zzso with zzso rats, a parental zzso zzso Our investigation revealed that the zzso zzso 1 zzso which resulted in zzso zzso zzso with the lower blood pressure in zzso and that zzso 1 gene is located on zzso zzso On the other hand, we found the lack of zzso between blood pressure and the nerve growth factor zzso zzso which is linked to a zzso gene locus zzso as zzso on zzso zzso We propose that zzso 1 gene itself of closely linked gene on zzso 8 is a new candidate with the zzso effect, and that zzso locus does not directly contribute to blood pressure zzso in original zzso
