The participation of zinc in widely diversified biological reactions focuses attention on its zzso A number of its properties relate to its biological zzso and zzso Its zzso properties allow the zzso water to exist as a zzso or hydroxide zzso even at zzso Its coordination sphere is flexible and adapts to a wide variety of zzso allowing for a zzso of types and numbers of coordination complex zzso Its stable d shell zzso that it is neither oxidized nor zzso yet it zzso in zzso zzso reactions in coordination with an organic zzso X-ray zzso analyses of twelve zinc zzso now show that zzso zinc is bound by three protein zzso whereas structural zinc atoms are fully coordinated by four zzso Water is always a zzso to the zzso zinc while the protein zzso occur in an order of frequency of His zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso water is the critical component of the active zzso it is activated for zzso zzso by the identity and arrangement of the zzso coordinated to zzso Thus, ultimately, it is this water zzso which, upon entering the zinc coordination sphere, is activated either by zzso polarization or zzso As a result of the properties of this metal, zinc zzso and zinc proteins participate in a wide variety of zzso processes including zzso zzso protein and zzso acid zzso regulation and zzso
