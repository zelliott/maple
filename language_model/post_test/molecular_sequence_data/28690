zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary zzso Recent findings suggest that the major outer membrane protein zzso should be reconsidered as a vaccine candidate for zzso A zzso vaccine would require a relative degree of sequence stability of the gene zzso zzso zzso during zzso To characterize the sequence stability of zzso during colonization of the human respiratory zzso zzso genes from 13 sets of zzso that persisted in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso zzso 7 zzso were zzso In 9 sets of zzso zzso did not zzso zzso changes were noted in 4 sets of zzso Most of these changes occurred within areas of repetitive DNA, suggesting that this type of DNA has a role in zzso variation of zzso The sequence of zzso is relatively stable during persistence of zzso in the human zzso
