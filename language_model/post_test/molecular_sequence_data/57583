Using an in zzso zzso for segment identity, the structural differences that distinguish two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso There are at least two independent parts of zzso and zzso that contribute to their functional zzso zzso their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to their zzso zzso zzso In the absence of any zzso differences in 5 zzso domain zzso acids are sufficient to distinguish between the functions of zzso and zzso Two of these are at the zzso zzso of the zzso domain and could contact DNA zzso A three zzso model suggests that the other 3 zzso domain zzso and the zzso are unlikely to contact zzso In addition, we demonstrate that the zzso used to measure the segment identity functions of zzso and zzso is independent of any zzso zzso gene normally active in zzso and abdominal zzso zzso it is likely that this zzso measures the coordinate regulation of many downstream target zzso This expectation is confirmed for at least one zzso target zzso zzso
