Three zzso zzso zzso coordinated to calcium and zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso followed by tandem mass zzso Studies were undertaken to zzso the zzso charged metal coordinated precursor prior to zzso and zzso zzso The positioning of the zzso linkages between reducing and zzso rings could be determined in all three zzso and the linkage of the zzso ring was obvious in two of the three zzso when calcium was used as the zzso zzso The zzso radius and charge of the metal appear to be very important in obtaining structural information in these zzso
