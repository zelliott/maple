zzso zzso blood zzso has been used as an alternative source for zzso stem cell transplantation zzso in recent zzso However, delayed zzso recovery is frequently associated with CB zzso zzso zzso are the zzso precursors of zzso and they are among the zzso zzso cell zzso Despite the rapid expansion of our knowledge of zzso in recent years, many questions, such as the molecular regulatory mechanisms in zzso differentiation and zzso zzso formation and release, remain unanswered in zzso zzso Variations can be seen from the literature by individual investigators using different approaches for zzso differentiation and maturation zzso The development of in zzso culture methods to obtain sufficient numbers of zzso from readily available zzso stem cells is of value for both basic research and clinical zzso 

The zzso cells from zzso blood samples were cultured in zzso medium with zzso growth factors zzso such as zzso stem cell factor zzso and zzso zzso The differentiation of zzso was monitored using zzso and zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso The zzso of the cultured cells was studied by both light and electronic zzso zzso and zzso The involvement of the human zzso gene family members was studied by real zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of the cultured zzso was studied using flow zzso analysis for both zzso surface markers and zzso zzso zzso was assessed in the zzso fragments harvested from the zzso 

zzso zzso differentiation of zzso resulted from a zzso culture approach using zzso zzso and zzso for 7 days followed by zzso only for another 14 zzso zzso showed high-level expression of both zzso and its zzso zzso in the cultured zzso Limited levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in the cultured zzso The results also showed that the zzso fragments from the cultures responded to zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso marked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The methods used in this study are specific for differentiation of zzso from CB zzso cell, which can partially mature and produce functional zzso in zzso This approach for human zzso differentiation could be further zzso and may be adapted on larger scales for clinical zzso
