The zzso between zzso signatures at underground petroleum zzso and the structures of subsurface microbial communities was zzso For sediments contaminated with light zzso liquids, anomalous high zzso values have been zzso zzso changes in the zzso properties of the sediments were zzso with significant changes in the microbial community structures as determined by the construction and evaluation of zzso zzso gene zzso DNA sequencing of clones from four zzso zzso gene libraries from different depths of a contaminated field site and two libraries from an zzso background site revealed spatial zzso in the microbial community zzso zzso analysis showed that the presence of distinct microbial zzso including the various zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was a contributing factor to the elevated zzso zzso Thus, through their growth and zzso activities, microbial populations that have adapted to the use of petroleum as a carbon source can strongly influence their zzso zzso Since changes in the zzso properties of contaminated sediments parallel changes in the microbial community compositions, it is suggested that zzso zzso can be a zzso tool to guide zzso sampling for microbial ecology studies during the monitoring of natural or engineered zzso zzso
