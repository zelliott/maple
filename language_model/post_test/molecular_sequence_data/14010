We review the current state of knowledge of the molecular properties and actions of zzso zzso protein zzso both in cancer patients and in normal zzso zzso is a common product of zzso zzso and is the major zzso of the syndrome of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by its actions through zzso hormone receptors in bone and zzso Recently developed zzso and tissue zzso techniques indicate that zzso is produced by many more zzso than was originally indicated by clinical studies and that it contributes significantly to zzso zzso associated with other zzso for example, zzso zzso to bone and zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso is complex, with multiple zzso coding for up to 12 alternate transcripts and three different length zzso potentially in a zzso manner, by the use of three zzso Its expression is regulated by hormones and growth factors, and the untranslated zzso display features in common with many zzso zzso Although potential zzso actions of zzso are evident in fetal development, further evidence suggesting that the normal zzso role of zzso is predominantly as a locally produced zzso comes from zzso studies and investigations of its actions in a variety of zzso Such studies indicate that in addition to its zzso zzso actions, zzso has multiple activities, including those in fetal development, zzso calcium transfer, zzso smooth muscle relaxation, and on zzso cell zzso Although zzso was discovered because of its production by zzso evidence for its actions as a local regulator highlights the importance of understanding its roles not only in the zzso of zzso in cancer patients but also in normal zzso
