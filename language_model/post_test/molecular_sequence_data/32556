zzso zzso are zzso molecular zzso that provide the driving force for zzso zzso zzso light chain 1 zzso has been well studied in zzso zzso and is unique among all zzso components as the only protein known to bind directly to the zzso motor domain of the zzso heavy zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso assembly and/or function is unknown because no zzso have previously been zzso We identified an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and have investigated its role in zzso zzso zzso using zzso tagging and zzso zzso zzso is localized along the length of the zzso and partitions between the zzso and soluble zzso following zzso and salt zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression results in the complete loss of the dominant zzso beat that is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso emergence of a sustained reverse beat that zzso zzso and drives cell movement in zzso zzso analysis revealed that outer arm zzso are disrupted in zzso zzso Therefore zzso is required for stable zzso assembly and forward zzso in zzso zzso Our work provides the first functional analysis of zzso in any zzso Together with the recent findings in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso and specific functions of zzso components in zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso our data indicate functionally specialized roles for outer arm zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these differences will provide a more robust description of the fundamental mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and will aid efforts to exploit the zzso zzso as a drug zzso
