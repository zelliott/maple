It is demonstrated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso is a fast, highly sensitive, and zzso method for the zzso of zzso sites by zzso zzso zzso mass zzso We have analyzed zzso peptides of up to 25 zzso zzso and could distinguish even neighboring zzso zzso This method was also able to zzso and characterize zzso zzso the zzso zzso on zzso derived zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns were recorded in the positive zzso mode from the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso an overlapping sequence of zzso tandem repeats, which was zzso with zzso in zzso The zzso sites found were either zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso A single zzso spectrum of the zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to identify the zzso sites, thereby distinguishing six potential, partly zzso zzso zzso The zzso fraction was found to consist of a mixture of two zzso species with the same molecular zzso This was shown by the analysis of zzso zzso zzso of the resulting peptides right out of the zzso probe was sufficient to identify the zzso sites as either zzso or zzso zzso Beyond the methodical aspects the results revealed that in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a zzso system from human milk differs from that obtained with a breast cancer cell zzso zzso
