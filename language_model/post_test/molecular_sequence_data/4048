The zzso properties of zzso solutions had not been investigated since zzso initial zzso We recently reported that solutions containing zzso zzso develop color upon heating or zzso In the presence of zzso these solutions exhibit significant color changes which are easily zzso We zzso present strong evidence that the solution color is due to zzso ring opening and zzso The optical responses to zzso are due to zzso of the sugar with the zzso zzso We apply these zzso insights toward the challenging problem of the visual detection of neutral zzso by simple zzso In addition, we also report the first zzso X-ray crystal structure determination of a rarely observed zzso zzso zzso
