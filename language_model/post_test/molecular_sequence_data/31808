Central European salt zzso are mainly restricted to the maritime coast but scattered zzso can also be found zzso In inland zzso human activities have caused losses and reductions in the size of natural salt sites but have also created new anthropogenic zzso around zzso mining zzso zzso by zzso species in the last 30 zzso We aimed to investigate the effects of zzso isolation, and ongoing habitat fragmentation on the genetic variation of a species commonly growing in these special zzso 

We used 10 zzso markers to compare genetic diversity and differentiation of 31 populations of zzso zzso zzso from Central European coasts and inland zzso Two approaches were applied to analyze the zzso data based on zzso zzso directly derived from zzso data and from transformed zzso zzso 

In comparison to the coastal populations from the North Sea and the English Channel, significantly reduced genetic variation and increased zzso differentiation was revealed for populations from the German inland and the Baltic Sea zzso zzso structure analyses clearly separated coastal and inland zzso 

Our results indicate that gene flow is restricted among populations from inland salt sites and the Baltic Sea coast, presumably due to their isolation, small sizes, genetic bottlenecks and/or founder zzso zzso of zzso distribution indicate some occasional genetic exchange among habitat types in the zzso zzso salt sites may facilitate gene flow among inland salt zzso preventing endangered inland zzso populations from genetic zzso
