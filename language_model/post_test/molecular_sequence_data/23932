zzso zzso protein is a paradigm of tumor zzso zzso of zzso plays a critical role in the development of human zzso zzso an zzso frequently found amplified and zzso in a variety of human tumors and zzso directly interacts and zzso the zzso tumor zzso zzso In addition, zzso has been shown to stimulate zzso zzso activity and promote zzso entry independent of zzso yet the mechanism of which is still not fully zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso specifically binds to zzso zzso and that the central zzso domain of zzso is essential for zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso of zzso reduces zzso complexes in zzso Moreover, the zzso expression of the wild type zzso but not zzso zzso defective in zzso interaction, stimulates zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso growth suppression zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso likely contributes to zzso zzso zzso
