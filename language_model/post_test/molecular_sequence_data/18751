Two zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso composting zzso Based on zzso zzso gene zzso both strains belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was most closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso respectively), whereas strain zzso was most closely related to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso shared zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The fatty acid profile of strain zzso was dominated by saturated zzso and zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also contained considerable amounts of zzso The fatty acid profile of strain zzso showed a predominance of zzso zzso with smaller amounts of other saturated zzso fatty acids along with an zzso zzso Both strains contained zzso zzso and zzso as major polar zzso Additionally, strain zzso contained an unknown zzso and strain zzso two unknown zzso The diagnostic zzso acid found in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests also allowed zzso differentiation of the two strains from each other and from related zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso zzso and zzso properties, strains zzso and zzso represent novel species of the zzso zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
