Internal eliminated segments zzso are sequences that interrupt coding and zzso regions of zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso are flanked by short, unique repeat zzso which are presumably required for precise zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso and zzso segments of genes separated by zzso are called zzso zzso or zzso We have compiled the characteristics of 89 individual zzso in 12 zzso genes in the zzso and zzso zzso to define the zzso phenomenon precisely, a first step in determining the origin, function and significance of zzso Although all 89 zzso among the 12 different genes are zzso they show no other similarity in zzso zzso position or zzso Two main types of zzso are zzso zzso that separate scrambled zzso are significantly shorter and more frequent and have longer zzso repeat sequences than zzso that intervene between zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso gene zzso zzso binding protein in three species of zzso shows that even in the same gene zzso are not zzso in zzso zzso position, or number from species to zzso A comparison of zzso in the scrambled gene zzso zzso I in the three species shows that the evolutionary behavior of zzso in a scrambled gene may be more zzso However, zzso in the scrambled zzso I gene have shifted along the DNA zzso during zzso In total, the various studies show that zzso are zzso in sequence and zzso They zzso zzso and shift along DNA molecules more or less randomly during evolution, with no discernible function or zzso
