In a previous zzso analysis, we showed the recurrence of zzso involving band zzso and zzso gene regions in 20 out of 319 patients with zzso zzso zzso We report here the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso from tumor cells of a patient zzso with zzso and the isolation of DNA zzso which identify a major zzso cluster region zzso at band zzso A DNA library from zzso tumor cells was screened with a zzso probe and several clones were identified corresponding either to a zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso or to the zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso showed that zzso 3 material was zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso which was itself zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to investigate local DNA zzso in a series of NHL with zzso zzso zzso were detected in 13 of 17 patients including 9 of 11 with zzso 1 of 2 with zzso 1 of 2 with zzso and 2 of 2 NHL with zzso not involving an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The finding of this zzso should be useful for diagnostic and zzso studies and for the identification of a novel zzso at band zzso involved in the development of B cell zzso
