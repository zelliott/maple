zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to its alcohol, zzso and zzso acid in three successive zzso Each step involves zzso consumption of zzso and zzso and formation of CO2 and zzso Given the zzso of this zzso it was hoped that it would serve as a zzso for understanding the mechanism of this class of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters for zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been determined, and isotope effect analysis of zzso with zzso reveals zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The kinetic parameters for zzso zzso have been determined, and incubation of zzso and zzso with zzso reveals zzso removal of the zzso zzso No apparent isotope effect is observed in this zzso The zzso specificity of this zzso has been examined in zzso The zzso can catalyze zzso zzso of a zzso to a zzso and a zzso zzso of an zzso zzso bond, and zzso of a zzso to formaldehyde, as revealed through studies with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In each case, the products were identified by gas zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that one atom from zzso is incorporated into each zzso The zzso has also been shown to catalyze an zzso of zzso and zzso in the presence of a zzso analog incapable of undergoing zzso or a zzso that is difficult to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
