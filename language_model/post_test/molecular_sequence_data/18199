The zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was restored by zzso whether zzso applied or zzso produced by transformation of the zzso with a transfer DNA zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso alone did not zzso this zzso Similar transformation was not achieved for the parental zzso In the case of transformation with the zzso zzso selection of the transformed zzso was based on its zzso growth in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso indistinguishable from that of zzso genetic tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This altered zzso was caused by the presence and zzso expression of the zzso zzso The zzso and expression of this gene in transformed zzso was confirmed by using the zzso chain reaction zzso technique as well as conventional molecular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene led to an elevated level of zzso in the transformed zzso zzso This evidence supports the notion that genetic tumors are caused, at least in part, by elevated levels of zzso in zzso zzso
