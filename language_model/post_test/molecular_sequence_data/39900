The expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the canine zzso during the normal zzso cycle and in zzso with zzso was zzso Using zzso chain reaction analysis, zzso gene transcripts were detected in the zzso at all stages of the zzso cycle, with the highest levels in zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso it dramatically decreased from zzso to Day 10 of zzso zzso and stayed low at Day 35 of zzso and zzso this was consistent with blood zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were higher in zzso with zzso than in normal zzso zzso With zzso distinct zzso of zzso was detected in the zzso and zzso zzso cells of the zzso at zzso and zzso but little zzso was detected at Day 10 of zzso At Day 35 of zzso and zzso a partial and weak reaction was present in the same zzso In zzso with zzso the zzso zzso cells and many cells in the zzso zzso were strongly zzso zzso cells in the zzso were zzso similar to zzso No zzso zzso was seen in the zzso zzso cells or zzso in any zzso These results suggest that, in the canine zzso zzso expression is related to the blood concentration of estrogen, and that the dramatic reduction in zzso observed at the early stage of zzso may impair zzso zzso Also, enhanced expression of zzso zzso in the zzso with zzso may be associated with zzso invasion into the zzso to combat the zzso
