Although the zzso genes are known in zzso zzso and zzso zzso little is known in other zzso zzso are an attractive group of organisms for studying the evolution of sex determination because they show an amazing variety of mechanisms, ranging from environmental sex determination and different forms of zzso to classical sex zzso zzso or zzso systems and modifications zzso In the fish zzso zzso has recently been found to be the candidate male zzso zzso It is a duplicate of the zzso zzso zzso a gene acting in the sex zzso cascade of flies, zzso and zzso Because in birds zzso is located on the zzso both findings led to the suggestion that zzso is a zzso zzso with an even more widespread zzso However, although zzso was found to be the male zzso gene in the mouse and some other zzso species, in some it is absent and has obviously been replaced by other genes that now zzso the same zzso We have asked if the same might be true of the zzso zzso We find that the gene zzso generating zzso occurred recently during the evolution of the zzso zzso The gene is absent from all other fish species zzso zzso it may not be the zzso determining gene in all zzso
