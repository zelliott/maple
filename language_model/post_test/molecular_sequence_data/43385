The sea zzso zzso zzso collagen chain has a unique zzso structure with several repetitions of a still unknown zzso zzso module called zzso (for sea zzso zzso zzso To follow the expression of the zzso of the zzso chain and assign a function to this domain, we have zzso in zzso coli several zzso proteins corresponding either to the zzso or to the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso against these zzso proteins allowed us to observe a similar tissue distribution during the first stages of zzso A signal is first observed at the zzso stage as zzso spots in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is observed around the skeleton zzso and as a thin zzso surrounding the zzso zzso At the zzso level, and using zzso against the zzso gold particles are observed at the surface of 25 zzso thin periodic zzso By rotary zzso these zzso show a zzso zzso exhibiting at their surface numerous periodically distributed thin rods ended by a small zzso These data indicate that the zzso is maintained during zzso As previously suggested, the retention of the zzso could play an important role in regulation of the zzso zzso We propose that the important region of this zzso in the widely encountered zzso zzso is the short zzso zzso The zzso part of the zzso will not only restrict the zzso growth but also interact with other zzso components and playing, as suspected from our zzso studies, a function during the zzso of the sea zzso zzso
