The zzso zzso base pair of transfer zzso zzso zzso the sharp turn from the zzso stem to the zzso zzso This zzso base pair is important for the overall L-shaped zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequences shows that zzso is highly zzso However, variations of zzso are found in natural zzso This raises the question of whether all 16 permutations of zzso can be zzso by a single zzso sequence framework and by the bacterial zzso zzso Here we expressed the wild type and 15 zzso of zzso of an zzso zzso amber zzso in zzso coli and tested the ability of each to suppress an amber zzso We showed that 12 of the 15 zzso are functional zzso zzso and 3 are zzso zzso Of the 12 functional zzso the zzso zzso is the most efficient zzso whose suppression efficiency is indistinguishable from that of the wild zzso Analysis of zzso structure with chemical zzso and the zzso reaction, however, showed a distinct difference between the zzso zzso and the wild zzso Thus, two different structures of zzso coli zzso share an identical functional zzso in protein zzso The remaining 11 zzso zzso with reduced suppression efficiencies are likely to have other structural zzso We suggest that the variations of these zzso zzso are structurally and functionally zzso by the bacterial zzso zzso In contrast, the three zzso zzso harbor variations that alter the backbone structure in the corner of the zzso These variations are likely to reduce the stability of the zzso inside the cell or, among others, to interfere with the ability of the zzso to functionally interact with zzso factor Tu and with the zzso
