zzso snails of the zzso zzso group are one of four zzso species complexes responsible for the transmission of zzso in Africa and adjacent zzso The species status of these zzso variable and widely distributed zzso remains zzso and zzso zzso varies considerably amongst the zzso zzso zzso making zzso identification and differentiation important zzso for determining their zzso and evolutionary zzso Random zzso zzso DNA zzso analyses were used to investigate relationships between zzso with particular emphasis on Central and West African zzso zzso zzso were compared with those from other independent molecular zzso including partial sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso and the nuclear zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso 1 region zzso The zzso reconstructions from the three approaches were essentially zzso in that all methods of analysis gave unstable tree zzso or largely unresolved zzso There were large sequence divergence estimates between species, with few characters useful for determining relationships between species and limited within species zzso Nuclear and zzso sequence data from Central and East African representatives of the zzso zzso zzso showed little evidence of geographical zzso Despite the unresolved structure within the zzso specimens from the same species clustered together indicating that all methods were capable of zzso zzso but could not establish the zzso relationships with zzso The limited genetic variation displayed by zzso zzso and the evolution and zzso nature of the group, are discussed in the context of the increasingly arid climate of the late zzso and early zzso of zzso
