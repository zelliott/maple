zzso in the zzso zzso tumor gene zzso affect growth and structural properties of neural zzso and zzso discs during zzso zzso We have analyzed the cellular zzso of transcripts and a zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso using in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of maternal origin are detected in freshly laid eggs and are zzso incorporated into zzso zzso The protein is found at low levels in all embryonic zzso after zzso zzso In later stages differential expression of the protein is observed, particularly in cells of the nervous zzso The protein is located at the cell surface of zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso show zzso to a mouse protein that is localized at zzso contact sites in tissue culture zzso Moreover, zzso acid sequence zzso to deduced zzso acid sequences of members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family suggests that the zzso gene product may have properties of a zzso zzso
