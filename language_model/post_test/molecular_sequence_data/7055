In order to study the mechanisms involved in the zzso of zzso fetal bovine zzso in zzso cultures were treated with zzso acid, an agent known to modify the zzso zzso (10 zzso between day 2 to day 5 of zzso The synthesis of zzso and zzso proteins was studied by two-dimensional zzso in cell zzso and culture media after labeling with zzso for the last 14 h of zzso The proteins expressed in control and zzso zzso cells were identified by zzso after zzso zzso zzso of the spot or by zzso with specific zzso after two-dimensional gel zzso zzso protein modifications included one of zzso zzso and with an zzso point zzso of zzso whose synthesis was previously reported to be zzso by zzso zzso of two internal peptides did not reveal a known zzso Changes to the zzso zzso were also recorded in the culture zzso as a decrease in type II collagen synthesis and expression of the small zzso zzso Several new spots were also observed after treatment with zzso acid, including a large, diffuse spot, not yet zzso with a mean molecular mass of 39 zzso and a zzso of zzso Under our experimental conditions, zzso acid zzso zzso changes of the zzso and dramatic changes in the synthesis of several zzso and zzso proteins that zzso the synthesis of collagen type I (the classical marker of zzso zzso
