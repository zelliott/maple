To characterize a zzso zzso zzso isolated by zzso et zzso zzso 70 (1989) zzso and to adapt it as a convenient control element, we have zzso mapped the zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso determined that the zzso resulted in the loss of a zzso site in zzso due to a zzso transition, leading to a zzso zzso zzso removed extraneous zzso DNA downstream of zzso and zzso cloned zzso (in plasmids based on zzso of either zzso or zzso under control of the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso is insensitive to zzso The repression of zzso by zzso is very efficient at 30 degrees C and total induction was achieved at 42 degrees C, providing that the zzso zzso are not excessive and that zzso ratios are not too zzso
