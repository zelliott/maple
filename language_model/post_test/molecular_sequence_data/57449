A zzso of zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of zzso cells of carrot zzso zzso zzso by use of zzso sequences that zzso two internal zzso sequences of zzso (an zzso protein with a relative molecular mass of zzso A zzso Southern zzso using the zzso as probe suggested that there are at least two genes for zzso in the carrot zzso The zzso zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso and the deduced zzso sequence was found to share two zzso namely zzso and zzso with zzso protein from rice and zzso from barley and zzso The level of expression of these proteins has been reported to be high during late zzso and to be induced by a plant hormone, zzso zzso of zzso transcripts started 18 days after flowering and continued until maturation of seeds, but the levels decreased within 24 h after zzso zzso and its zzso were detected in the zzso and zzso zzso of mature seeds by zzso and in zzso zzso zzso application of zzso zzso zzso to carrot zzso did not induce expression of the gene for zzso while drought treatment induced the zzso of low levels of the zzso During zzso zzso the zzso were found at high levels in zzso cells and at low levels in zzso zzso at the torpedo zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso showed that both zzso and its transcripts were zzso localized in the peripheral cells of the clusters of zzso zzso In zzso zzso application of zzso resulted in increases in levels of zzso for zzso up to the levels in zzso cells, but no such increases were observed in zzso zzso zzso The pattern of expression of the gene for zzso during zzso zzso was basically the same as that of zzso another zzso zzso protein of carrot, the presence of which has been correlated with the zzso competence of cultured cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Plant zzso 95 (1991) zzso The various results together imply that a group of zzso genes is expressed in these zzso zzso
