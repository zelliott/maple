The potential for zzso that has been well documented in normal individuals implies that natural zzso responses must serve some zzso zzso To investigate the genetic mechanisms involved in the emergence of such responses, we have determined the sequences of heavy zzso and light zzso chain variable region genes for several human zzso zzso and compared these with corresponding sequences reported for other zzso and zzso Our data reveal that natural zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes which are essentially identical to V genes expressed in early B cell zzso as well as in some zzso zzso Taken together with other structural data on human zzso these findings suggest that natural zzso responses originate early in zzso and that such zzso may play a regulatory role in development of the normal immune repertoire and possibly in suppressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso
