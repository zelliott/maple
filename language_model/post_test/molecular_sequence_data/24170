To understand the molecular mechanism of zzso development, a zzso box zzso zzso 1 , has been isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso comparison showed that zzso 1 is highly zzso to both class C and D zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis suggests that zzso 1 is most likely a class D zzso box zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso 1 was exclusively expressed in the zzso zzso zzso 1 in transgenic zzso plants produced zzso zzso structures, including zzso indicating that zzso 1 is involved in the determination of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, during in zzso zzso no zzso 1 zzso was detected in the floral zzso at high level hormones in the zzso However, zzso 1 zzso accumulated in the floral zzso when the zzso flowers were transferred to the media containing low level hormones which could induce in zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the induction of zzso 1 by plant hormones may play important roles during zzso initiation and development in the zzso zzso Whether zzso 1 expression is also regulated by zzso and zzso during zzso development in zzso remains to be zzso
