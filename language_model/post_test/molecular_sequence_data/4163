We analyzed zzso mice showing behavioral defects such as severe zzso up-and-down and zzso wriggling of neck without zzso and found that the gene causing the defects was located between 46 and zzso zzso zzso on the mouse zzso zzso In this region, zzso transition of the plasma membrane zzso zzso 2 zzso gene was found, which caused a zzso acid to change into zzso Since zzso is expressed in the zzso and plays an important role to maintain the zzso of the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso the behavioral zzso can be ascribed to the impairment of zzso regulation in zzso of the zzso To confirm the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso mice, we measured high zzso changes in zzso zzso concentration zzso in the zzso zzso zzso to our zzso the extent of the zzso increase in all the regions tested in the zzso slice was far smaller than that of the wild type mice, while the resting zzso remained almost zzso The rate of rise in zzso during high zzso zzso was significantly reduced, and the zzso rate of increased zzso was also zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso channels were zzso in the zzso mice in order to regulate zzso toward the normal zzso The behavioral defects may be ascribed to the zzso zzso zzso since dynamic changes in zzso are important for various zzso zzso
