The zzso loop of the zzso zzso presenting zzso frequently zzso highly zzso and zzso bonded structure plays the central role in the virus biology and forms the principal target for zzso zzso and the major viral zzso for zzso zzso Here we present the zzso studies on the zzso structure of the zzso zzso A zzso loop zzso zzso in which its structurally inflexible regions and individual zzso acids were identified and the zzso analysis of zzso aimed at the informational support for zzso drug researches was put into zzso To this end, the following successive steps were carried out: zzso using the methods of comparative modeling and simulated zzso the ensemble of the low-energy structures was generated for the consensus zzso acid sequence of the zzso loop and its most probable zzso was defined basing on the general criteria widely adopted as a measure of the quality of protein structures in terms of their zzso folds and local zzso zzso the elements of secondary zzso structures in the built zzso were characterized and careful analysis of the corresponding data arising from experimental observations for the zzso zzso in various zzso strains was zzso zzso to reveal common structural motifs in the zzso zzso zzso regardless of their sequence zzso and medium zzso the simulated structures were collated with each other as well as with those of zzso zzso by zzso zzso and X-ray studies for diverse virus zzso in different zzso zzso with the object of zzso into the zzso features of the zzso loop, molecular dynamics trajectory was zzso from its zzso zzso structure followed by determining the structurally rigid zzso segments and comparing the findings obtained with the ones derived zzso and zzso to evaluate the masking effect that can occur due to interaction of the zzso loop with the two virtual molecules constructed previously by tools of zzso modeling and named zzso and zzso zzso molecular zzso of zzso with these molecules was implemented and zzso contacts appearing in the simulated complexes were analyzed to specify the zzso stretches keeping in touch with the zzso As a matter of record, zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso containing the highly zzso and biologically meaningful zzso of zzso were shown to retain their zzso main chain shapes in all the cases of interest presenting the forward-looking targets for zzso drug zzso From the data on molecular zzso synthetic zzso of the zzso and zzso peptides were suggested being suitable zzso for making a reality of the zzso zzso drug zzso
