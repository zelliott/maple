We have used an in zzso selection procedure called zzso zzso zzso zzso systematic evolution of zzso by exponential zzso to identify zzso sequences that bind with high affinity and zzso to the Rev protein from human zzso virus type 1 zzso A zzso zzso library zzso with the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso light in the presence of zzso Those sequences with the ability to zzso to Rev were zzso from the rest of the zzso pool, zzso and used for the next round of zzso zzso of zzso selection were zzso with rounds of selection for zzso sequences with high affinity to zzso This zzso zzso method yielded zzso molecules with zzso zzso zzso and high efficiency zzso to zzso Some of the zzso molecules isolated by this procedure form a stable complex with Rev that is resistant to zzso gel zzso in the absence of zzso zzso In zzso selection of zzso acids by using modified zzso allows the isolation of zzso acid molecules with potentially zzso chemical capacities to zzso attack a target zzso
