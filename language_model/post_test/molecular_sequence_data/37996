We have isolated a zzso zzso full length zzso zzso zzso zzso from mouse zzso The zzso was isolated by zzso using zzso designed from published zzso sequence of rat zzso with the addition of zzso zzso and 3' zzso sites, and cloned into bacterial expression zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso calculated zzso zzso zzso confirmed the identity of zzso zzso from mouse liver which has sequence zzso with that of rat and human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso # zzso was expressed in zzso in the presence of 1 zzso zzso at 30 degrees zzso The expressed zzso protein was found to be zzso in the bacterial membrane as determined by measuring zzso activity using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso We have demonstrated the cloning and expression of full length zzso for zzso from mouse liver and have zzso the functionally active product as zzso zzso These results should facilitate studies on the role of zzso in the regulation of chemical zzso and in the prevention of zzso stress caused by zzso and zzso zzso
