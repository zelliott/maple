zzso grown zzso derived from zzso zzso maintained at relatively low temperatures (4 degrees C, zzso acquire the competence to resume normal zzso In contrast, fully grown zzso derived from toads maintained at relatively high temperatures zzso degrees C, zzso never acquire maturation zzso By suppression zzso zzso we obtained 18 zzso preliminarily thought to be zzso expressed in zzso of these, zzso shared zzso with the human and mouse zzso zzso We cloned the full-length zzso zzso gene by zzso and identified three alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso transcribed and translated in zzso versus zzso likely resulting in differential zzso and/or zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso B2 was zzso transcribed at high and low zzso Taken together, this report of the differential expression of zzso zzso at different temperatures is the first evidence that temperature may influence and regulate zzso zzso
