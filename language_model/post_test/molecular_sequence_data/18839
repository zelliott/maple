The zzso is a zzso layer located at the zzso part of the zzso zzso It is involved in key zzso processes and its malfunction is related to several zzso To understand the function of the zzso a molecular level characterization is zzso In this article, we present large-scale zzso simulations that provide a comprehensive description of the structure and dynamics of the zzso We introduce the most detailed, zzso zzso zzso model, composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chains with realistic zzso Our results reveal the folding of zzso zzso and the extended zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we study the zzso response under zzso flow and its role as a zzso for binding zzso growth factors zzso which are involved in diverse functions related to cellular zzso including zzso zzso and wound zzso The simulations show that the zzso increases the effective concentration of zzso leading to zzso zzso and acts as a lever to transfer mechanical stimulus into the zzso side of zzso zzso
