zzso are the most crucial membrane proteins for the formation of tight and compact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso established and/or disrupted during various zzso and pathological zzso However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso contacts are not fully zzso In this paper, we report a novel functional role of zzso zzso 1 zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso we observed that zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso the zzso domain of zzso in zzso and in a cell culture zzso We show that the major zzso zzso site of zzso is zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso between classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to zzso at zzso contacts and has decreased adhesive zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso has weaker interactions with zzso and is zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is a novel negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso
