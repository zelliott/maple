We have analyzed the junction regions of inserted elements within the human zzso gene zzso This complex contains five genes which are expressed at high levels either in the zzso or in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso regions of these genes contain two inserted zzso A zzso zzso is located at a position 200 base pairs upstream of the first coding zzso All of the zzso genes contain this zzso The subsequent zzso of an zzso zzso interrupted the zzso zzso within its zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the inserted elements associated with each of the five human zzso genes has revealed a series of molecular events during the recent history of this gene zzso The data indicate that the entire gene family was generated during zzso evolution from one ancestral gene copy and that the zzso zzso activated a cryptic zzso
