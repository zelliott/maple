The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso of the mature zzso and zzso fragments were determined for preparation of synthetic zzso as zzso zzso for zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso which contained DNA sequences zzso to the zzso was cloned in zzso in zzso zzso The zzso sequence together with the determined zzso acid sequences revealed that this zzso consists of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and contains an zzso consensus sequence at its zzso zzso In front of the zzso start point, which is 28 bases upstream of the initiation zzso as determined by primer extension, zzso and zzso sequences similar to typical zzso promoter consensus sequences are zzso zzso coli zzso containing the zzso zzso gene just downstream of the zzso promoter in zzso produced a large amount of this protein when grown at 37 degrees C but in the zzso inactive form of inclusion zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso coli cells at temperatures below 30 degrees C led to production of active zzso (20 times as much as produced by the original zzso zzso zzso
