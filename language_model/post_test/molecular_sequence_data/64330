A number of bacteria were isolated from sea water in zzso Denmark, at 30 m zzso Two of the zzso strains zzso and zzso belonged to the zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes of the two strains indicated strongly that they belonged to the zzso zzso and that they showed greatest similarity to the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values, DNA base composition and zzso characteristics separated the zzso strains from the other species within zzso Thus, it is concluded that the strains belong to a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
