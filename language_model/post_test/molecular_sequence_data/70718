zzso zzso are double zzso motifs found in many proteins that play central roles in cell zzso Members of the zzso protein zzso family display two zzso zzso and are implicated in muscle zzso Here we describe the characterization of one member of this family, zzso in the zzso We have isolated and zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso We have determined by Northern analysis and in zzso zzso that zzso expression is zzso regulated in the embryonic mouse and displays organ specific regulation in zzso The gene zzso zzso is expressed in the smooth muscle cells zzso of the zzso zzso at zzso thus illustrating that zzso is an early marker for zzso differentiation at that zzso As development zzso zzso transcripts are observed throughout the zzso zzso with zzso transient expression detected in skeletal and cardiac zzso Interestingly, although several markers of mature smooth muscle are already zzso zzso expression in the zzso is not zzso until the onset of zzso expansion at embryonic day zzso at which time its expression becomes very zzso zzso expression persists into adulthood with prominent expression observed in both vascular and visceral smooth zzso The results reported here define zzso as a general marker of smooth muscle zzso
