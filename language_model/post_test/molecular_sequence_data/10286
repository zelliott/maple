zzso zzso from zzso mapping to zzso zzso yielded 6 zzso sequences that matched the human zzso zzso which encodes a tight zzso zzso One zzso sequence identified a zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso which contained zzso zzso zzso to the originally reported zzso zzso zzso zzso A portion of this novel zzso sequence matched an additional trapped zzso sequence which was obtained from the most zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene thus lies in a zzso direction on zzso Only three zzso from a large zzso zzso zzso with zzso thereby assigning the zzso gene to a 40 zzso region immediately zzso to gene 59 and the zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso end of the zzso clone has a potential initiation zzso with a strong zzso sequence and Northern zzso analysis detected a zzso zzso signal in most human zzso indicating that zzso may be a complete zzso zzso Based on the trapped zzso zzso twelve zzso boundaries were zzso
