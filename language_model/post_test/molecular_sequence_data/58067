We observed that decline of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso faster than the zzso of full length zzso zzso during growth arrest of zzso mouse zzso or during differentiation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to study the molecular mechanism of this disparate behavior, a zzso zzso against mouse zzso was raised in zzso High level expression of mouse zzso zzso in zzso coli was achieved with a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso Using the zzso in zzso no indication for a pool of inactive zzso was found during differentiation of zzso or growth arrest of zzso zzso Pulse labeling of these cells in zzso with zzso showed a more than zzso decrease in the rate of zzso synthesis of in zzso cells after 3 days of treatment with zzso acid as well as in zzso cells after 16 h under low zzso This was not due to increased turnover of the protein as measured in pulse chase zzso In addition, full length zzso zzso stayed associated with zzso under these conditions in zzso as well as zzso zzso Taken together the results suggest that zzso zzso zzso becomes zzso zzso under a variety of conditions when mouse cells cease to zzso
