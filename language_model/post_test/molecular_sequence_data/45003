The alternating zzso and zzso stages of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from its zzso fish and aquatic zzso zzso respectively, were compared for sequence zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso similarity between the sequences of these two stages was substantially greater than that of zzso zzso compared to two other zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our results are the first molecular evidence confirming the alternating zzso initially described by Wolf and zzso zzso for the life cycle of zzso zzso but found in two different zzso classes zzso and zzso are indeed forms of the same zzso zzso of zzso genes of the zzso stage followed by development of specific zzso for DNA amplification of the zzso stage, as in our study, should be applied to solve other zzso life zzso Additionally, these approaches will in the future provide useful diagnostic zzso for the detection and study of this important group of fish zzso
