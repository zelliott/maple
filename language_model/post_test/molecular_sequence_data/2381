While studying the organization of the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso on zzso zzso we identified a novel zzso unit located only zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso end of the zzso zzso This gene has been zzso named zzso The unusual proximity of these two genes led us to investigate the pattern of expression and sequence characteristics of the new gene for comparison with those of zzso zzso was found to have transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The zzso transcript was expressed at low levels in all zzso zzso whereas the zzso transcript was detected only in the cerebral zzso and the brown zzso zzso and zzso are not zzso zzso as evidenced by the characteristics of their expression in several zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence of zzso bases isolated from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library had a large open reading frame of 461 zzso acids at one end followed by zzso zzso of sequence with multiple stop zzso zzso used to search the protein and zzso acid data bases detected no significant sequence similarity to any other protein or zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA using the zzso zzso as a probe indicated that zzso is a zzso gene in the mouse zzso and that it is zzso in humans, rats, and zzso This conservation of gene sequences suggests that zzso encodes a protein with an important cellular zzso
