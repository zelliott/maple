zzso calcium zzso entry zzso is a vital zzso signaling zzso in zzso as well as zzso excitable cells, regulating countless zzso and zzso zzso zzso interaction molecules zzso are the principal regulating molecules of zzso sensing changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and directly interacting with the zzso channel zzso to orchestrate the opening of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent atomic resolution structures on human zzso and zzso have illuminated critical mechanisms of zzso function in zzso further, the first high-resolution structure of the zzso zzso zzso channel has revealed vital data on the atomic composition of the zzso channel pore and the assembly of individual zzso zzso This chapter focuses on the zzso information garnered from these high-resolution structures and the supporting zzso zzso and live cell work that has enhanced our understanding of the relationship between zzso and zzso structural features and zzso channel zzso
