The zzso zzso for zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The gene contains zzso zzso that translate in a single reading frame to give a predicted zzso acid zzso zzso The translated zzso contains a single potential zzso site, a readily identifiable zzso family signature, and has highest zzso to chicken zzso by zzso tree analysis and sequence zzso It lacks a signal zzso in common with other known zzso zzso and lacks a clear ICE zzso cut site in common with other zzso zzso genes zzso to zzso zzso was used to study sites of zzso transcript zzso 24 h following injection of zzso zzso zzso was detected in the brain, liver, zzso and zzso with expression weakest in the brain and strongest in the zzso No transcript expression was zzso following injection of zzso Northern zzso analysis was used to zzso the induction of zzso expression in zzso following in zzso or in zzso stimulation with zzso The results are discussed in relation to the potential role of zzso in zzso immune zzso
