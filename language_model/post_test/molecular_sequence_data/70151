Two complementary DNA zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso two distinct zzso of mouse zzso protein zzso beta zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso Although mouse zzso is zzso to the rat zzso zzso reported previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cohen, zzso Campbell, zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso It was strongly suggested that the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso of a single zzso The difference in the zzso acid sequences between zzso zzso and zzso was observed only at the zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli cells were zzso to an zzso beta zzso and exhibited zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso activities with similar zzso zzso Although the zzso of zzso zzso was expressed zzso in various mouse zzso that of zzso zzso was expressed exclusively in brain and zzso These results suggest the difference in the zzso roles of these two zzso zzso
