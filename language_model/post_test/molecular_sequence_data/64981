zzso zzso is a recently identified disease associated with zzso in zzso or zzso Typically, the illness presents with lower limb muscle weakness slowly spreading to involve zzso zzso zzso zzso and respiratory zzso zzso zzso is often combined with zzso zzso by zzso blocks and zzso resulting in premature sudden zzso Sections of the affected skeletal and cardiac muscles show abnormal zzso areas containing zzso zzso deposits seen as zzso or zzso material on electron microscopic zzso zzso for zzso is positive in each region containing abnormal zzso The inheritance pattern in familial zzso zzso is zzso dominant or zzso zzso but many cases have no family zzso At least some, and probably most, zzso zzso zzso cases are associated with de zzso zzso zzso Age of disease onset and rate of progression may vary depending on the type of inheritance and location of the zzso zzso Multiple zzso have been identified in the zzso zzso point zzso zzso small zzso deletions and a larger zzso zzso The majority of these zzso are located in zzso zzso segments of zzso Many of the zzso zzso result in changing the original zzso acid into zzso which is known as a zzso zzso Studies of zzso cell cultures indicate that zzso zzso is zzso and able to disrupt a pre-existing zzso network in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in humans or transgenic mice cause zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and other zzso zzso zzso serves in the muscle as a zzso preventing zzso zzso under various forms of zzso If zzso zzso may cause a zzso similar to those resulting from zzso zzso zzso genetic testing of patients for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso genes is now available and necessary for establishing an accurate diagnosis and providing appropriate genetic zzso Better understanding of disease zzso would stimulate research focused on developing specific treatments for these zzso
