In this work, to explain doping behavior of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso we applied a combined zzso approach, zzso zzso zzso was modeled by molecular dynamics simulations, and the lowest energy zzso was confirmed by density functional theory zzso On the basis of the resulting structures of the hybrid materials, electronic structure and transport calculations were zzso We demonstrate that zzso stacking of the aromatic zzso and zzso zzso backbone to the zzso surface in zzso have a role in the zzso These results are consistent with our experimental observation of the zzso zzso even after a zzso zzso zzso Upon substitution of three of the aromatic zzso to Ala in zzso a considerable decrease from zzso is observed zzso demonstrating zzso as compared to the zzso device, yet not explained based on the zzso MD simulation zzso To gain a qualitative understanding of zzso zzso over a longer simulation time, which may differ from aromatic zzso acid zzso swift zzso on the surface, we analyzed zzso zzso simulations performed for 500 zzso zzso of the Ala zzso from the surface was shown zzso which could in turn affect charge transfer, yet a full explanation of the mechanism of zzso will require zzso of differences between various aromatic zzso as dependent on zzso zzso and inclusion of effects of the zzso and environment, to be considered in future zzso
