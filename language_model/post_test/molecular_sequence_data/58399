The structural integrity of the zzso gene in several zzso lines of zzso zzso was tested by Southern zzso analysis using a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone of Alcohol zzso zzso as a zzso One line, zzso III, showed evidence of a spontaneous zzso zzso zzso to the adult zzso in an area previously indicated as a putative zzso zzso zzso The inserted zzso was present at an approximate frequency of 50% in relation to the zzso zzso zzso zzso lines were constructed of both zzso zzso and zzso flies, allowing the comparison of a spontaneous zzso zzso zzso and it's direct zzso ancestral zzso The inserted sequence is a 296 zzso zzso truncated jockey zzso zzso The sequence and distribution of the element as well as it's proximity to the zzso gene are zzso
