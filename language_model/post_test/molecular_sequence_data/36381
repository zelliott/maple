A modified zzso chain reaction zzso was developed to introduce random point zzso into cloned zzso The modifications were made to decrease the zzso of zzso zzso during DNA synthesis without significantly decreasing the level of amplification achieved in the zzso The resulting zzso products can be cloned to produce random zzso libraries or transcribed directly if a zzso promoter is incorporated within the appropriate zzso zzso We used this method to zzso the gene that encodes the zzso zzso with a zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per position per zzso as determined by sequence zzso There are no strong zzso with respect to the type of base zzso The number of zzso per DNA sequence follows a zzso distribution and the zzso are randomly distributed throughout the amplified zzso
