A complementary DNA zzso for the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated with the use of a DNA probe generated in a zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso based on zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso As would be predicted from the zzso zzso the zzso consists of a zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso domain displaying an internal repeat structure characteristic of members of the zzso zzso zzso family, and a zzso region containing seven zzso zzso This zzso region displays sequence similarity with all members of the G zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene may have evolved by zzso of zzso and G zzso zzso zzso zzso engineered to express zzso zzso bind human zzso with high affinity and show an increase in zzso zzso zzso when exposed to zzso As revealed by zzso zzso analysis and in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is prominently localized in the rat zzso
