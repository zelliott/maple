zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso influences a diverse array of biological zzso including cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso are associated with multiple zzso cervical zzso and zzso zzso To identify proteins that interact with zzso and which may mediate zzso zzso a zzso zzso screen was employed using the zzso zzso domain of zzso as zzso We identified the adapter protein zzso as an zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate binding of the zzso beta zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta was observed when zzso with activated zzso zzso such as the zzso activated zzso zzso or the strongly activated zzso zzso both associated with human zzso zzso The extent of zzso zzso of zzso beta zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso are required for optimal binding of the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso We also demonstrate the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso by activated zzso which increases in response to zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our results identify zzso beta as a novel zzso binding partner that mediates signal zzso
