zzso factors are modular entities built up of discrete zzso some devoted to DNA binding and others permitting zzso zzso The structure of DNA binding zzso has been thoroughly investigated and structural classes clearly zzso In sharp contrast, the structural constraints put on zzso regions, if any, are mostly zzso Our investigations focus on zzso a zzso zzso factor of the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso with distinct functional features: zzso lies in the first 72 zzso acids of zzso while zzso sits in the last zzso Here we show that zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso for it activated zzso in zzso cells, while zzso did zzso zzso contains a 20 zzso acid stretch predicted to form an zzso that is found unchanged in the related zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that a 32 zzso acid zzso encompassing this region is zzso in water but folds into a zzso when the zzso zzso zzso is zzso The isolated zzso was sufficient to activate zzso and zzso predicted to disrupt it dramatically affected zzso zzso whereas zzso decreasing its acidity had more gentle zzso A zzso zzso within the zzso was particularly sensitive to zzso Finally, we observed that zzso bound zzso via zzso and bound zzso and zzso presumably via other zzso zzso
