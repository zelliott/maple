The gene product of the zzso zzso gene is a member of a family of zzso zzso proteins that are involved in diverse cellular zzso The zzso protein zzso was shown to perform an essential function in the zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso causing a zzso zzso protein sorting zzso zzso as demonstrated by the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Y zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a single point zzso resulting in an zzso acid exchange at position zzso from Ala to zzso The zzso is located downstream of the zzso zzso motif found in the zzso half of the zzso The observation that expression of zzso zzso partially suppressed the zzso zzso sorting zzso indicates competition of a zzso zzso zzso protein and a functional zzso zzso for a zzso site of an as yet unknown zzso protein sorting zzso
