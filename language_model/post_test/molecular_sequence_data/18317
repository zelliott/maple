In zzso conversion of zzso zzso to a soluble form zzso creates a potent inhibitor of complement zzso by both the classical and alternative pathways by zzso the zzso zzso In the rat zzso zzso model, zzso significantly suppresses complement zzso at the zzso surface of zzso and zzso This suppression of complement zzso is accompanied by reduced zzso of zzso within the zzso zone, perhaps because of reduction of the generation of zzso which promotes expression of zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso In addition, formation of the zzso attack complex, which may contribute to direct zzso injury, was suppressed by zzso The zzso of complement zzso and zzso zzso by zzso explains the observed significant reduction in zzso necrosis after zzso and zzso These studies have identified zzso as a potential agent for therapeutic intervention in diseases associated with zzso tissue zzso
