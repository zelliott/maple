Human zzso zzso zzso from newborn zzso zzso express zzso zzso zzso and protein after completing at least zzso zzso 40 population zzso of their in zzso life zzso This zzso in turn zzso the synthesis of specific proteins in aging zzso To determine whether zzso expression may be promoted by in zzso aging, we analyzed the expression of zzso and of zzso zzso in zzso from two normal individuals 55 and 92 years old and in zzso from a patient with premature aging caused by zzso zzso By reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we detected expression of zzso alpha and beta zzso and protein in early passage zzso from both normal individuals and the zzso syndrome zzso These zzso also expressed the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso inhibitor type 2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that an zzso expression of zzso occurs either in zzso or after a few cell divisions in zzso zzso the zzso zzso is modified by the expression of zzso genes during zzso
