The zzso of zzso and zzso beta zzso were isolated from Atlantic zzso zzso The isolated genes in zzso showed zzso and zzso identities with zzso and zzso beta of other zzso and zzso and zzso with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso models of zzso zzso and zzso beta were constructed using the currently known X-ray zzso structures of human zzso beta and zzso zzso as zzso zzso quantitative zzso protocols were developed and validated to measure zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was higher in the zzso of zzso zzso than that in zzso individuals, whereas zzso zzso showed an opposite trend with substantially higher expression in zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso 1 and zzso body zzso in zzso fish significantly decreased zzso but increased zzso zzso expression in the zzso In zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso while zzso replacement suppressed the elevated zzso On the other hand, zzso or zzso with zzso replacement did not significantly alter zzso zzso in the same experiment consistent with similar lack of effect on circulating zzso levels in zzso described zzso This finding together with the existing evidence for zzso negative feedback on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggests that the negative feedback mechanism does not involve zzso of zzso zzso or protein and may be limited to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
