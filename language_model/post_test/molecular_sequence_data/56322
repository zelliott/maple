Recently an zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso recognition protein 1, has been discovered which binds to specific DNA structural elements such as the bent, zzso zzso that occur upon the formation of zzso zzso by the zzso drug zzso The zzso family includes the mouse protein zzso which recognizes zzso signal zzso In order to delineate functional zzso more zzso a zzso of zzso was cloned from zzso zzso This zzso maps to zzso region zzso zzso and shares zzso identity with human zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences among zzso family members reveals zzso identity, with structural conservation in the zzso zzso of the zzso box as well as zzso of highly charged zzso Interestingly, however, the most highly zzso regions of the protein are in the less well understood zzso zzso strongly suggesting that this portion of the protein is critical for its zzso
