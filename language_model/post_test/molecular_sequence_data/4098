Comparative zzso has proved useful for investigating biological responses to past climate change and is strongest when combined with zzso hypotheses derived from the fossil record or zzso However, the rarity of species with zzso zzso explicit fossil evidence restricts the application of this zzso Here, we develop an alternative approach in which spatial models of predicted species zzso under serial zzso are compared with a molecular zzso in this case for a snail endemic to the zzso of North Queensland, zzso We also compare the zzso of the snail to those from several endemic zzso and use zzso across all of these approaches to enhance zzso zzso for this rainforest zzso The snail zzso zzso is consistent with predictions from zzso modeling in relation to the location and size of zzso zzso through the late zzso and broad patterns of extinction and zzso There is general agreement between quantitative estimates of population expansion from sequence data zzso likelihood and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The snail zzso represents a composite of both common and idiosyncratic patterns seen among zzso reflecting the geographically finer scale of persistence and subdivision in the zzso In general, this multifaceted approach, combining zzso explicit zzso models and comparative zzso provides a powerful approach to locating historical zzso and understanding zzso responses to zzso
