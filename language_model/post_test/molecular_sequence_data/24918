The zzso house zzso by zzso zzso is among the most complex zzso structures constructed by any zzso This structure allows the zzso to exploit a wide range of food particle sizes, including zzso and zzso zzso establishing them as an important and abundant component of marine zzso communities throughout the zzso The zzso zzso a zzso of cells covering the trunk of the animal, is responsible for zzso of the zzso The zzso has a fixed number of cells, organized in distinct fields, characterized by defined cell shapes and nuclear zzso Certain structures in the house appear to be zzso linked to these different fields of zzso Using zzso representation difference analysis zzso zzso on whole animals at two different zzso stages separated by the zzso zzso event, we isolated four families of genes zzso that are expressed only from specific zzso of the zzso zzso The molecular patterns defined by zzso gene expression establish the zzso as an ideal and easily accessible zzso cellular template for exploring coordinate regulation of gene zzso zzso interactions involved in pattern formation, zzso amplification, and the role of zzso changes in nuclear architecture in regulating gene zzso
