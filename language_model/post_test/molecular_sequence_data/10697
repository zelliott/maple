The generation of zzso zzso has been observed in a variety of cellular zzso The zzso that mediate synthesis are the zzso zzso zzso that form a family of structurally diverse zzso with distinct zzso zzso In this paper, we describe the cloning of a novel human zzso namely zzso zzso which contains a zzso C2 zzso This zzso can be assigned to the class II zzso which was defined by characterization of the zzso zzso zzso and includes the recently described zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the overall similarity in the zzso acid sequence of the zzso and human zzso which suggests that they are zzso by closely related zzso these molecules show marked sequence zzso at their zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso alpha demonstrates a restricted zzso zzso zzso As reported for other members of this class, the zzso only zzso zzso and zzso when the lipids are presented zzso However, when lipids were presented together with zzso acting as a carrier, zzso of zzso was also zzso The zzso activity of zzso alpha is zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso which inhibit the zzso activity of other family zzso The comparative zzso of zzso alpha to these zzso suggests that their use should be reevaluated in the study of zzso
