In response to zzso zzso of the brine shrimp zzso zzso are able zzso to zzso metabolism to levels low enough to permit survival for several years at room zzso In addition to dramatic decreases in free zzso levels and heat production, zzso pH drops from zzso to zzso zzso Use of isolated zzso to study zzso responses to zzso offers several zzso zzso the localized nature of transcript zzso processing and degradation, all of which may be followed in zzso zzso the relatively simple zzso and zzso involved and zzso the ability to provide relevant zzso treatments in zzso In response to zzso incubation of zzso in zzso for 4 h followed by zzso zzso isolation and zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso a significant decrease in overall zzso incorporation zzso was seen after 30 zzso relative to zzso pH zzso zzso A less severe zzso of zzso under zzso zzso was observed compared with controls when pH was raised to zzso Similarly, under zzso the incubation at low pH zzso reduced zzso by zzso zzso protection zzso showed that the contribution of in zzso initiation during the zzso fell from zzso at pH zzso to approximately zzso at pH zzso under either zzso or zzso zzso DNA zzso of putative zzso promoters revealed proteins at regular intervals upstream of the zzso zzso in the control region, which previously had been indirectly zzso to contain promoters for zzso zzso The area between 1230 and zzso contains a sequence in the zzso gene believed to bind the zzso termination factor zzso or zzso and we provide the first evidence that this sequence is zzso in zzso zzso However, our hypothesis that initiation is reduced at low pH because of a change in DNA binding by zzso zzso factors was not zzso We propose that regulation of initiation may be zzso by zzso modification or by zzso interactions not detected by zzso
