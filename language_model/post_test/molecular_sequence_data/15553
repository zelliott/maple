The zzso protein zzso zzso has been implicated in a variety of cellular zzso such as transcription, processing of edited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso details of these functions are not yet zzso Tudor zzso have previously been shown to bind zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso It has been suggested that the role of zzso in zzso may involve binding to such zzso zzso or to the zzso zzso cap of zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the extended Tudor domain of zzso from zzso zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso zzso secondary chemical shifts, relaxation data, and residual zzso zzso indicate that the solution and crystal structures are zzso zzso of various zzso was investigated by zzso zzso sites and affinities were characterized by chemical shift zzso We show that the aromatic cage of the Tudor domain specifically binds a zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso while the same zzso zzso zzso zzso does not show significant chemical shift zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso over zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, two zzso cap zzso with different zzso patterns, as well as zzso zzso and zzso show no zzso Our data demonstrate that the Tudor domain of zzso specifically recognizes zzso zzso The aromatic cage of zzso is very similar to the one in the Tudor domain of the survival of motor zzso zzso which also recognizes zzso zzso indicating a zzso binding motif for this zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso tails of zzso zzso proteins suggests how zzso may interact with small nuclear zzso particles during the regulation of zzso
