zzso zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso protein involved in different zzso processes including zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have previously identified zzso as an zzso protein present in zzso zzso that binds to a specific approximately 100 zzso region in the zzso region of zzso and its zzso zzso In the present study, we show by zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance analyses that the zzso site of zzso resides in its domain zzso Furthermore, the interaction of full-length zzso with the zzso region of zzso zzso is zzso By contrast, the interaction is zzso for the isolated domain IV of zzso suggesting that the zzso site is masked in zzso and gains exposure through a zzso zzso change of zzso generating a zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction is specific and involves zzso C and D in domain IV of zzso since point zzso of several charged and polar exposed zzso of these zzso in the full-length protein strongly reduce zzso zzso The interaction appears to be sequential involving an initial phase of recognition dominated by zzso zzso most likely between zzso zzso and the zzso backbone of zzso followed by a second phase contributing to the specificity of the zzso
