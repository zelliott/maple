zzso differences between native zzso and in zzso transcribed zzso zzso coli zzso were explored by comparing their zzso profiles as a function of zzso zzso concentration and by probing their solution zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In zzso transcribed zzso has a less ordered structure as monitored by zzso melting zzso its zzso is appreciably lower than that of native zzso at all zzso zzso zzso probing experiments with zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that the unmodified zzso transcript is more susceptible to zzso attack at low zzso zzso particularly in the zzso and zzso indicative of at least a partial disruption of zzso zzso These experiments also provide evidence for zzso alternative zzso of the zzso loop of native zzso zzso zzso are essential for the stability of these zzso they cannot be detected in the unmodified in zzso zzso The observations suggest that zzso modifications in zzso allow the adoption of unique zzso and act to stabilize those that are biologically zzso
