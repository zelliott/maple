The complete zzso sequences of four zzso zzso zzso virus zzso like zzso were determined and used to analyze the zzso position and zzso of these zzso The results indicate that all zzso show a typical zzso genetic zzso Despite an average zzso zzso zzso they show strong zzso with only three regions of significant zzso zzso in the internal and 3' zzso regions and variable zzso half of the coat protein zzso zzso comparisons using the zzso zzso and zzso genes provide a conflicting zzso picture, with divergence level in the Pol and zzso genes suggesting the existence of a single or of two species, zzso However, a range of considerations argue that all four zzso should likely be considered as belonging to the zzso zzso zzso is closely related to Apple stem pitting virus and could be considered a sister species to it, with zzso being specialized to zzso members of the zzso family and zzso members of the zzso Analysis of selection pressures affecting the five open reading frames of zzso and zzso identified two regions under strong zzso selection, that coding for the zzso zzso half of the zzso and the gene coding for the first protein of the triple gene block zzso
