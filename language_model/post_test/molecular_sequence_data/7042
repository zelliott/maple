Human nuclear zzso zzso zzso protein content in cells suggests that zzso expression is zzso zzso Analysis of the 3 zzso promoter zzso which is required for high level zzso revealed an extraordinary zzso several zzso motifs are located in the vicinity of the first zzso but the closest zzso boxes are several hundred zzso zzso Four zzso type repetitive sequences are in the promoter zzso Within these zzso sequences there exist zzso repeat zzso which could form two mutually exclusive types of DNA zzso structure consisting of zzso DNA and zzso resembling zzso zzso a zzso element would be moved to spatial vicinity of the zzso site zzso the zzso zzso analysis showed the functional significance of these racket zzso We also obtained evidence for DNA racket structures when we studied zzso mechanisms in a human zzso zzso zzso deficient zzso One of his zzso zzso a novel complex type of zzso zzso Based on several highly zzso sequence features in this zzso region a model is proposed for the generation of this unusual type of zzso involving two steps: an initial targeting step and a subsequent complex zzso This process includes the formation of a DNA racket structure, which resembles that of the zzso zzso Thus we conclude that DNA racket structures seem to be of general importance in zzso
