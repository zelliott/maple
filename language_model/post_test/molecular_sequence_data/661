We describe a new zzso zzso found infecting the zzso zzso of the zzso fish zzso zzso zzso from the South Atlantic coast of zzso Light zzso scanning and transmission electron zzso and zzso data were zzso Numerous irregular zzso zzso zzso covered by numerous zzso containing different stages of zzso including free spores, were observed in zzso zzso spores, on average zzso zzso long, zzso zzso wide and zzso zzso thick, were formed by 2 zzso valves, each possessing 3 to 4 zzso 5) elevated zzso which projected from the zzso portion of the zzso and joined along a sinuous zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion of the valves bore a bundle of 33 to 37 extended tapering zzso filaments attached to the zzso portion of the last zzso and zzso portion of the zzso edge of the 2 zzso The zzso zzso formed of material similar to the valves, were attached to the shell wall by a zzso zzso The spores contained 4 zzso zzso polar capsules zzso zzso zzso zzso located at the same level, each with a polar filament with 6 zzso 7) zzso zzso zzso was irregular in shape, with a zzso zzso and dense bodies randomly distributed in a light zzso Based on the shape and dimensions of the zzso on the number, position and arrangements of the surface zzso zzso bundle of zzso polar capsules and polar filament arrangements, as well as zzso analyses using the small zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso we propose the name zzso zzso for this new zzso
