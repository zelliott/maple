zzso zzso by members of the zzso gene family are predominantly expressed on zzso natural killer zzso zzso Several members of this gene family have been demonstrated to inhibit zzso cell zzso upon recognizing their class I zzso on target zzso In this report, we present data supporting that not all zzso proteins inhibit zzso cell zzso Our laboratory has generated and characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso that can be used to recognize the zzso subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with known members of the zzso gene family revealed that zzso recognizes zzso but also zzso with the zzso protein on B6 zzso zzso In addition, zzso demonstrates zzso by both zzso and zzso flow zzso analysis with an zzso cell subset that is distinct from those expressing zzso C, or zzso An zzso subset of zzso cells that did not express zzso C, and zzso was isolated and examined for their functional zzso zzso targets and zzso A zzso zzso from a variety of zzso zzso were examined for their zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso None of the major zzso complex class zzso targets inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso More importantly, we demonstrate that the addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells can augment zzso of zzso gamma zzso target cells in a reverse zzso cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain of zzso does not contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso motif found in zzso C, or zzso that has been characterized in the human zzso killer zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first member of the zzso family characterized as zzso positive signals to zzso cells, rather than zzso zzso cell zzso
