In zzso zzso the zzso gene is required for repair of X-ray and zzso DNA damage during zzso growth, and for zzso complex formation and genetic zzso during zzso We show below that the zzso gene encodes major and minor transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in length which differ primarily at their zzso zzso zzso levels of both zzso transcripts increase zzso during zzso reaching zzso levels midway through zzso zzso about 3 or 4 h after transfer of cells to zzso zzso The zzso ends of the major zzso transcript in both zzso and zzso cells map to the same cluster of sites approximately 20 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of the zzso coding zzso We conclude that the increased zzso transcript level observed during zzso does not reflect zzso of a new zzso In contrast, zzso levels of zzso protein do not increase during zzso Thus, changes in zzso transcript levels are not necessarily accompanied by commensurate changes in zzso protein zzso zzso explanations are zzso
