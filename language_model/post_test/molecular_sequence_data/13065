Human zzso protein extracts were examined for zzso activity on a defined zzso pair DNA zzso containing a single, zzso zzso plus long wavelength ultraviolet zzso zzso side or zzso side zzso or zzso zzso These extracts produced incisions on both the 3' and zzso sides of each of these zzso The distance between the 3' and zzso incisions at sites of a zzso side zzso or zzso was 9 zzso and at sites of a zzso side zzso or zzso it was 17 zzso zzso on the 3' side of both types of zzso side and zzso side zzso were similar and were either at the fourth or fifth zzso bond from the zzso zzso depending upon the zzso However, greater differences were observed between sites of zzso zzso This incision occurred at the fifth and sixth zzso bonds from the zzso zzso at sites of zzso side zzso and zzso respectively, and at the 13th and 14th zzso bonds at sites of zzso side zzso and zzso zzso Thus, direct analysis of sites of zzso incision reveals that the location of sites of incision on zzso zzso depends upon the type of zzso zzso
