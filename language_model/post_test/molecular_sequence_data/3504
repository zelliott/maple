zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are an important class of bacterial factors termed zzso that are found in tuberculosis and zzso Although their structures are well established, little is known with respect to the molecular aspects of the zzso machinery involved in the synthesis of these zzso On the basis of sequence similarity to other zzso and our previous studies defining an zzso from zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso the zzso we have identified a related gene from zzso tuberculosis zzso now designated zzso The use of a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the synthesis of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso established the identity of the new zzso zzso product as zzso zzso the zzso The results indicate that zzso encodes an zzso involved in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the production of higher zzso zzso and zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the existence of redundant zzso or an alternate zzso that may compensate for this zzso zzso Further zzso which compared the distribution of zzso in a panel of zzso tuberculosis zzso revealed that zzso was present in only zzso of the clinical zzso zzso
