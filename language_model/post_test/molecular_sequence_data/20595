The advances in zzso zzso have paved the way for the study of social communication processes at the gene level, in particular the expression of zzso zzso The queen zzso zzso zzso provides an excellent model system, in that zzso of the zzso fatty acid zzso zzso appears to be reduced to a single chemical zzso step of zzso zzso Queens are typified by zzso as opposed to the zzso zzso We hypothesized that this zzso is the consequence of differential expression of zzso genes that code for fatty zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies disclosed two candidate proteins zzso and zzso We thus investigated the expression of these genes in the zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The real-time zzso results revealed that zzso zzso was expressed at high levels in both zzso and zzso workers, whereas in queens its expression was zzso The expression of zzso zzso on the other hand, was high in the queen's zzso and negligible in those of zzso zzso In zzso workers, however, the expression of zzso was considerably elevated and significantly greater than in zzso zzso zzso structural models constructed for these zzso demonstrate differences in the active site between zzso and zzso in line with their differential zzso zzso The fact that queen zzso plasticity can be tracked all the way to gene expression provides a new insight into the process of zzso differentiation and the accompanying social zzso
