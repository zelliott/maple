A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which stained zzso but showed the typical cell wall structure of zzso bacteria, was isolated from an zzso zzso filter treating zzso zzso in zzso The strain, designated zzso grew at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at pH zzso zzso pH zzso It did not require zzso for growth, but was able to grow in the presence of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate and zzso were not used as terminal electron zzso zzso zzso used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as electron zzso The main zzso products from zzso metabolism were zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and a summed feature consisting of zzso and/or zzso and the major zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso Although the closest zzso relatives of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene sequence showed that strain zzso was not a member of the zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso properties, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as the type strain of a novel species in a new zzso within the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
