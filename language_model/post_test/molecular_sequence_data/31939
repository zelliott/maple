The spread of zzso proteins may occur in many neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso zzso the only zzso proteins in which high specific biological zzso can be produced zzso Using a system that generates infectious zzso de zzso from zzso zzso zzso and conversion zzso zzso zzso and zzso we examined by zzso exchange mass zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso changes that occur during prion zzso We found that initial incubation with zzso causes major structural changes in zzso involving all three zzso zzso and one zzso zzso with subsequent addition of zzso rendering the N zzso highly zzso Final conversion into the infectious zzso form was accompanied by globally decreased zzso exposure, with persistence of the major zzso zzso zzso Thus, we report that zzso molecules appear to induce major structural zzso during prion formation, initiating a dynamic sequence of zzso changes resulting in biologically active zzso
