The effects of zzso colon zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso in rats were zzso Additionally, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats and on normal zzso zzso in zzso rats were zzso As an index of the cell proliferation the incorporation of zzso zzso into cell zzso was zzso It was found that the zzso significantly suppressed the proliferation of the zzso zzso in normal, zzso zzso However, it failed to suppress the cell proliferation of zzso zzso zzso or zzso and produced only a slight, statistically insignificant decrease of the zzso zzso index in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the process of zzso might zzso zzso the local negative control of the zzso cell proliferation exerted by zzso zzso
