The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso component I was zzso identified by deletion analysis and zzso It encodes a predicted zzso of 497 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso Its primary structure shows zzso identical zzso acids with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso and only zzso with that of zzso zzso The zzso usage of the zzso genes zzso the most zzso zzso differs greatly indicating selection for zzso acid zzso The zzso are clustered in the zzso 200 zzso acids of the sequences indicating that this part is important for zzso zzso
