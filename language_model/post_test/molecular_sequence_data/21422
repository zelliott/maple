Although the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been extensively characterized in terms of structure and function, similar zzso of the zzso tail zzso of zzso zzso remain relatively limited and zzso The current study was designed to examine in detail zzso sequence conservation relative to zzso and the zzso zzso and to examine the conservation of predicted zzso and structural properties across a number of divergent zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso sequences display intermediate levels of sequence evolution and diversity in comparison to the more diverse zzso and the more zzso zzso zzso Despite the relatively high level of zzso sequence variation, the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso are evidently highly zzso across zzso Additionally, predictions using zzso indicate a high level of structural similarity in the LLP regions that was confirmed by circular zzso zzso of secondary structure of LLP peptides from zzso B, C, and group zzso zzso demonstrate that LLP peptides adopt zzso structure in the presence of zzso or zzso but are predominantly zzso in zzso zzso Thus, these data for the first time demonstrate strong zzso of characteristic zzso zzso and structural properties despite substantial sequence diversity, apparently indicating a delicate balance between evolutionary pressures and the conservation of zzso structure and associated functional roles in virus zzso
