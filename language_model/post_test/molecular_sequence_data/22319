zzso factors enhance the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso zzso to rescue arrested zzso complexes and are thought to zzso the high zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso factors insert the extended zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso secondary channel to position two zzso zzso zzso at the zzso tip near the active site to stabilize the zzso metal zzso zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso rather than activates zzso zzso Here we report the structure of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso A resolution revealing a zzso architecture closely resembling that of zzso However, the zzso orientation is zzso distinct zzso 162 degrees zzso between the two zzso In contrast to zzso which has two zzso zzso on a well fixed zzso zzso the tip of the zzso zzso is flexible and contains four zzso zzso This difference is likely the key to the zzso functional diversity, while zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhances only the zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso stabilize the zzso zzso active center in a zzso inactive zzso through zzso zzso The excess of the zzso zzso and inherent flexibility of the zzso tip might allow zzso to adjust its activity to structurally distinct zzso thereby zzso diverse zzso reactions of zzso zzso
