We examined the expression and function of a gene we previously cloned from its zzso in a muscle zzso zzso The zzso protein was named zzso because of sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso its restricted expression in skeletal muscle zzso and its modulating properties on vascular zzso cells described zzso We investigated the expression of zzso in muscle fibers and cultured muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in muscle fibers and their zzso zzso zzso of zzso fused to a zzso zzso showed evidence of a muscle cell surface zzso zzso functions were assessed from similarities with zzso zzso experiments using zzso mouse zzso or zzso which zzso zzso zzso with zzso mouse cardiac vascular zzso cells revealed that zzso had a very active role in the invasive action of zzso cells, without any evidence of zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be a muscle zzso factor operating through direct zzso zzso This role is consistent with the correlation between zzso in zzso expression and modifications in muscle zzso associated with zzso muscle mass zzso
