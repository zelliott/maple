Alternative zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso results in three distinct molecular forms of 121 or 165 zzso zzso acids that are released in the zzso medium of cultured cells and one longer zzso of 189 zzso acids zzso that remains zzso zzso has been expressed in wild type zzso cells and in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It could be released from zzso cell zzso by zzso or a synthetic zzso designed on the sequence zzso by zzso 6 but was freely released from zzso zzso zzso In both cases, the zzso zzso was mainly released as a zzso zzso form, provided that the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso zzso zzso was zzso from insect cells infected with a zzso zzso as a zzso zzso precursor that binds to the zzso zzso but not to zzso It could be matured by zzso as a zzso zzso able to bind to zzso and to trigger cell zzso zzso and zzso however, could be zzso by zzso as zzso fragments that exhibit a decreased zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso domain of zzso masks its binding domain to zzso
