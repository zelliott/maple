Our laboratory recently isolated a zzso for zzso zzso zzso a zzso highly zzso zzso zzso from zzso of the high zzso zzso of zzso rats zzso et zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso zzso studies using a specific zzso probe for zzso zzso indicated that equivalent amounts of zzso zzso were present in zzso of both the high and low zzso zzso and zzso of male zzso Fischer zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we isolated one full-length and one nearly full-length zzso clone coding for the zzso form of zzso zzso from a zzso library constructed from zzso from a zzso male zzso zzso The longest zzso had an open reading frame of zzso zzso which coded for a zzso zzso acid zzso of Mr zzso Although the zzso leader sequence and the zzso region were zzso the coding sequence of the zzso zzso differed from that of the zzso isolated from the zzso zzso by nine bases zzso These base changes would result in seven zzso acid differences between the protein sequences for the two zzso Two specific zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing three base differences between the zzso and zzso sequences zzso zzso to zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
