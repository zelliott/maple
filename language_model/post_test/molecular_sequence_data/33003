zzso zzso zzso a zzso transition from zzso to zzso in response to a variety of stimuli and growth zzso We previously isolated a zzso domain containing zzso factor zzso which is essential for zzso development in zzso zzso To search the putative binding partner of zzso in zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso a functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso which also contains a zzso motif at its N zzso zzso zzso zzso can interact with zzso via the zzso motif by in zzso zzso The results of a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that more zzso and zzso proteins bound to the upstream zzso sequence region of zzso promoter in zzso cells than in zzso cells, and the increased binding of each of these two proteins responding to zzso induction was dependent on the zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a profound zzso in zzso development and the induction of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso functions as an zzso in zzso development of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso can bypass the requirement of zzso in zzso formation, whereas zzso of zzso failed to promote zzso growth in zzso zzso In zzso we show that the expression level of zzso increases during zzso zzso and the enhanced expression of zzso may contribute to cooperative binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso
