zzso of the beta zzso of the zzso calcium channel zzso from human skeletal muscle and zzso zzso libraries, and from human zzso libraries, were isolated using a human skeletal muscle beta 1 zzso probe generated by zzso chain zzso The skeletal muscle beta 1 zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 523 zzso acids that is zzso identical to the rabbit skeletal muscle zzso Two different zzso beta zzso and beta zzso were obtained from the human zzso zzso The beta zzso transcript encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that is identical to the skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso except for an internal region of 52 zzso zzso The beta zzso transcript encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The beta zzso zzso is identical to the beta zzso zzso at zzso acids zzso however, it has a unique 152 zzso acid zzso zzso Like beta zzso it differs from beta zzso at the internal 52 zzso zzso Analysis of the beta 1 gene structure demonstrates that these three zzso represent transcripts zzso by a single beta 1 zzso zzso from the beta 1 gene were detected in zzso from skeletal muscle, heart, zzso and brain, but not in zzso from liver, stomach, or zzso
