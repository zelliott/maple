Human zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is a zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso that rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso and possibly zzso in zzso and, by regulating these potent zzso is thought to prevent tissue damage at inflammatory zzso The zzso gene zzso was characterized by amplifying zzso regions using zzso zzso zzso positions of zzso were found to be zzso to zzso positions in the genes for the zzso molecules chicken zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso genes in general have widely different organizational patterns, the shared organization of these genes strengthens the evidence that they form a zzso or family, the zzso zzso zzso zzso By amplifying DNA of a zzso cell hybrid panel, zzso was zzso localized to zzso zzso The use of a panel of radiation and zzso cell hybrids specific for zzso 6 refined the zzso of zzso to the short arm zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at zzso Another zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the same region, thus defining an zzso locus on zzso 6 in addition to the previously defined zzso zzso locus on zzso zzso
