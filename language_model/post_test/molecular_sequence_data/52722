The zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate signal zzso pathways via interactions with downstream zzso zzso We report here the solution structure of zzso bound to the zzso binding domain of zzso an zzso of both zzso and zzso The structure is compared with those of zzso bound to similar fragments of zzso and zzso two zzso proteins that bind only to zzso The zzso of all three zzso fragments bind in an extended zzso to strand zzso of zzso and contact zzso zzso and zzso The remaining zzso bind to switches I and II of zzso but in a significantly different zzso The structure, together with zzso data, suggests reasons for the specificity of these interactions and provides insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso
