The human zzso zzso protein is toxic in both human tumor cells and zzso zzso Previous studies indicated that most of this toxicity is dependent on an interaction of zzso protein with the zzso class of regulatory zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso and in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso We have found previously that zzso zzso zzso activity against at least some zzso In an attempt to understand the mechanism of this zzso we used a genetic approach to identify zzso in the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso required for zzso zzso In both cases, zzso zzso composed only of blade 1 and at least part of blade 2 were found to bind zzso and zzso blocked zzso toxicity in zzso Furthermore, certain zzso acid zzso in zzso 1 and 2 within full-length zzso and zzso resulted in loss of zzso zzso Recent zzso analysis has suggested that segments of zzso 1 and 2 present on the top face of zzso form part of the zzso zzso Additionally, these segments are in close proximity to the zzso C zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso binding could affect the access of zzso resulting in the failure to zzso some zzso zzso
