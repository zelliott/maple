zzso zzso zzso positive zzso are poorly responded to different kinds of zzso Gene vaccines are promising in research of gene zzso for these zzso In this study, a zzso gene vaccine with zzso as an immune zzso was constructed into a zzso zzso for zzso zzso so as to explore zzso a new zzso strategy against zzso 

Using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso was obtained from a large zzso zzso zzso its zzso protein was compared with the zzso presented in zzso using the protein analysis zzso The acquired zzso zzso zzso was linked to zzso zzso via an zzso site and cloned into the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was estimated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso measurement zzso 

The zzso sequences of the target gene fragments of the zzso zzso were zzso The acquired zzso sequence is highly zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso sequence of zzso is zzso with the original zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso signal zzso sites, secondary structure and zzso structure of the acquired zzso protein were similar to the original proteins of zzso and zzso predicted by the protein analysis zzso zzso showed the zzso could steadily express zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in zzso cells in zzso 

The zzso zzso was obtained from the tumor tissue and the zzso gene vaccine with zzso zzso was constructed zzso It has provided a possible method for zzso against zzso positive zzso in zzso
