zzso zzso is a special zzso zzso only distributed in Southern China, with a few exceptions in zzso It is a cherished element used in traditional Chinese zzso In order to produce a global panorama of gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was constructed, and zzso high quality zzso end expressed zzso tags zzso were zzso and zzso The initial sequences were assembled into zzso zzso Of these zzso only zzso clusters matched known sequence and zzso had no match to any known sequence in zzso Except for putative cellular proteins zzso zzso the remaining 118 clusters zzso of all zzso corresponded to sequences associated with diverse toxin zzso According to expression zzso the major toxin components were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and other components including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules zzso and other proteins zzso The majority of these components are thought to be responsible for zzso after zzso zzso zzso We have therefore generated a comprehensive catalog of the zzso zzso zzso zzso described so zzso Gene expression from the very specialized zzso zzso especially for those involved in zzso can be surveyed and provide important information in finding novel zzso
