zzso zzso receptors zzso containing the zzso gene product can influence a range of cellular events in zzso depending on zzso zzso On chick zzso zzso the receptors are concentrated on zzso zzso but little is known about mechanisms responsible for zzso them zzso zzso is a zzso protein essential for zzso zzso receptors at the zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed previous studies showing that the chick zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso including several zzso zzso lacking part or all of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso shows that chicken full-length zzso can induce zzso of both muscle and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking one or both zzso zzso motifs of zzso 2 are unable to cluster the zzso though, like full-length zzso they cluster zzso zzso analysis demonstrates the presence of full-length zzso in chick muscle extracts but fails to detect either full-length or zzso versions of zzso at significant levels in zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso does not cluster zzso on zzso zzso in any way similar to that of receptors at the zzso junction where zzso and the receptors are present in approximately zzso zzso
