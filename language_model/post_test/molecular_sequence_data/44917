We have recently cloned a novel zzso initially identified in human zzso and hence previously called zzso A close examination of the overall protein structure reveals three main zzso four zzso zzso encompassing the zzso and central part of the deduced zzso a zzso motif overlapping the third domain, and the zzso domain in the zzso end region of the protein zzso We propose to call it zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso according to its specific zzso zzso To get further insight into the function, a Northern zzso analysis was performed in order to determine the site of expression in various adult zzso a zzso zzso transcript appeared only but strongly in mouse zzso The structure of the zzso brain zzso was determined through molecular zzso human and mouse deduced proteins are highly zzso with zzso overall zzso acid zzso zzso brain serial sections zzso with zzso and zzso zzso revealed identical distribution in discrete cerebral regions, such as zzso zzso region and zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso selectively localized in the zzso density of scattered zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis, a main expression in nervous system and preliminary assignment of the human gene in a critical region for zzso suggest that zzso may be of importance in neural development and neurodegenerative zzso
