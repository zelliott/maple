Human T cells recognize self and foreign zzso when such zzso are processed into small peptides and bound to molecules coded for by genes of the zzso region on zzso zzso The part of the zzso surface which is responsible for such recognition is a set of molecules coded for by a variety of genes and known as the zzso zzso In animal models, T cells are able to transfer zzso zzso and T cells have, therefore, long been implicated in the zzso of human zzso zzso disease zzso Information gained from the study of zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso clones has shown that in patients with zzso disease, mainly helper zzso clones have been zzso whereas in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones may be zzso Such zzso zzso T cells have now been shown to recognize one or other of the three major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso and efforts are currently in progress to characterize the zzso zzso of these major zzso zzso Recent findings of restricted zzso zzso V gene use amongst zzso T cells confirm the primary role of T cells in human zzso zzso processes leading to zzso However, the mechanisms zzso such zzso T cells escape deletion and zzso and how they become zzso remain zzso There is compelling evidence that the zzso cell itself, by expressing zzso zzso and presenting zzso directly to the T cells, may initiate disease, perhaps after an external zzso
