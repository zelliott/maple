In order to understand the role that zzso plays during development of the Mediterranean fruit fly zzso zzso zzso a major agricultural zzso we have cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso and studied its expression and its binding properties to an zzso response zzso Using the zzso DNA binding region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 zzso as a probe, we isolated a zzso zzso clone containing the coding region, a part of the zzso region and the complete zzso region of a zzso The deduced zzso zzso contained all five zzso typical of a nuclear zzso zzso comparisons and zzso analyses indicated that zzso most closely resembled the B1 zzso of zzso and Lucilia zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to all other known zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene is mapped in the region zzso of the zzso zzso arm, while Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts have a size of approximately 8 zzso zzso levels of zzso transcripts were detected in eggs, middle and late zzso late third zzso larvae and middle zzso The levels of the zzso transcripts during the other zzso stages as well as during zzso and adult stages were much lower, while during the early stages of zzso were very zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso binds specifically to the zzso zzso zzso response element as a zzso with zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso Our structural and zzso data suggest that zzso is the functional zzso of the B1 zzso of zzso
