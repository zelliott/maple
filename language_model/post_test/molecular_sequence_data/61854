zzso Danish zzso zzso is a rare neurodegenerative disorder, which is zzso characterized by widespread cerebral zzso zzso zzso protein deposits and zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso a zzso zzso between zzso 265 and zzso in the 3' region of the zzso gene originates an zzso zzso named zzso 11 zzso longer than the zzso zzso produced from the normal zzso zzso zzso deposits have been found widely distributed in the zzso of zzso zzso The deposits of zzso are predominantly zzso zzso We show here that synthetic zzso forms zzso in zzso seen by zzso and gel zzso and higher zzso which are seen by atomic force zzso and electron zzso as zzso objects that bunch zzso Here we report that zzso zzso is toxic to zzso cell zzso We find that the soluble zzso zzso species of both the reduced and oxidized forms of zzso are zzso These results support the idea that the zzso soluble zzso are the zzso species, which may play a central role in the zzso of zzso and imply that similar mechanism may also be involved in other neurodegenerative diseases associated with zzso zzso
