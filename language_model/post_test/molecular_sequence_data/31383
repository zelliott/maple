zzso is shown to generate an zzso toxin from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by an unusual zzso zzso Seven specific zzso are shown to occur in an ordered sequence starting at the zzso of the zzso and proceeding toward the zzso zzso At each step, zzso fragments of approximately 10 zzso are produced and rapidly zzso to small zzso The sequential zzso ends with a zzso toxin which is resistant to further zzso However, the toxin could be specifically split into two fragments by zzso as it unfolded under zzso zzso zzso zzso the toxin at zzso zzso to give a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Similar fragments could be generated by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso domain predicted from the zzso sequence analysis of toxins from various subspecies of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso is the predicted zzso sequence zzso A zzso transition was observed for the toxin by differential scanning zzso consistent with two or more independent folding zzso It is concluded that the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso are two zzso regions which give unique structural and biological properties to the zzso
