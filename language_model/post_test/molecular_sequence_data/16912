The zzso zzso is the master zzso of the zzso zzso and a global regulator of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso coli K-12 strain zzso contained an zzso zzso sequence element in the regulatory region of the zzso zzso Another stock of zzso was obtained from the zzso coli zzso Stock zzso This stock contained zzso which were poorly zzso and had no zzso element upstream of the zzso zzso From these zzso zzso zzso were identified after extended incubation in zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives contained an zzso element zzso upstream of the zzso promoter, and swarm rates were zzso higher than that of the original zzso For a zzso zzso levels of zzso transcript had increased zzso leading to a zzso increase in zzso transcript and a zzso increase in zzso expression from a promoter probe zzso A collection of commonly used lab strains was screened for IS element zzso and zzso Five strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained zzso elements upstream of the zzso promoter at either of two zzso This correlated with high swarm zzso Four other strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not contain IS elements in the zzso regulatory region and were poorly zzso zzso extension determined that the zzso start site of zzso was zzso by the IS element zzso We suggest that IS element zzso may activate zzso of the zzso zzso by reducing zzso zzso
