We have found conditions for zzso zzso by restriction zzso zzso integration that result in zzso tagging of disrupted zzso Using this method we selected for zzso in genes that act at checkpoints downstream of the zzso zzso system that controls zzso in zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso is a member of the zzso protein zzso cascade family while the other, zzso is a novel zzso gene zzso to response regulators in one part and to zzso zzso zzso in the other zzso zzso of either of these genes results in partial suppression of the block to spore formation resulting from the loss of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The products of the tag genes have zzso zzso of zzso zzso attached to zzso zzso suggesting that they process and export zzso zzso Together, these genes outline an zzso communication system that coordinates zzso shape with cellular differentiation during zzso
