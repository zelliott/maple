zzso of the zzso zzso patch are sites of B cell proliferation and of diversification of the primary zzso repertoire in zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso zzso particles released in the zzso space in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso patch of zzso contain DNA protected with a zzso zzso We named these particles zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso from a suspension collected from zzso zzso patch zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso membrane is resistant to several zzso and zzso zzso alone, but can be disrupted by a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso indicates that they contain zzso zzso of zzso DNA with zzso pair restriction zzso produces zzso suggesting that individual zzso contain unique zzso Nonetheless, the size of zzso DNA is smaller zzso 16 zzso than that of lamb zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and sequence analysis of zzso DNA reveals the presence of light and heavy chain variable genes as well as zzso zzso The data demonstrate the presence of DNA in these zzso zzso and suggest a role of zzso in transfer of DNA between cells within the zzso zzso zzso This raises the possibility of a novel form of communication between cells zzso by zzso zzso
