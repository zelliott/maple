We have studied V alpha 2 and J beta usage by V beta zzso peripheral T cells isolated from the zzso mice strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso of V beta zzso T cells present in adult zzso mice differed from those in zzso zzso the fraction of V beta zzso cells using the J beta zzso segment was reduced, while the number of V beta zzso T cells using J beta zzso was zzso These results indicate that the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso in recognition of the zzso zzso We also found that in zzso mice an increased fraction of V beta zzso T cells expressed the V alpha 2 zzso The study of J beta usage by V beta zzso alpha zzso and V beta zzso alpha zzso T cells indicates that both J beta segment and zzso V alpha 2 chain expression zzso complementary protection against deletion by zzso zzso These results suggest a novel view of zzso selection, where the zzso region of the V beta chain zzso zzso recognition, and the zzso of the zzso complex determine the fate of the T zzso
