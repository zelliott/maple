zzso zzso zzso zzso is a very stable zzso zzso This zzso can be converted into a stable zzso protein zzso by replacing the zzso interface loop zzso by a zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso shows that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are at the zzso interface in zzso zzso have acquired rather different structural zzso Nevertheless, zzso has residual zzso zzso 

Three new structures of zzso of zzso are zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the presence and absence of bound zzso and a zzso zzso in the presence of a different zzso These new structures show large structural zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the structures with inhibitor bound, the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso adopt zzso similar to those observed in zzso zzso but very different from the zzso zzso 

The residual zzso activity of zzso can now be zzso In the presence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso adopt zzso similar to those seen in the zzso zzso These zzso lack zzso flexibility in zzso zzso The data suggest that the rigidity of these zzso in zzso zzso resulting from zzso contacts at the zzso zzso is important for optimal zzso
