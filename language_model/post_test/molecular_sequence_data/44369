The entire zzso sequence of the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of the sequence indicated that 14 zzso designated zzso through zzso are involved in the formation of the zzso thin zzso zzso products of eight zzso genes were identified by the zzso zzso The zzso product was shown to be a zzso by an experiment using zzso A computer search revealed that several zzso zzso genes have zzso acid sequence zzso with proteins involved in type IV zzso zzso protein zzso and transformation zzso The zzso and zzso products were suggested to be zzso for the zzso thin zzso and the zzso product appears to be a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso thin zzso belongs to the type IV family, specifically group zzso of zzso The requirement of the zzso and zzso genes for zzso liquid mating was demonstrated by constructing their zzso zzso zzso of three type zzso zzso zzso systems, the zzso system of zzso the zzso zzso zzso system of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso system of zzso zzso coli, suggests that they have evolved from a common ancestral gene zzso
