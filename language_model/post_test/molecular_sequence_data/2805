A gene in zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso abortion zzso equivalent to the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso virus zzso has been identified by DNA zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso to zzso map zzso contained an open reading frame flanked by appropriate control elements and was capable of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso This had 50 to zzso identity over a zzso zzso acid zzso region with the zzso gene products of zzso and three other zzso and 20 to zzso identity with those of human zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence predicts a long signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sites, and has identified a probable internal zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso open reading frame appears to be overlapped at its zzso end by 135 zzso of the 3' end of an upstream open reading frame the potential translation product of which has approximately 50% identity with zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso gene 30 zzso
