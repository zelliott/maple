The protein zzso is an immediate downstream target of Ras in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The complex of Ras with the zzso domain zzso of zzso has been zzso by zzso to the zzso complex, and both have been subjected to multiple molecular dynamics simulations in zzso While both complexes are stable, several zzso occur in the zzso zzso the zzso loop zzso moves closer to zzso zzso in the zzso moves towards Ras to form a salt bridge with zzso and zzso 4 of the Ras switch II region shifts zzso toward the zzso The zzso interactions (including the zzso zzso are consistent with available zzso and zzso data on the zzso zzso complex in zzso The Ras switch II region does not interact directly with the zzso although indirect interactions exist through the zzso domain and bridging water zzso No large-scale zzso motion is seen in the zzso complex, compared to the zzso complex, to suggest an zzso zzso of zzso by zzso This may be because the zzso zzso domain (whose structure is zzso is not included in the zzso
