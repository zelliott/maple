The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso present in bovine milk that have been studied for over a century and whose structures remain zzso Here we describe the chemical synthesis and structure zzso of the zzso segment zzso of bovine zzso the protein which maintains the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by highly zzso zzso zzso zzso chemistry and zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso was carried out by circular zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso CD analysis demonstrated that the segment was ill defined in zzso medium but in zzso zzso it exhibited considerable zzso zzso Further, zzso analysis showed the presence of a zzso segment containing 26 zzso which extends from zzso to zzso This is the first report which demonstrates extensive secondary structure within the zzso class of zzso
