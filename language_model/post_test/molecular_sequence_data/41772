The zzso sequence of a 19,000 base pair region from the left arm of zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been determined and zzso It covers the zzso zzso already zzso As expected zzso zzso and zzso genes have been found and six new open reading frames zzso with a coding capacity of more than 100 zzso acid zzso have been zzso One of them zzso shows a high degree of identity with an zzso zzso zzso This raises the question of a second zzso zzso gene in zzso A second zzso zzso shows features compatible with a zzso zzso The other zzso do not show a similarity with any known zzso A member of the highly repetitive zzso DNA sequence is zzso
