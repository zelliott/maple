The zzso zzso zzso of a series of zzso zzso peptides that differed by the position of an internal zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso of these peptides produced both doubly and zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso fragmentation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had better efficiency than that of the doubly zzso zzso producing a higher abundance of product zzso at lower collision zzso The product zzso zzso of these zzso zzso zzso were dominated by a series of doubly charged zzso and the amount of sequence information was dependent on the position of the zzso zzso In the peptides where the zzso was located towards the zzso of the zzso a more extensive series of sequence specific product zzso was zzso As the position of the zzso zzso was moved towards the zzso of the zzso systematically less sequence information was zzso The peptides were subsequently modified with zzso to manipulate the product zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group to the zzso and zzso zzso shifted the zzso charge state of the modified zzso to the doubly zzso zzso These zzso zzso fragmented zzso producing product zzso zzso that contained more sequence information than could be obtained from the corresponding unmodified zzso
