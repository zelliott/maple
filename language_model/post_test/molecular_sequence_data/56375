zzso strain zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of a newborn infant from New Delhi who had no symptoms of zzso The strain could not be P typed using the zzso method recently developed in our laboratory so we have zzso the 4th gene segment that encodes the zzso protein using viral transcript zzso prepared in zzso This gene is zzso base pairs in length and codes for a protein zzso zzso acids long which begins with a zzso initiation zzso at zzso 11 to 13 and ends with a single termination zzso at zzso zzso to zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso protein of this strain is zzso by zzso segment zzso This gene is closely related to the zzso gene of the bovine zzso strain zzso type zzso at both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso levels, but is unique from those of strains from P types 1 to zzso The close zzso of the zzso proteins of strains zzso and zzso is demonstrated by the zzso acid composition of the potential zzso zzso sites and their zzso zzso the size of the zzso fragments, and conservation of most zzso and zzso zzso Comparative zzso acid analyses of the variable regions thought to be important in zzso zzso are consistent with the hypothesis that strain zzso may represent the first reported human P type 11 zzso
