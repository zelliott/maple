zzso L is an zzso zzso that zzso viral zzso after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is surprisingly resistant to zzso by zzso L due to an zzso structure in the zzso open reading frame zzso The zzso structure associated with the zzso of zzso L is zzso zzso in group C zzso including zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso A virus 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso structure is not present in other human zzso zzso A, B, or D zzso zzso B3 zzso and zzso C virus zzso were fully sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells expressing either zzso zzso L or a zzso zzso zzso L were used to examine the effects of zzso L on zzso zzso zzso replication was not inhibited by zzso L activity, but zzso zzso characteristic of zzso L activity was detected late during the course of zzso infection, after assembly of zzso zzso Rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso L activity was associated with larger plaques and better zzso zzso zzso in the zzso structure associated with the zzso of zzso L did not affect the magnitude of zzso replication in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso consistent with the absence of observed zzso L activity until after virus zzso Thus, zzso carries an zzso structure in the zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso but this zzso structure does not prevent zzso L activity late during the course of infection, as virus assembly zzso zzso
