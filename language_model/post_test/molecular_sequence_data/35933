zzso gene transfer into localized zzso segments can be performed in zzso by zzso with zzso zzso This technique holds promise for the treatment of human diseases, including zzso and cardiovascular zzso We have previously characterized the potential toxicity of this form of treatment in mice in zzso zzso et zzso zzso In this report, we examined two issues relevant to long-term expression of foreign zzso zzso zzso the potential for zzso damage to major zzso and zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso and toxicity of zzso major zzso zzso gene transfer was assessed in mice after induction of an immune response to a zzso zzso class I zzso gene by direct gene transfer in zzso zzso examination of brain, heart, zzso liver, zzso zzso and skeletal muscle revealed no clinically significant zzso or organ zzso The toxicity of gene delivery by DNA zzso was also analyzed in pigs and rabbits in zzso No zzso was observed following the introduction of plasmids zzso several different gene products, and analysis of serum following DNA zzso delivery revealed no abnormalities of serum zzso zzso The potential for transfer of zzso DNA into zzso and zzso in animals was evaluated by the zzso chain zzso Although evidence of zzso zzso was consistently observed in zzso but not zzso zzso sites and occasionally in zzso zzso zzso and liver, no zzso DNA was detected in zzso or zzso These studies suggest that zzso of zzso DNA following direct gene transfer by zzso zzso in major zzso is not associated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
