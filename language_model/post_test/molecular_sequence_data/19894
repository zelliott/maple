zzso dynamics simulations reveal that the zzso cavity in human zzso zzso is hydrated and can zzso accommodate between one and four water zzso These waters have residence times zzso 500 zzso and can give rise to zzso zzso in agreement with zzso observations of Ernst et zzso zzso 1995; zzso The waters also display high zzso disorder within the zzso which explains why they have not been resolved zzso The average distribution of water molecules over time within the cavity matches well the low resolution electron density extracted by Yu et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The water molecules zzso the zzso cavity zzso as complex zzso These clusters result from a combination of hydrogen bonds between the waters and stabilizing interactions between the waters and aromatic rings forming the zzso Free energy estimates suggest that it takes zzso to zzso the cavity in a zzso stable manner leading to a gain in free energy of transfer from bulk of approximately approximately zzso zzso This arises from the existence of the water clusters in multiple hydrogen bonded zzso In addition, the waters are found to migrate either individually or as clusters out of the cavity through several zzso The upper limit for one-dimensional diffusion of the waters within the protein zzso is 4 zzso zzso to 6 zzso for zzso zzso reveal pathways in addition to those identified zzso with motions controlled by the zzso of zzso We find that only when the zzso cavity is zzso do correlated motions couple distant sites with the sites that make contact with the zzso and this data partly offers an explanation of experimental zzso zzso zzso together with recent observations based on zzso by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005; zzso that hydrogen bond networks couple motions across long distances in zzso lead us to zzso that the zzso of the cavity zzso across zzso can zzso enhance hydrogen bond networks to enable zzso across long distances by acting as a plug and this in turn enables a kinetic control of the rate of transmission of zzso
