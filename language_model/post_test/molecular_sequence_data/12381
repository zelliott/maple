By using quantitative zzso and highly selective zzso zzso we zzso modifications in zzso zzso binding sites in the superficial layers zzso I and zzso of the cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in two models: zzso rats zzso treated with zzso zzso rat submitted 15 days before to unilateral zzso zzso We comparatively zzso the distribution of zzso binding sites in the same zzso We have shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not significantly modified following selective damage of fine zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In the cervical and zzso zzso zzso binding ratios for zzso were zzso and zzso zzso While unilateral zzso zzso induced a drastic decrease in zzso zzso in the side zzso to the zzso as compared to the intact side of zzso ratios of zzso and zzso for cervical and zzso levels, respectively), zzso zzso was not significantly zzso yielding ratios of zzso and zzso for cervical and zzso levels, zzso These data suggest that, in contrast with a majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors are not located on fine primary zzso fibers carrying zzso information from the zzso or zzso in the zzso This preferential zzso zzso together with the reported zzso zzso action of this zzso support the proposal of a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
