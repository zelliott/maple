The segmented zzso of zzso provides an opportunity for zzso strains to generate a large genetic diversity through zzso however, this mechanism is considered to play little role in the generation of mosaic gene zzso between zzso and zzso strains in genes other than the zzso zzso A pilot study was undertaken to analyze these two zzso important strains at the zzso level in order to zzso identify zzso zzso and zzso to make available additional reference zzso sequences of zzso and zzso for future zzso zzso The full or nearly complete coding region of all 11 genes for 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains isolated from children hospitalized with severe zzso in Long Beach, California, where these strains were circulating at comparable rates during zzso are described in this zzso Based on the zzso zzso system, all zzso strains had a zzso zzso zzso zzso and were mostly identical to the few zzso strains whose zzso sequences have already been zzso Similarly, the zzso sequences of the 3 zzso strains were highly zzso zzso and displayed an overall lesser genetic divergence with reference zzso zzso While zzso zzso was not seen between the zzso and zzso strains studied here, evidence for zzso zzso events was zzso Similar studies in the zzso zzso era will help uncover whether zzso zzso affecting the backbone genes could play a significant role in any potential vaccine breakthrough events by evading immunity of vaccinated zzso
