The soluble core domain of zzso zzso of liver zzso zzso was appended at its zzso zzso to full-length alkaline zzso zzso signal sequence including the zzso binding zzso The zzso precursor gene was placed under the zzso control of the native pho promoter in a zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso coli by growth in a zzso medium resulted in abundant synthesis of zzso zzso as detected zzso and by visual transformation of the bacteria to a pink zzso The zzso zzso zzso but not the corresponding zzso zzso was zzso across the bacterial inner membrane and processed to yield authentic, zzso zzso zzso within the zzso The eventual processing of the zzso zzso zzso precursor was unusual regarding the known reaction specificity of signal zzso The zzso mature zzso was zzso indistinguishable from its native zzso zzso At peak zzso approximately 6 zzso of correctly matured zzso zzso per liter of culture was zzso This amount of zzso zzso constituted zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The appearance of the exported zzso zzso preceded the formation of zzso Thus the zzso zzso protein was efficiently exported from zzso coli and zzso modified to generate a functional zzso in the zzso
