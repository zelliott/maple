zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso each having a functional active zzso Fine zzso mapping of 8 zzso to the zzso domain of human zzso was carried out using plate zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso from different species, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Almost all zzso contained potential zzso zzso zzso these zzso could be used to distinguish different zzso of zzso expressed in different zzso or cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso were especially sensitive to the composition of the zzso attached to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso detected the zzso status of the zzso attached to zzso 685 and perhaps zzso and zzso zzso and zzso recognized the zzso on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is located at the zzso end of the C domain, close to the unique 36 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it binds zzso to zzso on the surface of human zzso and thus may find application as an zzso zzso zzso zzso was the best zzso for zzso of zzso zzso cells by flow zzso In contrast to the other zzso binding of zzso zzso was not markedly influenced by zzso zzso or by the cell culture conditions or cell types, making this zzso a suitable reference zzso zzso mapping of these zzso zzso particularly those that compete with zzso zzso enabled us to propose a model of the zzso zzso zzso that might explain the zzso zzso Our findings demonstrated that zzso directed to zzso zzso on the zzso domain of human zzso are very useful for the detection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso using flow zzso and zzso zzso and for the study of different aspects of zzso zzso
