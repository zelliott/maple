Novel zzso zzso for inclusion in zzso zzso containing zzso zzso as a zzso anchor, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a molecular weight of 2000 as a linking zzso and a biological cell adhesive zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso They were characterized by zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso zzso of either of the zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso mole zzso zzso mixture followed by preparation of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in positioning of zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso on the periphery of the outer zzso zzso zzso as determined by a combination of specific zzso zzso of each zzso and zzso Similar zzso of zzso zzso chains were incorporated into zzso by simply zzso zzso degrees C, 5 zzso either one of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso process was zzso zzso Using zzso zzso it was demonstrated that all the zzso incorporated into zzso zzso by this new approach were positioned exclusively on the outer leaflet of the zzso zzso Since zzso of this type are intended for in zzso use as zzso zzso platforms, the zzso approach is preferable because of the more efficient zzso of zzso zzso
