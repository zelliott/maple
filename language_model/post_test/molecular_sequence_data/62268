zzso forms the scaffold for a zzso zzso complex that zzso zzso via the action of zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the DNA by several DNA binding zzso such as the zzso proteins of the Mad zzso Here, we elaborate on the zzso interaction based on a binding study, solution structure, and dynamics of the zzso domain of zzso in complex to an extended zzso interacting domain zzso of 24 zzso of zzso We show that SID zzso zzso and zzso outside the previously defined minimal binding zzso mediate additional zzso and zzso interactions with zzso On the basis of these results we propose an extended consensus sequence describing the zzso interaction specifically for the Mad family, showing that zzso outside the zzso core of the SID interact with zzso and zzso binding affinity to appropriate zzso
