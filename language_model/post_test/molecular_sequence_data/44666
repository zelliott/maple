zzso B4 zzso is a potent zzso that is primarily involved in zzso immune responses and host zzso against zzso zzso activates inflammatory cells by binding to its zzso zzso zzso zzso can also bind and activate the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of genes that terminate inflammatory zzso Here we report the cloning of the complementary DNA zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is highly expressed in human zzso Using a zzso strategy, we isolated two zzso clones zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso These two clones contain identical open reading frames zzso a protein of 352 zzso acids and predicted to contain seven zzso zzso but different zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with an expression construct containing the open reading frame of zzso showed specific zzso zzso with a zzso zzso comparable to that observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso expressing this zzso zzso induced increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells expressing zzso zzso showed marked zzso responses towards low zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso Our findings, together with previous reports, show that zzso is a unique zzso zzso that interacts with both zzso and nuclear zzso
