zzso resistance of zzso mice to influenza virus is due to the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso gene consists of 14 zzso that are spread over at least 55 zzso pairs of zzso Surprisingly, the zzso gene promoter is induced as efficiently by zzso disease virus as it is by zzso The zzso boundary of the region required for zzso induction by both zzso and zzso disease virus is located about 140 base pairs upstream of the cap zzso This region contains five elements of the type zzso which occurs in all zzso and zzso zzso The consensus sequence zzso is found in all zzso zzso
