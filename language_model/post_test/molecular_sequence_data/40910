In this paper, we report the full-length coding sequence of bovine zzso zzso and analyze its expression in bovine zzso Similar to human, zzso and pig zzso zzso bovine zzso has a highly zzso zzso domain that is necessary for zzso function in mice and zzso This suggests that zzso is functionally intact as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso distribution of zzso gene expression was highest in fat and muscle zzso and zzso zzso while protein expression was solely zzso in the zzso zzso The effect of zzso of zzso supplementation on zzso and zzso fatty zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso or zzso expression was examined in Angus zzso zzso zzso had greater zzso zzso content in the muscle compared with zzso zzso Additionally, supplementation increased zzso expression and decreased zzso zzso 1 zzso expression in muscle, while total zzso expression was zzso In zzso supplementation of cattle zzso with zzso increased muscle zzso zzso attributed in part to increased expression of key zzso involved in zzso trafficking zzso and metabolism zzso
