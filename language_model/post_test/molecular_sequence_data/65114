zzso zzso zzso and zzso are recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso signaling zzso They are zzso to be the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso or -9 and zzso zzso We report here the first detailed characterization of zzso and compare its expression pattern with zzso Similar to zzso zzso preferred alpha zzso zzso acid over alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso Using a specific zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso was expressed mainly on zzso in blood and their immature precursors in bone zzso zzso was present on zzso cavity zzso and on zzso of mature zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found zzso novel population of zzso cavity zzso cells and a subset of zzso B cells enriched in transitional zzso and marginal zone B zzso In striking contrast to zzso zzso was expressed predominantly on zzso in blood and their precursors in the bone zzso The distinct and largely zzso expression profiles of zzso and zzso suggest that they play zzso roles in the innate immune zzso zzso is likely to zzso the functions of several types of zzso cells, whereas zzso is likely to be more restricted to zzso zzso
