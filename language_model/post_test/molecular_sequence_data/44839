In this paper we report the expression in zzso zzso zzso and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso produced zzso to the level of zzso g per liter zzso This production level is about the same level as that gained for zzso zzso from zzso and about zzso more than previously achieved by zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso zzso was zzso by two independent zzso methods employing zzso exchange or affinity zzso to apparent zzso The zzso protein has a molecular weight of about 75,000 and specific activity of 78 units per zzso zzso The zzso present in the zzso N zzso was found to be removed correctly by zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso is zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso appear to be larger than in zzso another zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso to our knowledge for the first time in zzso zzso in this zzso contribute about half of the total zzso content in zzso zzso zzso appears as multiple hands on zzso focusing with zzso values around zzso a value that is little higher than that for zzso produced in zzso zzso zzso could be used as a versatile tool in studying protein expression in zzso zzso as an affinity handle for other zzso proteins produced in zzso zzso as a reporter gene when studying gene zzso and as a model protein in studying protein zzso and processing in zzso zzso
