zzso zzso zzso zzso catecholamines and zzso drugs such as zzso The common genetic zzso zzso in the human zzso gene is suspected to be associated with zzso or risk for zzso In this study, we attempted to identify the canine zzso gene zzso and to find a similar zzso and to reveal its genetic distribution among five representative canine zzso We found that the amplified gene consisted of zzso zzso zzso and was zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso The single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso From the zzso of the zzso zzso among zzso dogs by the zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso method with restriction zzso zzso and that of the zzso zzso with restriction zzso zzso we found zzso variations of zzso as well as of zzso zzso for both of these zzso zzso These results suggest that the identified zzso will be useful tools in zzso the genetic background of canine behavioral zzso
