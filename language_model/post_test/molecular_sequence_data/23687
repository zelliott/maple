zzso mobile has a zzso cell zzso and glides toward its tapered end at a rate of zzso cell lengths per s zzso zzso zzso by an unknown zzso zzso requires that the surface of the cell is in contact with a solid zzso such as glass or zzso In order to characterize the nature of the outer surface of zzso mobile, zzso zzso were raised against intact cells and screened for their ability to recognize surface zzso Four zzso were identified and their protein targets were zzso One zzso recognized the zzso zzso which is known to be involved in glass binding and zzso This zzso was also able to zzso attached zzso mobile cells from glass, suggesting that zzso is the major zzso protein in zzso zzso The other three zzso recognized members of the zzso family of zzso which are presumably the major surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies were performed to zzso these proteins on the surface of zzso mobile zzso zzso localized to the zzso region of the tapered part of the cell (the zzso while the various zzso family members showed several distinct patterns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso localized to the zzso end of the tapered part of the cell (the zzso zzso localized to the main part of the cell (the zzso and zzso localized to both the head and body but not the zzso This analysis shows that zzso mobile surprisingly expresses multiple versions of its major surface zzso at once but zzso its surface by differential zzso of the various zzso
