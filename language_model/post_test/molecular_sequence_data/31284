We have studied the alcohol zzso zzso system in the zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso to the zzso zzso zzso gene indicates four probable structural zzso genes in zzso zzso Two of these genes have been isolated from a zzso bank by zzso to zzso The zzso sequence of one of these genes shows zzso and 50% sequence identity to the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso cells and, in zzso to zzso zzso was named zzso The other zzso zzso to zzso in zzso shows an zzso extension which displays all of the characteristics of a zzso targeting zzso We named this gene zzso The two genes have been localized on different zzso by Southern zzso to an zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities resolved by gel zzso revealed several zzso zzso which are differently expressed in zzso zzso cells depending on the carbon zzso
