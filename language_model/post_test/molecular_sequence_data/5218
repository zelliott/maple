The molecular structure of zzso zzso zzso channels which are involved in hypoxic pulmonary artery zzso zzso has yet to be zzso To address this problem, we identified the zzso zzso channel zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso in rat PA zzso zzso encodes an zzso silent zzso which associates with zzso and zzso its zzso zzso The zzso zzso unlike zzso opens in the zzso range of the resting membrane potential of PA zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the activity of zzso is tightly controlled by internal zzso and is zzso inhibited by zzso In conclusion, we propose that zzso regulation of the zzso zzso may play an important role in hypoxic PA zzso and in the possible development of PA zzso
