zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed step of the zzso zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated by combining library screening and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a small gene family of two genes zzso and zzso which are organized in a tandem zzso zzso and zzso have an identical organization with regard to zzso positions and zzso sizes and zzso zzso zzso showing a high level of sequence conservation zzso identity and zzso zzso The isolated zzso has been assigned to the zzso gene product, zzso zzso zzso analysis has shown that the zzso zzso zzso is detected in all plant zzso analyzed zzso leaves, stems and zzso although the transcript is especially abundant in zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to complement the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso although zzso activity was detected in the zzso fraction of the transformed zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso resulting from the replacement of the 66 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by the 111 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso to strain zzso zzso studies using zzso and zzso zzso obtained from zzso strains expressing either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives indicated that the zzso region of the zzso is involved in the channeling of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
