The aim of this review is to analyze the different ways by which stem cells and zzso cells may zzso Stem cells are defined as immature cells that ensure the continuous renewal of blood zzso This small set of zzso cells comprises different kinds of cells, differing by their degree of maturity, their commitment, zzso ability and zzso zzso zzso cells are fixed zzso cells involved in stem cell survival, proliferation and zzso In zzso studies on the distribution within zzso or zzso of stem cells injected to lethally zzso mice, have suggested that cells of the zzso play a significant role in stem cell proliferation and zzso This role has been demonstrated using an in zzso model, zzso the long-term zzso cultures as described in 1976 by zzso zzso Analysis of stem cell maintenance in this culture system has made it possible to define the different means by which zzso cells and zzso (the zzso zzso may control stem cell zzso Different molecules play a critical zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso molecules and molecules belonging to the zzso zzso and eventually small zzso It appears nowadays possible to materially represent the zzso zzso whose existence was zzso by zzso zzso 10 years ago for theoretical reasons related to the the physiology of stem zzso
