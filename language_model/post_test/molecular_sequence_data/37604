Members of zzso zzso C zzso families are central zzso in signal zzso in response to the occupancy of receptors by many growth zzso Among zzso zzso the type zzso is of particular interest because of its reported nuclear zzso in addition to its presence at the plasma zzso It has been previously shown that both the stimulation and the zzso of the nuclear zzso under different stimuli zzso zzso as an important zzso for zzso cell growth as well as for zzso zzso cell zzso The above findings hinting at a direct involvement of zzso in controlling the cell cycle in zzso cells, and the previously reported mapping of its gene in rat zzso band zzso a region frequently rearranged in rat zzso induced by chemical zzso prompted us to identify its human zzso By screening a human zzso brain zzso library with the rat zzso zzso probe, we have identified a clone zzso to a sequence in gene bank called zzso zzso which encodes a large part of the human zzso By using this human zzso in zzso in zzso zzso on human zzso it has been possible to map human zzso on zzso zzso confirming the zzso between rat zzso 3 and human zzso 20 and providing a novel locus of zzso between bands zzso in rat and zzso in zzso Since band zzso has been recently reported amplified and/or deleted in several solid zzso the identification and zzso mapping of human zzso could pave the way for further investigations on the role exerted both in normal human cells and in human zzso by zzso which has been shown to behave as a key zzso intermediate in the control of the cell zzso
