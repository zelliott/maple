The repeated transmission to pigs and humans, and the long-term zzso in zzso poultry of zzso viruses in China lend urgency to the study of their ecology and zzso In the present paper, we reported an zzso virus zzso isolated from chickens in northern China from 2007 to 2009 has high zzso for zzso zzso analysis of the full zzso indicated that six representative zzso zzso shared high zzso to each other, and they clustered in the same zzso with other zzso viruses isolated recently in northern zzso The zzso were zzso viruses containing M genes similar to zzso zzso zzso and the other seven gene segments from zzso zzso These six zzso were capable of replicating in the lungs of infected chickens without producing zzso clinical signs of disease or zzso However, they were highly lethal to mice with mortality rates as high as zzso zzso without prior zzso The affected mice exhibited severe respiratory syndromes and diffuse lung zzso The zzso viruses could be detected in multiple zzso of the infected mice, including hearts, zzso zzso lungs and zzso Our findings demonstrated that zzso viruses isolated from the chickens in northern China have established a stable zzso with enhanced zzso to mice, suggesting that urgent attention will need to be paid to the transmission of zzso viruses from chickens to zzso
