The zzso significance of multiple zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso receptors zzso zzso remains obscure, since in many cases several zzso activate the same zzso and zzso the same zzso zzso We inspected the deduced zzso acid sequences of the beta zzso zzso for variations in the zzso for zzso regulation as a potential basis for zzso zzso Whereas the beta zzso has a C zzso containing 11 zzso and zzso zzso representing potential sites for beta zzso zzso zzso which mediates rapid zzso zzso only 3 zzso are present in the comparable region of the beta zzso and they are in a zzso zzso The beta zzso also lacks sequence zzso in regions which are important for zzso zzso and zzso of the beta zzso although such zzso are less well zzso We therefore tested the idea that the zzso regulatory properties of the two receptors might differ by expressing both zzso in zzso cells and exposing them to the zzso zzso The beta zzso did not display short-term zzso functional zzso or zzso or long-term zzso To assign a structural basis for these zzso differences in zzso regulation, we constructed a zzso beta zzso zzso which comprised the beta zzso up to zzso of the zzso tail and the C zzso of the beta zzso When cells expressing this zzso beta zzso zzso were exposed to zzso functional zzso was zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the beta zzso displayed zzso zzso but no such zzso could be demonstrated with the beta zzso even when beta zzso zzso was zzso In contrast, the zzso beta zzso zzso did display zzso zzso consistent with its functional zzso In addition to zzso functional zzso and zzso to the beta zzso the zzso tail of the beta zzso also zzso zzso zzso and long-term zzso zzso
