We describe a system to isolate zzso zzso zzso which contain targeted zzso in their zzso zzso The zzso of interest should be present in so-called specialized zzso zzso which have an zzso sequence that is altered from zzso zzso to zzso zzso These zzso specialized zzso zzso are separated from their zzso zzso zzso counterparts by affinity zzso that exploits the different zzso zzso An zzso complementary to the 3' end of zzso zzso zzso and attached to a solid phase zzso retains the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the column contains close to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that affinity column treatment does not cause significant loss of activity of the specialized particles in initiation complex formation, whereas zzso capacity as determined by zzso synthesis is only slightly zzso The method described offers an advantage over total zzso from in zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso since our zzso zzso contain the naturally occurring base modifications in their zzso zzso
