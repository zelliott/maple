zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts was studied in zzso zzso Thompson zzso through use of zzso zzso In roots, the three zzso zzso zzso zzso reported in the zzso facility database from the University of California zzso were expressed as zzso zzso and three zzso zzso two basic zzso and zzso and a neutral zzso zzso zzso were detected in root zzso In zzso although one zzso zzso zzso was detected as a zzso transcript, three zzso activities were found in its zzso these same being the two basic zzso found in the roots, and an zzso one zzso as zzso In field grown zzso zzso zzso transcript was expressed zzso during bud zzso zzso while under controlled conditions in a growth chamber, a short day zzso zzso triggered expression of the zzso transcript in bud zzso low temperature, enhanced its expression zzso Because environmental cues that trigger and enhance zzso zzso transcript expression in zzso are the same as those that induce zzso in zzso the transient expression of zzso zzso zzso identified in buds could signal the full extent of zzso in zzso
