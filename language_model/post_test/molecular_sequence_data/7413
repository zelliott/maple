A domain substitution experiment was carried out between the structurally related zzso zzso Pol beta and zzso to investigate the region of Pol beta required for template zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA procedures were used for construction of a gene zzso a zzso form of the two zzso and termed zzso in which the DNA region zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of zzso was replaced by the corresponding region zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The construction was confirmed by restriction analysis and DNA zzso Since this region of zzso beta represents most of the zzso domain of the zzso possessing zzso DNA zzso activity, it was hypothesized that the zzso zzso unlike zzso might possess zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso gene product was produced in zzso coli, zzso and subjected to preliminary zzso zzso The finding that the zzso zzso beta protein possessed significant zzso zzso activity suggests that zzso zzso of Pol beta are involved in template zzso during the zzso reaction, as suggested by the previous finding that the zzso zzso domain of Pol beta possesses zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 265 zzso zzso Kumar et zzso zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 268 zzso zzso
