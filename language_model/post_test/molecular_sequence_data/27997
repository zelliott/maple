The complete zzso acid sequence of a high mobility group zzso zzso zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso This protein was extracted with zzso M zzso together with zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso from the whole zzso zzso then zzso by gel zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein showed a single zzso band on zzso gel zzso The zzso acid sequence was determined by zzso degradation of intact zzso zzso fragments, and their zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus the total zzso consisting of 99 zzso acid zzso and having a molecular weight of zzso was completely zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso showed that this zzso protein was zzso at two positions, each zzso and contained zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso is rather similar to the central part of zzso zzso 1 in terms of the zzso acid sequence and the zzso zzso
