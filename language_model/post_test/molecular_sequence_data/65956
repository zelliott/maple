To clarify the natural diet of zzso larvae of the Japanese zzso lobster zzso zzso the sources of zzso zzso clones obtained from the zzso were zzso Of a total of zzso clones zzso 160 had different restriction profiles from the host larvae, in which 21 restriction types were zzso zzso sequences of 16 of 21 restriction types were successfully determined and their assignments were investigated by zzso search and zzso zzso From seven late-stage larvae collected in spring to early summer, zzso DNA molecules of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso DNA from four younger zzso larvae collected in late autumn could not be zzso A previous study identified zzso of zzso and zzso in late-stage zzso larvae of a closely related species collected in zzso This indicates that the zzso larvae are opportunistic zzso whose diets correlate with the relative abundance of prey organisms in the ambient zzso
