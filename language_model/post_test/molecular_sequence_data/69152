We have studied the question of whether a zzso zzso into the zzso DNA of the host cell before or after the DNA is zzso during the S phase of the cell zzso We have infected single zzso cells with zzso a zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso then observed the clones derived from these cells to discover whether all the cells carry a copy of the zzso zzso We have discovered that only half of the progeny of an infected cell carries a copy of the zzso This indicates that the virus only zzso into zzso zzso We discuss the implications of this result for applications of zzso such as gene therapy and cell zzso which use them as vehicles for gene transfer into stem zzso
