The direct sequencing of zzso products generates zzso zzso zzso zzso that are useful for identifying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso short tandem repeats zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be easily detected using the currently available zzso or zzso programs, which do not search reference zzso However, the detection of other zzso zzso remains a challenge due to the lack of appropriate tools for zzso zzso zzso zzso data zzso In this study, we developed a free zzso program, Mixed zzso Reader zzso which can directly analyze zzso zzso zzso zzso data in zzso file format using comparisons with reference zzso The zzso sequences are identified as two distinct sequences and aligned with reference zzso Our results showed that zzso may be used to zzso physically locate zzso and zzso sequences and determine zzso copy number by searching zzso reference zzso zzso predict combinations of zzso patterns using the Federal Bureau of Investigation Combined DNA Index System zzso zzso determine human zzso virus zzso zzso by searching current viral databases in cases of double zzso zzso estimate the copy number of zzso zzso such as zzso 4 zzso and its zzso zzso
