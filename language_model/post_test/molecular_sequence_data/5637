Vitamin D promotes differentiation of cells either by simply enhancing zzso gene expression and/or by suppressing expression of zzso of zzso Previously, we reported that expression of a gene zzso zzso a negative type zzso zzso factor, was zzso suppressed by zzso D3 zzso zzso To identify the sequence required for the negative regulation by 1, zzso a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso gene was examined by zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso into zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of this construct was zzso by zzso M zzso zzso analysis revealed that a zzso pair zzso upstream response sequence zzso zzso was required for the suppression by zzso This sequence zzso negative responsiveness to zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained not only zzso consensus sequence zzso but also four direct repeats of a zzso sequence zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that the zzso zzso formed specific nuclear zzso complexes, which were neither zzso by previously known positive and negative vitamin D response elements nor zzso by zzso D zzso zzso suggesting the absence of vitamin D zzso in these zzso These results indicate the involvement of the novel zzso sequence in the vitamin D suppression of zzso gene zzso
