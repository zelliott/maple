Little is known about the genes that regulate zzso length diversity between zzso zzso A candidate gene locus was previously mapped to a region on zzso mouse zzso zzso Within this region, we identified a gene similar to the zzso DNA zzso gene in zzso zzso We cloned this zzso of zzso length zzso gene and zzso its expression in zzso zzso mice died between days 10 and zzso of gestation with defects in the nervous system, heart, zzso and zzso zzso zzso embryonic stem cells showed zzso loss and displayed many zzso breaks and zzso upon differentiation in zzso zzso of zzso mice with zzso zzso showed that zzso from the zzso zzso parent is required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in F1 zzso We conclude that zzso is an essential gene that regulates zzso length and prevents genetic zzso
