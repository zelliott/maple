One of the proposed functions for the zzso structures on zzso is the transfer of information through interaction with specific zzso zzso However, the number of zzso functional zzso interactions is still relatively small, largely due to the lack of adequate methods to identify zzso activity in complex biological zzso zzso to solve this problem, we have developed a method based on the novel group of compounds we named zzso The zzso consists of three vital zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tag, and zzso zzso zzso When incubated in dark, zzso part of the zzso forms a complex with zzso After zzso zzso link between the probe and the zzso is formed resulting in a zzso zzso Using zzso against zzso this complex can easily be identified zzso or by Western zzso To demonstrate the zzso of zzso we have used zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a synthetic zzso with three terminal zzso zzso Lee and Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso in bovine serum and rat liver zzso The simplicity of the method enables its application in routine monitoring of changes in zzso activity during various zzso or pathological zzso An example of zzso analysis in human serum is zzso
