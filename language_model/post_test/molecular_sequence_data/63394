The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family in humans is represented by three members, zzso zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso distinct from zzso zzso mediates transport of a broad range of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso drugs, whereas zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso All three zzso are zzso Unlike zzso however, zzso is also capable of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso in combination with zzso expression in zzso zzso we have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Access of this zzso probe to zzso as determined by zzso of zzso transport activity, required zzso but not zzso and was blocked by zzso zzso Although this zzso zzso is also present in zzso and zzso neither zzso was affected by zzso We conclude that zzso is located in the zzso pore in a mobile region within or closely adjacent to the zzso binding pocket and that access of zzso to this zzso reports a specific zzso zzso state of the zzso
