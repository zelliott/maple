Two soluble zzso were identified in zzso of zzso major, using an zzso model zzso zzso as zzso Similar activities were also detected in zzso major zzso and in different species of zzso zzso A zzso and an zzso activity were resolved and isolated by zzso exchange and gel zzso zzso A single zzso of 62 zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso pH was neutral for the zzso and neutral to alkaline for the zzso Both activities were able to zzso a zzso zzso zzso and were inhibited by 20 zzso zzso and 200 zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso and a range of other zzso These results strongly suggest that both zzso are zzso and thus represent a novel class of soluble zzso in zzso
