In order to estimate the prevalence and patterns of zzso drug resistance zzso in zzso zzso infected patients in Slovenia, and the prevalence of non-B zzso a retrospective study was conducted on a zzso representing zzso of the total of newly diagnosed zzso infected patients, in a 5 year period zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso sequences were determined in 77 newly diagnosed zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in zzso of the population zzso zzso drug resistance was identified as in the zzso zzso the presence of primary zzso and zzso gene zzso according to the zzso zzso list including the zzso zzso in zzso 215 and excluding zzso on the zzso positions 44 and zzso The estimated prevalence of transmitted resistance zzso was zzso zzso three out of 77 patients had zzso associated with resistance to zzso one patient carried zzso in association with zzso while a zzso zzso zzso was found in two zzso No transmitted drug resistance to zzso or zzso was zzso However, to score the expected response to therapy using the zzso and the Stanford zzso we also took into account secondary zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso zzso response to some therapeutic options was predicted in five patients zzso In conclusion, testing the vast majority of all newly diagnosed zzso patients in the last 5 years in Slovenia uncovered a relatively high prevalence of non-B zzso and a low prevalence of transmitted drug zzso
