zzso is a newly isolated zzso zzso that has been zzso because of its ability to induce water zzso The effects that zzso and some synthetic peptides corresponding to its zzso sequence have on zzso zzso of water, zzso and sodium were studied in comparison with the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The technique of an in zzso zzso zzso loop in the rat was used for all zzso Under the experimental conditions used, a low zzso zzso of water, zzso and sodium was zzso zzso induced an increase of the zzso whereas zzso induced an zzso both in the zzso dose zzso zzso II and zzso induced an zzso in the zzso dose zzso The most effective doses of zzso peptides but not of zzso induced the lowest final zzso of zzso and zzso zzso without inducing secondary water zzso All synthetic peptides containing the zzso zzso of zzso were active in the zzso dose zzso zzso to zzso they had no effect on blood zzso
