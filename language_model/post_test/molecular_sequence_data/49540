zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are members of the zzso zzso of zzso Among them, AM and zzso are reported to share a core zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the specificity of the zzso is determined by the expression levels of zzso proteins zzso In the case of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was recently reported to form its specific zzso However, detailed analysis of the zzso specificity of the zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso has so far been performed mainly in the human zzso Thus, we cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursors from a zzso lung and zzso zzso library, and determined their zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso or zzso vascular smooth muscle cells, and the resulting zzso complexes were analyzed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso production zzso The specificity of zzso was clearly determined by the expression of zzso zzso converted zzso to zzso zzso while zzso and zzso converted it to AM zzso but the affinity of zzso for zzso was not increased by the expression of any known zzso In contrast to previous findings, zzso zzso and zzso did not appear to form an zzso zzso having sufficient affinity and specificity for the zzso zzso
