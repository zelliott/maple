The zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso is a zzso complex of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso is required for sorting zzso proteins into the internal zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso to zzso zzso zzso but lack the zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso in a complex with zzso zzso shows the detailed interactions made with the bound zzso Compared with the solution structure of the zzso zzso (the human zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso two zzso that are zzso among the zzso zzso move toward each other to grip the zzso in a zzso zzso The contacts with the zzso zzso two adjacent patches on the surface of the zzso one containing several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and the second containing a zzso patch including zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso patch interacting with the zzso zzso zzso the surface of zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a sequential model for zzso cargo binding by these zzso In contrast, the zzso patch encompasses zzso uniquely interacting with the zzso zzso The structure provides a detailed framework for design of zzso that can specifically affect zzso sorting of zzso cargo without affecting zzso delivery of cargo to zzso
