zzso zzso zzso recovering from acute dose of gamma radiation shows a zzso mechanism of DNA zzso break zzso The possible involvement of zzso zzso or zzso end joining type mechanisms during initial period followed by zzso zzso zzso pathways has been suggested for the reconstruction of complete zzso in this zzso We have exploited the known roles of zzso I in DNA zzso to zzso the nature of zzso involved in DNA zzso break repair during zzso recovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso I functions of zzso coli showed significant reduction in gamma radiation zzso while the resistance to zzso and hydrogen zzso remained zzso The zzso of zzso coli zzso I in zzso inhibited DNA zzso break zzso Such cells exhibited normal zzso expression zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins but lacked the zzso zzso zzso zzso protection from gamma zzso The results strongly suggest that 3' zzso zzso zzso DNA ends constitute an important component in zzso zzso involved in DNA zzso break repair and that absence of zzso from zzso zzso may significantly aid its extreme zzso zzso
