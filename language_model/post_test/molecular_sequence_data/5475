The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein zzso believed to be important for the normal progression of zzso cells through the cell zzso In this paper, we report the zzso organization of the mouse zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene encompasses 16 zzso of the mouse zzso and is zzso into 10 zzso Based on zzso with the human zzso promoter region, the putative mouse promoter region includes a zzso motif but lacks the conventional zzso zzso The proposed promoter region contains consensus binding sites for several zzso regulators, including zzso and zzso In addition to the active copy of zzso zzso exists as a processed zzso Using zzso analysis, we have localized the active zzso gene to mouse zzso 7 and the processed zzso to mouse zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of DNA from a limited number of other zzso species suggests that the zzso is confined to the zzso zzso analysis suggests that the gene zzso leading to the mouse zzso zzso occurred after the zzso zzso
