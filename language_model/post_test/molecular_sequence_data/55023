The evaluation of zzso zzso host range is a significant issue in understanding zzso and zzso community zzso However, in conventional methods, such as plaque zzso target host strains must be isolated, although almost all environmental zzso are recalcitrant to zzso Here, we introduce a novel zzso host range evaluation method using zzso labeled zzso (the zzso zzso which consists of the following four steps: zzso zzso labeled zzso are added to a microbial zzso and host cells are infected and zzso zzso zzso Fluorescent cells are sorted by zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences retrieved from sorted cells are zzso and specific zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso labeled with both zzso labeled zzso and FISH probe are identified as host zzso To verify the feasibility of this method, we used T4 zzso and zzso coli as a zzso We first used zzso acid stain zzso for zzso zzso however, the zzso also stained zzso zzso Next, we employed the zzso zzso zzso zzso kit from zzso for zzso zzso Using zzso T4 zzso we could specifically detect zzso coli cells in a complex microbial consortium from municipal zzso We also confirmed that FISH could be applied to the infected zzso coli zzso These results suggest that this zzso method using the zzso zzso kit is a useful method for evaluating zzso host range and may have a potential application for various types of zzso even if their zzso hosts are currently zzso
