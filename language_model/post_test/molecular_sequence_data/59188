A zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library and zzso This gene presents an extra zzso coding for zzso a zzso motif and a putative zzso element in its zzso zzso The zzso gene expression in this zzso was investigated by Northern zzso zzso in zzso cells or cells under stress zzso zzso growing cells express two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and a new species of zzso zzso is induced under zzso zzso During sexual reproduction of the cells zzso the zzso zzso is still transcribed whereas the zzso population of the zzso zzso transcripts is strongly zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that zzso in zzso zzso constitutes a large family of about ten zzso
