A zzso reporter system was used to investigate the regulation of zzso 2 zzso zzso stability by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso The stable zzso zzso was rendered unstable by zzso of the 2, zzso zzso 3' untranslated region zzso zzso The zzso transcript was stabilized by a zzso active form of zzso zzso 6, an zzso of zzso This stabilization was blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso and by two different dominant negative forms of zzso protein zzso 2 zzso a zzso lying downstream of zzso zzso active zzso was also able to stabilize zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso may be involved in stabilization, as zzso transcripts were partially stabilized by zzso zzso forms of zzso A short zzso zzso of the zzso 3' zzso was necessary and sufficient for the regulation of zzso stability by the zzso cascade and zzso with a zzso protein zzso related to zzso zzso binding factor zzso
