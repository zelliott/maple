The aim of the present study was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso from four to eight zzso clusters occurred before or after the split between the zzso and zzso fish by characterizing zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso have extremely large zzso we took the approach of zzso pure high molecular weight zzso zzso DNA to act as a template for zzso chain reaction zzso of the zzso zzso domain of the highly zzso zzso zzso The 21 clones thus obtained were zzso and translated in a zzso protein database search to designate zzso gene zzso Fourteen of the clones were from zzso zzso two were zzso zzso four were zzso zzso and one most closely resembled the zzso zzso insulin upstream factor zzso The zzso genes identified were from all four zzso clusters A, B, C, and D, confirming their presence in zzso and there is no evidence to suggest more than these four functional zzso zzso as is the case in zzso A comparison of zzso group 13 zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and mouse provides firm evidence that the expansion of zzso zzso as seen in zzso occurred after separation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
