Current views on zzso zzso favor the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso zzso belong to a single family zzso and form an interrelated progression in which zzso is near to zzso at the base of the zzso tree and zzso is the most zzso A stock similar to that of contemporary zzso is considered to have given rise to the southern zzso zzso zzso zzso the sole member of the zzso In the present study, two molecular forms of zzso were isolated from an extract of zzso zzso zzso that differed in structure by six zzso acid zzso One form shows two zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Met and zzso zzso zzso compared with the single molecular form of zzso isolated from the sea zzso zzso zzso and the second form shows three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala, zzso zzso zzso compared with the single zzso isolated from the river zzso zzso zzso As zzso and zzso zzso differ by six zzso acid zzso the data suggest that a zzso of the zzso gene occurred prior to or early in zzso zzso Although both genes are strongly expressed in zzso zzso the expression of one gene zzso in zzso zzso while that of the other gene zzso in zzso zzso Previous work has shown that, in the zzso organ of zzso zzso zzso is processed almost exclusively to zzso However, the present study demonstrates that zzso is the major molecular form in zzso zzso zzso with zzso present only as a minor zzso This result demonstrates a zzso zzso of zzso processing of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
