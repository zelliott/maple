A membrane zzso of 190 zzso has been identified previously by zzso labeling as a candidate for the zzso export pump for zzso C4 in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study indicates that this protein represents the zzso zzso of the human zzso resistance protein zzso In zzso analyses several zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso recognized the protein of zzso in plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso after zzso labeling with zzso C4 zzso the labeled zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso F of zzso membrane proteins was performed in comparison with zzso from zzso cells and resulted in a reduction of the molecular mass of 190 zzso by about 20 zzso in all membrane zzso The expression of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso cells was analyzed by amplification and sequencing of two zzso zzso fragments in the first zzso binding domain zzso zzso and in a domain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these fragments were identical with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso identical with the corresponding sequences of human zzso These results indicate that the zzso release of zzso C4 by zzso zzso cells is zzso by zzso zzso
