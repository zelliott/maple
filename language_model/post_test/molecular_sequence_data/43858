The zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso protein is required for zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in the protein results in an zzso of the precursor form of the zzso zzso zzso 2 of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This temperature sensitivity can be suppressed by a zzso in the zzso gene changing zzso of the zzso protein to zzso In the zzso double zzso zzso is restored without removal of the zzso zzso The suppression suggests an interaction of the zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against the predicted zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso protein reacted with a zzso zzso This zzso present in the zzso zzso is localized within the inner zzso The difference in size can be explained by the removal of the predicted zzso sequence from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the protein points to a direct interaction with the zzso zzso zzso
