To further understand the zzso diversity and genetic architecture of zzso a physical and genetic map of the sweet potato little leaf zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso was used to determine the size of the zzso zzso which was estimated to be zzso zzso A physical map was prepared by two-dimensional zzso zzso using the restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Sixteen zzso sites were located on the zzso Southern zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA were done using random clones and zzso genes as zzso This confirmed zzso positions and located the two zzso zzso and the linked zzso genes zzso zzso factors G and zzso respectively, on the physical zzso An inversion of one of the zzso zzso was observed from zzso zzso zzso analysis of one of the random clones identified a zzso gene zzso a zzso division zzso zzso of the tomato big bud zzso zzso zzso with the same four zzso revealed zzso zzso when compared to the closely related zzso and a preliminary zzso size for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso This mapping information has revealed that significant zzso diversity exists within the zzso
