zzso respiratory zzso virus zzso vaccine preparations have been shown to cause enhanced disease in zzso hosts following natural zzso In this study we demonstrate a similar pattern of enhanced disease severity following primary zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed markedly increased illness compared with zzso zzso animals following zzso zzso despite similar lung virus zzso and rates of virus zzso zzso zzso animals had zzso and zzso pulmonary infiltrates not present in zzso or zzso zzso In zzso analyses of infected lung zzso zzso was induced in both zzso and zzso mice, with preferential zzso zzso and zzso induction only in the zzso zzso zzso was detected in the lungs of both zzso and zzso mice following infection, with a zzso increase over zzso in the zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso newly identified in the zzso fusion zzso we were able to demonstrate that zzso memory zzso T cells zzso by this zzso produce primarily zzso while zzso cells produce primarily zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso by both type I zzso and type II zzso zzso plays an important role in establishing a zzso zzso zzso immune response to zzso zzso
