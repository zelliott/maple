We report the identification and disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso into zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to modifications in the cell wall, as revealed by changes in the sensitivity of zzso cells to sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, two of the zzso major zzso zzso zzso and the ability to grow at 37 degrees zzso impaired in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso represents the major, and maybe only, zzso zzso for zzso acid in zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso blocked not only the synthesis of zzso acid but also that of zzso To differentiate the zzso associated with the zzso acid zzso alone from those linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso compared to strains from which the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso that required for synthesis of zzso had been zzso Finally, studies of strains from which one of the four zzso genes zzso zzso zzso or zzso had been deleted revealed common cell wall zzso associated with the zzso zzso
