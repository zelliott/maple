A simple and rapid method to detect the zzso growth factor zzso hot spot zzso zzso in lung zzso was developed based on principles similar to the universal zzso generator zzso A zzso zzso with an internal deletion was used to generate zzso zzso bearing a loop in the complementary strand derived from the zzso chain reaction product of the normal or zzso zzso By placing deletion in the zzso adjacent to the zzso site, difference in zzso mobility between zzso with normal and zzso DNA was distinguishable in a native zzso zzso The method was also modified to detect zzso deletion zzso of zzso growth factor zzso in lung zzso In addition, the method was adapted to detect hot spot zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and in a zzso zzso at zzso the zzso commonly found in zzso zzso Our zzso detection system, designated the zzso mobility shift zzso was sensitive enough to detect zzso DNA zzso zzso of the total zzso As a simple and straightforward zzso detection technique, zzso mobility shift zzso may be useful for the molecular diagnosis of certain types of clinical zzso Other applications are also zzso
