The zzso zzso zzso zzso which is central to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso has long been known to use a variety of metal zzso and has recently been shown able to exist in two very different zzso forms that are related to metal zzso zzso This paper reports new information on the metal zzso independence and zzso structure of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The gene for zzso zzso zzso was amplified from zzso DNA and sequencing revealed errors in the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso coli and zzso to zzso Analysis of an unusual zzso variation in metal zzso usage by zzso zzso predicts that zzso zzso zzso does not zzso metal zzso such as zzso or zzso which have been shown to act in other zzso at either zzso or zzso zzso Studies with these zzso and zzso confirm the zzso A broad pH optimum was determined to be independent of zzso zzso approximately zzso and the zzso value shows an zzso zzso of approximately zzso Because the metal zzso of other zzso affect the zzso structure, gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments were performed to examine the zzso structure of metal zzso independent zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to be predominantly zzso in contrast with most other zzso which are zzso A protein concentration dependence to the specific activity suggests that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is very active and can zzso to smaller, less active, zzso A zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso is presented and zzso 

The evidence presented in this paper supports the unusual position of the zzso zzso zzso as not requiring any metal zzso for zzso Unlike other zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein is a zzso with an unusually high specific activity when compared to other zzso zzso zzso
