The zzso proteins make up a family of zzso calcium binding proteins that function in response to changing calcium zzso Several zzso binding proteins have been zzso however, the exact biological functions of the zzso proteins are largely unknown as there are several factors which zzso their zzso To address these issues, the specificity of binding of representative members of the human zzso proteins to short zzso peptides of zzso I zzso and zzso II zzso was investigated under controlled experimental zzso zzso and zzso have been shown previously to interact with zzso and zzso zzso This provided a unique opportunity to determine their binding specificity with the other members of the human zzso protein zzso It was found that zzso binds zzso or zzso while zzso binds zzso or zzso This is the first report of the interaction between zzso and zzso The fact that zzso and zzso bind to selected members of the zzso protein family shows that these interactions are specific and that the mode of binding is different from that of zzso as it was found not to bind zzso or zzso From the analysis of the thermodynamics of zzso the binding seems to be zzso zzso It was found that both zzso and zzso undergo a zzso transition upon binding to their respective binding zzso The observation that there is an overlap in functionality is not surprising due to considerable sequence zzso between zzso protein family zzso In fact, the functional overlap can explain previous failures of zzso knockout zzso to show any zzso changes in zzso despite numerous implications of these proteins in important cellular zzso
