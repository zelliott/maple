zzso germ cells zzso are founder cells of all zzso A number of genes which control zzso development have been identified in zzso whereas such genes are by and large zzso in zzso Here we describe zzso zzso structure and expression of mouse zzso of germ zzso zzso gene which is required for zzso formation in zzso The mouse zzso shows zzso identity compared with zzso zzso protein and contains zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of 14 zzso and spans more than 50 zzso The zzso islands are found around zzso 1 of the zzso zzso promoter region contains potential binding sites for various zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that its zzso is highly expressed in adult zzso with lower expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and various other zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed strong expression of the zzso gene in the zzso stage zzso The expression was also observed in zzso zzso but was not apparent in migratory and zzso zzso Further studies including gene disruption analysis would provide an important insight into zzso germ lineage zzso
