The solution structures of human zzso zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso and of its zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined by two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and molecular zzso Analysis of the double quantum filtered correlation zzso total correlation zzso and nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso led to a complete assignment and to the identification of more than 350 zzso and zzso zzso for each zzso zzso models were calculated by molecular dynamics and energy zzso using distance zzso The structure of zzso is characterized by a rigid zzso zzso loop followed by zzso segments zzso a zzso zzso and several local zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso is less defined than the structure of zzso and no zzso structure is zzso zzso models of both peptides are consistent with the zzso temperature zzso and secondary chemical shifts of the zzso zzso bonding with the zzso ring appears to be critical for zzso formation, both structural elements being essential for zzso zzso
