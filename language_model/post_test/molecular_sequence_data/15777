zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso strains stocked in the Department of zzso Technology, zzso University zzso were screened for the presence of a zzso sequence both as zzso or in the zzso Five DNA samples gave rise to a positive zzso signal when zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso Two among these contain zzso sequences as plasmids while the other three apparently were zzso Two zzso DNA segments of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso with zzso probe were cloned and zzso Both zzso zzso with a zzso sequence covering the P gene of zzso One of the two segments contains a large open reading frame which can zzso 410 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is closely related with that of the P gene of zzso The present finding suggests that there was an zzso of a gene between zzso zzso and zzso
