In zzso zzso gene zzso zzso can be triggered by 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso By functional analysis of zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso harbors a second zzso DNA zzso zzso targeting a subset of zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso differs from zzso by the fact that it relies both on zzso factors previously implicated only in zzso gene zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and most likely on 21 zzso zzso A central role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals in zzso zzso is supported by data showing that it binds both to zzso zzso and zzso proteins and contributes to zzso zzso at a zzso zzso Our results unravel the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encompassing both zzso and zzso components in zzso
