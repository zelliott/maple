We report the construction of an zzso zzso zzso for the expression of foreign proteins in zzso zzso This zzso zzso combines the zzso promoter, zzso translation start site, and zzso of zzso with the origin of replication region of zzso Replacement of the origin of replication of zzso results in a zzso increase in zzso copy number of zzso compared with zzso zzso of the zzso for rabbit muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso in the two expression plasmids exhibit a comparable difference in copy zzso An increase in protein expression measured by zzso and zzso specific activities reflects the increased copy zzso zzso activities of zzso in bacterial extracts differ approximately zzso between the two expression plasmids in zzso coli zzso zzso A can compose up to zzso of the total protein in zzso coli zzso when expressed in zzso from which more than 100 zzso of zzso zzso can be obtained per liter zzso
