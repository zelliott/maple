The zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso has previously been isolated and described zzso number zzso As demonstrated zzso the predicted zzso acid sequence and zzso activity of the zzso protein share a significant degree of similarity to the forms of zzso found in other zzso zzso utilizing reverse zzso coupled with the zzso chain reaction zzso demonstrate the expression of zzso zzso in zzso brain, zzso and zzso In spite of the evidence provided by Northern zzso analysis for a single transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated transcript zzso within the zzso but not the zzso or the zzso Although not zzso zzso analysis indicated that the transcript complexity of zzso zzso was within the zzso zzso Until this study, the expression of zzso and its correlation with the zzso physiology of fish had not been studied at the molecular zzso In the zzso significant changes in zzso development were evident following zzso of plasma zzso zzso during October and again in zzso Seasonal changes in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was reflected in zzso plasma zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso commenced a month before the message for zzso was zzso Both transcripts were present from October to zzso As the female approached the time of zzso (in zzso the abundance of both zzso and zzso transcripts zzso The zzso message was not detected in zzso females but zzso transcripts were zzso These data indicate that the timely synthesis of zzso in zzso is caused by the regulation of both zzso and zzso
