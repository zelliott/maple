zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a clinically zzso group of zzso respiratory chain disorders that can theoretically be subject to either a nuclear or a zzso mode of zzso In an attempt to zzso the molecular bases of the disease, we first determined the zzso sequence of three unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of human expressed sequence tag data bases and zzso the 11 zzso zzso zzso complex III in five patients with isolated complex III zzso No zzso in the zzso zzso complex III zzso was observed, but a zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso b gene was found to alter the zzso of the zzso complex in one patient with severe zzso zzso The present study is highly relevant to genetic counseling as the absence of zzso zzso in all but one patient in our series strongly supports zzso rather than maternal inheritance in the majority of patients with complex III zzso
