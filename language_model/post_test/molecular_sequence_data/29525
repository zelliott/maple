zzso muscular zzso zzso is an zzso zzso dominant muscle disease with a worldwide zzso Recent findings reveal the genetic basis of this disease to be zzso in the zzso zzso 2 zzso gene that involve short expansions of the zzso zzso repeat zzso a zzso zzso The underlying mechanism causing the zzso zzso in zzso remains to be zzso although the DNA zzso model is thought to be a plausible explanation of zzso 

We analyzed zzso using zzso chain reaction analysis and DNA sequencing in Japanese patients with zzso confirmed zzso and found zzso zzso and zzso zzso instead of the normal zzso zzso These zzso zzso could be explained by the insertions or zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, but not by the simple expansion of zzso zzso The clinical features of our patients were compatible with those of other Japanese patients carrying zzso that encodes a zzso tract of the same zzso but were not compatible with those of Italian zzso 

The zzso zzso identified in our Japanese patients with zzso were most likely due to zzso of zzso and zzso but not simple expansions of the zzso zzso zzso unequal zzso of 2 zzso zzso rather than DNA zzso is probably the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso All zzso that have been reported in patients with zzso so far can be explained with the mechanism of unequal zzso On the other hand, comparison of the clinical features of our patients with those of other patients in previous reports suggests that specific clinical features cannot be attributed to the length of the zzso tract per zzso
