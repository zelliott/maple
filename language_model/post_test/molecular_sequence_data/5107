zzso zzso of the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso to the development of zzso breast cancer and zzso zzso Loss of zzso detected using zzso zzso markers in the vicinity of zzso is observed in most zzso arising in carriers of zzso zzso zzso and also in zzso of sporadic breast and zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso are extremely rare in sporadic zzso We have examined the hypothesis that expression of the zzso gene may be suppressed in sporadic breast zzso by a mechanism that is associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso in the promoter zzso Using a zzso zzso chain reaction based zzso the presence of zzso in three zzso zzso within the zzso promoter was assessed in 18 breast or zzso cancer cell lines, in an zzso large T zzso immortalized cell line derived from normal breast zzso cells, in 64 primary sporadic breast zzso and peripheral blood zzso from these cases and in a number of other normal human zzso zzso was not detected in any of the zzso zzso suggesting that this mechanism of zzso repression is unlikely to explain the absence of zzso zzso in sporadic zzso
