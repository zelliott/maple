We have previously reported the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and their incorporation into synthetic zzso to create zzso zzso linkages in the zzso Such linkages have a profound effect on DNA backbone zzso flexibility, and we have shown that the zzso zzso which requires such flexibility, is inhibited when it encounters these linkages on the zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the effects of these linkages on the zzso specific zzso III and on the zzso specific zzso bean zzso to establish whether our modification zzso resistance to zzso making it suitable for zzso therapy zzso We also investigated the effect on DNA zzso I to establish whether we could in the future use this zzso to incorporate these linkages in the zzso Our results show that a single modification does not affect the activity of DNA zzso I, but four zzso linkages in tandem inhibit its zzso Furthermore, such linkages do not zzso significant zzso resistance to either zzso III or zzso bean zzso but unexpectedly, they alter the zzso specificity of zzso zzso
