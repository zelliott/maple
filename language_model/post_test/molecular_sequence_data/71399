zzso zzso have been used in the diagnosis of zzso diseases as well as the analysis of nuclear zzso In an attempt to study the biological characteristics of the nuclear zzso we screened human zzso using zzso zzso and zzso We detected zzso against nuclear zzso zzso a remnant zzso protein compartment after the treatment of zzso salt and zzso in 212 out of zzso tested zzso zzso by zzso zzso with molecular weights of 70 zzso 50 zzso and 25 zzso were detected in the order of zzso Clinical zzso of 198 out of 212 cases were available and went as zzso 38 cases were zzso diseases, such as systemic lupus zzso and zzso zzso 132 zzso and zzso diseases; 16 zzso diseases and 12 cases zzso The zzso zzso intensity by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso decreased zzso but zzso speckled and zzso zzso patterns were retained after in zzso zzso zzso and La protein were detected by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso indicates that the zzso constitute a variety of characteristic nuclear zzso and may serve as zzso in diverse human zzso In addition, the presence of zzso and La protein as zzso suggests that the zzso can be functionally active in association with DNA or zzso
