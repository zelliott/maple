We present DNA sequences zzso cloned zzso human zzso In addition to providing zzso evidence that zzso cluster with other tandem repeats, these zzso sequences contain a high frequency of zzso repetitive zzso These elements include a zzso zzso zzso from which one of the zzso appears to have expanded, and a recently described short zzso zzso We present our own findings concerning this element, in particular that those examples studied do not show significant evolutionary zzso despite suggestions that the element may have a zzso zzso
