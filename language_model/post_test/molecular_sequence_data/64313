In a previous study that was based primarily on zzso zzso sequencing, two groups of zzso that had been recovered from a pig zzso were proposed to belong to two novel species, termed zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, based on DNA zzso content and partial zzso protein 60 zzso gene zzso the assignment of zzso zzso corrected to zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso zzso was relatively low, which was consistent with its segregation into zzso II of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on partial zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso the species was transferred to a novel zzso and reclassified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles and growth parameters were established for both novel zzso Interestingly, each had a high tolerance to oxygen and grew on zzso media under zzso conditions, a trait that may relate to their zzso zzso Under zzso growth conditions, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This appeared to arise from incomplete cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso was unusual in that it grew at temperatures as low as 4 degrees zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, the identities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso are zzso
