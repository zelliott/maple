A zzso zzso strain with a reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated among 398 clinical zzso obtained from zzso in zzso City, zzso The zzso zzso strain was negative for zzso production but it showed zzso resistance against zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 16 zzso The molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso in this strain were zzso zzso chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing were performed to identify zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso strain, which thus explain the zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain contained a significantly different sequence of the zzso gene from that of the zzso zzso Some regions of the zzso domain within this zzso gene were closely similar to those found in other zzso species such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso This strain also included a zzso zzso that is associated with high-level resistance to zzso zzso zzso that mediate zzso of the zzso zzso pump responsible for resistance to zzso agents such as zzso and zzso zzso that reduce zzso zzso to zzso agents such as zzso Moreover, this strain contained zzso and zzso zzso that zzso high-level resistance to zzso These results indicate the emergence of a zzso zzso strain with reduced zzso to zzso which also showed a zzso zzso that can be explained by the presence of multiple zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso
