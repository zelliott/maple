In zzso coli, the molecular zzso of zzso zzso families are required not only for protein folding but also for the rapid degradation of certain abnormal zzso The zzso step in the degradation of the fusion protein zzso by zzso zzso appears to be the formation of a complex with zzso We have isolated these complexes and found that each zzso zzso contained a short-lived zzso of zzso plus a 50 zzso zzso which we identified by sequencing and zzso methods as zzso Factor zzso Upon zzso addition, zzso and zzso zzso together from zzso but remained tightly associated with each other even upon gel zzso zzso was originally proposed to function in protein zzso across zzso but altering cellular content of zzso did not affect this process in zzso By contrast, low levels of zzso expression markedly reduced zzso degradation, while an overproduction of zzso greatly zzso this zzso Furthermore, in extracts of cells expressing high levels of zzso the capacity of zzso to bind to zzso is greatly zzso zzso of zzso also zzso zzso ability to bind to other unfolded proteins zzso and zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso factor for zzso degradation; it appears to regulate zzso function and to promote the formation of zzso complexes which are critical for zzso
