Two zzso isolated from white spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are predicted to zzso a basic class IV zzso and a zzso respectively corresponding to genes zzso and zzso Each represents a zzso family in zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso genes were highly abundant in zzso zzso and gradually decreased after zzso were placed on zzso zzso maturation zzso with lowest abundance in zzso zzso zzso related to zzso became highly abundant again in early zzso zzso but decreased thereafter, whereas transcripts related to zzso were also highly abundant in late zzso zzso and zzso in zzso transcripts were either low zzso or were not zzso zzso in zzso zzso drying and flooding stresses enhanced zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso cell wall suspension enhanced zzso transcript zzso but reduced zzso transcript abundance within 24 zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso may have roles in plant defense, and possibly zzso roles during spruce zzso zzso zzso
