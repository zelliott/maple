A zzso intervening sequence within the highly zzso zzso region of the zzso large zzso zzso zzso gene of the fungus zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and identified to be a zzso zzso This is the largest zzso zzso reported zzso for zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains an zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso but complete, zzso zzso protein of 510 zzso acids which is fused at its zzso zzso to a 311 zzso zzso representing a typical zzso zzso A short open reading frame of 83 zzso acids with some similarity to zzso but lacking a zzso zzso was also noted at the 3' end of the zzso The unusual size of the zzso and the arrangement of the open and truncated reading frames suggest that this segment of the zzso of zzso zzso has arisen by a fusion of components from two or more different zzso possibly involving the zzso of zzso zzso
