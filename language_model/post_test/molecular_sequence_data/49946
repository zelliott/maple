A survey of six zzso zzso of the model zzso barrel medic zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso gel zzso reference maps of protein extracts from leaves, zzso roots, flowers, seed zzso and cell suspension cultures were zzso Five hundred zzso proteins were excised and 304 proteins identified using zzso mass zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso coupled with tandem zzso zzso mass zzso was used to validate marginal zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso protein zzso This zzso represents one of the most comprehensive plant zzso projects to date and provides a basis for future zzso comparison of genetic zzso zzso and zzso challenged plants, and/or environmentally challenged zzso Technical details concerning zzso mass zzso database queries, and protein identification success rates in the absence of a zzso zzso are reported and zzso A summary of the identified proteins and their putative functions are zzso The zzso expression of proteins and the levels of identified proteins are compared with their related transcript abundance as zzso through zzso zzso It is estimated that approximately 50% of the proteins appear to be correlated with their corresponding zzso zzso
