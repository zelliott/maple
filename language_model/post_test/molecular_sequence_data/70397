zzso zzso mice were primed with the bovine zzso strain of zzso to study the induction of zzso zzso T zzso zzso These zzso zzso were detected only after in zzso zzso with the zzso Using a zzso zzso virus we identified the zzso zzso protein as a major target of these zzso The response against this protein was obtained also after in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and human zzso strains of zzso Using published zzso and zzso zzso motifs to predict possible zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we zzso and tested 18 predicted peptides of zzso Only one zzso was able to sensitize target cells at a concentration below 5 zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was also induced by zzso with the zzso zzso expressed with a zzso zzso and was shown to be zzso by its capacity to zzso in an zzso target zzso the bulk response against cells infected with zzso zzso virus expressing zzso This zzso zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso of the zzso
