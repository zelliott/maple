Among zzso there is a high degree of variation in zzso size in mature zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying size control between these neighboring zzso Here we report the rice GIANT zzso zzso gene that is essential for controlling the size zzso The function of GE in each tissue is zzso controlling cell size in the zzso and cell death in the zzso zzso which encodes zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso zzso of the both zzso and zzso GE expression is under negative feedback zzso zzso GE expression is zzso in zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso with large zzso and small zzso GE zzso causes a small zzso and enlarged zzso A zzso analysis coupled with zzso showed that zzso of zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso failed to restore the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso interact in determining zzso size zzso Among genes associated with zzso size, zzso zzso zzso whose zzso causes a zzso opposite to zzso are revealed to regulate zzso size upstream of zzso To fully understand the zzso size control, the genetic network of the related genes should be zzso
