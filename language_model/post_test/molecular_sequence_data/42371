To determine the role of zzso and zzso II zzso zzso zzso genes in hypertension, spontaneously zzso rats zzso were injected with synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed to bases -5 to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and to bases zzso to zzso zzso of zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by the application of 50 zzso of both zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso produced long-lasting (7 zzso decreases in blood zzso After zzso zzso treatment, zzso receptors were reduced in the zzso nucleus zzso and in the anterior third zzso area zzso Following zzso zzso treatment, zzso II levels were significantly reduced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating arrest of zzso II zzso The results demonstrate that zzso the brain zzso system by zzso zzso of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso lowers high blood pressure in the zzso The zzso administration to specific genes of the tissue zzso system offers the possibility of a new approach to developing zzso zzso
