zzso zzso of the human zzso protein has been performed by using a multiple predictions zzso As the sequence identity between the target and the template proteins is nearly zzso which is lower than the commonly used threshold to apply with confidence the zzso zzso method, we developed a specific zzso scheme by combining different sequence analyses and predictions, as well as model validation by comparison to structural experimental zzso The target sequence has been used to find zzso within sequence databases and a multiple alignment has been zzso Secondary structure for each single protein has been predicted and compared on the basis of the multiple sequence zzso in order to evaluate and adjust carefully any zzso zzso comparative zzso has been applied to create the model of the protein on the basis of the zzso sequence zzso The quality of the model has been checked by zzso methods and the structural features have been compared to experimental information, giving us a good validation of the reliability of the model and its correspondence to the protein structure in zzso zzso the model was deposited in the zzso Data Bank to be accessible for studies on the zzso relationships of the human zzso
