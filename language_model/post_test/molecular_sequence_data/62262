Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is an emerging infectious disease associated with a novel coronavirus and causing worldwide zzso SARS coronavirus zzso is an enveloped zzso virus, which contains several structural zzso Among these zzso spike zzso protein is responsible for binding to specific cellular receptors and is a major zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso In order to analyze the zzso and zzso ability of zzso S zzso we expressed the S protein in zzso coli using a zzso expression zzso After the zzso zzso S protein was expressed in the soluble form and zzso by zzso zzso to zzso The amount of S protein recovered was zzso bacterial zzso The S protein was recognized by zzso from SARS patients by zzso and Western zzso which indicated that zzso S protein retained its zzso By zzso zzso and Western zzso using zzso S protein as the probe, we identified zzso and zzso proteins in zzso cells that might be the cellular receptors responsible for zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggested that zzso S protein exhibited the zzso and zzso ability, and it could be a good candidate for further developing SARS vaccine and zzso zzso
