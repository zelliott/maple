In this paper we present zzso a zzso software package that features a unified set of procedures for evaluating the zzso data obtained from X-ray zzso experiments and for assessing the agreement of the atomic coordinates with these zzso The evaluation is performed completely automatically, and produces a concise zzso pictorial output similar to that of zzso zzso MacArthur, Moss & Thornton zzso zzso zzso zzso 26, zzso greatly zzso visual inspection of the zzso The required zzso are the zzso zzso and the atomic zzso Having those, the program summarizes relevant information on the deposited structure factors and evaluates their quality using criteria such as data zzso zzso uncertainty and the optical resolution zzso from the Patterson origin zzso The dependence of various parameters on the nominal resolution zzso zzso is also zzso To evaluate the global agreement of the atomic model with the experimental data, the program zzso the R factor, the correlation zzso between observed and calculated zzso zzso and zzso (when zzso In addition, it gives several estimates of the average error in the atomic zzso The local agreement between the model and the zzso map is evaluated on a zzso basis, considering separately the zzso backbone and zzso zzso as well as zzso atoms and zzso Among the criteria are the zzso average atomic zzso the local density correlation zzso and the zzso chain zzso The possibility of computing these criteria using the zzso procedure is also zzso The described software should be a valuable tool in monitoring the refinement procedure and in assessing structures deposited in zzso
