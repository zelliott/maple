zzso fusion is a process that intimately involves both proteins and zzso Although the zzso zzso which ultimately overcome the energy barrier for fusion, have been extensively zzso regulation of the energy barrier itself, determined by specific membrane zzso has been largely zzso Our findings reveal a novel function for zzso proteins in reducing the energy barrier for fusion, by directly binding and zzso zzso lipids to sites of zzso We demonstrate a specific interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso acid, in addition to multiple zzso zzso and define a zzso zzso region within zzso as its zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso that progressively reduced zzso binding resulted in a progressive reduction in evoked zzso Moreover, zzso analysis of fusion events driven by a zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso in fusion pore zzso suggestive of an energetic zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely rescued the zzso zzso seen with the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso D1 activity drastically reduced control zzso while leaving zzso zzso relatively zzso Altogether, these data suggest that zzso interactions are a critical zzso of the zzso of zzso fusion zzso
