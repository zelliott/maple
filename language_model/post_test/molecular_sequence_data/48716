zzso mouse embryonic stem cells zzso maintained in the presence of the leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso provide a powerful model with which to study zzso and differentiation zzso zzso zzso studies on cultured cells have led to the identification of three zzso zzso Here we focus on muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a small zzso of the Ras family zzso within the zzso gene zzso To zzso the effects of zzso on cell zzso and zzso we used zzso and zzso strategies in zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso in which zzso gene structure and protein sequence are zzso We show that persistent zzso of zzso in zzso reduces expression of specific master genes and that zzso plays a crucial role in the zzso of zzso and zzso protein levels upon zzso In zzso we demonstrate the potential of zzso to zzso cell fate at early steps of development and during zzso zzso of zzso allows zzso cells to retain responsiveness to zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso these results highlight novel zzso and zzso effects of zzso in stem cells and early steps of zzso
