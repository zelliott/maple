The zzso zzso proteins of the North American zzso zzso and European zzso I) zzso of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso share only approximately zzso genetic identity, and the functionality of N in both zzso especially its role in zzso zzso is still poorly zzso In this study, we demonstrated that the zzso 3' untranslated region or zzso of type I is functional in the type II zzso zzso Based on these results, we zzso that the zzso at position 90 zzso of the type II N zzso which zzso to an zzso in the type I zzso is zzso for virus zzso The replacement of zzso with zzso confirmed this zzso We then hypothesized that all of the zzso in the N protein could be replaced by zzso zzso analysis revealed that, in contradiction to previously reported findings, the replacement of all of the zzso either zzso or in zzso did not impair the growth of either type II or type I zzso Treatment with the zzso agent zzso inhibited zzso N zzso in living cells but not in released zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso interactions in living cells among the N and C zzso and between the zzso and zzso regions of the N proteins of both zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso linkages zzso the N zzso are not required for zzso viability and help to promote our understanding of the mechanism underlying zzso particle zzso
