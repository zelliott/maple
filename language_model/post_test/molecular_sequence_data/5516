zzso the role of the zzso zzso in membrane protein structure and dynamics is needed for zzso structure determination zzso However, the molecular details are not well zzso zzso dynamics computer calculations can provide insight into these molecular details of zzso zzso This paper reports on 10 simulations of individual zzso in explicit zzso zzso The 10 zzso were selected from the zzso structure as representative zzso membrane folding zzso The zzso is constructed of zzso zzso zzso The only major difference between simulations is the primary sequence of the zzso The results show dramatic differences in zzso behavior between zzso For example, zzso A has much smaller zzso zzso than does zzso zzso This can be understood in terms of the presence of aromatic zzso at the interface for zzso A that are not present in zzso zzso Additional motions are possible for the zzso that contain zzso side chains relative to other zzso zzso The results thus provide insight into the types of motion and the average structures possible for zzso within the zzso setting and demonstrate the strength of molecular simulations in providing molecular details that are not directly zzso in zzso
