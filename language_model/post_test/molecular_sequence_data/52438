We have characterized a series of mouse zzso zzso and describe both their zzso zzso recognition and Id zzso We also determined the V region gene sequences of these zzso in an attempt to correlate zzso recognition and Id expression with V region zzso All of these preparations recognize zzso that cluster around the zzso zzso binding site on the human zzso zzso However, we observed differences in zzso recognition among the zzso zzso based on either competitive zzso zzso or functional zzso such as zzso zzso Analysis of Id zzso using a zzso zzso generated against zzso zzso indicated that five of the seven zzso zzso expressed a shared zzso Based on V region gene zzso the V region zzso zzso from each of the seven zzso was zzso by the zzso gene family and expressed the zzso gene zzso Those preparations that expressed the shared Id with zzso zzso have virtually identical zzso zzso with a high degree of zzso in the zzso The zzso region gene sequences of six of the seven zzso also shared overall zzso and appeared to be zzso by the zzso zzso gene zzso The seventh zzso zzso region is zzso for by the zzso gene zzso The majority of these zzso used zzso gene segment, although the zzso and zzso gene segments were also zzso In addition, several of these zzso share a common sequence organization within their zzso joining regions that appears to involve N and P sequences to generate unique D zzso Together, these data suggest that differences in zzso recognition among the zzso zzso may reflect sequence zzso primarily within the zzso region of both zzso and zzso The basis for the detection of a shared Id most likely reflects the high degree of zzso within the zzso region zzso In addition, these data, which are based on a limited analysis, suggest the possible restricted use of V region zzso gene families in the secondary zzso response of zzso mice to specific zzso on the human zzso zzso
