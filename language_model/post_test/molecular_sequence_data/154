In plants, zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso are precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by a zzso zzso fatty acid zzso system that zzso four successive zzso zzso zzso reduction, dehydration, and a second zzso A zzso survey of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has revealed two sequences zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the first reduction during zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that both zzso and zzso genes were transcribed in zzso flowers, zzso zzso leaves, as well as developing zzso but only zzso transcript was detected in zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso were localized to the zzso zzso the site of fatty acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the two zzso proteins are divergent and that only zzso can restore zzso zzso activity similar to the native zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso revealed that loss of zzso function results in zzso zzso which cannot be rescued by zzso expression using the zzso zzso In contrast, a disruption of the zzso gene had no obvious zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that only zzso is a functional zzso zzso involved in zzso fatty acid zzso To investigate the roles of zzso in zzso development, transgenic lines expressing zzso interference and zzso zzso targeted against zzso were zzso zzso and zzso characterization of these lines confirmed that suppressed zzso activity results in a reduction of zzso wax load and affects zzso composition of zzso seed zzso and root zzso demonstrating in zzso that zzso is involved in zzso reactions zzso zzso for all these diverse classes of zzso
