We have observed that the zzso domain of T beta zzso and zzso zzso an inhibitor of the membrane attack complex of complement, share structural features, a distinct spacing of ten zzso and a zzso zzso Based on these common features and the recently determined zzso of zzso a three-dimensional model for the zzso domain of T beta zzso was zzso After energy zzso and molecular dynamics zzso a structure with four extending fingers zzso zzso and two clusters of charged zzso was zzso This model provides a view to the understanding of interactions between T beta zzso T beta zzso and zzso beta during zzso recognition and signal zzso
