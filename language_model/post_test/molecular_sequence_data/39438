zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso box proteins are required to specify zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed two types of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within core zzso and we show functional divergence in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (also known as GREEN zzso zzso is expressed mainly in whorls 2 and 3, and its expression pattern remains unchanged in a blind zzso zzso background, in which the zzso zzso function in the zzso is zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso organ identity protein only in the determination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated like a zzso rather than a zzso zzso is expressed mainly in whorls 3 and 4, and is zzso by zzso in the zzso thereby preventing involvement in zzso zzso A promoter comparison between zzso and zzso indicates an important change in regulatory elements during or after the zzso that resulted in zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, although zzso normally is not involved in zzso development, zzso zzso expression can restore zzso development in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we isolated both zzso and zzso genes from seven zzso species, suggesting that a dual zzso zzso system might be the rule in the zzso
