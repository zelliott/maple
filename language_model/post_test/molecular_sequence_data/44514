In this study, we aimed at analyzing the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso had been previously reported by two independent groups zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a human liver zzso library and from zzso derived from the human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of both carriers demonstrated zzso identity with the respective zzso zzso In their functional zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso differ only by one zzso from the respective mouse zzso Thus, zzso proteins demonstrate a higher zzso conservation than zzso proteins that are overall zzso identical between mouse and human and differ by seven zzso in the functional zzso The high degree of sequence conservation was reflected by the functional similarity of the human carriers with their mouse zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated transport properties consistent with zzso Unlike the mouse zzso and zzso whose transport properties could hardly be zzso the transport properties of the human zzso and zzso zzso showed clear zzso zzso had a zzso higher zzso affinity and was more sensitive to zzso than zzso In contrast to the zzso carriers, zzso exhibited a zzso lower zzso zzso a greater zzso zzso and was much less sensitive to zzso at zzso zzso zzso
