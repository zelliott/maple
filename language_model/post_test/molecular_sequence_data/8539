In order to look for a zzso zzso response in zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso specific for 24 zzso zzso zzso families were performed to compare the respective usage of each zzso gene by T cells present in zzso and zzso of 13 patients with zzso In four patients, zzso cells from two or three sites of inflammation were subjected to zzso In one patient, zzso tissue was studied at two different zzso of the disease, resulting in a total number of 19 samples of zzso cells, which were compared with paired samples of zzso zzso The results showed that whereas all 24 zzso gene families could be detected in both zzso and zzso cells, there was some skewing of increased or decreased usage zzso of particular zzso V beta genes among zzso zzso Three zzso families were often zzso in zzso V beta 3, V beta 17, and V beta zzso Moreover, V beta 4 was often decreased in zzso (7 out of zzso This decrease was statistically significant in the zzso population zzso zzso from different zzso of a given patient showed similar variations of zzso repertoire compared to zzso even 6 months later in the course of the zzso These results demonstrate a biased zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso This bias appears to be similar in different zzso and at different times in the course of the zzso No correlation was found between the bias of zzso repertoire in zzso and the zzso typing of these zzso
