Two closely related genes have been identified at zzso and zzso These genes show similarity to members of the zzso family of small zzso zzso and zzso differ by three conservative zzso acid changes over a total of zzso zzso Both are expressed in all zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that a zzso transcript is expressed in all zzso tested while a zzso transcript is specifically expressed only in zzso The size difference between these two transcripts is the result of differential zzso of an zzso within the 3' zzso zzso is located within the zzso region of zzso zzso maps to zzso the site of an ancestral zzso fusion event, suggesting that it also may be a zzso zzso
