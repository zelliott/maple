zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which is induced in zzso fish upon optical nerve zzso zzso consists of a highly zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso specifically catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso to produce zzso but the zzso relevant in zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we report the zzso structure of the zzso domain of goldfish zzso and describe its binding to zzso zzso The structure consists of a twisted zzso zzso zzso surrounded by zzso on both zzso Despite significant local differences mostly arising from a zzso insert in the zzso zzso the active site region is highly similar to that of human zzso Likewise, refinement of the zzso domain of rat zzso using residual zzso zzso gave improved agreement with the published crystal zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso point to a similar zzso mechanism for zzso and zzso The results suggest a functional importance for the zzso zzso zzso activity and hint of a link with zzso zzso
