We previously reported the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso which binds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Leung, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso These zzso proteins together with zzso comprise the zzso zzso of proteins that are involved in zzso zzso We now report the isolation of a rat zzso zzso a zzso zzso which specifically binds zzso in its zzso form and contains an zzso zzso zzso domain highly related to the human zzso zzso zzso and a zzso domain toward the C zzso The zzso binding domain is unrelated to other zzso binding zzso zzso raised against the zzso domain of the predicted zzso termed zzso alpha (for zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized a ubiquitous zzso zzso The brain zzso zzso by affinity zzso with zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso In cultured cells, zzso zzso was recruited to zzso upon zzso with dominant positive zzso zzso and was localized with zzso zzso at the cell zzso These results are consistent with a role for the zzso zzso alpha as an zzso for zzso
