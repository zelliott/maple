zzso zzso including zzso A and zzso III, are sorted to the zzso zzso in neuroendocrine zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso III binds zzso A and targets it to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso III has not been identified in adrenal zzso and zzso cells, where zzso A is correctly sorted to the zzso zzso In this study, low levels of a large and zzso zzso III have been identified in zzso cells and rat adrenal zzso Although the zzso III expression was limited in zzso cells, when the zzso zzso III lacking the zzso zzso zzso domain was expressed zzso zzso zzso A was unable to target to the zzso zzso at the tips and shifted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso III was able to bind the zzso form of zzso A, suggesting that a small quantity of zzso III is enough to carry a large quantity of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso III bound zzso a major zzso hormone in zzso zzso Indeed, small interfering zzso zzso III depletion impaired zzso retention of zzso A and zzso suggesting that they are zzso released to the zzso We suggest that the sorting function of zzso III for zzso A is common in zzso and zzso cells as well as in other zzso cells, and a small amount of zzso III is able to sort zzso A zzso together with zzso to zzso zzso
