Natural killer zzso cell receptors belong to two zzso but functionally analogous gene families: the zzso zzso situated in the zzso zzso complex zzso and the zzso zzso zzso located in the natural killer complex zzso Here, we describe the largest zzso zzso gene expansion seen to zzso We identified zzso putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso Many have arisen as the result of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were also zzso The zzso is split into at least two regions of the zzso 34 genes map to zzso 7, two map to a small zzso and the remainder are zzso in the current zzso zzso No zzso zzso genes from the zzso were zzso The massive zzso zzso expansion and lack of zzso zzso receptors represents the most extreme polarization of zzso receptors found to zzso We have used this new data from zzso to trace the possible evolutionary history of the zzso zzso zzso
