A zzso containing zzso at a and d positions of a zzso motif was zzso to investigate the possibility that zzso peptides with a zzso left-handed zzso packing motif would zzso Based on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso did associate in a zzso zzso although the association constant was significantly less than that reported for the right-handed zzso of the zzso A zzso zzso in similar zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso experiments conducted on peptides labeled at their zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso also indicated zzso However, analysis of the zzso data using the usual assumption of complete zzso for zzso pairs in the zzso could not be zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This led us to develop a general treatment for the association of zzso to either parallel or zzso structures of any zzso zzso zzso this treatment to the zzso data, constraining the zzso constant to be within experimental uncertainty of that measured by zzso zzso we found the data could be well described by a zzso equilibrium with only partial zzso of the zzso suggesting that the zzso are most probably zzso These results also suggest that a left-handed zzso zzso repeat motif can drive membrane zzso association, but the affinity is likely to be less strong than the previously reported right-handed motif described for zzso zzso
