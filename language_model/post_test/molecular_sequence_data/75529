The zzso zzso sequences of eight zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso zzso system zzso have been zzso All systems show similar sizes, and six of these systems exhibit the same molecular weight zzso zzso Several exhibit sequence zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were zzso The zzso leader sequences are believed to function in targeting of the zzso to the zzso whereas the characteristic zzso sequences are zzso to mediate interaction with the zzso protein zzso zzso One of the systems, the one specific for zzso exhibits distinctive zzso A pair of probable zzso sites was detected in each of the five most similar systems, those specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso One of the two equivalent zzso sites zzso zzso site 1) was located approximately 80 zzso from the zzso zzso of each zzso The other site zzso zzso site 2) was located approximately 440 zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso systems, approximately 320 zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso systems, and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso during evolutionary history may account for the different positions of zzso sites 2 in the different zzso zzso More extensive zzso zzso may have given rise to entirely different positions of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso A single, internal zzso zzso with characteristic features was found in each of seven of the eight zzso zzso The zzso zzso III of zzso zzso was unique in possessing a zzso zzso zzso rich in basic zzso zzso zzso zzso functions for these zzso segments are zzso
