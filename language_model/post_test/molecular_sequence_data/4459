The primary structures of three human forms of zzso carrier membrane proteins zzso have been deduced from full-length clones isolated from a zzso cell zzso library and confirmed by a combination of comparison to expressed sequence zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso The structures indicated that zzso are highly related products of distinct zzso and that the sequence identity of an individual zzso between different zzso species is almost zzso Analysis of the distribution of zzso among different zzso zzso and cells indicates parallel expression of zzso and zzso zzso and indicates that the three zzso are usually but not always expressed zzso The apparent zzso of two zzso (1 and 2) do not vary appreciably among species, while that of the third zzso is approximately 2 zzso larger in zzso cells than in zzso zzso of the zzso of the three forms within individual cells using double label zzso indicates extensive zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso however, zzso regions enriched for a particular zzso are readily zzso These findings suggest that the zzso may largely function at the same sites during zzso transport rather than in separate zzso recycling zzso
