A part of the zzso region of zzso type 9 zzso was zzso and an attempt was made for rapid virus detection in clinical samples obtained from 22 subjects hospitalized with zzso zzso The sequence identity of zzso products amplified from the region by zzso was zzso between the standard zzso type zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to Hill strain were positive in zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A high detection rate of zzso products was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso at admission, and in peripheral zzso cells zzso zzso at the end of zzso zzso zzso were zzso for 2 days in serum samples, and for 6 days in zzso samples after onset of zzso When specific zzso zzso zzso were less than zzso the amplification rate of viral zzso from serum samples was zzso These results indicate that the combination of specific zzso determination and viral zzso amplification from zzso will be a rapid and reliable method for early zzso
