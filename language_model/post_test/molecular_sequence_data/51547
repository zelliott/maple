Avian sensory zzso contain a population of normally zzso zzso precursors with zzso zzso The present study examines the expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene in quail zzso root zzso zzso by both in zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso In zzso zzso using quail zzso zzso as a probe demonstrated the presence in zzso cell cultures of zzso zzso in a zzso of cells that never express the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso precursor cells of zzso in culture is totally dependent on the presence either of insulin or chick zzso zzso The numbers of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso evolve in a closely similar manner during the culture zzso Using two zzso specific for highly zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso it was possible to detect the same band of DNA amplified by zzso in total zzso from zzso cultures grown in the presence of insulin, sympathetic zzso and adrenal zzso No amplified DNA was detected in zzso zzso zzso These data further indicate that, under the influence either of insulin or a still unknown factor contained in the zzso the zzso gene is induced in a zzso of zzso zzso
