We searched for novel imprinted genes in a region of human zzso zzso which contains several known imprinted zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of the zzso ( I zzso in P zzso and L zzso zzso which shows zzso expression and functional zzso with the maternal zzso active and the paternal zzso relatively zzso in many human and mouse zzso Human zzso is highly expressed in zzso and shows low but zzso expression in fetal and adult liver and zzso Mouse zzso maps to the region of zzso 7 which is zzso with human zzso and this gene is expressed in zzso and at higher levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso fetal liver and adult zzso Mouse and human zzso show sequence similarity to zzso , a gene which was shown to be essential for zzso expression and zzso to zzso in a T zzso cell zzso Like several other imprinted zzso mouse and human zzso genes are small and contain small zzso These data expand the repertoire of known imprinted genes and will be helpful in testing the mechanism of zzso zzso and the role of imprinted genes in growth zzso
