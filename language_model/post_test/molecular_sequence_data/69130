We show that the reverse zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso closely resembles viral zzso zzso zzso in initiating zzso synthesis opposite the penultimate C zzso of a 3' zzso structure and has the unprecedented ability for a DNA zzso to initiate DNA synthesis at a specific site in a natural template without a zzso The zzso zzso zzso can also use DNA or zzso zzso in a manner suggesting how a primitive zzso could have evolved from an zzso zzso zzso into zzso and other types of zzso The characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso suggest that it may be related to the zzso of zzso zzso and DNA zzso
