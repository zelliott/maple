The organization and expression of a putative zzso zzso gene zzso zzso proposed to relate to a zzso zzso signal zzso pathway, was characterized for the zzso important pathogen zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso gene is approximately zzso zzso in size, has 26 zzso and is zzso to produce multiple zzso via alternative zzso in its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed major differences in zzso organization, zzso number and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso transcripts was highest in the zzso and zzso larvae of the zzso compared with other zzso zzso somewhat distinct from zzso in zzso zzso In spite of a substantial zzso acid sequence identity in the functional zzso between the predicted proteins zzso and zzso overall, the findings suggest a unique functional role for each zzso
