The clustered zzso zzso are zzso zzso proteins that constitute a zzso within the zzso zzso In zzso they are arranged in three consecutive clusters named zzso zzso and zzso These proteins are expressed in the nervous system and are targeted to mature zzso Interestingly, different zzso express different zzso of zzso however, little is known about the functions and expression of the clustered zzso Previous zzso analyses that compared zzso and human clusters zzso the recent occurrence of gene zzso zzso Using standard zzso methods, I confirmed the prior zzso and I show that zzso are likely to occur through unequal zzso events between two, and sometimes three, different zzso zzso The results are consistent with the fact that these genes undergo gene zzso zzso events between different clustered zzso genes appear to zzso concerted evolution through gene conversion and gene zzso through unequal zzso In this work, I provided evidence that the unit of zzso of these genes in both the mouse and the human and within each cluster is the zzso The unit of zzso includes the zzso zzso sequence of an zzso and its promoter along with the zzso zzso region of the immediately upstream zzso in the zzso
