zzso acquire the ability for fast swimming early in zzso The zzso zzso accordion zzso zzso exaggerated and prolonged zzso on both sides of the body, interfering with the acquisition of patterned swimming zzso Our whole cell recordings from muscle indicate that the zzso is not zzso in zzso zzso However, imaging of skeletal muscle of zzso zzso reveals greatly prolonged calcium zzso and associated zzso in response to zzso zzso cloning of zzso identified a zzso zzso as the cause of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein in skeletal muscle that mediates calcium zzso from the zzso The zzso in zzso a zzso to zzso zzso is likely to result in compromised protein function that accounts for the observed zzso Indeed, direct evidence that zzso zzso causes the zzso dysfunction was provided by the finding that wild type fish injected with an zzso zzso directed against zzso exhibited zzso zzso and impaired zzso We conclude that the zzso dysfunction in embryonic and zzso accordion zzso stems directly from defective calcium transport in skeletal muscle rather than defective zzso zzso
