Three small and distinct satellite zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were recently described for a zzso zzso isolate harboring a zzso zzso Since characterization of these satellite zzso might provide insight into the virus replication cycle and zzso zzso full-length zzso to zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso has zzso zzso A zzso open reading frame that begins at zzso 37 was detected on a putative sense strand of zzso All satellite zzso were found associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that banded on zzso zzso Within carrier zzso satellite zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An in zzso zzso was established to assess replication of satellite zzso zzso generated from zzso zzso for example, served as a template for the viral zzso These templates had a polarity similar to that of the zzso intermediate found in the zzso zzso zzso the recognition of zzso zzso was shown to be specific, since unrelated zzso did not serve as templates for zzso under the same experimental zzso The data indicate that the zzso of zzso has a specific and essential sequence needed for recognition by the viral zzso and for subsequent zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso have zzso zzso albeit of unproven function, but which may be required for zzso
