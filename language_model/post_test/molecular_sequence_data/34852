The relationship between the design and functionality of molecular networks is now a key issue in zzso zzso of regulatory networks performing similar tasks can provide insights into how network architecture is constrained by the functions it zzso Here, we discuss methods of network comparison based on network architecture and signaling zzso zzso local and global signaling scores for the difference between two networks, we zzso similarities between zzso closely and zzso related zzso Despite the large evolutionary separation between zzso zzso and zzso their networks are found to be similar when difference is measured in terms of global zzso We finally discuss how network alignment can be used to pinpoint protein similarities viewed from the network zzso
