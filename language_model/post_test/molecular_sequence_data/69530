zzso of heat shock proteins following transfer of zzso coli cells from 30 degrees C to 42 degrees C depends on rapid zzso of zzso 32, a minor zzso factor specifically required for zzso of heat shock zzso The synthesis of zzso 32 is induced by enhancing translation of its zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso control of zzso gene fusion is zzso by two zzso zzso coding regions presumably involving zzso secondary zzso To further examine this model, we constructed and analyzed a set of gene zzso carrying base zzso or internal deletions within zzso including zzso zzso predicted to destroy the zzso secondary structure and zzso zzso zzso that may restore the secondary zzso The results demonstrate that base pairings between the translation initiation region of some 20 zzso and part of the internal complementary sequences are critical for maintaining repression during zzso growth and for modulating zzso synthesis of zzso zzso fusion protein upon temperature zzso Furthermore, some of the zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the heat induction depends on a specific zzso zzso as well as the zzso secondary structure within the zzso regulatory segment of zzso coding zzso
