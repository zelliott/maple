Fast synaptic transmission in the zzso brain is zzso by zzso channel zzso As some of these receptors have been implicated in learning and memory, it is important to understand their mechanism of action at a molecular zzso zzso receptors are members of large gene families of related channels that are gated by zzso zzso and the most abundant zzso zzso Within the last year, a number of important studies have focused on the ability of these channels to flux calcium zzso zzso entry into zzso through some of these channels triggers zzso zzso which can lead to changes in synaptic zzso presumed to be a requisite for memory formation, or if it occurs in zzso to cell zzso Recent studies that attempt to determine the channel structures responsible for this calcium zzso will be zzso
