The zzso intermediate zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso protein import machinery critically involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This leader zzso removes specific zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and components of the zzso genetic zzso To address the zzso role of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have initiated its molecular and functional zzso A full-length zzso was isolated by screening a human liver library using a rat zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso protein contained a typical zzso leader zzso and showed 92 and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso A survey of human zzso protein precursors revealed that, similar to zzso zzso is primarily involved in the maturation of zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that the zzso gene is zzso expressed in human zzso with the highest levels of expression in the heart, skeletal muscle, and zzso three organ systems that are frequently affected in zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso the zzso locus was assigned to zzso This information offers the possibility of testing the potential involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
