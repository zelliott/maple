zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the chicken and human zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the putative zzso site found in the variable region 1 zzso loop of zzso zzso is absent in the zzso region of zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso also appears to be zzso to zzso by human zzso and as a naturally occurring zzso zzso constitutes a unique model system for assessing the functional relevance of the zzso zzso zzso we zzso constructed a zzso zzso which contains the putative zzso motif zzso zzso zzso in its zzso zzso As a result of this zzso the zzso rate constant of zzso of zzso increased approximately zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and the ability to form zzso zzso complexes increased approximately zzso Furthermore, the interaction of zzso with zzso was also substantially zzso while the interaction with other members of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso protein zzso 1, zzso and zzso was unaffected indicating that the zzso motif is not a general zzso zzso inhibitor binding zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso degradation by cells expressing zzso is inhibited by zzso in a zzso manner, while zzso breakdown by cells expressing zzso zzso is unaffected by zzso Thus acquisition of sensitivity to zzso through a structural motif that enhances the specificity of the zzso interaction zzso to zzso an added level of regulation in the context of the zzso cellular zzso
