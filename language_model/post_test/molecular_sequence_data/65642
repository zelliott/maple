zzso regulatory proteins zzso comprise a single group of zzso factors systematically distributed throughout zzso and zzso In the zzso domain in zzso coli, zzso pathways are activated and zzso pathways are zzso by an zzso the zzso regulatory protein zzso in some cases in interaction with other zzso zzso By sensing the concentration of zzso zzso changes its association state between zzso and zzso to adapt the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso gene is regulated so that the concentration of zzso decreases in the presence of rich zzso In the zzso domain a large part of the metabolism of zzso zzso is regulated by another zzso zzso In the presence of rich nutrition, the metabolism is released from repression by zzso zzso of zzso is terminated by zzso forming zzso in interaction with zzso When the zzso is zzso the metabolism is arrested by a high concentration of zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the absence of zzso and repression of zzso of zzso is zzso Common characteristics of the master regulations by zzso and zzso hint at the zzso regulation once achieved in the common zzso of all extant zzso zzso of discrimination by zzso between DNA sequences and also between zzso zzso mostly zzso zzso and variations of zzso regulations observed with zzso and zzso are zzso
