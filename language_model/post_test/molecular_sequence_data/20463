Organic zzso zzso in aquatic zzso zzso diverse microbial zzso The colonization and growth of zzso bacteria are important processes in the degradation and transformation of the zzso The development of efficient and comparative DNA extraction methods is one of the most critical steps in the study of the composition and diversity of zzso bacterial zzso To evaluate whether different DNA extraction procedures affect the measurement of bacterial community zzso we compared four in zzso zzso procedures using zzso from three locations in a shallow zzso lake zzso zzso zzso The extracted DNA was analyzed using zzso zzso gel zzso zzso We found that the choice of DNA extraction protocol had a significant influence on the fingerprints of the zzso bacterial zzso This was shown not only in the number of bands but also in their relative representation of certain DNA zzso Using the zzso DNA extraction method in the presence of zzso zzso we found that crude microbial DNA could be extracted efficiently from different zzso zzso This protocol is zzso and gives very pure DNA of relatively high molecular zzso More importantly, the protocol provided more representative and zzso data on the diversity of zzso bacterial zzso
