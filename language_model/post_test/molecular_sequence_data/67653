In the present study, the first full-length zzso zzso zzso Y zzso was cloned from the brain of Japanese zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of Japanese zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso in zzso zzso a precursor protein of 97 zzso zzso which contains a zzso mature zzso zzso analysis showed that the Japanese zzso zzso zzso is similar to that of other zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso in Japanese zzso is mainly expressed in the brain, especially in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The effect of a negative energy balance on zzso gene expression was examined zzso The zzso level of zzso in the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed a pronounced increase after 4 days of food zzso The biological activities of Japanese zzso zzso were further investigated in zzso and in zzso zzso injection of the zzso zzso into Japanese zzso could zzso elevate the expression of the zzso zzso hormone zzso in zzso and the zzso hormone beta zzso the zzso hormone beta zzso and growth hormone zzso in zzso In zzso incubation studies, the zzso effects of zzso on zzso expression in zzso fragments and on zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells were also zzso However, in zzso and in zzso studies showed that zzso exhibits an zzso action on the expression of zzso hormone beta zzso in zzso The results indicate that zzso is involved in the regulation of multiple zzso processes in Japanese zzso
