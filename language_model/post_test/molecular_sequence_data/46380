The zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso activity of the innate restriction factor zzso by a mechanism that partly depends on its interaction with zzso a zzso zzso for an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso stimulates the zzso of zzso and that this zzso the relief of zzso Here, we show that zzso stimulates zzso of zzso zzso of all potential zzso sites in the zzso domain of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso abrogates zzso zzso However, a zzso sequence specifically mediates the zzso of zzso from the cell surface and the optimal relief of restricted zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is likely part of the mechanism by which zzso zzso innate zzso
