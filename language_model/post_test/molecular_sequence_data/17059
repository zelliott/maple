zzso the zzso gene of Type 1 zzso H found in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso protein exhibited zzso H activity in both in zzso and in zzso zzso The protein expressed in an zzso zzso zzso zzso coli strain functioned to suppress the zzso zzso associated with the lack of zzso zzso The in zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso H activity were similar to those of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso Type 1 zzso H to be zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso not only the zzso strand of an zzso hybrid but also an zzso strand of an zzso duplex in the presence of zzso or zzso The result of gel zzso column zzso showed this zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso study of essential zzso acids for zzso H activity indicated that this activity also affected zzso zzso A single zzso acid replacement of zzso by zzso resulted in loss of zzso activity but not zzso H activity, suggesting that zzso acid zzso required for zzso activity seemed slightly different from those of zzso H zzso Some reverse zzso from zzso can cleave zzso zzso and this activity requires the zzso H zzso zzso in primary structure and zzso characteristics between zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso imply that the zzso zzso might be derived from the zzso H domain of reverse zzso
