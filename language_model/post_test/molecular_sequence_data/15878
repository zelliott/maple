zzso zzso is highly zzso in zzso active, zzso zzso of zzso during zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso changes dramatically in response to different zzso zzso zzso is zzso in response to heat shock and during zzso stages of zzso zzso zzso is largely zzso during prolonged zzso and during elimination of parental zzso during zzso zzso of zzso sites within zzso indicates that zzso occurs at multiple sites in the zzso portion of the zzso predominantly at zzso zzso Two of these sites have been identified by compositional analyses and zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, two major sites contain the sequence zzso similar to that contained in the sites recognized by zzso zzso zzso in other zzso No new sites are detected during the zzso of zzso which occurs during heat shock or in early stages of zzso and no sites are zzso zzso during zzso or later stages of zzso zzso changes in the overall level of zzso zzso as opposed to zzso or zzso at particular sites, appear to be important in the regulation of zzso structure under these zzso zzso Further, since no cell division or DNA replication occurs under these conditions, changes in the level of zzso zzso are best correlated to changes in gene expression during heat zzso zzso and zzso We suggest that, at least in zzso zzso zzso is used as a rapid and transient mechanism for the zzso of zzso under conditions of cellular zzso
