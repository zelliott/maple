The major zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso and subjected to zzso sequence analysis providing extensive zzso acid sequence which was subsequently used for cloning the zzso zzso and zzso sequences revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was identical to a zzso zzso of a recently cloned zzso zzso zzso termed zzso Since zzso is not known to possess zzso zzso activity, we verified that the zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso are identical by Western zzso using specific zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso from crude zzso of rat brain tissue showed that zzso accounts for the major part of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso It is also shown that the protein is localized to the soluble zzso zzso of a truncated zzso protein demonstrates that the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene expresses zzso zzso zzso However, zzso analysis demonstrates that the zzso zzso activity expressed from the zzso gene in brain is due to a particular zzso zzso which contains a zzso acid insert as shown by zzso using a specific zzso raised against this particular zzso zzso
