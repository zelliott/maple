zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso antibiotics that are produced either by zzso cells lining the zzso zzso and zzso tracts or by zzso and zzso A growing body of evidence has implicated these peptides in host defense, particularly zzso innate zzso We previously reported the cloning of the full-length zzso for a zzso zzso zzso which was found to be expressed throughout the airway and oral zzso Here, we provide the structural organization of the zzso zzso showing that the entire gene spans approximately zzso zzso with two short zzso separated by a zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso mapped the zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso 1 within a region of zzso zzso to the zzso locations of human and mouse zzso and zzso We also provide several independent lines of evidence showing that the zzso gene is expressed zzso during inflammation and infection, despite its resemblance to many zzso zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso structure, and sites of zzso First, stimulation of primary zzso tongue zzso cells with zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso failed to zzso the expression of zzso zzso Second, zzso gene expression was not enhanced in either zzso or respiratory zzso of pigs following a zzso infection with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso direct zzso of the zzso gene promoter into zzso cells showed no difference in reporter gene activity in response to stimulation by zzso and zzso The zzso expression of zzso in airway and oral zzso which is consistent with a lack of consensus binding sites for nuclear zzso or zzso in its promoter region, suggests that it may play a surveillance role in maintaining the steady state of zzso on zzso zzso
