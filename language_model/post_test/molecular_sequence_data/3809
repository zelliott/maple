We present the complete coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from the zzso cell line zzso established from an individual of Spanish Gypsy ethnic zzso This cell was typed by zzso and reverse zzso as zzso but further characterization of the zzso gene by zzso typing zzso demonstrated zzso at zzso 78 zzso zzso With the aim of confirming this zzso zzso isolated from zzso was subjected to zzso using zzso designed to recognize specifically the zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso and the product was cloned and zzso zzso sequences derived from seven clones confirmed the zzso of zzso as they corresponded to two open reading frames of 801 zzso that matched either zzso or the recently described zzso for which a partial zzso spanning zzso 2 and 3, has been zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is consistent with a proposed association of zzso with zzso and zzso
