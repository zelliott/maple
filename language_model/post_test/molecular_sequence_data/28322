We have zzso zzso an zzso element isolated from a zzso zzso of the zzso locus zzso alcohol zzso in zzso The zzso element is zzso base pairs zzso in zzso has zzso identical long terminal direct repeats zzso and created a zzso zzso direct zzso of target zzso DNA upon zzso The zzso zzso is followed by a zzso primer binding site with zzso to the plant zzso zzso and the 3' zzso is directly preceded by a zzso stretch like that observed in zzso and zzso zzso encodes two overlapping open reading frames specifying peptides of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The longer open reading frame specifies a zzso with zzso acid zzso to the zzso and zzso acid binding zzso of zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso by zzso lacks convincing zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso despite the fact that this zzso domain is routinely the most zzso region of any such zzso The sequence and relatively small size of zzso suggest that this element is a deleted zzso that inserted into zzso with the aid of a reverse zzso function provided in zzso In zzso transcribed zzso complementary zzso was translated in zzso to produce both a protein of 81 zzso representing open reading frame 1 zzso and one of the zzso size predicted for the zzso fusion of zzso and zzso As with many other zzso the efficiency of zzso initiation at the zzso beginning zzso was not noticeably affected by the presence of one or more upstream, zzso zzso in the complementary zzso zzso
