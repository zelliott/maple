The tumor zzso protein zzso acts as a zzso zzso that can mediate cellular responses to DNA damage by inducing zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso and zzso has been proposed to be a means by which the activity of zzso is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally identified as a cellular zzso required for the zzso of a zzso complex, and zzso is comprised of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is part of the zzso factor zzso zzso complex, which is required for zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because of the similarities between zzso and zzso in their involvement in the cell cycle, transcription, and repair, we investigated whether zzso could act as a zzso for zzso by zzso While zzso H is sufficient for zzso of zzso we show that zzso is required for efficient zzso of zzso by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso can act as a zzso zzso factor for zzso zzso We have mapped a major site of zzso by zzso to zzso of zzso and have demonstrated as well that zzso is zzso at this site in zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are efficiently zzso by zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso can interact both in zzso and in zzso These studies reveal a potential mechanism for zzso the regulation of zzso with DNA repair and the zzso zzso zzso
