In contrast to zzso the evolution of zzso genes in birds appears to be characterized by high rates of gene zzso and concerted zzso To further our understanding of the evolution of zzso zzso zzso we have isolated class II B sequences from two species of New Zealand zzso the South Island robin zzso zzso zzso and the endangered Chatham Island black robin zzso zzso Using an zzso based approach we isolated four transcribed class II B zzso sequences from the black zzso and eight sequences from the South Island zzso zzso analysis indicated that all class II B zzso were contained within a single linkage zzso Analysis of zzso region sequences enabled putative zzso zzso to be identified in the two species, and indicated that multiple rounds of gene zzso have occurred within the zzso of New Zealand zzso The zzso relationships are not retained within the coding region of the zzso instead the sequences group within zzso A number of putative gene conversion events were identified across the length of our sequences that may account for zzso zzso 2 sequences are highly diverse and appear to have zzso under balancing zzso It is also possible that gene conversion involving short stretches of sequence within zzso 2 adds to this zzso Our study is the first report of putative zzso zzso zzso in zzso and provides further evidence for the importance of gene zzso and gene conversion in the evolution of the zzso zzso
