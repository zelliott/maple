The 26 S zzso is the central zzso involved in zzso protein degradation and fulfills vital regulatory functions in zzso The zzso core of the complex is the 20 S zzso a zzso particle with two outer rings each made of 7 different zzso zzso and two inner rings made of 7 different zzso zzso In the zzso 20 S zzso zzso zzso active sites reside in the 14 uniform zzso Their zzso zzso zzso released by precursor processing, perform the zzso attack for zzso bond zzso By directed zzso analysis of 20 S zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso we identified three active zzso zzso responsible for different zzso activities as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Double zzso harboring only zzso or zzso activity were zzso zzso of two potentially active site zzso zzso in the zzso zzso excluded its zzso involvement in any of the three zzso zzso The generation of different, incompletely processed forms of the zzso precursor in active site zzso suggested that maturation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is exerted by active zzso and occurs in the fully assembled zzso This zzso zzso activity might also account for processing zzso of the active site zzso zzso zzso which was unable to undergo zzso zzso
