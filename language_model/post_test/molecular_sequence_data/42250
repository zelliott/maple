We isolated several zzso peptides from extracts of whole heads of the zzso zzso zzso and the southern zzso zzso zzso using a zzso heart of zzso zzso for zzso We have now isolated from each species the zzso with the strongest effect on rate of contraction of the zzso The peptides were identified using zzso zzso sequencing and mass zzso zzso This zzso zzso has the same primary structure from both zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso originally isolated from the shore zzso zzso zzso and subsequently isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is additional evidence that zzso has widespread occurrence in zzso
