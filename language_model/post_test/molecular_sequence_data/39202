zzso an inflammatory disease of the zzso zzso generally caused by zzso infections, is the most frequently occurring disease in the North American dairy zzso zzso milk yield, milk quality, and zzso zzso as well as early zzso contribute to the economic losses associated with this zzso During zzso infections, cells of the innate immune system become activated through pattern recognition receptors that recognize zzso molecular signatures associated with the invading zzso The quality, timing, and intensity of the host inflammatory and subsequent immune response determine the fate of this zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is an important pattern recognition zzso that recognizes zzso associated with zzso bacterial zzso Its role in pathogen recognition and subsequent initiation of the inflammatory and immune response makes it a suitable candidate gene for enhancing disease resistance in Canadian zzso In this study, zzso in the zzso gene were identified in the Canadian zzso bull zzso zzso and zzso were constructed, and their associations with zzso cell score and zzso zzso were zzso zzso of selective DNA pools was used to reveal zzso in zzso Two DNA pools were constituted based on high and low estimated breeding values for zzso cell zzso A total of 3 single zzso zzso zzso including 1 zzso in a putative promoter region zzso and 2 zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso A total of 388 bulls were zzso for the zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso were zzso zzso in these regions were found to be associated with estimated breeding values for zzso zzso and zzso cell scores in the Canadian zzso bull zzso The zzso zzso at zzso and zzso were found at a frequency of 40 and zzso zzso zzso selection against these zzso is promising in Canadian zzso zzso against the zzso zzso T at zzso is limited because of its low frequency zzso Two frequently occurring zzso zzso and zzso occurred in zzso of the Canadian zzso bull population chosen for zzso The most frequent zzso zzso zzso was found to be associated with higher zzso zzso and lower zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso in the putative promoter region zzso was in a potential DNA binding zzso
