The application of zzso DNA technology to prenatal diagnosis of many zzso inherited zzso diseases is complicated by a high frequency of heterogeneous, new zzso zzso zzso gene deletions account for more than 50% of zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso and approximately one-third of all cases result from a new zzso zzso We report the isolation and DNA sequence of several deletion prone zzso from the human zzso zzso We also describe a rapid method capable of detecting the majority of deletions in the zzso zzso This procedure zzso simultaneous zzso DNA amplification of multiple widely separated sequences and should permit deletion scanning at any zzso zzso We demonstrate the application of this multiplex reaction for prenatal and zzso diagnosis of zzso
