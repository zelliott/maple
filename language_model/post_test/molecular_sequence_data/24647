zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso in plant cells and plays a critical role in many zzso zzso We describe the identification of a zzso zzso gene family zzso zzso putative zzso transport zzso Most members of the zzso family are expressed in a range of zzso zzso One member of this family, zzso functionally zzso a bacterial zzso lacking zzso transport zzso A second member, zzso zzso a zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso and increased the cellular zzso content of starved cells zzso during a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies in bacteria showed that zzso has highest affinity for zzso but may also be capable of transporting several other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso required for transport of these other zzso are beyond normal zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are highly sensitive to zzso zzso providing potential molecular targets for zzso toxicity in zzso Using green zzso protein as a reporter, we localized zzso protein to the plasma membrane in zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso gene family encodes a zzso transport system in higher zzso
