We have completely assigned the extreme zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum of a zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso by experiments involving sequential zzso enhancements between adjacent base zzso These assignments substantiate the zzso secondary folding model proposed by zzso and co-workers for this class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Forster, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso Forster, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 49, zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pp zzso zzso Press, Boca Raton, zzso No zzso due to zzso base pairs could be identified in the zzso spectrum, and addition of zzso to the sample did not produce additional zzso in this region of the zzso
