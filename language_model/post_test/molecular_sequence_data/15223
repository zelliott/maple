The zzso at zzso Bay, Western Australia, are zzso of some of the oldest evidence of life on zzso The aim of this study was to identify and zzso characterize the specific microbial communities associated with zzso Bay zzso zzso zzso Conventional zzso methods and construction of zzso zzso clone libraries from community zzso DNA with both universal and specific zzso zzso were zzso The estimated coverage, richness and diversity of zzso microbial populations were compared with earlier studies on these zzso The estimated coverage for all clone libraries indicated that population coverage was zzso zzso analyses of zzso and surrounding seawater sequences were performed in zzso with the zzso database of full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso The communities identified exhibited extensive zzso The most abundant sequences from the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso community was characterized by sequences related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All clones from the zzso clone libraries were related to the zzso zzso however, no zzso sequence was identified from the surrounding zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso also revealed zzso surfaces to be dominated by zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study is the first to compare the microbial composition of zzso similar zzso over time and examine the spatial distribution of specific zzso groups in these zzso structures and the surrounding seawater at zzso zzso The results provide a platform for identifying the key microbial physiology groups and their potential roles in modern zzso zzso and zzso
