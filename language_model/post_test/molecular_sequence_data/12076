A complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso a protein with high zzso to rat zzso zzso zzso protein was cloned from rat zzso by differential screening of a zzso zzso minus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that contained a zzso zzso zzso (a zzso domain with consensus zzso sequence zzso that was initially identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Nature 344 zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso Nature 344 zzso zzso and zzso zzso et zzso Cell 54 (1988) zzso in the zzso portion zzso zzso It shared an overall zzso identity to a rat zzso domain zzso protein zzso et zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso with zzso identity in the N zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity in the C zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso is expressed most abundantly in heart, lung and liver, moderately in zzso and skeletal muscle, and at extremely low levels (if at all) in zzso and brain zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso extracted from zzso or hypoxic rat zzso with a zzso of clone zzso as probe, demonstrated a single band with a mobility corresponding to a size of zzso zzso whose level was significantly decreased during chemical zzso
