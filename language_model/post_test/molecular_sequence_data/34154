zzso virus zzso is the zzso zzso species in Germany causing large numbers of mild to moderate cases of zzso fever with zzso syndrome zzso During an outbreak in zzso Germany in 2004 a novel zzso zzso designated zzso was identified as the zzso agent of zzso in humans zzso Here we present a molecular characterization of this zzso strain by investigating novel partial and almost entire zzso zzso zzso small zzso segment sequences and partial medium zzso segment sequences from bank zzso zzso zzso trapped in Lower zzso during 2004 and zzso zzso analyses confirmed their zzso as zzso zzso which is further subdivided into four geographical zzso The entire N zzso zzso an zzso zzso tag, of the Bavarian strain was produced in zzso zzso zzso and showed a slightly different zzso with zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso N protein of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso of human zzso from different parts of Germany and from Finland revealed only very slight differences in the diagnostic value of the different zzso zzso Based on the novel N zzso indirect and zzso zzso capture zzso were zzso By using serum panels from Germany and Finland their validation demonstrated a high sensitivity and zzso In zzso our investigations demonstrated the Bavarian zzso strain to be genetically divergent from other zzso strains and the potential of its N protein for diagnostic zzso
