zzso screening was used to select clones from a bovine zzso zzso library, which were specifically expressed in late zzso zzso One of these clones zzso the bovine zzso of the zzso Acute Regulatory protein zzso The bovine zzso gene is transcribed as zzso and zzso zzso which differ in their sites of 3' zzso Both transcripts are highly expressed in zzso zzso of mid to late cycle and through pregnancy, but only at low levels in the early zzso Northern analysis showed expression only in the corpus zzso and in the adrenal zzso but not in any other tissue zzso Within the protein coding region of the bovine zzso zzso there is a marked 124 base zzso to the zzso zzso region of another zzso transcript, zzso suggesting a possible common regulatory function for this zzso
