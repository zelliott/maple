In single isolated rat zzso zzso hormones induce zzso in zzso free zzso zzso in which the frequency of zzso depends on zzso dose, but the time course of individual spikes depends on the hormone species, rather than zzso zzso We have previously presented data using zzso and zzso as evidence of a negative feedback role for protein zzso C zzso in the zzso of the falling phase of zzso zzso We show here that the principal effect of three specific zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso the zzso aromatic zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso that act at different sites on the zzso zzso is a reduction in, or a complete suppression of, the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results resemble the effects of zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, following zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the addition of all three of these zzso zzso further reduces the zzso zzso frequency, with high zzso of zzso being the only agent that overcomes this zzso by zzso zzso These paradoxical results point to the need for caution in interpreting the effects of protocols involving zzso zzso and zzso in assessing the feedback control from zzso on cellular zzso zzso
