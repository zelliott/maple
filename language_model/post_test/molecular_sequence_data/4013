zzso zzso is an important pathogen of zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the major zzso of zzso zzso and it is involved in adherence to zzso respiratory tract zzso We previously generated seven rough zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 by using a zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso zzso C, zzso J et zzso Isolation and characterization of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Can J zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to characterize these zzso in order to learn more about zzso zzso zzso genes and their organization in zzso zzso and to determine the surface properties and zzso in pigs of these zzso zzso By zzso insertions in rough zzso four putative genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 1 were found within a region of 18 zzso This region is zzso to the gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso Two zzso showed zzso to a protein with identity to zzso zzso two others had the zzso zzso localized in genes zzso for two distinct proteins with identity to zzso zzso and zzso and three showed zzso to a protein which is known to initiate zzso synthesis zzso These four zzso were also present in zzso zzso zzso 9 and 11 that express an zzso that zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of some biological properties of rough zzso seems to indicate that the absence of zzso does not appear to have an influence on the zzso of the bacteria in pigs and on the overall surface zzso charge and zzso activity, or on zzso zzso An zzso zzso was included in the present study in order to compare the influence of zzso and capsule zzso on different cell surface zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso and not zzso zzso have a major influence on surface properties of zzso zzso zzso 1 and its zzso in zzso
