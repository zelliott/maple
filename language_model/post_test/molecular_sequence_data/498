The zzso zzso zzso was isolated from contaminated soil and identified by zzso zzso gene sequencing as zzso zzso When zzso was provided as the sole nitrogen source, the degradation efficiency in liquid medium was about zzso after 7 days of zzso with strain zzso The effects of zzso concentration and temperature on zzso were zzso Two zzso of degradation were analyzed by zzso Based on the identified products, strain zzso seemed to be able to degrade zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso of strain zzso to zzso soil resulted in a higher degradation rate than in zzso soil, regardless of the soil being zzso or zzso This microbial culture has great potential for the zzso of soil contaminated with zzso
