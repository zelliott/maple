The sequence of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso chain has the same length as, and shows a zzso degree of identity with, its bovine zzso With the zzso alpha zzso the sequence of which was deduced from that of its zzso the degree of identity is zzso counting as one difference a deletion of eight zzso in the zzso zzso The differences between the three genetic zzso associated with a high alpha zzso content in milk are simple zzso zzso alpha zzso differs from zzso alpha zzso by two zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso and 77 zzso zzso zzso the latter inducing the appearance of a zzso group on 75 zzso zzso alpha zzso differs from alpha zzso by three zzso 8 His zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso and 195 zzso zzso zzso The original type of zzso alpha zzso could be another hypothetical genetic zzso having the same zzso mobility as alpha zzso
