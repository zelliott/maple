The gene coding for the zzso specific zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and its zzso zzso The coding region was assigned on the zzso sequence on the basis of the zzso zzso acid sequence and molecular weight of the zzso The zzso gene coded for a protein of 580 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso indicated that the zzso sequence contained a segment of zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso In addition, some zzso regions were found in the sequences of type II zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso within the recognition zzso
