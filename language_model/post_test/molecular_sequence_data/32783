The crystal structures of a zzso and a zzso zzso a novel plant type III zzso zzso from a medicinal plant, zzso zzso were solved at zzso A zzso The crystal structures revealed that the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso shared almost the same overall zzso and that the zzso substitution dramatically increases the volume of the zzso tunnel by opening a gate to two hidden pockets behind the active site of the zzso The chemically zzso active site zzso zzso thus controls the number of zzso of zzso solely depending on the zzso bulk of the side zzso These findings not only provided insight into the zzso formation reaction, but they also suggested strategies for the engineered zzso of zzso
