A novel family of structurally and functionally related zzso has recently been detected that are now referred to as zzso Within this family, a zzso with the zzso zzso was shown to be zzso for memory T cells, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso thus suggesting it plays an important role in chronic inflammatory and allergic zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso specific for human zzso were raised and extensively zzso With these zzso zzso human zzso zzso were shown to express zzso zzso zzso by zzso Furthermore, similar zzso could be demonstrated in zzso for both zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso using Northern zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was induced upon stimulation with tumor necrosis zzso as well as with zzso alpha and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso These results reinforce the role of both resident and circulating cells in the production and release of zzso and their participation in inflammatory zzso
