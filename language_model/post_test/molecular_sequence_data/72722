Members of the zzso zzso of zzso proteins are involved in a variety of zzso processes including cell division and zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso all zzso zzso members reported thus far appear to play a role in zzso zzso while a different type of zzso zzso zzso appears to function in retrograde zzso To better understand the role of zzso in zzso zzso we cloned and characterized zzso a novel zzso zzso member from mouse zzso zzso encodes a 792 zzso acid zzso which contains the zzso motor domain at the zzso end of the protein and is most similar to members of the zzso family involved in cell zzso However, expression analysis localized zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells in the central nervous system, and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso is present in zzso and zzso of zzso in the central and peripheral nervous zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso with some, but not all, zzso transported zzso Finally, zzso of mouse peripheral nerves showed that zzso accumulates at the zzso and zzso sides of an zzso zzso Taken together, the data suggest that, unlike other zzso motor proteins that appear to be involved in cell division, zzso may play a role in retrograde zzso zzso
