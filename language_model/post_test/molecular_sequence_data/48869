A zzso zzso designated strain zzso was zzso from a zzso enrichment culture obtained from the zzso soil of zzso zzso of strain zzso are spiral zzso zzso and zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso has no zzso requirement for growth but can tolerate up to zzso % zzso zzso Internal zzso zzso are present as zzso zzso zzso is the only growth mode zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso lycopene and zzso as major zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso are required as growth zzso Major fatty acids are zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso and zzso are the observed zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso are the major polar lipids in strain zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the strain zzso clustered with species of the zzso zzso which belongs to the class zzso The highest sequence similarity of strain zzso was found with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso values of strain zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were 52 zzso 2 % and 45 zzso 1 zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso and molecular evidence, strain zzso is significantly different from the type strains of species of the zzso zzso of the family zzso and it is proposed that the strain be classified as a representative of a novel species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
