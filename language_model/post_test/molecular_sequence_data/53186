zzso identified initially as a fusion partner to the zzso zzso gene in human zzso and its related members, zzso and zzso have recently been shown to interact with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as with the zzso zzso In the present study, we show that the expression of the zzso zzso members is zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified for zzso In the brain, zzso and zzso zzso are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and cerebral zzso zzso The expression patterns of zzso and zzso zzso in the brain overlap with those of zzso zzso and zzso whereas the ubiquitous expression of zzso is consistent with that of zzso In zzso members of the zzso family are zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and germ cells zzso Our results on the overlapping expression patterns are consistent with the proposed interaction of zzso family members with zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso Although all three zzso family members bind to zzso and zzso zzso has the highest affinity for zzso followed by zzso and zzso We also demonstrate that zzso a major zzso protein in brain, can compete with the zzso family for binding to zzso and zzso We propose that recruitment of the zzso family by zzso to zzso pits can be regulated by zzso
