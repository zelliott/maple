zzso by zzso or zzso can be enhanced by interaction with several proteins or synthetic peptides containing the zzso zzso Recently we showed that an zzso zzso specifically inhibited this enhancement of zzso zzso by zzso zzso binding to the zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Goodwin, zzso zzso Allen, zzso zzso Anderson, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Now, we have zzso the zzso recognized by zzso to zzso Surprisingly, it is a zzso zzso that is expressed on the plasma zzso of all zzso cells, including zzso which express no known zzso On zzso and zzso but not on zzso this protein is associated with an zzso that can be recognized by an zzso 3 zzso In addition, both the zzso 3 and several zzso recognizing the zzso protein inhibit zzso stimulation of zzso These data demonstrate an association between zzso and the zzso protein on several cell zzso For this reason, we call it zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso may play a role in signal zzso for enhanced zzso by zzso zzso
