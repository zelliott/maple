zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso DNA zzso were combined with the zzso zzso chain reaction to obtain high resolution maps of the promoter regions for two zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso binds in zzso in zzso to a 16 zzso zzso sequence located in the zzso zzso In zzso the footprint pattern is extended relative to zzso consistent with the additional binding of zzso alpha 2 to the sequences zzso each end of the zzso A zzso was found adjacent to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso positioned so that the zzso zzso the zzso In contrast, such zzso zzso were not found for the zzso active zzso zzso in zzso where instead the zzso box appears to be bound to the general zzso factor zzso These observations support the hypothesis that zzso alpha 2 repression of zzso genes is zzso by zzso perhaps by exclusion of zzso from the zzso
