The structural properties of proteins recovered from random sequence libraries can be used to investigate the relationship between folding and sequence zzso Here, we show that zzso proteins displaying cooperative zzso zzso transitions can be easily recovered from a library containing zzso proteins predominantly composed of zzso zzso and zzso with an average zzso level similar to that of natural zzso The native structure of one of these proteins has a stability and zzso form similar to that of many natural proteins but differs in having no slowly exchanging zzso zzso
