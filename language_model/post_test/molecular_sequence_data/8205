During zzso development, avian and zzso skeletal muscles express a novel set of zzso T zzso zzso with higher zzso and more zzso zzso than their adult zzso In zzso these zzso result from the incorporation of a zzso regulated zzso zzso into fast zzso zzso To determine whether chicken zzso zzso are generated by a similar zzso we zzso 40 chicken zzso zzso from zzso and adult zzso Evidence for five zzso not present in the zzso gene was found, including one, zzso whose zzso is zzso zzso Although none of these new zzso are zzso with the zzso fetal zzso their alternative zzso superimposed on three zzso zzso patterns of the zzso shared zzso generates the chicken zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that chicken, and most likely other avian species, evolved an independent zzso zzso mechanism to generate zzso zzso that have the same zzso and presumably functional, properties as their zzso zzso
