zzso zzso a transparent envelope surrounding the zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso and consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso neutral zzso zzso chains obtained from a zzso mixture possess zzso zzso We have recently reported that among neutral zzso chains zzso and zzso chains have a zzso activity stronger than that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso chains are localized at the second of the three zzso sites of zzso In this study, we focused on the zzso of neutral zzso chains in zzso zzso and zzso can not be separated from each other unless the zzso zzso regions of their zzso chains are removed by zzso zzso A large part of the zzso zzso chains becomes neutral by the zzso but the main neutral zzso chains are not susceptible to the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso has three zzso zzso Three zzso each containing one of the zzso sites were obtained by zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso sites were revealed as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso structures of the neutral zzso chains from each zzso were characterized by two-dimensional sugar mapping analysis taking into consideration the structures of the zzso intact neutral zzso chains of zzso mixture reported zzso zzso and zzso chains were found mainly at zzso of zzso whereas zzso chains were present at all three zzso zzso Thus, zzso has zzso and zzso chains as well as zzso but the zzso of the chains is different from that in zzso
