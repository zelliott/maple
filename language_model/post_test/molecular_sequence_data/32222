zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso dependent zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the three-dimensional structure of zzso has been completely solved by the molecular replacement method to an zzso of zzso at zzso A zzso zzso information of the overall structure of zzso supplies a clear picture of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which are strongly zzso in other zzso zzso contact the zzso group of zzso These zzso are important as the main anchor within the active zzso zzso zzso and zzso of one partner zzso and zzso and zzso of the other partner zzso form a zzso network in the zzso active site which is specific for zzso It is also suggested that zzso interactions at the zzso interface are involved in the stabilization of the structural zzso The detailed structure will facilitate the development of zzso as an zzso zzso
