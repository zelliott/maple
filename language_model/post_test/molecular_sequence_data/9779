zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso have been shown to be one of zzso of the zzso drug zzso in the human and the zzso zzso zzso is a typical reaction zzso by these zzso However, various strains of mice were observed to have much lower zzso zzso activity than zzso rats, whereas other zzso activities in mice toward zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso by the zzso zzso in the zzso were comparable to those of the zzso zzso analysis of mouse liver zzso with an zzso raised against a rat zzso zzso indicated that the mouse liver contained a zzso zzso zzso related to the rat zzso zzso The zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, as well as testosterone zzso activity, a typical reaction of mouse zzso but not zzso zzso activity in mouse liver zzso We partially zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso of male zzso mice by monitoring the zzso with the zzso The partially zzso zzso was indicated to belong to the zzso zzso from its zzso zzso acid zzso but the zzso of the sequence to other zzso zzso of the mouse zzso was zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso had the zzso activities for the rat zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso in higher rates than those of the zzso but did not exhibit zzso zzso zzso Our result is the first finding that a mouse zzso zzso also zzso zzso for the rat zzso zzso in addition to steroids, but the zzso had a limited specificity for the zzso of the zzso zzso of the rat and the zzso
