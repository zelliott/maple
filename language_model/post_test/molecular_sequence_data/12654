zzso is the only established treatment for chronic zzso C but the zzso or zzso factors affecting the response rate to zzso therapy are not yet zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors zzso of response to zzso therapy in chronic zzso zzso 

Twenty-five consecutive patients with chronic zzso C were zzso to three regimens of zzso group A zzso zzso 7, 3 zzso every day for 3 zzso group B zzso zzso 8, 3 zzso every other day for 3 zzso and group C zzso zzso 10, 3 zzso every other day for 6 zzso We zzso serum HC zzso levels by competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and performed zzso zzso using zzso zzso deduced form the zzso region of the zzso zzso We also attempted to identify which zzso zzso and zzso factors in addition to zzso factors would significantly predict beneficial response to zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were 8 zzso zzso zzso were 2 zzso and zzso were 12 zzso of 22 patients who had received complete zzso The initial zzso zzso level zzso transformed copy numbers per zzso of zzso in sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso multiple zzso zzso analysis, the serum zzso zzso level before therapy was only the independent predictor of a sustained response to zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso level before therapy was the most useful predictor of a sustained response to zzso therapy for chronic zzso zzso
