We have characterized 33 zzso of zzso zzso from northern Illinois (32 zzso and Wisconsin (1 zzso representing the largest series of zzso zzso investigated to zzso The techniques used for molecular analysis of strains included zzso zzso typing with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling by zzso gel zzso of total zzso DNA, zzso zzso pattern zzso analysis by zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Saint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso of total zzso zzso zzso of zzso liquid zzso peptides derived from proteins showing high levels of zzso zzso zzso acid composition analysis of zzso and zzso zzso analysis of proteins with a zzso zzso of human zzso Five reference strains as well as two zzso tick zzso from California zzso and New York zzso were included for zzso All of the Illinois and Wisconsin zzso were typed as zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso were found to be zzso with regard to their zzso and protein zzso One isolate from Illinois possessed two zzso plasmids instead of the usual zzso zzso zzso patterns resulting from zzso zzso of zzso DNA from the 33 zzso and strains zzso and zzso were zzso into six distinct zzso five of which have not previously been zzso zzso zzso and an isolate from Illinois zzso shared an unusual zzso that is not typical of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they may represent a fifth species of zzso zzso zzso zzso Five of the 33 zzso and strains zzso and zzso showed high-level expression of proteins with molecular masses of approximately 22 zzso Investigation of these proteins by zzso of individual peptides and total zzso acid composition analysis indicated that the zzso proteins expressed by the seven strains were zzso zzso zzso By using a zzso serum of human origin, expression of zzso could be detected in all 33 Illinois and Wisconsin zzso
