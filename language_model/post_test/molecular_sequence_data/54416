zzso sequences minimally containing zzso zzso or zzso are sufficient to form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for subsequent zzso of complementary zzso The general lack of sequence restrictions should now allow for zzso of most any target of interest although reaction is most efficient when the zzso contain zzso zzso and do not form hairpin zzso
