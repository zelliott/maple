zzso zzso zzso zzso which make up a large gene zzso are known to play an important role in drug zzso The zzso family, one of the gene families of the zzso zzso has three zzso of genes whose sequences have been deposited in the zzso thus far: zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as fish confront numerous foreign chemicals in the environment that may accumulate to toxic levels unless they are zzso and eliminated by processes largely zzso by zzso zzso A new complementary DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the carp liver after a single zzso injection of zzso zzso The full-length zzso obtained contained a zzso zzso region of 198 zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso acids and a stop zzso and a 3' zzso region of 531 zzso The predicted molecular weight of the protein was approximately zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the carp zzso sequence showed a similarity of zzso with that deduced from our previously reported carp zzso It exhibited similarities of zzso zzso and zzso with those deduced from zzso zzso zzso zzso and Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed similarities with reported zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso human, zzso and mouse zzso respectively, while it exhibited a similarity of zzso with carp zzso The carp zzso sequence was aligned with the zzso sequences and has been deposited in the zzso data bank with the zzso number zzso The zzso tree constructed using fish and zzso zzso sequences suggested a closer relationship of zzso with zzso than with zzso The tree showed zzso existence of zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of the liver, zzso zzso and zzso revealed a distinct induced expression only in the zzso with no zzso zzso expression in the other zzso zzso
