The zzso of Madagascar are a unique radiation of primates that show an extraordinary diversity of zzso zzso and zzso However, very little is known about the relative zzso of zzso zzso due to the lack of zzso fossils for the zzso of zzso Here, we employ a zzso method to estimate divergence dates within the zzso radiation using several zzso gene zzso and multiple fossil zzso outside the zzso zzso Two zzso genes zzso zzso II and zzso zzso two nuclear zzso zzso zzso 1 and von zzso factor gene zzso zzso and one nuclear zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso 1) are used in separate and combined zzso The genes differ in zzso sampling and evolutionary characteristics but produce zzso date zzso zzso intervals narrow considerably in combined analyses relative to separate analyses due to the increased amount of zzso We also test the relative effects of multiple zzso single zzso points, finding that, when only single zzso points are zzso divergence dates are systematically zzso For the zzso DNA data set, we investigate the effects of sampling density within the mouse zzso radiation zzso zzso When only two representative species are included, estimated dates throughout the zzso are more recent than with the zzso sample, with zzso zzso less affected than recent zzso The difference appears to be due to the manner in which zzso on zzso ages are constructed in the two zzso In nearly all zzso the age of the zzso zzso is estimated to be approximately zzso zzso with initial radiation of mouse zzso and true zzso zzso zzso occurring approximately 8-12 zzso The zzso of the mouse zzso radiation is surprising given the near uniform zzso among zzso Moreover, the observation that mouse zzso and true zzso are of similar ages suggests discrepancies in rates of zzso zzso and zzso evolution in the two zzso particularly with regard to characteristics of sexual zzso These differences appear to correlate with the nocturnal zzso zzso zzso respectively, of these two zzso zzso
