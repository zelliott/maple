zzso zzso acid zzso in the central and peripheral nervous systems of insects are thought to assist in maintaining zzso zzso in the resting zzso below the zzso threshold of zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows strong identity with known members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of the insect zzso zzso was predominantly localized in the zzso zzso The function of the zzso protein was analyzed in cultured insect cells using a zzso expression zzso zzso infected with the zzso virus were found to exhibit a zzso increase in ability to accumulate labeled zzso compared to zzso cultures, and this activity was shown to be zzso Transport activity was further demonstrated by zzso identification of various zzso zzso accumulated by infected zzso Various zzso zzso zzso were used to outline the pharmacological properties of the cloned zzso and to compare it with known zzso zzso Despite the significant differences between insect and zzso zzso the characteristics of the respective zzso were found to be remarkably zzso
