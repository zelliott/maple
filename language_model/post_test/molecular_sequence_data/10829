We have isolated zzso zzso which are directed against the zzso Syrian golden zzso prion protein zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso The zzso did not recognize the fusion partner zzso or the fusion protein zzso zzso which lacks 67 zzso acids from the zzso N zzso The zzso region of zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso acids 23 to zzso zzso analyses suggest that the zzso zzso may fold into zzso structural zzso Replacement of the G zzso in the G quartet scaffold with zzso zzso destroyed binding to zzso completely, strongly suggesting that the G quartet motif is essential for zzso zzso Individual zzso zzso interact specifically with prion protein in brain zzso from zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso and cattle as shown by zzso obtained in the presence of zzso zzso No interaction was observed with brain zzso from zzso knockout mice zzso zzso of the zzso interaction was further confirmed by binding zzso with zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso in the G zzso scaffold were replaced by zzso zzso The zzso did not recognize zzso in brain zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso may provide a first milestone in the development of a diagnostic zzso for the detection of zzso zzso zzso
