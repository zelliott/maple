The zzso extracted from zzso shell zzso is a mixture of proteins and zzso that is thought to play a major role in controlling zzso synthesis and in increasing its mechanical zzso We investigated the zzso shell of the freshwater zzso zzso zzso to which we applied a zzso approach adapted to zzso shell zzso On one hand, the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and the five main protein bands zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso and analyzed by zzso followed by de zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in a similar manner, without any preliminary zzso In total, we obtained about 140 zzso of between 9 and 21 zzso as well as several shorter zzso Interestingly, it appears that the different protein bands share several identical zzso this has implications for the underlying genetic machinery that zzso zzso zzso zzso searches against sequences in the zzso protein database and the 800,000 zzso expressed sequence tag database were performed, but surprisingly, only a few obvious zzso were zzso Among the peptides that match with known zzso some from zzso and zzso proteins align with zzso zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso The evolutionary implications of our findings are zzso
