A strictly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the zzso hot spring located in the zzso geothermal area of zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene zzso as well as zzso zzso values, indicated that the isolate represents a novel species of the zzso zzso related most closely to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso and one unidentified zzso as major polar lipids and zzso and zzso as major fatty zzso which are both typical zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso The mean DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso A distinctive characteristic of the novel isolate was its extreme reliance on vitamin mixture or zzso extract for zzso Based on data from this zzso study using a zzso approach, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
