We developed a positive selection for zzso heavy chain zzso in zzso This selection is based on the fact that brief exposure to zzso causes zzso cells to release from the zzso whereas zzso zzso cells remain zzso This procedure zzso zzso function on a time scale of minutes and has therefore allowed us to select zzso zzso zzso after random chemical zzso of zzso zzso We developed a rapid technique for determining which zzso lie in sequences of the zzso gene that zzso the head zzso domain and localized 27 of 34 zzso to this zzso We recovered the appropriate sequences from five of the zzso and demonstrated that they retain their zzso properties when expressed from zzso zzso
