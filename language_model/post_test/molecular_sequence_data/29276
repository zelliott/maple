zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, is an important signaling zzso in B zzso zzso mice display zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso The role of zzso on T cell function and development of zzso inflammatory disease is not zzso zzso we examined the effect of disruption of the zzso gene on the development of experimental allergic zzso zzso a well-established zzso zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso mice had higher clinical and pathological severity scores of zzso when compared with wild type zzso The increase in the severity of zzso in zzso mice was not associated with a commensurate increase in the production of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mice with zzso showed zzso in serum zzso zzso zzso levels over that seen in zzso mice, along with a modest increase in the zzso levels of complement zzso and its zzso zzso in the spinal zzso Transfer of serum from zzso zzso mice worsened zzso in zzso mice, suggesting a zzso role for zzso zzso zzso in zzso These observations underscore the potential role of zzso in regulation of zzso disease and the role of zzso and complement in the development of zzso
