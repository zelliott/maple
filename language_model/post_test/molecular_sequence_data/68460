zzso zzso is a representative of a large group of zzso zzso genes in zzso coli that exhibit both zzso induction and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso was used to study the regulation of zzso We show here that in addition to zzso zzso the global regulators zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso and integration host factor zzso are involved in the control of zzso All three regulators zzso zzso the expression of zzso and they act independently from zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso in minimal medium can be explained by stimulation by zzso s combined with a relief of zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso in rich medium is zzso by the combined action of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the latter three proteins acting as transition state zzso The zzso start site of zzso was determined and revealed an zzso with an unusual long zzso leader of zzso zzso The regulatory region is characterized by a zzso zzso zzso promoter region and contains potential binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are clearly involved in zzso zzso none of these regulators is essential for zzso regulation of zzso
