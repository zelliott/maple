zzso zzso zzso resides within the zzso in the interior of the virus, which serves to protect the zzso against zzso degradation and to promote its reverse zzso To investigate the role of zzso protein zzso in the stability and replication of zzso zzso within the zzso we used zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso representing the zzso and 3' regions of the zzso to zzso functional zzso zzso The zzso complexes generated in zzso were found to be stable, which, according to zzso and genetic data, probably results from the tight binding of zzso molecules to the zzso and strong zzso zzso The zzso complexes efficiently protected viral zzso against zzso degradation and, at the same time, promoted viral DNA synthesis by zzso DNA strand transfer from the zzso to the 3' zzso template was very efficient in zzso complexes formed in the presence of both zzso but not when the zzso were in separate zzso These results indicate that the in zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes function like zzso zzso and thus provide a way to study at the molecular level this viral zzso and the synthesis of zzso DNA, and to search for new zzso zzso
