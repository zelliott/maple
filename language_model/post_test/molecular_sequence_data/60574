In zzso the zzso genes are expressed at early zzso stage in a narrow stripe encompassing the zzso boundary zzso a region from which a peculiar structure, the zzso is zzso zzso experiments in mice demonstrated that these genes are essential for the development of this structure and of its zzso In contrast, little is known about the effect of an zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso a zzso fish zzso zzso zzso zzso We have monitored the effects of its widespread expression following zzso injections in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that the zzso expression of zzso predominantly results in an altered development of the anterior brain, including an zzso of zzso zzso zzso No change in the patterns of zzso and zzso markers were zzso In contrast, expressions of markers of the zzso were strongly zzso in injected zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are essential components of the zzso genetic zzso were zzso expressed in this zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso de zzso formation of an zzso structure, which zzso with the development of zzso zzso structures, including zzso zzso A competence of the zzso to change to a zzso fate has been demonstrated in zzso graft zzso Our data demonstrate that this change can be zzso by zzso zzso expression zzso
