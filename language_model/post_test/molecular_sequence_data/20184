zzso expression of short hairpin zzso zzso to knock down target genes is a powerful tool to study gene zzso The most common zzso expression systems are based on zzso zzso zzso III zzso During the last years, several zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso have been reported in different experimental settings showing variable zzso In this study, we compare the most common zzso of these promoters in several zzso cell zzso For all cell lines tested, we find that several zzso zzso and zzso promoters containing single zzso operator zzso sequences show zzso background in the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso sequences show tight suppression of zzso in the zzso state, and high zzso responsiveness and high gene zzso efficiency upon induction in all cell lines zzso We report a zzso of the zzso promoter containing two zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso box that shows little zzso background in the zzso state and up to zzso target zzso when the zzso zzso zzso is zzso This zzso system for zzso gene zzso is a good candidate for use both in basic research on gene function and for potential therapeutic zzso
