A zzso was isolated from the blood and zzso of a zzso zzso The cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shaped or spiral zzso The zzso grows on sheep blood zzso as zzso gray colonies 1 zzso in diameter after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in ambient zzso Growth also occurs on zzso zzso and at 25 and 42 degrees C but not at 4, 44, and 50 degrees zzso The zzso can grow in 1 or zzso but not 3, 4, or zzso zzso No enhancement of growth is observed with zzso zzso The zzso is zzso and zzso at both 25 and 37 degrees zzso It is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso positive, and it reduces zzso It does not zzso zzso or zzso any sugar zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing showed that there are 91 base differences zzso 112 base differences zzso and 116 base differences zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso species, zzso The zzso content zzso and standard zzso is zzso zzso zzso and the zzso size is about 3 zzso Based on zzso zzso the zzso belongs to the zzso family of the zzso of zzso For these reasons, a new zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, for which zzso is the type zzso Further studies should be performed to ascertain the potential of this zzso to become an emerging zzso
