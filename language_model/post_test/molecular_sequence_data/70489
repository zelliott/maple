zzso for cell fate determination and cellular differentiation is under tight control of regulatory zzso zzso a nuclear target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an E zzso six zzso zzso protein that functions as a negative regulator of cell differentiation and proliferation in zzso Most members of zzso signaling pathways are highly zzso through evolution, yet no zzso zzso have been identified to date in zzso To investigate the degree of zzso conservation during evolution, we have characterized a zzso zzso from a sibling species of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results show that the organization, primary structure and expression pattern of zzso are highly zzso Both genes span over 20 zzso and contain four zzso with zzso at identical zzso The areas with highest zzso acid similarity include the zzso and zzso domain but there are other discrete regions with a high degree of zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso closest relative is the human zzso zzso a negative regulator of differentiation in zzso zzso In both species, Yan is zzso expressed beginning as early as stage zzso and zzso throughout zzso In third zzso larvae, Yan is expressed in and behind the zzso zzso of the eye zzso disc as well as in the zzso precursor cells of the zzso zzso zzso cells also contain Yan zzso Conservation of the structure and expression patterns of zzso genes strongly suggests that regulatory mechanisms for their expression are also zzso in these two zzso
