DNA zzso II is a nuclear zzso that zzso DNA zzso during several zzso processes and is the target of several zzso zzso The primary effect of zzso agents is to induce zzso The present study showed that zzso a zzso II inhibitor which forms zzso complexes, induced zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso a zzso zzso which does not form a zzso complex, induced zzso only in zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso II activity in zzso and zzso cells to a similar zzso zzso had no effect on the cell cycle of zzso cells, but zzso induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso stage followed by cell death without forming a DNA zzso on an zzso zzso zzso with zzso reduced the expression of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso has a mechanism of zzso which differs from that of zzso In zzso cells exposed to zzso we identified two clones that were suppressed early in the zzso One was highly zzso to zzso A1 which zzso zzso of selected transcripts or zzso zzso The other was a novel gene of which the function remains zzso These genes were also altered in zzso cells exposed to zzso which underwent zzso but not in those incubated with zzso indicating that the suppression of these genes is related to zzso DNA breaks resulting in zzso In zzso however, a zzso complex by zzso II zzso is not essential for the induction of zzso since it was induced by zzso This suggests that zzso nuclear zzso proteins other than zzso II, including zzso in the zzso should also be zzso The present findings also suggest that zzso derivatives are useful agents with which to study the role of zzso II in the regulation of gene expression as well as the role of the nuclear zzso
