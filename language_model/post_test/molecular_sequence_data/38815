zzso zzso of zzso to zzso occurs in various zzso and zzso sulfur zzso zzso as the final step in the zzso of reduced sulfur compounds and is zzso by zzso c zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso located zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potential, zzso zzso zzso zzso The organic component of the zzso zzso was identified as zzso contained in a zzso ratio to the Mo content of the zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso signal characteristic of zzso zzso However, zzso changes in the electron zzso resonance signal were not zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso exhibits a zzso mechanism involving two zzso zzso zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso were determined to be 27 and 4 zzso zzso the zzso was found to be zzso inhibited by zzso and various buffer zzso The zzso zzso which zzso the zzso appear to form an zzso which is preceded by a putative zzso zzso promoter and contains a hairpin loop termination structure downstream of zzso While zzso exhibits significant similarities to known sequences of zzso and bacterial zzso zzso zzso does not appear to be closely related to any known zzso zzso
