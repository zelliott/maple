A key next step in synthetic biology is to combine simple circuits into zzso zzso In this work, we expanded our synthetic zzso platform into a genetic zzso that independently controls the expression of multiple genes in zzso First, we designed and characterized zzso zzso to complete the foundation of the genetic zzso then we constructed the zzso zzso a testing platform that reported on zzso zzso DNA damage, iron zzso and zzso zzso concentration in single zzso As a demonstration of the zzso potential of our synthetic device, we built a metabolism zzso that regulated four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to control carbon flow through three zzso coli zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We provide direct evidence for zzso zzso of zzso flux by measuring zzso levels of the zzso zzso shifts in the activities of the relevant zzso and zzso and targeted changes to the zzso coli zzso The design, testing, and zzso of the genetic zzso illustrate the successful construction of a zzso system that can be used for a broad range of practical applications in synthetic biology and zzso
