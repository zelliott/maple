Human zzso is an zzso of zzso that displays unusual resistance to zzso zzso zzso and has been observed to cleave several such zzso as zzso Whereas substitution of zzso for the highly zzso zzso 193 in the zzso active site has been implicated as a critical factor in the inhibitor resistance of zzso how this substitution leads to accelerated inhibitor zzso is not zzso zzso pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso forms an extremely stable and zzso complex with zzso and thus provides a rigorous challenge of zzso zzso activity toward zzso zzso Here, we report kinetic zzso for zzso and the highly zzso (but inhibitor zzso human zzso zzso describing zzso by, and zzso of zzso as well as crystal structures of the zzso and human zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso with a rate constant accelerated zzso over that of human zzso zzso and zzso over that of bovine zzso From the crystal structures, we see that small zzso adjustments limited to several side chains enable zzso complex formation, zzso the predicted zzso clash introduced by zzso Our results show that the zzso interface favors zzso through zzso zzso zzso between the closely spaced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso elimination of two hydrogen bonds between the zzso and the zzso leaving group portion of zzso Our model predicts that these deleterious interactions accelerate leaving group zzso and zzso
