zzso is an zzso regulatory protein which is unique among zzso in that it is found as both an intrinsic zzso protein and as a zzso plasma zzso We demonstrate that plasma and zzso zzso are derived by alternative zzso initiation sites and message processing from a single gene 70 zzso long, containing at least 14 zzso Their message and zzso acid sequences are identical except at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence is derived from two zzso that zzso untranslated zzso while the plasma zzso zzso sequence is derived from a single zzso that encodes untranslated zzso the signal zzso and the first 21 zzso of the plasma zzso The two zzso initiation sites are separated by greater than or equal to 32 zzso zzso and zzso protection studies indicate that a number of cell types make both plasma and zzso zzso in widely varying amounts and zzso
