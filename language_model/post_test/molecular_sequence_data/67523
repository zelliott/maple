zzso resistance to zzso precedes fatality in zzso prostate cancer zzso However, strategies that target zzso resistant cells remain zzso Using zzso and zzso models, we identified a zzso of cells that survive zzso zzso This zzso lacks differentiation markers and zzso class I zzso zzso while zzso the zzso and zzso signaling zzso These cells were found in prostate cancer zzso and were related to tumor aggressiveness and poor patient zzso zzso targeting zzso and zzso signaling depleted this population through zzso of the survival molecules zzso and zzso suggesting a therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso resistance in zzso Finally, these cells exhibited potent zzso capacity, establishing a link between chemotherapy resistance and tumor zzso
