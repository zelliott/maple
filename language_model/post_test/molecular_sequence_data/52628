zzso is a type I integral membrane zzso zzso zzso which was originally cloned from rat zzso zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso of rat zzso The deduced zzso acids of zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso but very distinct zzso zzso We also cloned the human zzso zzso of which the gene zzso on the zzso zzso To better understand the regulation of zzso zzso we have determined the structural organization of the human zzso zzso The human zzso gene extends approximately 24 zzso and is divided into five zzso that appear zzso in zzso family zzso The zzso sequences of the human zzso gene contain a variety of potential binding sites for zzso factors and are capable of functioning as a zzso We zzso human zzso and evaluated its interactions with several zzso zzso It was found that basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso and tissue factor zzso inhibitor exhibited significant zzso zzso zzso but not zzso ABC zzso treatment, destroyed those zzso zzso thus, the zzso zzso chains of zzso appear to be responsible for those zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in peripheral nerve zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may possess multiple zzso functions, such as zzso zzso zzso growth promotion, and zzso via zzso zzso zzso in the cellular zzso
