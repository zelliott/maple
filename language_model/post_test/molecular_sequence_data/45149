zzso zzso proteins are involved in stabilizing stored zzso zzso and in recruiting zzso factors that mediate zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized two major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso sequencing, and zzso following zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso were recovered with free zzso or with zzso zzso In addition to the two zzso found for zzso an zzso derived from zzso was also observed to have five zzso acids zzso from its zzso zzso of quantitative real-time zzso indicate that both genes reached zzso rates of zzso 96 h after zzso of zzso and maintained relatively high levels throughout the whole life zzso zzso of zzso and zzso did not vary significantly under light or dark conditions, although production of the zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso exhibited light zzso Exposure of zzso zzso zzso to light conditions for as short as 9 h restored the modified zzso to levels similar to those found in green zzso Identification of zzso modifications in major zzso zzso proteins may help zzso their roles in zzso development and in plant zzso stabilization during the zzso zzso
