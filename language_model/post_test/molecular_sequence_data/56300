We have used a combination of restriction zzso length zzso zzso markers and highly zzso zzso zzso to map a common region of deletion on zzso zzso in zzso of the urinary zzso Analysis of loss of zzso zzso using zzso zzso was shown to be at least as sensitive as detection of zzso by Southern zzso A total of 110 zzso was zzso for loss of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso 109 patients were zzso for at least one marker on each zzso arm and 29 zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso 8 zzso 26 of which zzso showed zzso on zzso Sixteen zzso zzso showed zzso on zzso Thirteen of these also had zzso on zzso Of the 29 zzso with zzso five had zzso at all zzso zzso indicating loss of an entire copy of zzso zzso An association was found between high zzso grade and stage and zzso 8 zzso zzso per cent of grade 3 zzso zzso showed zzso compared with zzso of grade 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso for grade and stage zzso zzso mapping of zzso with zzso 8 zzso suggests the presence of a zzso zzso for zzso cancer within a region defined by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso If there is a common target for deletions in zzso and those in zzso and zzso zzso reported zzso this defines a common region of deletion at zzso
