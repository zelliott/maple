We examined the zzso in the Trail Road zzso soils, zzso Ontario, through zzso molecular zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of amplified zzso zzso zzso gene fragments revealed a more diverse type I zzso zzso zzso community than type II zzso zzso in 17 soil samples taken along a 50 m zzso The type II zzso community was less diverse, with the dominance of zzso in almost all samples, and zzso with high similarity zzso Also, the results showed that the zzso ratio of soil organic matter could significantly affect the zzso community zzso The zzso results were supported by sequence analysis of cloned zzso Members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X), and zzso zzso zzso appeared to be the dominant zzso From zzso zzso we isolated type I zzso zzso and 3 type II zzso zzso appeared to be one of the dominant bacteria species in the soil sample from which zzso were zzso
