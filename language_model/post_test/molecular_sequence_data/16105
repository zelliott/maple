A new method for labeling zzso was developed to obtain high specific activity of radioactive zzso In an zzso zzso two sequences were zzso One zzso the zzso contains 19 zzso and serves as a template for probe zzso The second zzso zzso contains a consensus sequence which forms a zzso I site after forming a complementary strand with the zzso In the presence of zzso coli DNA zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso a radioactive labeled zzso was zzso by the primer extension zzso After zzso I zzso the probe was different from its template in length by 4 zzso and could be separated from each other on zzso gel zzso zzso A radioactive zzso probe with extremely high specific activity up to zzso zzso could be obtained by the use of this zzso The zzso zzso have been used for the detection of the zzso E zzso in this zzso
