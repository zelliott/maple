In zzso a zzso spliced leader zzso is zzso to the zzso end of nuclear zzso before they can be zzso thus the spliced leader is central to gene expression in zzso zzso The spliced leader zzso genes in zzso zzso contain promoters with important sites at approximately zzso and zzso A complex forms specifically on the zzso element as shown by zzso mobility zzso The zzso shift complex has an estimated mass of 159 zzso An zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso shift zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the shift zzso zzso the shift, indicating that zzso is a component of the complex that interacts with the zzso zzso element of the spliced leader zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso are found near the spliced leader zzso gene promoter and the promoters important for zzso and/or U2 zzso gene transcription, as demonstrated by zzso zzso The zzso appears to interact with a subset of promoters in zzso with an affinity for short zzso zzso
