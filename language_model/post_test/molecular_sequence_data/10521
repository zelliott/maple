zzso zzso zzso is tightly localized to the zzso pole of the zzso zzso where the subsequent expression of zzso protein directs abdomen and zzso formation in the developing zzso zzso expression of zzso protein leads to lethal body patterning zzso The zzso message is zzso zzso before and during the zzso process, ensuring that zzso protein is only expressed after the zzso has reached the zzso An zzso zzso Bruno zzso has been implicated as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso using a novel approach to the expression cloning of an zzso zzso and the identification of previously described zzso in the arrest zzso as zzso in zzso The zzso zzso along with the binding properties of the protein and its pattern of zzso within the zzso indicate that zzso regulates multiple zzso involved in female and male zzso as well as early in zzso zzso experiments provide further evidence that zzso functions in the zzso repression of zzso zzso we find that zzso interacts physically with zzso zzso an zzso zzso that is a positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso belongs to an zzso zzso family of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso regulation may be zzso Models for the molecular mechanism of zzso function are zzso
