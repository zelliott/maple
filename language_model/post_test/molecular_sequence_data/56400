zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both extremely zzso zzso with a growth temperature optimum at 83 degrees C and 98 degrees C, zzso Both zzso contain an active zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso has recently been zzso We describe here the zzso and properties of the zzso from zzso zzso The zzso from zzso zzso was zzso zzso to apparent zzso and its properties were compared with those recently published for the zzso from zzso zzso The two zzso zzso were found to have very similar molecular and zzso zzso They zzso however, significantly with respect of the effect of zzso and of other zzso on the activity and the zzso The zzso from zzso zzso required relatively high zzso of zzso (1 zzso for optimal zzso at 90 degrees C but did not require zzso for zzso Vice versa, the zzso from zzso zzso was dependent on high zzso zzso zzso zzso for optimal activity but not for zzso Thus the activity and structural stability of the two zzso zzso depend in a completely different way on the concentration of zzso zzso The molecular basis for these differences are zzso
