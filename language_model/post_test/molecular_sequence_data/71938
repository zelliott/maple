The number of origins of zzso zzso zzso is important not only to our understanding of the evolution of resistance but also in modeling its zzso Previous studies of amplified zzso genes in a highly zzso zzso zzso have suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso can occur a single time and then spread throughout global zzso In order to provide data for zzso point zzso which are more typical of zzso mechanisms as a whole, we studied the number of independent origins of zzso zzso resistance in the red flour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso is zzso by single point zzso in the gene Resistance to zzso zzso which codes for a zzso of a zzso acid zzso zzso These point zzso are associated with replacements of zzso zzso which render the zzso insensitive to block by the zzso We collected 141 strains of zzso worldwide and screened them for zzso zzso strains contained resistant zzso After zzso 23 of these resistance zzso we derived a zzso sequence zzso of the resistant strains from a zzso section of zzso encompassing zzso 7 (which contains the zzso zzso and part of a zzso zzso The zzso also included six susceptible zzso chosen at random from a range of geographical zzso Resistance zzso fell into six zzso and three zzso contained both resistant and susceptible zzso Although statistical analysis provided support at only the zzso level, the pattern of variation in resistance zzso is more readily explained by multiple independent origins of resistance than by spread of a single zzso zzso For example, two resistance zzso differed from two susceptible zzso only by the zzso zzso itself, suggesting that they form the susceptible ancestors and that resistance arose independently in several susceptible zzso This suggests that in zzso zzso de zzso zzso for resistance have arisen independently in several zzso zzso zzso were found in geographically distant regions as well, also zzso that some zzso zzso have been exported in stored zzso These differences from the zzso study may stem both from differences in the population zzso of zzso versus that of mosquitoes and differences in zzso rates associated with point zzso versus gene zzso zzso The zzso data therefore suggest that multiple origins of zzso resistance zzso with specific point zzso may be more common than the spread of single zzso These findings have implications for the way in which we model the evolution and spread of zzso resistance genes and also suggest that parallel zzso zzso may not be uncommon in zzso zzso
