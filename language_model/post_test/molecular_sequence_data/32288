The zzso cell zzso protein zzso serves an important function in target cell recognition and zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso Atlantic cod zzso was identified in a zzso zzso library and zzso from Atlantic zzso rainbow trout, Japanese zzso and zzso zzso was found deposited in the zzso as zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of these receptors contain the characteristic functional zzso representing zzso and zzso analyses support the identification of five zzso zzso Cod zzso is shorter and has a different zzso organization from the common carp and channel zzso counterparts, but shows high extent of conservation in zzso signature zzso zzso real-time zzso analyses showed that the gene expression of cod zzso was higher in the zzso zzso head kidney zzso and zzso zzso compared to the organ with lowest zzso zzso gene expression was not induced by in zzso treatment of head kidney cells with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso zzso or by in zzso injections with zzso zzso or zzso killed zzso zzso These results show that the cod zzso gene is zzso expressed in zzso and that gene expression is not induced by the tested zzso
