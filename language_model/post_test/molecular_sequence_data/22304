zzso zzso zzso zzso are major sources of zzso oxygen species zzso and exist as a family of zzso with zzso expression and zzso zzso expressed in colon zzso and vascular smooth muscle, is suggested to be involved in innate immune defense and cell growth or zzso The zzso regulation of zzso appears to be particularly important in the zzso of its activity but the underlying mechanisms are zzso Here we have identified the functional zzso promoter in human colon zzso zzso cells, and show that a zzso zzso zzso encompassing the zzso site is sufficient to direct high levels of expression of a linked reporter gene in these zzso zzso analyses together with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso promoter activity is dependent on a zzso site, zzso between human and zzso within the zzso promoter zzso The ability of mouse zzso factors to zzso the zzso promoter was demonstrated in zzso cells and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site further demonstrates that the regulation of zzso zzso is zzso by the direct binding of a zzso factor to the zzso zzso zzso We also identified more zzso upstream regions which act to repress significantly expression from the zzso zzso
