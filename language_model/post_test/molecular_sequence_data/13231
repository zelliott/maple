zzso has been identified as a potential second zzso that may mediate cell differentiation and zzso after exposure to hormonal zzso such as 1 zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso or zzso The secondary cellular events that follow zzso generation remain zzso We report that in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso an enhancement of gene zzso of alpha zzso a small heat shock zzso The levels of alpha zzso as measured by Northern zzso and zzso zzso were increased by the addition of an zzso zzso zzso zzso or by increasing zzso zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Similar effects were not seen in the expression of the closely related zzso zzso To ascertain whether zzso gene zzso was a feature of the heat shock response, cell zzso was measured in heat shocked cells and observed to be elevated zzso immediately upon the return of cells to 37 degrees zzso Thus zzso formed after heat shock treatment of zzso cells may mediate the zzso events associated with the cell stress zzso
