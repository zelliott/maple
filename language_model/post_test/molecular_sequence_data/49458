We have determined the complete zzso DNA zzso sequences of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our zzso analysis based on zzso zzso protein sequences confirms the placement of zzso zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso order zzso with overwhelming zzso These four zzso sequences zzso the standard zzso zzso gene complement and, like certain other zzso zzso zzso a reduced complement of 7-9 zzso some of which require zzso editing to be zzso zzso zzso sequence elements were identified upstream of almost all zzso genes in the zzso of zzso and both zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso is zzso upstream of the predicted zzso or zzso start zzso of almost every zzso gene in these zzso The appearance of this G zzso zzso with the presence of a zzso zzso zzso at position 37 in the zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso features in these four zzso we propose that a 4 zzso interaction between the zzso zzso of these zzso and zzso zzso is involved in translation initiation in zzso zzso zzso a similar interaction may also be involved in zzso translation initiation in the sea zzso zzso zzso
