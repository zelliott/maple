The zzso and zzso genes of zzso are zzso regulated in the zzso of the early zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene is determined by a composite zzso made of three clustered zzso zzso zzso a zzso site, and the zzso element zzso We have investigated the basis of zzso expression of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso Enhancement of expression zzso to the region from zzso to zzso whereas full zzso regulation requires the region from zzso to zzso Four zzso zzso are present, three of which can be zzso by the zzso element from the zzso zzso zzso interference establishes that binding to the element located in the key region for zzso from zzso to zzso requires contacts with a zzso core sequence that matches the zzso gene zzso zzso DNA affinity zzso using the zzso gene zzso allows zzso of zzso zzso This zzso protein binds specifically to the key element, zzso to zzso and to at least two additional zzso elements clustered in the regulatory region of the zzso beta 5 zzso We conclude that both the zzso and zzso genes of zzso require the zzso factor zzso protein for zzso providing a mechanism for their coordinate regulation in zzso zzso
