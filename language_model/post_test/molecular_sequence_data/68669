zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso that invades animal cells and raises zzso zzso zzso The zzso does not enter animal cells by zzso zzso but the mechanism for invasion of animal cells has not been zzso We have proposed that the 177 zzso zzso zzso is zzso to a 45 zzso zzso zzso and one or more zzso zzso zzso that facilitate entry of the zzso zzso into animal zzso In this study, we report the identification of a sequence of zzso acids within the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is important for entry of the zzso into zzso zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso within the zzso zzso was shown to inhibit invasion of zzso cells by the zzso zzso In addition, this zzso inhibited the association of the zzso zzso with invasive zzso We propose that this domain is a site for interaction between the zzso zzso and invasive zzso
