zzso muscle and zzso tissue zzso II is a promising candidate gene for zzso diabetes zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso we investigated the association of zzso at four zzso zzso in this gene with zzso and insulin resistance in 110 Finnish diabetic patients with zzso and in 97 Finnish control subjects with normal zzso tolerance and a negative family history of zzso The four zzso zzso zzso zzso in the coding region of the zzso II gene were: zzso 251 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso CCC zzso zzso and zzso 766 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of each of these zzso did not differ between patients with zzso and control zzso In addition, subjects who were zzso for the less frequent zzso of each of the four zzso had a similar degree of insulin resistance, as determined by the zzso clamp technique, as did the subjects who were zzso for the common zzso in both control subjects and in patients with zzso In conclusion, zzso in the zzso II gene are not associated with the risk of zzso or insulin resistance in the Finnish zzso
