A protein with characteristic properties of a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso stage of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone containing the corresponding gene zzso was identified using a zzso probe derived by zzso zzso and sequence analysis identified a second zzso zzso just zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso a zzso zzso with zzso sequence zzso Both zzso and zzso are subject to zzso zzso They are expressed in zzso zzso cells but not in the asexual zzso produced on the surface of zzso zzso of the genes were barely detected in zzso zzso and were absent from fruit zzso Loss of aerial growth due to a zzso known as zzso was correlated with lack of both zzso
