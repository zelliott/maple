A DNA zzso was identified and cloned from zzso zzso zzso using zzso from zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a portion of this clone revealed two complete zzso highly related to zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso arrangement of the zzso zzso complex was nearly identical to that observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these genes and conservation of zzso organization were consistent with gene zzso of one of these genes in an ancestral zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso coli zzso was zzso to near zzso zzso of the zzso protein was verified by zzso zzso acid zzso sequence zzso
