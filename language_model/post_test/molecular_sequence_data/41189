Twin zzso proteins constitute a large protein family among all zzso are putative zzso of the zzso zzso import zzso contain a coiled zzso zzso zzso fold stabilized by two zzso bonds as exemplified by three structures available for this zzso However, they considerably differ at the primary sequence level and this prevents an accurate prediction of their structural zzso With the aim of expanding structural information on zzso zzso here we structurally characterized human zzso and zzso While zzso has two zzso interacting zzso zzso which sample a range of limited zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso zzso has a third zzso zzso interacting with an extension of zzso zzso which is part of the zzso zzso Upon reduction of the zzso bonds both proteins become zzso exposing zzso patches, with the result of protein zzso These results suggest a model where the molecular interactions guiding the protein recognition between zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurs in zzso when the latter proteins are partially embedded in the protein import pore of the outer membrane of zzso
