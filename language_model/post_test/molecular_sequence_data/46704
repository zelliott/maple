zzso zzso zzso mediate changes in zzso zzso and are important in the regulation of gene zzso zzso are involved in zzso progression and zzso and their deregulation is associated with several zzso zzso zzso such as zzso A zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso have zzso effects, as they can inhibit cell growth, induce terminal differentiation and prevent the formation of zzso in mice models, and they are effective in the treatment of zzso zzso Here we describe the structure of the zzso zzso zzso core, as revealed by the crystal structure of a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso that shares zzso identity with human zzso over 375 zzso zzso zzso in zzso and is inhibited by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso structures reveal an active site consisting of a zzso pocket, a zzso site and two zzso zzso systems, and establish the mechanism of zzso zzso The zzso that make up the active site and contact the zzso are zzso across the zzso zzso These structures also suggest a mechanism for the zzso reaction and provide a framework for the further development of zzso zzso as zzso zzso
