zzso zzso zzso form a diverse family of proteins of which most members inhibit target zzso zzso zzso is a member of this zzso Here, we have characterized zzso in the zzso species zzso zzso and found a high degree of zzso sequence zzso especially of the zzso center loop, of the zzso protein compared to zzso and chicken zzso zzso suggesting a zzso target zzso zzso zzso and protein were expressed throughout zzso development, while in the adult zzso high zzso expression was found in zzso and neuroendocrine zzso and the zzso zzso and the zzso protein was detected mainly in brain and zzso More specifically, in zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed higher in the zzso lobe than in the zzso zzso At the protein level, we detected a zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso two zzso proteins of zzso and zzso in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso and a zzso product in the zzso zzso On the basis of its relatively high degree of sequence conservation and its expression pattern, we conclude that zzso zzso may play an important zzso role, zzso as a zzso zzso inhibitor during development, and for proper zzso and neuroendocrine cell zzso
