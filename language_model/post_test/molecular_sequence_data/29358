zzso tandem repeats zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on 25 zzso strains to investigate the genetic zzso of zzso zzso to the closely related zzso Based on zzso analysis, all zzso zzso strains could be assigned to zzso which is the most commonly found type in the zzso Interestingly, a zzso was also observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso and with an exact match to the tandem repeats found in zzso zzso This finding has never been reported before in the closely related zzso According to the zzso zzso zzso strains clustered together and separated reliably from the closely related zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso was linked to the zzso zzso cluster and showed close relationships with zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that there was a strong correlation between zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso
