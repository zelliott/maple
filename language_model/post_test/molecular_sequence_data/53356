A shortened genetically engineered form of zzso zzso growth factor zzso that includes zzso acids zzso of the full-length sequence zzso zzso plus Met in substitution of zzso does not induce cell division even though it is recognized by the cell membrane zzso triggers the early zzso events, and retains the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso properties of the native full-length zzso Taken together, these properties make this truncated zzso a promising compound in the treatment of a wide assortment of neurological and cardiovascular zzso where zzso zzso activity is zzso zzso in biological activities between the shortened zzso and the zzso form have been attributed to lack of stability, and to the specific zzso acid sequence missing at the zzso Here we show that this shortened zzso form has a three-dimensional structure even more stable than the zzso protein at the zzso zzso zzso that this structure is similar to that of the wild type except at site 1 of interaction with the cell membrane zzso that its lack of zzso activity cannot be attributed to the specific missing zzso and that the zzso activity of zzso seems impaired by zzso of the three-dimensional structure of site 2 of interaction with the cell membrane zzso
