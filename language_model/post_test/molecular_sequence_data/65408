The key to successful cancer zzso is to induce an effective zzso immunity that will overcome the acquired zzso immune zzso In this study, we found that zzso cells zzso from multiple myeloma zzso patients suppressed rather than induced a cancer zzso immune zzso We demonstrated that zzso T cells from zzso patients suppressed the proliferation of activated peripheral blood zzso Further analysis illustrated that zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically induced the expansion of peripheral zzso T regulatory zzso cells in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso patients overcame the immune suppression and enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso did not affect the peripheral expansion of zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso Thus, the immune suppression effect of zzso cells in cancer patients may be overcome by improving zzso processing in zzso which in turn may lower the zzso threshold of the immune zzso zzso This concept of modulating zzso immunity by genetically engineering cancer patients' zzso may improve zzso regimens in cancer zzso
