Four strong T cell zzso have been identified studying the zzso response of zzso from zzso zzso zzso virus zzso immune zzso to zzso zzso synthetic zzso Three of these zzso are located on the zzso zzso zzso acids 46 to zzso zzso zzso acids 272 to zzso and zzso zzso acids 321 to zzso and one on the membrane protein zzso zzso acids 196 to zzso zzso zzso induced the highest T cell response and was recognized by immune zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso T zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso the in zzso synthesis of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso This response was directed at least against the three major structural zzso The zzso zzso specific for S protein zzso recognized zzso zzso and neutralized zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso defines a functional T helper zzso zzso T cells capable of collaborating with B cells specific for different proteins of zzso
