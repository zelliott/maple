The entire rat zzso C gene has been isolated from a rat zzso library, using the rat zzso C zzso as a zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that there exists at least two rat zzso C zzso The zzso sequences of the coding regions and the zzso and zzso regions of one of the rat zzso C genes have been zzso This gene is split into 9 zzso interrupted by eight intervening zzso The zzso region is similar to that of the human zzso C zzso but only the former has the core sequence of the zzso binding zzso The amount of transcripts of the rat zzso C genes was found to increase during development, and a similar increase was shown to be induced by injection of zzso As a candidate of a factor which regulates the transcription, we found a zzso protein by zzso zzso It binds to a specific site in the zzso region of the gene only in the presence of zzso zzso and it is present in the nuclear fraction of the gastric zzso but not of the zzso
