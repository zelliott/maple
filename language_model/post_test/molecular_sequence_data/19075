Although the abundance and diversity of natural zzso are well established, much is still unknown about the degradation of these zzso zzso zzso were used to determine whether, and which, bacterial communities could zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a diverse class of natural zzso According to zzso zzso results, several known zzso zzso were either not present or not enriched during zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso however, indicated that several zzso were enriched in the zzso cultures compared to zzso controls amended with zzso zzso One such group, zzso referred to as the zzso group, was further studied with a novel zzso method that confirmed enrichment of zzso group zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso The enrichment of the zzso group was again tested with two new sets of zzso zzso zzso was observed during zzso zzso zzso in one set of these zzso zzso In the other set, two zzso showed clear enrichment while a third did zzso The zzso group is a previously unidentified group of zzso distinct from but related to the zzso and zzso zzso this group also contains clones from at least four unique cultures capable of zzso anthropogenic zzso that have been previously described in the zzso This study suggests that natural zzso zzso may be effective zzso to enhance the zzso of pollutants and highlights the idea that novel zzso of zzso likely exist and may be active in zzso and the natural cycling of zzso
