Although the modification of cellular factors by zzso is an essential process in zzso zzso the identities of the zzso remain largely zzso Using a mass zzso approach, we have identified zzso new zzso zzso These zzso play roles in a diverse set of biological processes and greatly expand the scope of zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso appears to be the most prevalent process associated with zzso with novel zzso zzso found in zzso zzso machinery for zzso zzso I, II, and III, pol II zzso zzso complexes, and a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, our global analysis has revealed a number of interesting biological patterns in the list of zzso targets including a zzso of zzso targets within zzso zzso
