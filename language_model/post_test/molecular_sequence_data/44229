zzso zzso the primary zzso agent of zzso is the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, and new vaccines and drugs to combat it are urgently zzso The major zzso proteins of zzso zzso which are released into its zzso in zzso its host cells in humans, are leading candidates for a vaccine and prime targets for new zzso However, the development of these zzso has been hampered by the unavailability of large quantities of zzso zzso proteins identical to their native zzso In this report, we describe the zzso expression and zzso of four major zzso tuberculosis zzso proteins (the zzso 32, zzso and zzso zzso first, second, third, and eighth most abundant, zzso in rapidly growing, zzso zzso zzso Multiple attempts to obtain zzso of the proteins by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression systems were zzso suggesting that high-level expression and zzso of these zzso proteins require a zzso zzso All four zzso proteins were zzso expressed from the cloned zzso own promoters at yields that were zzso to zzso higher than those observed for the native zzso The four proteins were zzso to apparent zzso from culture zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso and molecular sieve zzso The zzso proteins were indistinguishable from their native counterparts by multiple zzso First, zzso zzso acid sequence determination demonstrated that processing of the leader peptides was highly zzso Second, sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis revealed identical migration zzso Third, mass zzso analysis confirmed that differences in mass were zzso or zzso 5 zzso A zzso of the zzso tuberculosis zzso protein was identified in zzso zzso by means of DNA analyses and zzso This is the first time that zzso of zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso proteins in their native form has been zzso This study opens the door to mass production of correctly processed and zzso zzso proteins of zzso tuberculosis in a zzso host and allows ready evaluation of their zzso and zzso zzso
