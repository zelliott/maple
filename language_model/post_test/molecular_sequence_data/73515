In order to clarify the role of the zzso zzso group in the recognition of DNA by small molecules we have examined the binding of zzso D and zzso to artificial DNA molecules zzso zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso in one of the complementary zzso These zzso prepared by a method based upon zzso present various potential sites for zzso zzso including several containing only a single zzso zzso group in different zzso The results show zzso that the presence of two zzso groups is mandatory for binding of zzso D to zzso zzso In the case of zzso only one zzso zzso group is required for remarkably strong binding to the zzso zzso zzso step, but the zzso step (which also contains only a single zzso zzso zzso does not afford a binding zzso zzso removing a zzso group zzso zzso is dominant over adding one zzso zzso No sequences containing just a single zzso zzso are zzso The possibility is raised that replacing zzso with zzso may do more than remove a group endowed with hydrogen bonding capability and interfere with zzso binding in other zzso The new methodology developed to construct zzso zzso DNA zzso for this work provides a novel strategy that should be generally zzso for studying zzso zzso beyond the specific interest in drug binding to DNA, and may help to zzso how proteins and zzso recognize their target zzso
