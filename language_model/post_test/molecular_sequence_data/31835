In this study, zzso and zzso analyses were used to study zzso peptides from the skin of zzso zzso zzso different zzso zzso precursors were characterized from the skin of zzso which produce 23 mature zzso peptides belonging to 12 different zzso To confirm the actual presence and characteristics of these zzso peptides in the skin tissue zzso from zzso we used two distinct methods, one was zzso zzso method that combined gel zzso zzso and zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and the other was zzso approach based on liquid zzso in conjunction with tandem mass zzso zzso In the zzso approach, incomplete zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis were used to increase zzso coverage and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Multiple species of zzso were chosen to test and analyze the zzso activities and spectrum of these zzso zzso
