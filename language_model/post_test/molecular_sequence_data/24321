The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso in the sequence databases as hypothetical, and that has not been assigned a function, has been determined at zzso zzso The structure reveals a fold typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a processed zzso zzso zzso is bound to the zzso further confirming the zzso function of zzso and its sequence family zzso An active site zzso zzso from bulk zzso interacts with an zzso possibly a zzso zzso which in turn interacts with the sulfur atom of zzso The zzso and nearby protein zzso delineate a small zzso zzso binding cavity of 162 zzso in zzso The environment surrounding the cavity indicates that the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso Many of the zzso that define the cavity are zzso in the zzso sequence family but are not zzso in other zzso zzso the zzso specificity of zzso zzso is unique and differs from the zzso specificity of all other zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso Commission list of zzso prompted a manual inspection of 10 possible zzso using computer graphics and suggested that the zzso zzso acids fit best in the active zzso
