We identified a putative pal gene cluster zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by sequencing zzso this cluster was found to be involved in zzso zzso and its functional importance was revealed by zzso zzso The pal gene products were highly zzso to those of putative zzso zzso transport systems but were not essential to bacterial growth on zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso genes showed the necessity of these genes for bacterial growth and zzso with zzso as the carbon source, but no zzso of zzso was zzso Growth on zzso and zzso was not influenced by the zzso
