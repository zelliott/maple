zzso is a zzso protein zzso that functions as an upstream zzso of the zzso zzso Previous work has suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso In this study, mass zzso coupled with comparative zzso mapping was used to directly characterize zzso in zzso zzso zzso Various types of mass zzso were used to analyze zzso zzso peptides separated by zzso zzso zzso leading to the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a site found on zzso zzso within a zzso region as zzso zzso zzso Additionally, porous zzso carbon zzso successfully retained and resolved zzso that had zzso along with zzso zzso and buffers in the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Following resolution by zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with alkaline zzso treatment identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as sites of zzso on zzso A zzso zzso immediately follows 7 of the 11 zzso identified zzso sites, suggesting that zzso may be a target of zzso zzso Finally, two-dimensional zzso mapping confirmed that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso is induced by the activated small zzso zzso
