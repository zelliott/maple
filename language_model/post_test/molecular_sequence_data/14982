A large variety of aquatic animals was found to emit the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide when nitrate was present in the zzso The zzso was ascribed to zzso by zzso bacteria in the zzso animal gut, and the exceptionally high zzso production ratio suggested delayed induction of the last step of zzso zzso and zzso animal species showed the highest rates of nitrous oxide zzso and predators the zzso probably reflecting the different amounts of zzso bacteria in the zzso We estimate that nitrous oxide zzso by aquatic animals is zzso important in zzso aquatic environments like zzso coastal marine, and zzso zzso The contribution of this source to overall nitrous oxide zzso from aquatic environments might further increase because of the projected increase of nitrate availability in tropical regions and the zzso dominance of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
