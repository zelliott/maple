Max protein forms specific zzso zzso complexes with itself and with proteins of the zzso gene zzso A large volume of data has accumulated on the role of the zzso zzso in cell zzso differentiation and zzso To zzso the role of max in regulating zzso functions and the effect of both proteins on cell proliferation and zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with a full-length zzso zzso human max gene and a zzso containing a double point zzso in the basic region zzso which zzso specific DNA zzso All clones expressing zzso grow slowly, and the process of zzso differentiation is zzso Furthermore, cells zzso with the zzso max exhibit growth zzso zzso in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and spontaneous zzso Our findings are consistent with a model in which a large excess of zzso in the cells enhances the formation of zzso zzso complexes, while elevated zzso zzso the cell of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, presumably by zzso zzso zzso and zzso
