zzso proteins are ubiquitous in zzso and are responsible for a variety of biological zzso zzso is initiated by the addition of zzso to zzso or zzso zzso though it is not clear how specific zzso are selected for zzso We have compared zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso based on sequences from zzso zzso and von zzso factor zzso that are zzso in zzso zzso zzso was derived from rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso liver and kidney as well as from human zzso The zzso zzso were zzso to a much greater extent than those containing zzso for all the zzso zzso Changes in reaction zzso donor zzso or zzso zzso were unable to increase zzso of zzso When the incubation time was extended, zzso in the zzso zzso was found to incorporate zzso at a low level, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso which did not zzso at zzso By circular zzso the zzso zzso was the only one of the series that did not exhibit random zzso zzso Our data suggest that although the structural and sequence requirements for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are similar, zzso sites are zzso less effectively than are zzso sites in zzso
