The interaction of zzso zzso zzso a DNA zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a stretch of 4 zzso zzso and their precursor duplexes has been investigated by circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a circular zzso band in the region around 310 zzso which is positive for the duplex forms but negative for the triplex zzso We observed that the binding of zzso to the duplex form does not induce the formation of the triplex zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso zzso more the parallel triple zzso than the zzso zzso Analysis of the binding process from zzso zzso shows that binding zzso to the triple zzso forms and to the hairpin reference duplex zzso are zzso However the binding site size is larger for the zzso zzso base zzso than for the duplex (2 base zzso
