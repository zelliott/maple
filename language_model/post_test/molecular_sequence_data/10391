zzso v 1, the major birch zzso zzso is a member of a zzso family; a number of zzso and zzso proteins from closely related species zzso zzso and zzso has been isolated and their zzso cloned and zzso zzso clones coding for zzso v 1 and zzso from apple and zzso were isolated and zzso Some of these clones contained intervening zzso The zzso formation is highly zzso throughout this family of zzso proteins in zzso plants and is also found in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested a possible common origin of the zzso position in these zzso proteins at zzso 62 in various families of flowering plants, including zzso zzso and zzso This zzso zzso zzso may point to a zzso zzso A zzso sequence motif zzso was also found in all members of this protein zzso Moreover, there is a certain degree of sequence similarity among the proteins derived from various species throughout the zzso and the only zzso zzso This fact is reflected by zzso from zzso and zzso zzso raised against zzso v zzso
