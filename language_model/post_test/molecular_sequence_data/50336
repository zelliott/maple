We have identified a zzso of human zzso zzso zzso causing a zzso zzso We used a zzso zzso to zzso a synthetic human zzso gamma zzso then screened the resulting zzso produced in zzso coli for proteins with altered biological zzso One zzso protein selected for detailed characterization exhibited less than zzso of the specific biological activity of native zzso gamma in an zzso activity zzso performed at 37 degrees zzso However, the protein bound the human zzso gamma zzso with native efficiency at 4 degrees zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso this protein showed that the zzso changed the zzso zzso at zzso acid 43 to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso acid 43 showed that this zzso zzso resulted from positioning a negative charge at position zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso using CD demonstrated that the protein had native zzso at 25 degrees C, but assumed an altered zzso at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso in this altered zzso bound poorly to the zzso gamma zzso at 37 degrees C, providing a rationale for the zzso decreased zzso zzso
