To make a comprehensive study of zzso resistance zzso distribution in the zzso zzso a collection of 577 clinical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso from a variety of geographical locations was screened to identify zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso identified were then screened by zzso analysis to determine the distribution in these strains of zzso zzso resistance zzso belonging to classes A to zzso G, and H that have been identified in zzso zzso Only classes A to D were represented in these zzso Although zzso B was the zzso zzso in all geographical locations, there were geographical and species differences in the distribution of resistance zzso An zzso of zzso designated zzso was identified and zzso and the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was found to have zzso to portions of a zzso zzso cryptic zzso and the zzso resistance zzso zzso This zzso and zzso were used as zzso markers to monitor zzso and horizontal transmission of zzso zzso zzso An analysis of zzso distribution of zzso resistance zzso and resistance profiles indicated that both zzso spread and horizontal transfer had contributed to the spread of specific zzso resistance zzso in these populations and demonstrated the use of these parameters as an zzso tool to follow the transmission of zzso and zzso
