Mouse zzso zzso protein plays a key role in limb zzso zzso is one of the zzso regulators with scaffold function, interacting with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified the human zzso gene by using zzso The complete coding sequence of human zzso zzso was determined by assembling zzso zzso sequence zzso position zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence for zzso position zzso and zzso zzso zzso position zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso were transcribed due to alternative zzso of the alternative promoter zzso The zzso gene at human zzso zzso was located between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was identified within the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso were identified as novel regions zzso among human zzso mouse zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain was almost identical to the zzso binding domain of mouse zzso Human zzso zzso zzso showing zzso total zzso identity with mouse zzso was found consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first report on the identification and characterization of the human zzso gene as well as the zzso and zzso zzso
