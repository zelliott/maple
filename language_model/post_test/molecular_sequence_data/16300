zzso defined zzso of the pig zzso B zzso locus zzso are correlated with different blood cholesterol levels and predisposition towards premature coronary heart zzso We show here that these zzso are associated with differences in the zzso gene by identifying six restriction zzso length zzso at the pig zzso zzso We have zzso a zzso zzso encompassing zzso 11 through 14 of one zzso and zzso zzso from the 3' one-third of zzso 26 to about 1 zzso past the last zzso from another zzso The zzso zzso acids of the pig and human zzso proteins are identical at zzso of these zzso One region close to the zzso of the protein is surprisingly different in pigs and humans zzso zzso but the zzso region is relatively well zzso zzso zzso Neither of the two putative zzso zzso zzso zzso sites is completely zzso in pigs and humans, but identical stretches of zzso acids occur near these sites more frequently than in the other zzso zzso We compare the zzso sequences of the region encompassing the putative LDL zzso sites from four pig zzso including one implicated directly in zzso None of the differences appears to account for the zzso zzso We conclude that significant differences in the physiology of LDL particles result from changes outside the putative zzso zzso
