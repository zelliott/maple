A system for addressing in the construction of zzso zzso can be based on the zzso of DNA zzso zzso and the capacity of these zzso to form zzso zzso complexes at targeted zzso zzso in zzso Using this system, zzso zzso have been created using two representative zzso zzso and M zzso zzso When zzso zzso is placed at the targeted zzso in each recognition sequence in a synthetic zzso zzso for M zzso zzso or zzso for M zzso zzso we show that the first recognition sequence becomes an address for M zzso zzso while the second sequence becomes an address for M zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso linked to the C zzso of zzso retained its recognition zzso That specificity served to address the linked zzso to the zzso recognition site in zzso With this assembly system components can be placed in a zzso order on the DNA zzso zzso spacing for adjacent addresses can be guided by the observed kinetic footprint of each zzso zzso rotation of the zzso protein can be guided by the screw axis of the DNA zzso The system has significant potential in the general construction of zzso zzso We anticipate that these zzso will be useful in the construction of regular protein zzso for structural analysis, in the construction of zzso systems as models of zzso and the zzso complex, and in the construction of zzso zzso
