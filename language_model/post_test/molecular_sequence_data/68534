We showed previously that zzso zzso zzso by cultured zzso firmly bound zzso zzso The proteins were derived from serum used for the culture and appeared to be zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In these regards, we named this zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso zzso of serum with zzso zzso under zzso conditions enabled us to prepare zzso complex without cell zzso The complex thus obtained from bovine or human serum was served for the characterization of zzso zzso with zzso and subsequent separation on zzso gel zzso yielded two zzso X and zzso Because of the block of their zzso zzso peptides were obtained by the zzso of X and Y with zzso zzso separated on zzso gel zzso and then subjected to the zzso zzso from X and Y showed a high degree of sequence similarity to the two heavy zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso inhibitor zzso respectively (over zzso with bovine zzso and essentially zzso with human zzso zzso with zzso against zzso supported the zzso zzso zzso of the complex with zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso complex were performed to identify the zzso zzso zzso sequences of the fragments suggested the participation of the zzso half of zzso with an zzso alpha zzso structure in the zzso zzso
