The zzso zzso one of the zzso genes on human zzso 2, has been isolated by screening a zzso zzso library with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of at least two zzso separated by a long zzso of 1860 zzso According to conceptual translation, the zzso protein is predicted to be composed of 416 zzso acid zzso Interestingly, the zzso protein has a zzso zzso eight zzso acids downstream from the zzso which is similar to that containing a zzso site in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso which exhibits a zzso relationship with the zzso zzso does not possess the sequence which is similar to that in zzso A comparison of the predicted zzso protein with the zzso protein revealed four regions of zzso acid sequence zzso an zzso zzso a zzso zzso upstream of the zzso the zzso and a zzso zzso
