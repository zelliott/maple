The external resistance zzso of microbial fuel cells zzso regulates both the zzso availability as an electron zzso and the electron flux through the zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso on zzso using zzso or zzso The average current zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a corresponding zzso potential zzso range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso a standard hydrogen zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a corresponding zzso range of zzso to zzso zzso zzso produced higher zzso efficiencies and energy efficiencies than zzso over all tested zzso levels because of electron and potential losses from zzso zzso zzso production accounted for 14 to zzso of electron flux in zzso but only 0 to zzso of that in zzso zzso produced similar levels of zzso regardless of the zzso However, total methane production in zzso increased as zzso increased, suggesting that zzso might influence the competition for zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso An increase of zzso to zzso zzso significantly changed the zzso bacterial communities for both zzso and zzso while operating at 970 zzso and 150 zzso had little zzso zzso and zzso were the major groups found in zzso communities in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were found only in zzso zzso were abundant only in zzso The zzso communities were dominated by zzso with significantly lower numbers of zzso These results show that zzso affects not only the zzso and current generation but also the zzso zzso community and zzso
