Two novel zzso mouse zzso tumor viruses zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were found in the zzso mouse zzso zzso females were crossed with zzso males to generate F1 zzso Foster nursing of zzso mice on zzso zzso zzso mothers resulted in the generation of a new mouse strain, zzso that had acquired a new zzso zzso zzso called zzso with a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the long terminal repeats of the zzso zzso and LA viruses indicated that LA virus resulted from zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed only in zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso of zzso mouse strains such as zzso In contrast, LA virus was highly expressed in the zzso zzso although it had the zzso region from zzso The LA virus, as well as different zzso viruses expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice, acquired a specific DNA sequence from zzso virus that is required for the zzso expression of zzso Since the Sag zzso by LA virus strongly zzso zzso T cells in zzso selection for zzso virus with the zzso sag most likely occurred because the increased zzso proliferation resulted in greater zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso As a result of the higher virus zzso zzso of zzso females developed zzso zzso tumors, although the zzso was only zzso in zzso zzso
