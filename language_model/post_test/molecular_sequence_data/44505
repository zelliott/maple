A zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso zzso that encodes an zzso which is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed based on zzso regions within the active sites of known zzso zzso and were used for reverse zzso chain reaction zzso of zzso isolated from zzso zzso A zzso product was isolated that had zzso to the active sites of known zzso zzso and was used as a probe to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence for the zzso domain of zzso is zzso to the known zzso zzso with strongest structural zzso to the zzso zzso However, all zzso and zzso proteins contain a characteristic zzso domain, and all zzso contain a zzso domain, neither of which is present in the zzso zzso zzso may thus represent a new class of zzso zzso
