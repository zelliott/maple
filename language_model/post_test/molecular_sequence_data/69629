What determines the precise sites of zzso in the two zzso reactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso zzso of the zzso G zzso at position 5 of zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso activates zzso at nearby zzso zzso A genetic approach was used to test the hypothesis that a zzso interaction between the zzso zzso site and the zzso zzso sequence of zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso site zzso zzso in zzso or the zzso (or zzso that were predicted to stabilize the interaction suppressed zzso zzso and increased normal zzso In addition, a zzso in the zzso sequence suppressed zzso of the 3' zzso site zzso These data can fit a model for the zzso active site comprised of a set of zzso interactions between the zzso U2 and zzso
