Southern zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso with a cloned zzso zzso as the probe indicated the existence of two genes on the zzso of the fungus which are zzso to the zzso As expected, two forms of zzso zzso I and zzso were actually isolated by zzso interaction zzso after a zzso procedure including ammonium zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso and gel zzso of the culture zzso zzso I, the first zzso zzso was the zzso form, and more than zzso of the total activity was attributed to this zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso of these two zzso preparations indicated that zzso I was the product of the zzso gene whose zzso had previously been cloned and zzso zzso et zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II, on the other hand, had similar zzso acid zzso but different terminal sequences which were not found in the primary structure of zzso I deduced from the zzso zzso These results gave lines of evidence for the expression of zzso different zzso genes and ruled out the possibility that the observed multiple forms are caused by zzso zzso The molecular mass estimated by zzso and the zzso point of zzso I were 64 zzso and zzso while those of zzso II were 66 zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso had essentially the same specific activities, zzso zzso pH zzso and optimal temperatures, but different pH zzso and zzso zzso
