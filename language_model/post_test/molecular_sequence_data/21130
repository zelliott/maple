zzso zzso protein 1 zzso binds to the zzso tail of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Previous gene knockout of zzso revealed that the loss of zzso caused a decrease in the total amount of zzso suggesting the zzso of zzso molecules without zzso zzso et zzso Am J zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2001) reported that zzso without a zzso binding site was found in the plasma zzso suggesting no requirement of zzso binding for plasma membrane zzso of zzso Here, the functional significance of zzso binding to zzso was examined to resolve these contradictory zzso In zzso cells, which zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused an increase in both the total amount of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso at the plasma zzso This provided new visual evidence of the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso to the plasma membrane upon zzso zzso An zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso reduced the zzso of zzso and/or its associated zzso zzso zzso without zzso binding site exhibited a modest zzso to the plasma zzso After reaching the plasma zzso these zzso zzso exhibited shorter zzso than the zzso zzso with zzso The results suggest a dual functional significance of zzso and its binding zzso 1) binding of zzso zzso zzso and increases its plasma membrane zzso by masking a zzso disposal zzso and 2) zzso binding is required for the zzso zzso
