zzso a sweet zzso consists of two zzso associated zzso zzso the A chain of 44 zzso acid zzso and the B chain of 50 zzso Two different primary structures have been reported for each of the A and B zzso The A and B chains corresponding to one of the reported zzso structures were zzso by the zzso zzso method using the zzso strategy in overall yields of zzso and zzso zzso The characterization of the synthetic peptides by zzso zzso zzso acid analysis and sequencing fully supported the expected zzso The individual synthetic A and B chains were not zzso Combination of the two zzso and subsequent zzso zzso gave zzso in a yield of zzso The synthetic zzso had a zzso lingering sweet taste zzso times sweeter than zzso and was zzso by a vapor diffusion zzso The synthetic product was identical to natural zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso These results indicate that the reported structure for zzso differs slightly from that of natural zzso
