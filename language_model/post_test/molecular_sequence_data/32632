Although the class I zzso receptors expressed by human and mouse natural killer zzso cells have distinct molecular origins, they are functional zzso that are expressed in a variegated zzso The zzso zzso class I receptors contain zzso promoters that have been proposed to control the zzso expression of these zzso Whether similar elements are present in the human killer zzso zzso zzso genes is a fundamental zzso A detailed analysis of the 2 zzso zzso region separating the zzso gene and the adjacent zzso gene revealed that additional promoter elements exist in the human zzso zzso zzso the previously characterized zzso zzso promoter possesses zzso promoter activity that maps to an 88 zzso DNA zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor binding zzso Individual zzso genes and zzso possess zzso promoters with distinct zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso precursors indicates that reverse transcripts from the zzso promoter are found in cells that lack zzso protein zzso but are not present in mature zzso zzso cells, suggesting that reverse zzso from the zzso promoter blocks gene zzso in immature zzso and precursor zzso
