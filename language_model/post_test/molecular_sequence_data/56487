The zzso of influenza viruses and zzso have been proposed to be primarily determined by a host cell zzso that activates viral zzso by zzso zzso of the envelope zzso We recently isolated a zzso zzso named zzso zzso from rat zzso and zzso zzso Clara cells, which is zzso into the airway zzso and activates zzso virus and influenza A virus zzso We report here that zzso in the zzso fluid inhibited zzso Clara specifically, having a Ki value of zzso zzso and inhibited the zzso zzso by zzso Clara in zzso and in organ cultures of rat zzso zzso infection of rats with zzso virus was shown to stimulate zzso of zzso Clara without changing the amount of zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in a preferable condition for zzso viral zzso and zzso
