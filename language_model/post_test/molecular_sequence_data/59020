Four species of zzso two species of zzso and one species of zzso were analyzed for the DNA sequences of their zzso zzso In addition to these seven species, we analyzed the published or available sequence data of ten related zzso in zzso zzso and zzso By zzso the base substitution rate between each pair of species, and by constructing zzso trees we concluded that: 1) In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are much more closely related than expected zzso this confirms the conclusion of zzso et zzso zzso 2) The new zzso of zzso species proposed by zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso is consistent with the zzso zzso 3) The zzso and the zzso should be separated from the zzso as concluded by zzso et zzso zzso 4) The separation of zzso from other zzso in the zzso has a solid molecular zzso
