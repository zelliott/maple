zzso zzso pumps of bacteria are involved in the resistance to various antibiotics and toxic zzso In zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes resembling zzso zzso pump genes were identified and designated zzso and zzso zzso was obtained after the screening of zzso zzso that are zzso by zzso released zzso The predicted gene products of zzso shared significant zzso to membrane fusion and major zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso formed on average zzso less zzso in zzso while zzso of zzso and zzso had enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso and salicylic acid, compared with the zzso zzso zzso resistance genes zzso from zzso coli zzso an zzso zzso from zzso zzso for resistance to high zzso of zzso
