zzso K zzso is a newly identified zzso We showed that zzso incorporation into zzso was dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso binding zzso demonstrated that human zzso bound to the zzso zzso element through the zzso zzso base pair quartet but not the zzso zzso zzso of the expression pattern revealed that human zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso localized to the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso attenuated the zzso zzso oxygen species level and protected cells from zzso zzso toxicity in zzso Our findings indicated that zzso is a novel zzso in zzso and is related to the regulation of cellular zzso zzso
