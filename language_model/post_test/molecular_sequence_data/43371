zzso zzso of human zzso zzso by zzso human zzso cells results in a zzso active zzso with reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso inhibitor type zzso We mapped the zzso zzso zzso by analyzing the in zzso zzso state of engineered zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not incorporate radioactive zzso into zzso zzso in which the zzso 138 and zzso have been replaced with zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso is zzso on A and B zzso Moreover, the zzso ability of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and promote adherence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was zzso We found that zzso zzso as well as the naturally occurring zzso at positions 138 and zzso abolish zzso ability, although they do not interfere with zzso zzso In addition, zzso carrying zzso lacks the capability to induce a zzso response of zzso zzso The exclusive presence of zzso reduces zzso zzso and zzso ability by zzso indicating that a zzso zzso at the same position plays a major zzso role of zzso cell response to zzso The zzso does not affect zzso ability to interact with zzso or to enhance binding of zzso zzso to zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso does not induce zzso polarization in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the data support the possibility that zzso zzso on zzso can zzso zzso zzso zzso
