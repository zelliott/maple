The small zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso and one of its major zzso is the exchange factor zzso zzso site opener zzso also called zzso zzso zzso zzso must be recruited from the zzso to the plasma membrane in order to activate zzso and in addition to a zzso zzso domain it contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain that binds zzso zzso zzso zzso and its three relatives, zzso zzso and zzso are expressed as two zzso zzso with either two or three zzso in a loop in the zzso pocket of the zzso domain zzso zzso The zzso form binds zzso with high affinity and mediates recruitment of zzso to the plasma membrane in response to insulin and growth factors zzso zzso However, the zzso form has only zzso affinity for both zzso and zzso affinities that are insufficient to zzso membrane zzso raising the question of how the zzso forms of zzso are regulated zzso zzso Here we show that three related zzso zzso of unknown function, zzso zzso and zzso are able to recruit zzso and other zzso to the plasma membrane by binding to their zzso zzso irrespective of whether they are in the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso family thus defines a zzso zzso that can mediate the zzso recruitment of zzso independently of a requirement for the generation of zzso
