Despite our advances, much remains to be zzso about the molecular mechanisms of damage zzso zzso Although some aspects of the intricate protein interactions that lead to the formation of the zzso have been determined, the precise nature of the interactions between pol III and the zzso proteins remains entirely zzso Further progress will depend on the development of a completely zzso cell free zzso bypass system in zzso as well as structural zzso of the zzso in its entirety before we understand how error prone zzso DNA synthesis is zzso Even if a structural zzso of the zzso coli zzso does not exist in higher organisms, it seems quite likely that a functionally zzso zzso zzso will indeed be zzso Such an active zzso process in animal cells would certainly have significant implications for our understanding of the mechanisms of genetic instability, as well as of human zzso and other zzso associated with the formation of zzso in zzso
