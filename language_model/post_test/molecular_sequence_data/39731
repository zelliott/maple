White Spot zzso zzso a member of the virus family zzso is a large zzso virus infecting shrimp and other zzso zzso Although limited information is available on the mode of transcription, previous data suggest that zzso gene expression occurs in a coordinated and zzso zzso To search in zzso for zzso promoter motifs zzso the abundance of all 4 through 8 zzso motifs in the upstream sequences of zzso genes relative to the complete zzso was determined, and zzso a zzso search was performed in the upstream sequences of either early or late zzso zzso as assigned by zzso zzso Both methods were validated by alignments of zzso determined zzso ends of various zzso zzso 

The collective information shows that the upstream region of early zzso zzso containing a zzso box and an zzso is similar to zzso zzso zzso II core promoter zzso suggesting zzso of the cellular zzso machinery for generating early zzso The alignment of the zzso ends of known well-established late zzso including all major structural protein zzso identified a zzso motif zzso which could be involved in zzso late zzso For these zzso only one contained a functional zzso zzso However, almost half of the zzso late zzso as previously assigned by zzso analysis, did contain a zzso box in their upstream zzso 

The data may suggest the presence of two separate classes of late zzso zzso one exploiting the cellular zzso zzso II system for zzso synthesis and the other generating zzso by a new zzso zzso zzso
