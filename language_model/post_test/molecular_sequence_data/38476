We have developed a zzso model of a zzso complex to screen drug candidates for zzso zzso In a series of sugar zzso studies of the zzso zzso zzso Lewis X zzso we have already found a potent compound, a zzso zzso analogue zzso and also have proposed how compound 1 binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997, 40, zzso To find drug candidates that fit into the binding pocket of zzso we constructed an original zzso model from structural information of a compound zzso complex model and screened lead compounds for zzso zzso using a commercially available database zzso As a result, we discovered a lead compound zzso containing good zzso zzso activity, and in addition, we succeeded to preliminarily zzso it to a more active lead compound zzso with zzso zzso values, based on the zzso model zzso This methodology using the zzso model could be zzso as a zzso system for zzso zzso
