This brief review was inspired by discussions relating to the zzso International C1 Workshop (this zzso and the realization that certain functional properties of the zzso zzso are limited exclusively to the zzso The zzso region of the zzso contains a major binding site for zzso zzso which include zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso This binding site is immediately adjacent to, and partially overlapping with, an zzso zzso common to the zzso zzso and various types of zzso including cartilage type II zzso At the zzso end of the zzso zzso is a leader zzso sequence that anchors the intact zzso zzso firmly in the membrane of zzso the zzso zzso can thus be classified as a type II membrane zzso functioning as an additional zzso for molecules known to react with zzso in fluid phase such as the zzso region of zzso zzso and zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The various zzso within the zzso and their respective functions (or potential zzso are presented and discussed in the context of the intact C1 zzso and with regard to any wider functional zzso
