Most cellular processes requiring zzso structure zzso zzso the action of zzso zzso zzso Members of the family, named originally for the zzso DEAD zzso acid zzso are thought to disrupt zzso structure and facilitate its zzso by unwinding short stretches of duplex zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso acid representative of the DEAD protein family from zzso zzso that contains all eight zzso motifs found in DEAD proteins and is zzso with other members of the zzso Here, we describe the zzso A resolution structure of the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso zzso Similar to the corresponding zzso of related zzso zzso adopts a parallel zzso structure with zzso zzso In general, the zzso motifs zzso on closely related DEAD proteins and on more zzso related zzso such as zzso This affirms the current belief that the core zzso zzso responsible for zzso activity, are structurally similar in DEAD zzso In contrast, however, the so-called Walker A zzso which binds the zzso and zzso of zzso adopts a rarely seen zzso zzso that would zzso block zzso zzso The closed zzso may be indicative of a general regulatory feature among DEAD proteins (and zzso zzso that differs from that used by DNA zzso zzso also contains a unique extension of approximately 60 zzso at the C zzso that is highly zzso suggesting that it might bind zzso acids and, in so doing, zzso specificity to the zzso activity of the core zzso
