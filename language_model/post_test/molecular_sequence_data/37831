The repair pathways involved in the removal of zzso zzso zzso from DNA by human cell extracts have been zzso Closed circular DNA zzso containing a single zzso at a defined site were used as zzso to determine the patch size generated after in zzso repair by cell zzso zzso analysis of the repair incorporation in the vicinity of the zzso indicated that the majority of zzso was repaired through the base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso to the zzso characteristic for the zzso zzso repair pathway, was not zzso More than zzso of the zzso repair was accomplished by the zzso repair zzso and the remaining zzso were removed by the long patch zzso zzso We also analyzed the role of the zzso zzso zzso group G zzso protein in the zzso step of zzso Cell extracts deficient in zzso protein had an average zzso reduction in zzso zzso These data show that zzso is the primary zzso for repair of zzso in DNA and that zzso protein may be involved in repair of zzso as an accessory zzso
