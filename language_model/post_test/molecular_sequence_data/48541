An zzso alkaline zzso was produced from zzso zzso zzso It was zzso zzso using zzso and zzso Q zzso zzso zzso assisted laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso (called zzso was a zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso 29 zzso acid sequence of zzso showed high zzso with those of zzso zzso It showed optimal activity at pH 12 and 80 zzso and was stable at a pH range of 9-12 after 120 h of zzso Its zzso and zzso were upgraded in the presence of 5 zzso zzso Its zzso times at 70 and 80 zzso were 16 and 10 zzso zzso It was completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso suggesting that it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso also exhibited high zzso efficiency, organic zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar to those of native zzso This organic zzso zzso could be considered a potential candidate for application as a zzso in the synthesis of zzso zzso
