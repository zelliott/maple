zzso C is a vitamin zzso zzso of a zzso zzso that zzso blood zzso by the zzso zzso of factors Va and zzso zzso affected with protein C zzso are at risk for zzso zzso analyses of affected individuals, to determine the cause of the protein C zzso revealed a large variety of zzso in the protein C zzso including several in the promoter region of this zzso zzso of the region around two of these zzso zzso and zzso with zzso factor consensus sequences suggested the presence of two overlapping and zzso oriented zzso binding zzso zzso evidence for the presence of the two zzso binding sites in the protein C promoter was obtained using zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso These experiments revealed that zzso can bind specifically to both putative zzso sites in the zzso protein C zzso Due to the zzso zzso one binding site is completely lost, while the other site still binds zzso but with strongly reduced zzso As a consequence of the zzso zzso the protein C promoter loses all its zzso binding zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the binding of zzso to the protein C promoter is of zzso zzso This followed from experiments in which the introduction of the zzso or zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduced promoter activity in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso protein C promoter construct with zzso showed a zzso increased promoter activity in zzso zzso In zzso cells, significant zzso promoter activity was only observed after zzso with zzso When a promoter construct containing the zzso zzso at position zzso was used, the zzso potential of zzso was zzso reduced in zzso cells, whereas in zzso cells no zzso was zzso With the promoter construct containing the zzso zzso no zzso by zzso was found either in zzso or in zzso zzso
