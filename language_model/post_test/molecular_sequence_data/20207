zzso between the zzso fungus zzso zzso and one of its zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed during zzso colonization of plant zzso zzso analysis, based on zzso and zzso zzso was used to draw up the profiles of soluble zzso of the two partners before interaction, and to trace the fate of zzso specific of each partner during zzso In sunflower zzso the main soluble carbohydrates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso soluble carbon zzso During infection, a decline in zzso and zzso acids was observed in the plant and fungus total zzso zzso and zzso initially present almost exclusively in plant, were reduced by zzso We used a zzso approach to correlate the disappearance of zzso with the expression and the activity of zzso zzso The expression of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso was enhanced during zzso A database search for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso sugar transport zzso Furthermore, the composition of the pool of reserve zzso and zzso during infection was zzso Whereas zzso was produced in zzso and accumulated in zzso zzso was exclusively produced in infected zzso and increased during zzso The hypothesis that the induction of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso exerts a positive effect on zzso protection of zzso cells and favors zzso growth in plant zzso is zzso Taken together, our data revealed the importance of zzso exchanges during the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
