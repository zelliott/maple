zzso zzso in bacteria is promoted by zzso which stimulate an zzso zzso transcript zzso activity of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso has the opposite effect on zzso complexes, zzso rather than stimulating transcript zzso We have determined the zzso zzso X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso The structure reveals an zzso and a zzso domain with close structural similarity to the zzso of zzso but with an unexpected zzso change in terms of the orientation of the zzso with respect to each zzso However, structural and functional analysis suggests that when zzso with zzso zzso zzso adopts a zzso similar to that of zzso These results reveal considerable structural flexibility for zzso and for zzso in general, as suggested by structural zzso and point to a possible role for the zzso switch in zzso and zzso zzso The opposite functional effect of zzso compared with zzso may be determined by three structural zzso First, zzso lacks the basic patch present in zzso that likely plays a role in zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso Second, the loop at the tip of the zzso zzso is highly flexible and contains extra zzso zzso compared with zzso Third, the zzso zzso finger lacks a zzso in the first zzso resulting in a straight zzso compared with zzso The latter two characteristics suggest that zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso active site (like zzso but in a zzso inactive zzso
