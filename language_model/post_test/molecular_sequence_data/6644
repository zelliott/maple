The genes zzso the production of zzso B, a zzso produced by zzso zzso strain zzso which is active against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but inactive against most other zzso species, were previously localized on a 4 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the present work, DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of three consecutive zzso which potentially code for zzso peptides composed of 60, 91 and 114 zzso zzso respectively, and a fourth zzso of opposite polarity which could potentially zzso a zzso of 59 zzso zzso The middle zzso zzso zzso was identified as the gene zzso zzso B by comparing the zzso acid composition of highly zzso zzso B with the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso Our results suggest that zzso B is zzso as a precursor which is processed at a site which zzso to the ' zzso zzso rules of von zzso to yield active zzso B zzso zzso zzso The presence of an zzso gene on the 4 zzso zzso zzso was deduced from the capacity of a zzso zzso zzso this zzso to zzso immunity upon transformation of zzso zzso zzso One of the three zzso zzso may zzso this immunity zzso
