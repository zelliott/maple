zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso was characterized for 58 zzso of zzso representing 41 species from the five groups of zzso Thirty-one species each produced a distinct zzso zzso Three species produced more than one unique pattern, corresponding to zzso zzso The remaining seven species produced three distinct patterns with two or three zzso similar species sharing a zzso A successful blind test with four samples and the identification of eight previously unknown zzso from irrigation water demonstrated the reliability of this technique for species zzso Each zzso pattern was defined and described by the positions of the top and bottom bands and the number of bands in between, which allows laboratories to use this technique without need to access the type zzso of zzso zzso
