zzso is the process by which a pair of duplicated zzso or zzso experiences a reduction of individual expression patterns or function while still zzso the complete expression pattern and function of the ancestral zzso Two zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso that belong to a small gene family in barley zzso zzso Both genes share high zzso sequence similarity in coding and zzso regions and zzso identical zzso zzso The use of zzso gel zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso products, zzso the zzso and zzso expression patterns of each zzso Individual expression patterns provided evidence of both overlapping zzso and early zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in developing zzso while zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso roots, developing zzso and zzso zzso promoter deletion studies located a region zzso responsible for high promoter activity and showed the ability of zzso and zzso upstream regions to drive zzso expression in zzso zzso and zzso of developing zzso The observed expression patterns are consistent with proposed roles in plant development and defense mechanisms for this gene zzso These roles may explain why zzso has been selectively maintained in this duplicate gene zzso
