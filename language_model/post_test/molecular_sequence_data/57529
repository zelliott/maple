zzso is a surface zzso found on T and B cells that has zzso to a family of molecules including the receptors for tumor necrosis factor zzso and nerve growth zzso A zzso zzso a zzso for zzso was isolated by a zzso cloning strategy using a fusion protein composed of the zzso domain of zzso linked to the constant domain of a human zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The predicted protein product is a type II zzso protein whose gene maps to zzso and that shows zzso to zzso and the zzso for zzso Biological characterization indicates that the cloned zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso T cells and enhances the generation of zzso T zzso
