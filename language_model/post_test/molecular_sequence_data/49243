zzso is zzso by a diverse set of zzso during bacterial growth, development and cell zzso The zzso proteins define a family of zzso zzso that are widely represented in various bacterial zzso Currently characterized members are known to zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso zzso showed that these proteins define a large zzso encompassing several diverse groups of zzso In addition to the well characterized zzso zzso this zzso includes the zzso and zzso families of bacterial zzso the zzso domain of bacterial and zzso zzso zzso zzso and several proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and certain zzso The zzso members include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso and candidate tumor zzso zzso These zzso zzso along with the bacterial zzso zzso family, show a circular zzso of the zzso zzso We identified three zzso zzso namely a zzso a zzso and a polar zzso that are involved in the zzso activities of this zzso zzso analysis of this zzso shows that it comprises four major families, with diverse domain zzso in each of zzso 

Several zzso but zzso zzso activities, such as zzso degradation, zzso transfer and zzso zzso have emerged in the zzso zzso The three zzso zzso zzso of this zzso are shown to be equivalent to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The predicted structural features indicate that the zzso zzso contain a fold similar to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
