During the mating of zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso fuse to produce a zzso zzso This process requires the functions of zzso a member of the zzso family in the zzso zzso and its partner zzso zzso To investigate further the role of zzso and zzso in nuclear fusion, we screened for partner proteins for zzso by the zzso zzso system and identified zzso zzso is an essential integral membrane protein of the nuclear envelope and is enriched in the zzso pole body zzso the sole zzso center in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells contain abnormal zzso lacking the zzso suggesting the essential role of zzso in the organization of the normal zzso Additionally, zzso zzso cells show defects in zzso nuclear division and nuclear fusion during zzso Because zzso is not required for nuclear division, zzso probably has dual functions in zzso zzso and in zzso nuclear zzso
