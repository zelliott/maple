The specific binding of zzso to the zzso loop in zzso from human zzso type 1 zzso individuals was zzso Different zzso structures were analyzed as full-length zzso or by zzso Our data show that on full-length zzso zzso both variable regions on either side of the tip of the loop zzso contribute to a common zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso bound strongly and at high zzso to native zzso zzso but zzso once the loop was zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso presented by the full-length zzso loop, the tip, the zzso base, and the zzso base were not accessible to serum zzso When the zzso sequences were analyzed with linear zzso zzso bound zzso to peptides containing the zzso zzso zzso Thus, two different zzso of zzso zzso were detected in patient zzso Unlike zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso lack of zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso was correlated with viral escape from zzso zzso Our data suggest that the full-length zzso of the zzso loop is accessible predominantly to highly zzso zzso present in zzso from zzso zzso These zzso are directed against zzso zzso zzso not against zzso linear zzso zzso The implications of these findings for viral escape and blockade of infection with zzso vaccines are zzso
