Alternative zzso is a key factor contributing to genetic diversity and zzso zzso zzso one form of alternative zzso is common in plants but rare in higher zzso because zzso zzso with retained zzso are subject to cellular restriction at the level of zzso export and zzso Often, retention of internal zzso restricts the export of these zzso and makes them the targets for degradation by the cellular zzso zzso machinery if they contain premature stop zzso In fact, many of the database entries for complementary zzso with retained zzso represent them as zzso that would not affect the zzso zzso are important model systems in studies of regulation of zzso with retained zzso because their zzso and zzso contain one or more zzso zzso For example, zzso monkey virus overcomes cellular restrictions by using a zzso zzso element known as the zzso transport element zzso The zzso interacts directly with the Tap protein (also known as nuclear zzso export factor 1, zzso by zzso which is thought to be a principal export zzso for cellular zzso leading to the hypothesis that cellular zzso with retained zzso use cellular zzso zzso to overcome restrictions to their zzso Here we show that the Tap gene contains a functional zzso in its alternatively spliced zzso zzso Tap zzso containing this zzso is exported to the zzso and is present in zzso A small Tap protein is zzso by this zzso and can be detected in human and monkey zzso Our results indicate that Tap regulates expression of its own zzso zzso through a zzso zzso Thus, zzso are likely to be important elements that facilitate efficient expression of zzso zzso with retained zzso
