We have isolated a zzso clone from rat brain using a human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso clone as a zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso corresponding to the rat brain zzso with that of the human zzso and human kidney alpha zzso receptors showed zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso The major sequence difference between the rat brain and human zzso zzso was a stretch of 48 zzso acids within the third zzso loop in which the similarity was only zzso Analysis of the 48 zzso zzso indicated that the two receptors significantly differ in terms of their primary zzso acid sequence and the predicted secondary and zzso structural zzso There was no sequence similarity between the human zzso and rat brain clone over the 177 bases of zzso sequence and a less than 50% similarity over a stretch of 210 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis with a human zzso alpha zzso zzso probe revealed the existence of a single zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso in both human and rat zzso zzso the rat brain alpha zzso probe, however, zzso to a single zzso zzso band in rat zzso zzso analysis of rat brain zzso zzso with the rat brain zzso probe under stringent zzso conditions revealed a single zzso zzso zzso none was detected by the human zzso zzso zzso The rat brain zzso zzso zzso was not detected in any zzso than zzso tested rat zzso utilizing either rat brain or human zzso DNA zzso The rat brain zzso was expressed in a zzso cell line zzso and found to bind the alpha zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso for zzso the presently cloned zzso was zzso closer to the alpha 2A zzso We conclude that the rat brain zzso encodes a new alpha zzso zzso zzso that may be zzso
