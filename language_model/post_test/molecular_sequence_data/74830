The bacterial communities in the zzso zzso zzso zzso from beneath zzso zzso and the corresponding bulk soil were compared by zzso and zzso zzso To assess the distribution of type III zzso systems zzso a zzso system for the broad detection of a highly zzso gene involved in zzso that is zzso was developed and used to zzso the cultured bacteria from the zzso zzso zzso and surrounding bulk zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso gene showed the selection of presumably zzso bacterial groups in the zzso of zzso zzso compared to the bulk soil in 3 sampling zzso Moreover, plate counts revealed that the numbers of zzso zzso bacteria were increased in the zzso as compared to the bulk zzso zzso the percentage of randomly picked zzso that carried the zzso gene showed a significant increase, from zzso in the bulk to zzso in the zzso zzso The increase could be mainly attributed to the emergence of a zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso which constituted the most dominant species in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was, together with a zzso zzso zzso zzso exclusively found in zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso genes using a zzso approach showed the selection of several zzso gene types uniquely in the zzso indicating the selection of several zzso bacterial zzso Thus, different bacteria were found to be enriched in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be involved in some of the interactions with the zzso zzso
