zzso is a zzso factor required for zzso of the zzso alcohol zzso 2 zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso has two zinc finger zzso between zzso acids 102 and zzso and it binds to an upstream zzso sequence zzso in the zzso zzso A functional dissection of zzso was performed by using a series of zzso and zzso deletion zzso of zzso most of which were fused to the zzso coli zzso These deletion zzso were zzso for binding to zzso in zzso for the ability to activate zzso zzso in zzso and for level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids 150 to zzso and 76 to 98 eliminated DNA binding in zzso which accounted for the loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso with the former deletion zzso indicated that both of the zzso zinc fingers are necessary for zzso DNA zzso zzso with the latter deletion zzso suggested that at least part of the sequence between zzso acids 76 to 98, in addition to the two finger zzso is required for zzso DNA zzso The smallest fusion protein able to activate zzso transcription, containing zzso zzso acids 76 to zzso was much less active in zzso than was the longest fusion protein containing zzso acids 1 to zzso of zzso In addition, multiple regions of the zzso zzso (including zzso acids 40 to 76, 260 to zzso and zzso to zzso which are required for full zzso of zzso were zzso An zzso fusion protein containing only the zzso 16 zzso acids of zzso was present at a much higher level than were larger fusion zzso which suggested that the sequences within zzso influence the expression of the gene zzso
