The secondary structure of zzso zzso toxin zzso a zzso zzso containing 55 zzso acid zzso and four zzso bonds, was zzso estimated by computer analyses of toxin circular zzso zzso and laser zzso zzso The CD spectrum of the toxin displayed typical zzso zzso at zzso zzso and 222 zzso At neutral zzso the zzso estimates from CD varied between 49 and zzso when zzso spectrum zzso methods were zzso Analysis of the laser zzso spectrum obtained at a much higher toxin concentration yielded a zzso zzso zzso Both CD and zzso zzso methods failed to detect any zzso zzso The zzso analyses revealed significantly more zzso and less zzso for toxin zzso than was predicted from its zzso To account for the difference between the zzso zzso estimate from CD zzso and the zzso zzso estimate from the zzso spectrum, we zzso that some terminal zzso are unfolded at the low toxin zzso used for CD zzso but form zzso at the high toxin concentration used for zzso zzso Our CD observations showing that zzso toxin zzso zzso content increases about zzso in zzso or at high pH are consistent with this zzso
