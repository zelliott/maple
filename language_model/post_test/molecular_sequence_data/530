We present zzso sequencing digital gene expression zzso a zzso zzso method for accurate zzso of the full range of cellular zzso zzso transcripts using a zzso zzso Analysis zzso zzso involves a zzso and zzso sample preparation procedure followed by sequencing that generates a single read per zzso We applied zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso using 6 of the available 50 channels in a single sequencing run, yielding on average 12 million aligned reads per zzso Using zzso zzso accurate quantitative zzso were obtained over four orders of zzso High correlation was demonstrated across independent zzso channels, instrument runs and sample zzso zzso counting in zzso is highly efficient due to the representation of each transcript zzso by a single zzso This efficiency, coupled with the high zzso enabled by the zzso sequencing platform, provides an alternative method for expression zzso
