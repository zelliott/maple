Recovery from zzso virus zzso infection usually precedes the appearance of zzso zzso indicating that cellular immunity plays a primary role in viral zzso To date, the role of zzso zzso T cells has not been evaluated in zzso To facilitate such studies, we zzso a zzso zzso to identify candidate zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso precursor zzso zzso We identified three peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that displayed zzso binding zzso or zzso zzso to zzso induced zzso zzso responses of high functional zzso in zzso transgenic mice, and were naturally processed from native zzso zzso in human zzso target zzso zzso mice zzso with either zzso or zzso were protected against challenge with a zzso zzso virus that expressed zzso zzso The zzso identified in this study represent potential diagnostic zzso and candidates for inclusion in zzso vaccine zzso Our approach is zzso to any pathogen with existing sequence data, does not require manipulation of the actual pathogen or access to immune human donors, and should therefore be generally zzso to category A through C agents and other emerging zzso
