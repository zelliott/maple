Two zzso zzso zzso were zzso which consist of a zzso zzso segment, a zzso recognition zzso inhibitor and a zzso zzso connecting these zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso acid zzso connected via the zzso group to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was coupled to the zzso via the side chain of the zzso zzso Both zzso contain almost identical zzso site inhibitor parts, except for the substitution of a zzso as the first zzso zzso in zzso zzso by a zzso zzso acid in zzso zzso thus increasing flexibility and zzso length by two additional zzso zzso zzso showed moderate potency zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso was characterized as a slow, tight binding inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stability in human plasma of both zzso was strongly improved compared with zzso For zzso zzso a significantly reduced plasma clearance was observed after intravenous injection in rats compared with zzso zzso and zzso The X-ray structure of the zzso zzso in complex with human zzso was solved and confirmed the expected zzso binding zzso
