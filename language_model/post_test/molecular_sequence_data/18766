Two bacterial zzso designated zzso and zzso were isolated from forest soil of zzso Island and fresh water of zzso lake in zzso city, respectively, South zzso Both strains were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed high sequence similarities zzso and zzso respectively, to the members of the zzso zzso The sequence similarity between strains zzso and zzso was zzso A zzso tree showed that these strains fell within the radius of the zzso zzso The main fatty acids of strains zzso and zzso were summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both strains had zzso 8 as the only respiratory zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as the major polar zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso with members of the zzso zzso Thus, based on the evidence of a zzso study, it is proposed that strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species, for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are zzso
