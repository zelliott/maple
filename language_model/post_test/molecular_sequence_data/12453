zzso experiments have indicated that a fraction of the major zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a zzso on the outer surface of the plasma zzso The zzso location of zzso is in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso with its zzso zzso retention zzso Little is known about the biology of the protein in zzso or the rate at which it might pass to the cell zzso We have examined the turnover of zzso by in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso After different chase times, zzso was zzso from zzso membrane zzso Two zzso zzso with zzso Neither was zzso by any zzso zzso nor by zzso to zzso retention zzso The possible significance of these zzso zzso is zzso In addition, we have used a zzso zzso to zzso zzso proteins from the same membrane zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso sequencing showed that the major zzso protein zzso was a member of the zzso 70 family, a zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the turnover of this zzso zzso for comparison with zzso and found that both had extended zzso with zzso greater than 24 zzso Use of zzso to inhibit zzso indicated that zzso zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso was strongly reduced by heat stress, was reduced a little in response to zzso and was not markedly changed by zzso In contrast, zzso synthesis increased markedly in response to zzso and zzso and increased a little after heat zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
