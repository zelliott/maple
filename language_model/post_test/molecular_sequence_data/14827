zzso analysis was carried out for identification of proteins functionally involved in zzso development of the giant tiger shrimp zzso zzso A total of 335 protein spots including 183 spots from zzso zzso zzso and 152 spots from mature zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso were zzso Of these, 75 zzso and 59 zzso spots significantly matched known proteins in the databases, zzso In addition, zzso protein spots including 167 and 103 spots from respective zzso stages of zzso zzso were also zzso A total of 95 zzso and 62 zzso spots matched known zzso zzso Among zzso expressed zzso zzso the full-length zzso of protein zzso zzso A6 zzso was further characterized by zzso zzso was zzso in length containing an open reading frame zzso of zzso corresponding to a zzso of 430 zzso zzso zzso was zzso at stage III zzso in intact shrimp zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso resulted in a lower expression level of zzso in each stage of zzso development compared to that of intact zzso zzso zzso in this study clearly indicated the potential of cellular zzso studies and gene expression analysis for identification of zzso zzso expressed during zzso development of zzso zzso
