The sensing of an zzso by an animal must be a rapid but transient process, requiring an instant response and also a speedy termination of the zzso Previous zzso and zzso studies suggest that one or more zzso zzso may play an essential role in the rapid termination of the zzso zzso zzso Here we report the molecular zzso zzso and characterization of a zzso from rat zzso zzso that encodes a member of the zzso zzso family designated as zzso This zzso shows high affinity for zzso and zzso having a zzso for zzso much lower than that of any other zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso this zzso is highly enriched in zzso zzso and is not detected in six other zzso zzso However, zzso protection analyses indicate that other alternative zzso zzso related to this zzso are expressed in several other zzso Within the zzso zzso this zzso appears to be expressed exclusively in the sensory zzso The high affinity for zzso of this zzso zzso and the fact that its zzso is highly concentrated in zzso sensory zzso suggest an important role for it in a zzso zzso signal zzso
