zzso is involved in the control of zzso zzso the main blood sugar in zzso Here, we describe the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso for the soluble form of the zzso from the zzso larvae of zzso zzso a well-known zzso of the quality of freshwater zzso zzso cloning was achieved through multiple alignment of zzso zzso zzso allowing the synthesis of internal zzso zzso the complete open reading zzso was subsequently obtained through zzso zzso is rapid amplification of zzso zzso The zzso contained the zzso untranslated region zzso the 3' zzso including a zzso tail and the zzso of zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully expressed in zzso coli as a zzso protein and zzso on zzso affinity zzso zzso structure analysis showed a series of characteristic features shared by all insect zzso while three-dimensional structure prediction yielded the typical zzso fold, the two key zzso involved in the zzso mechanism being zzso zzso of zzso insect zzso opens the way to structural zzso of the zzso site, which might zzso among others, an element for zzso the zzso as a target in zzso zzso zzso
