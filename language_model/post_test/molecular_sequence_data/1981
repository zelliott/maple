zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with changes in the zzso region of AID retain zzso but lose zzso zzso Here we describe five zzso with zzso in the zzso region of AID that caused selective zzso in zzso but retained zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso activities of AID may zzso via interaction of zzso or zzso zzso with different zzso of zzso Unlike cells expressing zzso AID zzso B cells expressing zzso AID zzso had zzso in the switch zzso region, indicating that such zzso are generated by reactions involved in zzso but not zzso Thus, we propose that separate zzso of AID interact with specific zzso to regulate these two distinct genetic events in a zzso zzso
