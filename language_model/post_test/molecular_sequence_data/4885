The zzso and deletion model of switch zzso suggests that double strand breaks zzso may occur in switch regions and participate in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso method has been devised for the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been detected in zzso DNA of normal zzso B cells but not in zzso T cells or zzso The breaks are restricted to the zzso region and are sequence zzso zzso of the sequence surrounding the zzso has led to the derivation of a consensus sequence for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is correlated with the onset of switch zzso The zzso flank clusters of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that processing of the broken ends may occur during the zzso zzso
