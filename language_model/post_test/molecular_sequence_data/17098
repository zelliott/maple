Eight zzso acid zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and shown to be expressed in zzso Seven of these belong to the zzso acid zzso and one to the zzso acid zzso zzso Using these sequences as well as known and characterized zzso acid zzso genes from all zzso a training set was established and used to search for zzso using the zzso motif discovery zzso This study revealed two motifs that are specific to the zzso zzso four to the family zzso and a single motif that is common between zzso and zzso systems A1 and zzso Interestingly, most of these motifs are clustered in two regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso search analyses indicated a close relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The results of this work describe the cloning of the first zzso acid zzso genes in zzso zzso and contribute to the understanding of zzso acid zzso evolution in these zzso Furthermore, the identification of zzso motifs in these proteins might be useful to better understand zzso physiology within its zzso
