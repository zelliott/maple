zzso zzso zzso was determined in 124 Chinese persons living in Taiwan, and two poor zzso were identified with a urinary zzso ratio zzso greater than zzso The other subjects, extensive zzso showed a normal frequency distribution of zzso Most subjects zzso showed a zzso zzso pattern in restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis with use of zzso I, and zzso and zzso of the subjects exhibited a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso pattern, zzso Among extensive zzso subjects with the zzso zzso pattern had a significant higher zzso than those with the zzso pattern, and the zzso of the subjects with the zzso zzso pattern was significantly higher than that of the subjects with zzso zzso zzso All nine zzso and zzso 3 of C gamma zzso were amplified with zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso for four extensive zzso Two major zzso were zzso one at position 188 of zzso 1 and the other at position zzso in zzso zzso With zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso 1, zzso 3, and zzso 9 were zzso Only two of 254 zzso showed a zzso zzso at 1934 base pairs zzso to zzso zzso zzso commonly found in white poor zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed zzso at 188 base pairs zzso and zzso showed zzso at zzso base pairs zzso instead of zzso and zzso as is found in most white zzso zzso with zzso or zzso showed a significant higher zzso than subjects with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may explain the zzso variations between Chinese and white subjects, as well as the genetic variations among Chinese zzso
