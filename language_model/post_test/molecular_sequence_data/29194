The rates of zzso and zzso formation are tightly zzso possibly due to the requirement of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso differentiation requires the zzso factor zzso whereas zzso results from the interaction between zzso zzso of zzso zzso B zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells, and zzso a surface zzso on zzso zzso A striking decrease in the number of zzso in zzso mice suggested that zzso might be involved in zzso zzso To investigate this possibility and to zzso the mechanisms regulating zzso zzso we isolated the zzso region of the zzso zzso gene and found that it contains two potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to either of these sites in gel shift zzso and zzso the activity of a zzso promoter consisting of zzso zzso zzso sites inserted upstream from a minimal zzso zzso zzso promoter in transient zzso However, zzso zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that removal of these sites from the zzso promoter by either zzso zzso or zzso did not alter the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in a zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso by zzso but had no significant effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso conditional expression of a zzso form of zzso in the same cell line inhibited zzso zzso by zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso Although these results cannot rule out a novel function for zzso in zzso zzso they demonstrate that zzso does not regulate zzso gene activity in the same manner as known targets of this zzso factor, such as zzso
