A bacterial consortium that accumulated more than zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso was selected in a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso representing a dominant species in this enrichment, was isolated and zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that the isolate is a member of the class zzso forming an independent zzso zzso The closest relative of the isolate was zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso zzso was an zzso zzso with large, zzso zzso cells, zzso by means of a polar zzso It zzso a relatively broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso as carbon and energy zzso The temperature range for growth was zzso zzso with an optimum at 40 zzso the pH range was pH zzso with an optimum at pH zzso The major respiratory zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The polar lipids consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The zzso fatty acids in the membrane polar lipids were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso data, the isolate is proposed to represent a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
