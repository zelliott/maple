To identify zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso we prepared a zzso library from rat zzso zzso cultures, previously shown to transport zzso with high affinity and zzso Using this library, we cloned two forms, varying in the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was previously found to be localized exclusively in zzso in the normal mature zzso zzso zzso against the zzso peptides were used to show that zzso zzso in culture express both zzso and zzso zzso The pharmacological properties of zzso transport zzso by zzso and zzso expressed in zzso cells and in zzso cultures were zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cultures by exposure to zzso zzso We next investigated the expression of zzso in zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed two transcripts of approximately 3 and 11 zzso that became more plentiful with zzso zzso zzso analysis showed high levels of expression in the cortex, zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso electron microscopic zzso with zzso zzso detection was used to zzso zzso in zzso In the rat zzso cortex, zzso was clearly expressed in zzso in zzso terminals and zzso zzso as well as in zzso The presence of zzso in zzso may offer a partial explanation for the observed zzso of zzso by zzso zzso for the preservation of input specificity at zzso zzso and may play a role in the zzso of zzso
