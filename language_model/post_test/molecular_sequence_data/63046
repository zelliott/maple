zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in sheep and zzso zzso to this neurodegenerative disease is mainly controlled by point zzso at the zzso zzso Other zzso apart from zzso have been reported to zzso zzso to zzso On the basis of several studies in zzso and different zzso zzso zzso models, zzso was chosen as a putative zzso and functional candidate gene that might be involved in the zzso zzso mentioned zzso In the present work, the zzso zzso gene including the promoter and other regulatory regions has been isolated and zzso Several sequence zzso have also been zzso zzso localized the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso which was confirmed by linkage zzso This zzso region has been shown to include a quantitative trait zzso zzso for zzso incubation period in zzso zzso analyses were carried out in zzso and zzso zzso No differences in the expression of the zzso gene were found in any of these zzso zzso zzso zzso between control and infected animal zzso Nevertheless, association analyses revealed that several zzso in the zzso and 3' regions of the zzso gene were zzso distributed among animals with different responses to zzso zzso Thus, results presented here support the hypothesis that zzso could be a zzso and functional candidate gene modulating the response to zzso in zzso
