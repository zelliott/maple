To study the effects of two chemical pesticides zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso on bacterial diversity in zzso soil, a zzso pot experiment was conducted on zzso bean zzso zzso with recommended and higher doses of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was used to analyze such effects on both resident and active bacterial communities across two time zzso It was observed that higher doses of zzso zzso the effects of zzso on bacterial zzso Both zzso and zzso showed a zzso and zzso effect, which was zzso only at the zzso zzso zzso treatments showed dissimilar profiles compared to zzso Most of the bands showed high sequence similarities to known bacterial groups, including many zzso zzso and zzso zzso This study indicates that pesticides display zzso effects on active microbial populations that serve important zzso functions, thereby emphasizing the need to critically investigate and validate the use of zzso in agriculture before accepting them as safe alternatives to chemical zzso
