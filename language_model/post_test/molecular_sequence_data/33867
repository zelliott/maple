Only limited information is available about the occurrence of ticks and zzso pathogens in public parks, which are areas strongly influenced by human zzso For this reason, zzso zzso were collected in public parks of different Bavarian cities in a zzso survey zzso and zzso and screened for DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso Species identification was performed by sequence analysis and alignment with existing sequences in zzso Additionally, zzso with zzso zzso were zzso 

The following zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, including one pool of two zzso in 2009 and zzso to zzso zzso zzso 11, including one pool of five zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso including 16 pools of 76 zzso in zzso DNA of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in Bavarian public parks could not be zzso zzso analysis revealed the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and unspecified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso ticks in urban areas of Germany harbor several zzso pathogens and zzso were also zzso Public parks are of particularly great interest regarding the epidemiology of zzso zzso because of differences in both the prevalence of pathogens in ticks as well as a varying species arrangement when compared to zzso zzso The record of DNA of a zzso zzso pathogen detected in zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso may harbor and transmit more zzso zzso than previously zzso Because of their high recreational value for human beings, urban green areas are likely to remain in the research focus on public health zzso
