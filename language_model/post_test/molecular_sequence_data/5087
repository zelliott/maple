Previous hypotheses of zzso evolution are undermined by limitations in the zzso reconstruction method employed or due to the omission of key zzso In this experiment, sequences of the gene zzso the DNA zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso in combination with those zzso the zzso zzso II largest zzso gene zzso to zzso a comprehensive zzso of zzso zzso species of zzso were zzso zzso representatives of each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of questionable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The analyses presented here provide strong support for the hypothesis that the zzso that zzso zzso (also known as zzso evolved from zzso zzso One implication of this finding is that the zzso definition of zzso should be broadened to zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso However, this zzso revision is complicated in that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which exhibit some biological properties of zzso are more closely related to zzso on the basis of these sequence zzso zzso the zzso discrimination between zzso that zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso may be more problematic than has been previously zzso Since our resulting zzso hypothesis is supported by the analyses of two different zzso we speculate on the origin and evolutionary expansion of this lineage of zzso zzso
