The zzso agents of zzso disease form a zzso zzso group, composed of three species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and group zzso We have compared the sizes of the linear zzso that carries the genes zzso the major zzso proteins zzso and zzso as well as the size and structure of the zzso among the zzso disease zzso We have found differences in the sizes of the zzso zzso but not the linear zzso among the three zzso The zzso zzso size of 50 zzso in zzso zzso zzso is significantly smaller than the size of 55 zzso in zzso zzso zzso and 56 zzso in group zzso zzso The zzso was found to be linear in all three zzso species, but not significantly different in zzso
