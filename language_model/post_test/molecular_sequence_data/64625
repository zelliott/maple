The zzso visual zzso is a highly plastic structure and its development is guided by visual experience during early zzso zzso zzso do not open their eyes until the end of the second zzso zzso We hypothesized that the expression of genes in the visual zzso would differ before and after eye zzso As a first step in uncovering these differences, we compared gene expressions in the visual zzso of zzso days zzso 1 and 21 zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed using zzso samples as the tester and zzso as the zzso More than 30 genes were expressed at a higher level in zzso than zzso samples, but 5 fragments showed higher copies than zzso zzso product of the five fragments was zzso and cloned into zzso zzso They showed significant zzso to zzso of zzso zzso clone zzso zzso zzso Type II zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced expression 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso of A, C and E are zzso By means of zzso zzso three full-length zzso not reported previously in the rat were obtained for A, C and zzso and we named them zzso genes 1, 2 and 3, respectively, in the rat visual zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was further characterized by Northern zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso These approaches confirmed that zzso was expressed at a significantly higher level in zzso than in zzso visual cortical samples, and that zzso zzso cells and primary zzso cultures showed expression mainly in zzso cell zzso Our data indicate that genes expressed more abundantly on zzso are associated with various zzso pathways and zzso changes, and may play an important role in visual cortical development, growth and/or zzso
