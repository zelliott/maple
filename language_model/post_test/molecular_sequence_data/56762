zzso of the mouse zzso zzso gene is regulated by an zzso that is located 1 zzso zzso 3' downstream from the zzso The zzso zzso consists of six direct repeats with zzso to the zzso motif in the zzso virus zzso zzso The zzso motif binds to the zzso zzso zzso In this report we show that zzso fusion protein binds specifically to the zzso zzso unit sequence by gel shift zzso zzso showed that the zzso binding site consisted of 20 bases in each zzso zzso also moderately activated the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso binds in a sequence specific fashion to the mouse zzso zzso and suggest that zzso or other related zzso family genes function in regulating zzso gene zzso
