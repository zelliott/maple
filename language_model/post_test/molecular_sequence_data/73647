Three genes coding for different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were isolated and divided into two major classes according to structural features in their zzso zzso class I comprises two genes with an additional coding zzso of approximately 300 zzso at the zzso end, and class II is represented by one gene carrying an zzso of zzso zzso in its zzso untranslated zzso Fusion of the zzso sequence zzso by the additional first zzso of a class I zzso gene to the zzso zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso and transient expression in tobacco zzso targeted zzso to the zzso In contrast to the deduced primary structure of the zzso zzso domain zzso by the class I zzso the corresponding zzso acid sequence of the class II zzso shows higher identity with that of the zzso zzso both lacking a transit zzso The zzso zzso has been proposed to be a zzso zzso These observations indicate that the two classes of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso type, respectively, and that zzso zzso contains at least one zzso zzso besides the zzso zzso type located in zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the ancestors of zzso zzso using a zzso of a zzso zzso gene as a probe revealed that zzso is zzso by a zzso family of at least five zzso
