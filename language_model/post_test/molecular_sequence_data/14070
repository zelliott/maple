We describe a zzso in the outer zzso region of the adult rat skeletal muscle zzso zzso channel zzso that dramatically alters binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso at position zzso to zzso zzso decreased zzso binding affinity by zzso Because the zzso channel showed both low zzso zzso and zzso zzso these results suggested that zzso bound to the outer zzso and implied that the zzso and zzso sites partially overlapped in this zzso The zzso decreased the association rate of the toxin with little effect on the zzso rate, suggesting that zzso could be involved in zzso guidance of zzso to its binding zzso We propose a mechanism for zzso block of the zzso channel based on the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso on the requirement of zzso to have an zzso in position 13 to zzso the channel, and on this experimental result suggesting that zzso binds in the outer zzso In this model, the zzso group of zzso of the toxin interacts with two zzso known to be important for selectivity zzso and zzso with the association rate of the toxin increased by interaction with zzso of the zzso
