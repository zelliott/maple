zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor which binds to sequences containing a zzso motif in a number of promoters such as those for type I zzso zzso zzso Class II, zzso and zzso It consists of two different components that are both needed for DNA zzso We have zzso the zzso chain of zzso to apparent zzso by zzso DNA affinity zzso followed by zzso S and zzso Q zzso zzso and obtained the zzso acid sequences of zzso peptides of this zzso zzso acid sequences of two of these zzso peptides were used to zzso zzso zzso The zzso served to obtain a small zzso by the zzso chain reaction method, which was then further used to obtain larger zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of a representative zzso clone revealed the presence of an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids coding for a putative zzso of 25 zzso zzso of these zzso in zzso followed by translation in a zzso zzso produced a zzso that migrated on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso with the same mobility as the native A zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the A chain showed a remarkable identity over a length of zzso acid zzso with a sequence of the zzso zzso a component of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
