An zzso protocol was employed to generate zzso zzso to a zzso protein zzso of bovine growth hormone arising from alternative zzso zzso zzso bovine growth hormone used for zzso was obtained by expression in bacteria and zzso of the protein from zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were first zzso with zzso bovine growth hormone in the presence of the zzso drug zzso thereby zzso the mouse to common zzso shared among the two zzso zzso the mice were zzso with zzso bovine growth hormone to produce zzso specific to zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso resulting from standard and zzso zzso protocols resulted in a significantly enhanced production of zzso bovine growth zzso zzso as a result of the zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso to the zzso growth hormone was substantiated by differential zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso Nearly all zzso positive for zzso growth hormone were negative for zzso growth zzso Finally, the zzso were used to demonstrate zzso zzso of zzso I cells zzso zzso with a zzso growth zzso zzso Given the power of the zzso chain reaction to zzso clone alternatively processed zzso species, followed by expression in bacteria to provide zzso the zzso protocol provides a convenient general method for producing zzso specific to desired protein zzso
