Our understanding of the third domain of life, zzso has greatly increased since its establishment some 20 years zzso The increasing information on zzso has also brought their viruses into the zzso Today, about 100 zzso viruses are known, which is a low number compared to the numbers of characterized bacterial or zzso zzso Here, we have performed a comparative biological and structural study of seven zzso viruses infecting extremely zzso zzso The zzso nature of this novel zzso type was established by zzso analysis and zzso zzso These zzso viruses form zzso characterized by a zzso zzso enclosing the zzso without any zzso The viral lipids are zzso acquired from host cell zzso The zzso contain two to three major structural zzso which either are embedded in the membrane or form spikes distributed randomly on the external membrane zzso Thus, the most important step during zzso assembly is most likely the interaction of the membrane proteins with the zzso The interaction can be driven by zzso or zzso DNA, resulting in the zzso having similar zzso but different zzso zzso Based on our comparative study, these viruses probably form a novel group, which we define as zzso
