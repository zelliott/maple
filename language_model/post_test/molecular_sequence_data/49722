A novel mouse zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and organization of its gene structure has been zzso The new mouse zzso zzso and its closely related zzso zzso are derived from a single zzso gene as a result of an alternative zzso I and differential zzso Thus, the only structural distinction between the two zzso zzso is at their zzso zzso zzso in contrast to the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso have a zzso for zzso zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso is most abundantly expressed in the brain and spinal cord, whereas zzso and zzso are zzso if at all, expressed in the central nervous zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso is the most prominent zzso zzso expressed in skin, whereas zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso The zzso zzso and differential expression patterns of the three zzso zzso strongly suggest that they have distinct zzso roles to zzso Of further interest, the mouse zzso and zzso genes are zzso expressed during embryonic development, with the former being expressed at all stages from zzso whereas the latter is not expressed until zzso It is speculated that, during embryonic development, zzso is required for production of cholesterol zzso essential for normal skin development, whereas zzso produces zzso zzso an essential zzso during development of the central nervous zzso
