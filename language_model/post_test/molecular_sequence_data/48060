The zzso zzso zzso is, together with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the dissolution of blood clots in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso plays a key role in a variety of other zzso zzso such as the zzso of zzso and has also been implicated in wound healing, pathogen invasion, cancer invasion and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso represents a specific inhibitor of zzso and zzso and thus offers a unique opportunity to evaluate the concept of zzso zzso The complexes formed between zzso and bovine as well as zzso zzso have been zzso in a zzso and a zzso crystal form, containing six molecules and one zzso per zzso unit, zzso Both structures have been solved and refined to zzso A and zzso A zzso zzso turns out to have an zzso fold exhibiting a zzso structure like the tissue zzso inhibitor zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is restricted to the zzso zzso of zzso particularly to its primary binding loop, zzso zzso zzso The zzso site of zzso differs from other zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso instead of an zzso zzso at zzso A model of the zzso complex has been created based on the X-ray zzso Our zzso studies indicate that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso by interactions which are characteristic for zzso binding zzso zzso On the basis of our three-dimensional structures, and in comparison with the zzso and free zzso and the zzso structures, we zzso that the binding of the zzso toward zzso and zzso is accompanied by a switch of the primary binding loop segment zzso Moreover, in the factor zzso inhibitor zzso the core of the zzso would prevent an equivalent rotation of the zzso zzso making zzso interactions of zzso with factor zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso would clash with zzso of zzso thus zzso a zzso zzso interaction and explaining its zzso
