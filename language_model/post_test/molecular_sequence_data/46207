The zzso zzso gene is a zzso of the copper zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso c zzso 1) encodes a zzso protein that is essential for the correct assembly of complex IV in the respiratory zzso zzso analyses showed zzso promoter activity in vascular zzso guard cells, zzso zzso support cells, and zzso zzso function was studied in two zzso zzso zzso lines, zzso and zzso zzso development was not affected by the disruption of zzso but zzso zzso and zzso zzso became arrested at various zzso zzso mostly at the heart zzso Both the zzso zzso gene and the modified gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso were able to complement the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in transgenic lines identified zzso as a zzso zzso To determine if zzso is a functional zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was transformed with zzso zzso containing different combinations of zzso and zzso zzso One of the resulting zzso proteins restored zzso in the zzso zzso This protein had the zzso zzso targeting signal and the single zzso domain derived from zzso and the zzso half (including the zzso zzso derived from zzso Growth of the zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by the addition of copper to the zzso The data demonstrate that zzso is essential for zzso development in zzso possibly due to its role in zzso c zzso zzso
