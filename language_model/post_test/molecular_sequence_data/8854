Recently, the increased demand of energy has strongly zzso the research on the conversion of zzso biomass into reducing zzso for the subsequent production, and zzso have been the focus because of their important roles in a variety fundamental biological processes and the synthesis of useful zzso Although the zzso of different sources have been investigated, the amount of zzso are insufficient for effective conversion of zzso The goal of this work was to search for new resources of zzso which was zzso and with high zzso zzso 

In this study, a zzso native zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso Internal sequences of zzso were obtained by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso was cloned based on the zzso sequences obtained from the zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the deduced protein indicated that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family zzso A zzso zzso zzso was obtained by the functional expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Several zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso were determined - both zzso showed optimal activity at pH zzso and zzso and they were stable for a pH range of zzso and a temperature range of 50 to zzso Of the zzso tested, zzso and zzso displayed the highest activity toward zzso zzso with specific activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso U zzso zzso However, these zzso were inactive toward zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

An native zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso from the crude extract of zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso was cloned based on the internal sequences of zzso obtained from the zzso results, and the gene zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso The results of various zzso properties of two zzso including specific activity, pH stability, zzso and kinetic properties zzso and zzso indicated that they had no significant zzso
