zzso zzso are zzso zzso that become fluorescent upon zzso We developed a real-time zzso zzso to detect the presence of zzso species using these zzso reporter zzso A zzso section of the zzso was used as the amplification zzso zzso zzso were designed to recognize a zzso region on the zzso As few as 2 zzso unit zzso per zzso reaction could be zzso We also demonstrated the ability of the molecular zzso to discriminate between zzso obtained from similar species such as zzso coli and zzso zzso in real-time zzso zzso These zzso could be carried out entirely in sealed zzso tubes, enabling fast and direct detection of zzso in a zzso zzso
