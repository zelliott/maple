zzso virus zzso the type species of zzso is responsible for contagious zzso in sheep and zzso In the present report, sequence analysis of major envelope gene zzso of four Indian zzso virus zzso originating two each from sheep and zzso was carried zzso These recent zzso belonged to different outbreaks that occurred in zzso hills and adjoining plains during zzso zzso screening of the zzso samples was carried out by diagnostic zzso zzso zzso gene zzso for zzso major envelope protein from all the four zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Comparative sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso Indian zzso were highly related amongst themselves with sequence identity of over zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso Further, they showed zzso sequence identity with sequences of other zzso zzso from around the world; while zzso and zzso sequence identity was observed, respectively, with zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso other members of the zzso zzso analysis also showed that these zzso from sheep and zzso are closely related to other zzso viruses reported zzso
