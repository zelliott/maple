Three genes zzso putative zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso presumably corresponding to a zzso and zzso zzso were cloned and expressed as soluble zzso proteins in zzso zzso The specific activities determined for both zzso zzso zzso were notably higher than the values previously reported for zzso zzso zzso To confirm these differences, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also expressed as zzso zzso The kinetic analysis showed that the zzso parameters of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso were very similar to those determined for zzso zzso zzso The zzso from both zzso displayed equally broad zzso zzso while zzso were highly specific towards zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was confirmed by zzso extraction of intact zzso At the protein level, zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso whereas zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso By contrast in zzso zzso zzso is expressed along the whole life cycle, whereas zzso is specifically induced in the zzso zzso Similarly, the expression of zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated in zzso zzso while zzso zzso is only expressed in zzso and zzso zzso is present in the insect and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings provide evidence for a metabolically active zzso in the zzso stages of zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso by zzso more likely represents a side product of an at least partially operative zzso cycle, than an end product of zzso zzso
