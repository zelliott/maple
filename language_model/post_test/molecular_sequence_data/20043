We investigate the geographical and historical context of diversification in a complex of zzso zzso zzso living in zzso trees in the equatorial rain forests of Southeast zzso Using zzso DNA from 433 zzso colonies collected from 32 locations spanning zzso zzso and zzso we zzso branching zzso patterns of genetic diversity and population zzso We reconstruct a time frame for the zzso diversification and demographic expansions, and identify areas that might have been zzso or zzso of zzso zzso operational lineages are identified, most of which can be distinguished by host preference and geographical zzso The zzso first diversified zzso zzso not long after the onset of the zzso forests in zzso and achieved most of their zzso diversity during the zzso zzso demographic expansions are zzso for several of the younger zzso zzso relationships suggest a zzso cradle and major axis of zzso zzso diversity tends to be associated with mountain zzso in zzso it is greatest in the Crocker Range of zzso and concentrated also in other parts of the northern northwest zzso zzso genetic diversity in zzso and Sumatra tends to also coincide with mountain zzso A series of zzso and restricted zzso spanning northern northwest Borneo and the major mountain ranges of zzso and zzso seen in three pairs of sister zzso further suggests that these regions were zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are discussed in the context of the history of zzso rain zzso
