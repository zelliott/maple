We investigated zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso gene in 118 samples from 92 patients with chronic zzso leukemia in various clinical zzso zzso chronic phase, accelerated phase, and blast crisis zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and subsequent zzso sequencing disclosed no zzso of the zzso gene in chronic phase (no zzso in 80 zzso while five of 31 BC samples showed point zzso four in zzso and one in zzso zzso One of seven accelerated phase samples also showed a zzso gene zzso Ten of 31 BC samples showed loss of one of the short arms of zzso 17 zzso through the formation of zzso zzso zzso or unbalanced zzso Loss of zzso at the zzso locus in the accelerated phase and BC was detected only in two cases with zzso but not in seven cases with normal zzso 17 zzso suggesting that loss of one zzso zzso is rare without zzso zzso loss of a zzso Among those six samples with zzso gene zzso five showed loss of a zzso zzso and only one zzso crisis case exhibited normal zzso 17 zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso gene were closely associated with zzso crisis with loss of a zzso (four zzso in ten zzso in contrast to zzso crisis with normal zzso 17 zzso zzso in zzso or zzso crisis (one in zzso Our results also suggest that zzso of the zzso gene might occur after loss of a zzso during the course of chronic zzso zzso
