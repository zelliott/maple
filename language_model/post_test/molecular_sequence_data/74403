zzso membrane protein 1 zzso is membrane protein of unknown molecular function that has been associated with zzso and zzso The social zzso zzso zzso has a zzso gene that we identified previously in a functional zzso zzso zzso of this gene leads to a severe zzso that compromises zzso growth and zzso The expression of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso suggesting a functional conservation of the protein among zzso distant species and highlights zzso as a valid experimental system to address the function of this zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein necessary for the integrity of this zzso zzso deficient in zzso display zzso defects in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is necessary to survive under zzso conditions, is not functional in the zzso The structure of the zzso apparatus, the function of the zzso zzso and conventional protein zzso are also affected in these zzso zzso electron zzso of zzso cells showed the zzso of zzso features that suggests a role of zzso in zzso In addition to these defects observed at the zzso stage, the onset of zzso development and early zzso gene expression are also zzso
