zzso is a zzso zzso that functions in the zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso zzso binding to an zzso requires zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structures of the zzso domain zzso of zzso alone and in complex with zzso The zzso is composed of a zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso complex includes hydrogen bonds between zzso and zzso and zzso of the zzso group of zzso into a small zzso pocket of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso has demonstrated that the zzso acid zzso adjoining the zzso site interact with the outer branches of the zzso zzso Considering that the zzso zzso zzso in zzso are usually involved in zzso interactions with the zzso zzso we propose that zzso interacts with the zzso in unfolded zzso pointing the protein zzso toward zzso for zzso
