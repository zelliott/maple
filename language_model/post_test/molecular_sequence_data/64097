The zzso copper zzso 1 zzso is a highly zzso zzso protein that mediates the zzso of copper zzso from the zzso zzso In this study, we have isolated the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein with zzso identity to the human zzso and shows conservation of specific zzso acid zzso involved in copper zzso We find only a single zzso gene in the zzso zzso which maps to linkage group zzso The zzso structure of the zzso gene shows that it consists of five zzso and that zzso boundaries are absolutely zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and by in zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso and transcripts can be detected throughout development and in adult zzso Distribution of zzso message appears ubiquitous during early stages becoming restricted to the brain and zzso zzso by 24 h post zzso zzso Beginning at 3 days post zzso zzso expression is found mainly in the developing zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso causes early zzso zzso zzso include cell death in zzso where zzso is most heavily zzso a finding similar to that described for a mouse knockout of zzso Despite the existence of at least one other copper transport mechanism in the fish, our studies show that zzso zzso is an essential gene for zzso
