In zzso the zzso gene product, a zzso zzso acts as a zzso repellent to guide zzso development during zzso Three human zzso gene zzso have been zzso and recently we reported frequent promoter region zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso breast, zzso and zzso cell lines and primary zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited the growth of cancer cell lines so that zzso appears to function as a novel zzso zzso gene zzso We zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes in 20 normal human zzso Similar to zzso expression profile, zzso is expressed strongly in many zzso while zzso expression is zzso zzso We zzso the zzso zzso island of zzso and zzso genes in zzso cell lines and primary zzso for zzso zzso was found to be zzso in 12 out of 29 zzso of breast, one out of 15 zzso zzso two out of six zzso zzso and in two out of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso cell lines, silenced zzso associated with zzso and was zzso after treatment with zzso In primary zzso zzso was zzso in zzso of primary breast zzso zzso of zzso and 38% of zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso DNA from zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso demonstrated that majority of the zzso sites zzso were heavily zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in zzso and zzso zzso but the frequency of zzso zzso in lung and breast cancer is significantly less than that for zzso We also demonstrated zzso promoter region zzso in zzso zzso lines (five out of zzso zzso the zzso frequency in zzso zzso was much lower zzso out of 20; zzso zzso evidence is accumulating for the involvement of members of the guidance cues molecules and their receptors in zzso zzso
