We present further evidence in support of the notion that zzso zzso is possibly involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso Running a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso with a primer set specific for the zzso gene of zzso zzso enabled us to demonstrate the presence of zzso DNA in skin zzso of patients with zzso zzso of zzso of zzso (six of zzso zzso specimens obtained from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, four of four zzso and zzso zzso zzso (one patient, one of one zzso also showed positive zzso zzso By contrast, there was no amplification of zzso DNA in control zzso either from patients with chronic zzso (three of three) or psoriasis zzso of zzso or from normal skin (three of zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso were only detected in the serum of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso (one of one) but were not present in cases of zzso (five of zzso zzso (three of zzso or in control subjects (three of zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may play a role in the zzso of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, we conclude that zzso analysis provides an important diagnostic zzso even in zzso zzso zzso
