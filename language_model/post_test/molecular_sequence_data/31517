Previous molecular dynamics simulations showed that besides the zzso measured folded structures, several zzso zzso could also have zzso zzso zzso Through the enhanced sampling molecular dynamics simulations on a series of zzso using either implicit or explicit zzso model, the present study systematically investigated the zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso It was observed that the zzso could take place for almost all zzso under study, especially in the presence of weak side chain zzso Moreover, the observed zzso structures for various zzso share the following common features: zzso the turn length in zzso structure is zzso shorter than that in folded zzso zzso the zzso side chains on the two strands are pointed to the opposite directions instead of packing in the same direction to form zzso core cluster in the folded zzso and zzso the zzso structure is zzso zzso zzso zzso The detailed analysis suggested that the zzso of zzso is the result of the competition between the formation of the zzso turn zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These predictions are desired to be tested by zzso
