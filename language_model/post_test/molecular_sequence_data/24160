Gene expression analysis by zzso in barley ( zzso zzso zzso after powdery zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso , zzso ) zzso revealed zzso zzso of 16 500 screened zzso fragments being zzso regulated 4 and/or 12 h after zzso Of these transcript derived fragments zzso 120 were zzso and for 28 out of 29 tested, induction was confirmed via zzso Most zzso did not show any zzso to sequences with known functions, others showed zzso to genes involved in primary and secondary zzso pathogen response, zzso regulation, and signal zzso zzso with zzso to a zzso zzso ( zzso ), a zzso zzso factor, a zzso an zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso were isolated as full length zzso zzso by zzso interference via zzso delivery of sequence specific double stranded zzso to leaf segments zzso two of these genes as possible candidates being zzso involved in the outcome of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso factor increased resistance to the zzso while zzso of zzso only led to a slightly enhanced zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso protein zzso and the zzso protein are candidates for negative regulators of powdery zzso zzso Based on expression zzso zzso appears to be more generally involved in stress zzso
