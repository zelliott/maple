In the present study, a method for simultaneous determination of two different zzso is developed based on zzso target recycling and zzso zzso The target recycling process is accomplished by taking advantage of the zzso property of zzso zzso zzso for specific zzso sequences in zzso In the presence of target DNA, the zzso DNA in our detection system can zzso with the target and be zzso to form short zzso Thus the target DNA is released and recognized by another zzso DNA, zzso the next round of zzso zzso On the other hand, two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso probe and a zzso zzso probe, are used for tracing two target zzso to further amplify the detection zzso Based on a sensitive differential pulse zzso stripping zzso zzso method for the simultaneous detection of zzso and zzso obtained by zzso two zzso two different target zzso are determined with high sensitivity and zzso mismatch zzso
