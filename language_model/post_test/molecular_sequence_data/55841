zzso zzso was produced during the stationary phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso and the molecular mass was estimated to be zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso was stable at 60 and 70 degrees C, with zzso of 13 h and 19 zzso at 80 and 90 degrees C, zzso zzso zzso activity was observed at pH zzso with zzso as a zzso and the zzso also zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Major zzso sites of the insulin B chain were identified as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene was cloned in zzso coli, and expression of the active zzso was detected in the zzso medium at 75 degrees zzso The zzso is expressed in zzso coli as an inactive zzso at 37 degrees C and is converted to the mature zzso by heating the zzso media to 60 degrees C or zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso and had a zzso of zzso and a molecular mass of 45 zzso The zzso sequence was zzso showing the exact signal zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso resulted in the production of active zzso with an zzso sequence identical to that of the native zzso The characteristics of the cloned zzso were identical to those of the native zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
