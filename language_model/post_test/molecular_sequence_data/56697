zzso is the zzso zzso zzso protein that activates the beta zzso of zzso zzso C zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso modified by addition of a zzso zzso zzso Placement of the zzso zzso tag at the N zzso allowed expression of functional alpha zzso zzso and selective identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso inhibited zzso activity and persistently activated zzso resulting in high zzso levels of zzso zzso The elevated levels of zzso zzso resulting from zzso alpha zzso expression were similar to those obtained with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which stimulates zzso activity, and zzso zzso acting via protein zzso C, activate the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity resulting from expression of zzso alpha zzso was unable to persistently activate this zzso The results indicate that persistent zzso zzso is insufficient to sustain the stimulation of a zzso zzso protein zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso
