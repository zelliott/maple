zzso of the a zzso of the zzso coli zzso has been proposed previously as a component of the zzso zzso A zzso in which zzso was zzso for zzso was generated and was found to be unable to zzso zzso A zzso carrying this zzso along with zzso genes zzso the c and b zzso was unusual in that it failed to complement a zzso zzso zzso on zzso minimal zzso Three zzso on zzso minimal medium contained plasmids that showed zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso One of these had a deletion in the a zzso The other two were point zzso resulting in the substitution of zzso acid by zzso and of zzso for zzso The zzso to zzso acid change implied that zzso and zzso are normally in close zzso To test this idea further, a series of zzso in which zzso acid was placed in zzso I at positions ranging from 42 to 57 was zzso Full zzso was regained only when the zzso acid zzso was present on the same side of a putative zzso as zzso over a span of three turns of the zzso These results and others suggest modifications of a previously proposed model for the zzso zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso The implications of these modifications for the mechanism of zzso zzso are zzso
