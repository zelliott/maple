The zzso zzso cell zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso regulates vascular zzso To gain understanding of this zzso a zzso zzso zzso library of 5 zzso zzso clones was prepared from bovine zzso zzso cells zzso and screened with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat brain zzso zzso zzso was found to express NO zzso activity when zzso into zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed sequences compatible with binding zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed a protein with a relative zzso mass of zzso which is zzso zzso to the rat zzso zzso and 51% zzso to the mouse zzso zzso The zzso portion of the protein exhibits several characteristics peculiar to the zzso cell zzso These include a zzso region and several potential sites for zzso zzso as well as a potential zzso site for zzso zzso Northern zzso to zzso from cultured zzso revealed an abundant zzso message, which was not increased by zzso with tumor necrosis factor zzso but was markedly increased by exposure to zzso stress for 24 zzso The unique features of the zzso cell NO zzso particularly in the zzso terminal portion of the zzso may provide for novel regulatory influences of zzso activity and zzso
