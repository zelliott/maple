zzso a zzso zzso zzso recognizes multiple zzso zzso and plays a key role in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso specificity of zzso involves two zzso surfaces, the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso process is a powerful zzso methodology for identifying zzso zzso zzso to any desired zzso The zzso process has been used to isolate zzso DNA zzso to human zzso Here, a zzso zzso DNA zzso to human zzso designated zzso with a zzso of approximately zzso zzso is zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso Previously described DNA zzso bind the zzso zzso while competition and zzso experiments indicate that the DNA zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso DNA zzso is a zzso with a zzso zzso sequence that has striking similarity to previously described DNA zzso to zzso but binds with 20 to zzso higher zzso The zzso core sequence has eight highly zzso zzso zzso and forms a zzso zzso A single zzso within the zzso structure can direct the DNA to a distinct zzso Additional sequence information in the duplex regions of zzso zzso contribute to greater stability and affinity of binding to zzso A zzso model for the interaction of DNA zzso to human zzso has been zzso
