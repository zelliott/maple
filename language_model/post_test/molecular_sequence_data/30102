zzso bacteria comprise a broad range of zzso zzso zzso which are able to zzso on (a number zzso compounds lacking zzso zzso This contribution will essentially be limited to those organisms that are able to zzso methanol and will cover the zzso zzso and genetic aspects of this still diverse group of zzso In recent years much progress has been made in the zzso and genetic characterization of pathways and the knowledge of specific reactions involved in methanol zzso Only a few of the genetic zzso zzso found have been matched by zzso experiments through the isolation or demonstration of specific gene zzso zzso several factors have been identified by zzso means and were shown to be involved in the methanol zzso reaction or subsequent electron zzso For the majority of these zzso their genetic zzso are zzso A comprehensive zzso on the regulation and molecular mechanism of methanol zzso is therefore zzso followed by the data that have become available through the use of genetic zzso The zzso of methanol zzso zzso the role of zzso zzso the involvement of accessory factors, the evident zzso of all these components to the zzso and the dedicated link to the electron transport chain are now accepted and well studied phenomena in a few selected zzso zzso zzso regulation of gene zzso efficiency of energy conservation and the question whether universal rules apply to zzso in general, have so far been given less zzso In order to expand these studies to less well known zzso species initial results concerning such area as genetic zzso the molecular characterization of specific genes and zzso zzso will also pass in zzso
