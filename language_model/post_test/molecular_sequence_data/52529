zzso zzso factor A zzso the only known zzso factor in zzso is also implicated in maintenance of zzso zzso although little is zzso about its molecular zzso zzso is a member of zzso box proteins zzso Some zzso proteins bind with high affinity to zzso DNA junctions that mimic a Holliday structure, a putative intermediate in DNA zzso To explore possible involvement of a zzso structure in the maintenance of zzso zzso we examine the binding of zzso human zzso to a synthetic zzso DNA zzso The human zzso binds to the zzso DNA junction with an approximately zzso higher affinity than to the corresponding linear duplex DNA and with essentially the same affinity as to a zzso DNA containing the human zzso light strand promoter zzso The zzso binds to the zzso as a zzso Both of the two zzso box zzso of human zzso are required for the high affinity binding to the zzso zzso
