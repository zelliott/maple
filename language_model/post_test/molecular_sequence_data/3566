The zzso zzso protein zzso is the central regulator of the zzso degradation zzso in zzso zzso zzso genetic and zzso data indicate that the zzso domain of the protein zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso which renders the protein competent as a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or zzso have been reported to change or expand their zzso zzso Here, we follow a fold recognition approach to generate three-dimensional models of the domain A of zzso and zzso with the purpose of deciphering the molecular activity of this protein zzso The model is based on the zzso data of the rat zzso zzso a typical zzso fold, consisting of eight zzso and seven zzso The fold identification is supported by zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso characteristic of the sequence families and confrontation with experimental zzso The model not only provides a rationale for understanding published experimental data, but also suggests the molecular mechanism of the zzso step and is a potentially useful conceptual tool for designing regulators with zzso zzso zzso
