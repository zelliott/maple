zzso of wild male fall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared in zzso experiments during zzso in zzso zzso were zzso either with a commercial sex zzso lure or corn and rice strain females obtained from laboratory zzso Over zzso male zzso were collected, and a large subset zzso of these zzso was analyzed for their host strain zzso The zzso lure attracted over four times more males than virgin corn or rice strain zzso Almost zzso of males attracted to the zzso lure were identified as corn zzso However, both corn and rice strain females attracted a higher percentage of rice strain zzso providing evidence that the commercial lure used in our study is biased to attract corn strain males and zzso rice strain population numbers relative to corn strain zzso Corn and rice strain males were attracted more to corn strain females than rice strain zzso although there was variation in response according to location and zzso Our results suggest that attraction of males to zzso females does not appear to be a zzso mechanism that results in zzso mating between corn and rice host zzso Clearly other zzso or perhaps even zzso mechanisms are important for the maintenance of host strains in zzso zzso
