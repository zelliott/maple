zzso zzso exerts selective effects on zzso sodium channels by eliminating fast sodium zzso and causing a zzso shift in zzso dependence of channel zzso In this study, we adopted a newly developed protocol that provides independent estimates of the binding and zzso rate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso sites on the sodium channel zzso important in the molecular analysis of channel zzso Novel zzso sites were determined in zzso zzso and zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso the results suggested that the zzso zzso consists of the zzso zzso segments of four zzso zzso facing the zzso zzso We systematically introduced at two sites in zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso containing zzso aromatic, charged, or polar zzso Generally, zzso at zzso increased both zzso and zzso resulting in no prominent change in zzso constant zzso It seems that the smaller the molecular size of the zzso at zzso the larger the rates of zzso and zzso indicating that this site acts as a gate regulating access of toxin molecules to a zzso zzso zzso at zzso selectively increased zzso but had virtually no effect on zzso thus causing a drastic increase in zzso At position zzso a zzso or aromatic zzso acid side chain was required to maintain normal sensitivity to zzso These results suggest that the zzso at position zzso has a more critical role in zzso zzso binding than the one at position zzso Here, we propose that the affinity of zzso to zzso sodium channels might be regulated by two zzso zzso and zzso at positions zzso and zzso which, respectively, control access and binding of zzso to its zzso
