The present study examined sequence variation in three zzso DNA zzso zzso namely zzso c zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 4 zzso and zzso among zzso zzso zzso from different geographical localities in zzso A portion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso separately from adult zzso zzso individuals and the zzso were subjected to sequencing from both zzso The length of the sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence variations within zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso contents of the sequences were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence differences among members of the zzso were significantly higher, being zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses using combined sequences of zzso zzso and zzso with three different zzso zzso zzso analysis, maximum likelihood and maximum zzso all revealed distinct groups with high statistical zzso These findings demonstrated the existence of zzso variation in zzso DNA zzso sequences among zzso zzso zzso from different geographical regions in China, and have implications for studying molecular epidemiology and population zzso of zzso zzso
