An abundantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da was isolated and zzso in a previous work from a local strain of zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso acid zzso sequence of the zzso zzso an zzso probe was derived and allowed the amplification of the zzso zzso by zzso This zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 94 zzso which appears to be processed to a mature product of 51 zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence of the zzso reveals high similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso and the zzso clone revealed the presence of an open reading frame of 282 zzso interrupted by two small zzso of 89 and 56 zzso with zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional zzso structure modeling of zzso exhibits a compact structure consisting of five zzso beta barrel stabilized by four internal zzso zzso The folding pattern revealed also a zzso site and zzso adjacent zzso zzso The zzso mechanism was investigated by transmission and zzso zzso zzso cause cell wall altering in a zzso manner against the zzso fungus zzso zzso
