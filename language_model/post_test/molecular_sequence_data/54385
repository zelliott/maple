zzso play a key role in the innate immune system of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso a vital component of the bacterial cell zzso zzso bacteria produce various types of zzso zzso that allow them to survive the zzso action of zzso when their outer membrane is zzso So far, three zzso inhibitor families have been zzso the Ivy zzso of zzso zzso family, the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso family, and the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Here, we report high-resolution crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso is the first in the recently discovered zzso family of zzso zzso while the structure of zzso is the first structure of a zzso zzso inhibitor from the zzso zzso Using zzso X-ray zzso we demonstrate that both zzso and zzso form stable zzso in zzso The functional zzso architecture of zzso is very different from that of the recently described zzso from zzso zzso zzso despite the close resemblance of their zzso Furthermore, zzso has distinctly different zzso and zzso folds compared to zzso zzso and Ivy zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso action of zzso proceeds via an zzso of a loop containing the zzso zzso motif into the active center of zzso zzso This motif is related to the functional zzso motif found in the zzso zzso
