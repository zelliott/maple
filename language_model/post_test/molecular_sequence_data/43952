Based on sequence zzso among the human, zzso zzso and mouse genes for the zzso zzso zzso overlapping partial fragments of zzso complementary zzso zzso were multiplied from zzso monkey zzso zzso using reverse zzso zzso of the individual zzso fragments generated a full-length monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the complete zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of monkey zzso zzso using a complementary zzso probe corresponding to the full-length zzso demonstrated major transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso and minor ones of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the monkey zzso zzso revealed a striking feature, zzso the absence of an zzso zzso sequence corresponding to zzso 10, present in the zzso zzso of all other species studied to zzso The monkey zzso zzso displayed zzso overall sequence zzso with the other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the total absence of this sequence from the monkey zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso of monkey zzso DNA using a human zzso 10 probe demonstrated its presence in the monkey gene and that it is totally spliced out from the primary zzso zzso cells zzso with the monkey zzso zzso showed similar high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding as those zzso with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cells expressing the zzso monkey and human zzso displayed similar responses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso In conclusion, zzso monkey zzso seems to lack the sequence corresponding to zzso 10 of the zzso gene in other zzso zzso The zzso does not alter zzso function, as the monkey zzso protein bound zzso and evoked zzso and zzso zzso responses comparable to those of the human zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso As the sequence zzso to zzso 10 is missing in the other two zzso zzso zzso those of zzso and zzso this extra zzso is apparently inserted into the zzso zzso zzso of some species during evolution from zzso sequences by a change in alternative zzso
