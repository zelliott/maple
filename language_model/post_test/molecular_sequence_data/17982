We have isolated and zzso a full-length zzso clone containing information for the rice zzso gene zzso zzso zzso mapping and sequence alignment between the zzso zzso clone and a previously isolated zzso zzso clone were used to determine the structure of the zzso zzso This allowed us to make the first complete structural characterization of a plant zzso zzso The analysis revealed the presence of a zzso zzso separated by an zzso from the first translated zzso of the zzso zzso This is one of the few reported cases of a plant gene containing such a zzso zzso zzso comparison between the previously isolated plant zzso genes suggests that such an zzso may be a common feature of plant zzso gene zzso The present study also confirms that the rice zzso gene family is composed of at least eight unique zzso
