The zzso protein family was first identified in animals as zzso proteins and found to control establishment of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso In zzso ten zzso zzso zzso genes are found where zzso zzso and zzso represent different zzso of zzso Also the zzso zzso and zzso proteins represent zzso proteins and display differential effects on control of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso specific zzso zzso marks are zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to animal systems zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso do not index zzso zzso in zzso zzso shows a central role in control of zzso formation and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso of zzso results in significant reduction of all zzso zzso zzso marks and causes DNA zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso accompanied with significant growth zzso zzso shows strong zzso effects on zzso gene zzso In zzso different experimental systems connected with zzso gene zzso have been used for genetic dissection of molecular mechanisms controlling zzso zzso zzso analysis of the genes identified by the isolated modifier zzso suggests that zzso gene zzso in plants is caused by zzso A new efficient experimental system for the analysis of zzso gene zzso has been established with the help of zzso zzso zzso The different lines established show either complete or partial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These lines have been successfully used either for zzso isolation or for functional analysis of zzso proteins in control of zzso gene zzso
