The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found to possess a complex promoter which can be transcribed by both zzso zzso II and III zzso II and pol zzso Pol III transcription, which is not typical of zzso zzso is driven by the sequences located in the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso predominantly within the transcribed region and is initiated 10 zzso upstream from the regular pol II zzso start zzso The pol III zzso start site is observed not only in in zzso zzso zzso but also in total zzso isolated from tissue culture cells, larvae, zzso and adult zzso A possible role of pol III zzso in mechanisms controlling the expression of full-length zzso transcripts in the developing fly, which are apparently relaxed in cell culture, is zzso
