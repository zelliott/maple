zzso zzso is a significant pathogen causing invasive disease in zzso and thus an understanding of the molecular basis of the zzso of this zzso is of zzso zzso zzso is a major mechanism by which bacteria can zzso proteins to zzso zzso is directed by the presence of a zzso zzso within specific signal peptides and this feature has greatly facilitated the zzso identification of putative zzso We have designed previously a zzso pattern zzso for the identification of zzso bacterial zzso based on the signal peptides of zzso verified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso searches with this pattern and other zzso methods have been used to identify putative zzso in the recently published zzso of zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso A core of 39 common putative zzso was identified, along with 5 putative zzso unique to strain zzso and 2 putative zzso unique to strain zzso Thus putative zzso represent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso As in other zzso bacteria, the largest functional category of zzso zzso zzso is that predicted to comprise of zzso binding proteins of ABC transport zzso Other roles include zzso that appear to participate in zzso (including the previously zzso zzso zzso protein export and zzso zzso and several zzso proteins of unknown zzso These data suggest zzso may have significant roles that influence the zzso of this important zzso
