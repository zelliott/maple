Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that tumor cells shed into the circulation from solid zzso are ineffective in forming distant zzso unless the cells are able to respond to growth conditions offered by the secondary zzso To identify the zzso properties that are specific for such growth response, we injected zzso cells, which had been recovered from bone zzso zzso in a breast cancer patient who was clinically devoid of overt zzso disease and established in culture, into the systemic circulation of zzso zzso The animals developed zzso in the central nervous system, and zzso tumor cells were isolated with zzso beads coated with an zzso that was zzso with human zzso The zzso cell population was compared with the injected cells by means of differential display analysis, and two candidate fragments were identified as zzso in the fully zzso zzso The first was an zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso known to mediate nerve growth zzso promotion of cell zzso The second was a novel gene product zzso candidate of zzso presumably zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso expression of candidate of zzso seemed to distinguish breast cancer cells with zzso potential from cells without zzso zzso zzso our experimental approach identified factors that may mediate the growth response of tumor cells upon establishment in a secondary organ and, zzso contribute to the zzso zzso
