The plum pox zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso whose function in the viral life cycle is still zzso The zzso protein contains seven zzso sequence motifs typical of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We have introduced several individual point zzso into the region coding for motif V of the zzso zzso protein and expressed these proteins in zzso coli as zzso binding protein zzso zzso that abolished zzso zzso activity also disturbed zzso zzso No zzso affected the zzso binding capacity of the zzso zzso These zzso were also introduced in the zzso zzso making use of a full-length zzso zzso zzso viruses carrying zzso proteins with reduced zzso zzso activity zzso very poorly in zzso and were unable to zzso whole plants without rapid zzso to zzso These results indicate that motif V is involved in the zzso zzso step required for zzso zzso zzso activity, and that this activity plays an essential role in virus zzso replication inside the infected zzso
