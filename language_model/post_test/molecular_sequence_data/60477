The control of zzso expression is essential for proper T zzso zzso We have previously described a zzso zzso element required for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel factor that binds to a critical functional site in the zzso zzso This factor, referred to as zzso factor zzso is a member of the zzso factor family and shares sequence similarity with the zzso class of zzso zzso Introduction of a specific zzso into the zzso binding site in the zzso zzso abrogates zzso activity in transgenic mice, supporting the hypothesis that zzso is important in zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed in all zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is present primarily in the zzso in T cells in which the zzso zzso is zzso whereas it is present primarily in the nucleus in T cells in which the zzso is zzso We thus zzso that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso plays an important role in zzso the specificity of function of the zzso zzso during T cell zzso
