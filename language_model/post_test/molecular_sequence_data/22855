zzso channel beta zzso regulate trafficking and gating zzso and zzso of zzso zzso channel zzso zzso Based on primary sequence zzso they are thought to be modular structures composed of five zzso zzso that are related to the large family of membrane associated zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of the beta zzso core, zzso zzso have recently been zzso however, very little is known about the structures of the A and E zzso The zzso A domain is a zzso region that differs among the four zzso of zzso channel beta zzso zzso Furthermore, this domain zzso alternative zzso to create multiple zzso structures within a given gene class that have distinct effects on zzso We have solved the solution structure of the A domain of the human zzso zzso a zzso zzso that we have shown previously to have zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso channel trafficking and zzso
