zzso is an zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mice with zzso deletions of zzso (a zzso zzso zzso exhibit complete zzso zzso accompanied by growth zzso and zzso cell migration zzso which results in zzso of the zzso bulb and zzso cell zzso in the zzso zzso However, the zzso and molecular abnormalities in zzso zzso mice are not fully zzso In this study, we first defined the distribution of zzso in zzso zzso and adults zzso or zzso using zzso activity in zzso from zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is expressed throughout the nervous system zzso spinal cord, enteric and zzso nervous zzso In addition, zzso activity was detected in zzso zzso particularly in zzso with high zzso force, such as zzso heart valves, and skeletal zzso In order to identify the cellular population where the zzso zzso zzso zzso newly generated zzso zzso mice were crossed with zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice to obtain zzso conditional knockout zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso mice was almost identical to zzso mice, including zzso zzso growth zzso and decreased zzso zzso Our findings indicate that loss of zzso in the zzso cell lineage zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
