Global regulatory agencies require zzso sequence analysis as part of their safety evaluation for transgenic zzso Analysis typically focuses on zzso proteins and adjacent zzso zzso zzso Recently, regulatory expectations have expanded to include all reading frames of the inserted zzso The intent is to provide biologically relevant results that can be used in the overall assessment of zzso This paper evaluates the relevance of assessing the zzso potential of all DNA reading frames found in common food genes using methods considered for the analysis of zzso sequences used in transgenic zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to compare genes from zzso rice, zzso cucumber, melon, zzso and tomato using international regulatory zzso zzso show that zzso for zzso yielded zzso alignments that exceeded zzso similarity thresholds and zzso alignments that matched eight or more consecutive zzso acids with an zzso other crops produced similar zzso This analysis suggests that each zzso crop has a much greater potential for zzso risk than what has been observed zzso We demonstrate that a meaningful safety assessment is unlikely to be provided by using methods with inherently high zzso of false positive alignments when broadly applied to all reading frames of DNA zzso
