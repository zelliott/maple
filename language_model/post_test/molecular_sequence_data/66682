Bone degradation by zzso depends upon active transport of hydrogen zzso to zzso bone zzso This transport is supported by the parallel actions of a zzso zzso and a zzso channel located in the zzso ruffled zzso We have previously identified a novel zzso channel, zzso which appears to be the avian counterpart to zzso and is expressed zzso with the appearance of acid zzso as avian zzso differentiate in zzso In this article, we show that suppression of zzso in zzso avian zzso results in decreased zzso by zzso derived from these cells and decreased ability of the cells to zzso zzso zzso is rescued by the presence of zzso consistent with a selective loss of zzso channel but not zzso pump zzso zzso bone zzso is known to be dependent on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso from zzso has affinity for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso We find that suppression of expression of zzso in developing zzso results in decreased zzso zzso which is rescued by zzso consistent with the loss of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes no change in the steady state level of zzso zzso but does result in failure of zzso pump and zzso to zzso in cultured zzso zzso We conclude that suppression of zzso interferes with zzso bone zzso by zzso functional zzso of zzso pump and zzso
