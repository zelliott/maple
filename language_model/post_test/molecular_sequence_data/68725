zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso can be coupled in an appropriate zzso zzso However, definitive evidence has been lacking as to whether these events are coupled in zzso and whether the order of these two processing events is zzso Here, we investigated these questions by examining the in zzso processing of transcripts that differ solely by the precise zzso of an zzso within the first of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso techniques were zzso to analyze the processed zzso that accumulated in monkey cells zzso with plasmids zzso these zzso We found that, whereas all of the primary transcripts that lacked the inserted zzso were processed via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso none of the transcripts initially disrupted in this signal were processed this way even though the zzso zzso had been properly excised and zzso sometimes preceded zzso In addition, deletion of the second zzso signal resulted in failure of spliced transcripts to zzso We conclude that selection of, but not necessarily zzso at the zzso site precedes zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso although zzso exists during selection of the sites to be used for zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso the actual order of the subsequent zzso reactions is probably simply a reflection of their relative zzso
