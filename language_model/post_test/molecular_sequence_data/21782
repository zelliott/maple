One of the prevailing arguments in evolutionary theory is that the zzso of genes can acquire novel zzso This is because only one of the zzso need maintain the ancestral function, leaving room for natural zzso due to a respite in zzso zzso Although many zzso can subsequently become disabled by zzso zzso a few may also go on to diverge along a novel evolutionary zzso Here, evidence is provided that demonstrates how this scenario may not always be zzso Rather, in the case of the highly zzso zzso zzso family, an initial relaxation in selection induced a zzso that was later suppressed and heavily compensated for as part of a zzso and zzso zzso Despite a resulting zzso there remains a distinct preservation of both sequence and functionality among the zzso This would indicate that zzso can be retained by selection for reasons related to their redundant zzso It also shows that, even when positive selection is zzso in duplicate zzso this may be of a zzso nature rather than one representing any zzso zzso Generally, this development would perhaps be a more common outcome for gene zzso than is currently zzso
