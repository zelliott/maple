The advent of quantitative zzso opens new opportunities in biomedical and clinical zzso Although quantitative zzso methods based on stable isotope labeling are in general preferred for zzso research, zzso discovery is a case example of a biomedical problem that may be better addressed by using zzso zzso zzso As a proof of concept of this zzso we report the use of zzso quantitative zzso to profile the urinary zzso of kidney chronic zzso dysfunction zzso The aim was to identify zzso zzso that could be used to personalize zzso therapies for kidney transplant zzso We detected (by zzso and zzso (by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso urine specimens across 39 zzso patients and 32 control zzso Although zzso zzso zzso differentiated between the groups when including all the identified zzso specific peptides derived from zzso and zzso were found to be significantly more abundant in control than in zzso patients and correctly identified the two zzso These peptides are therefore potential zzso that might be used for the diagnosis of zzso In addition, zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso were able to differentiate between patients with different forms of zzso with zzso and sensitivities of zzso in a training set and, significantly, of approximately zzso in an independent validation set of zzso Interestingly low expression of zzso at zzso zzso coupled with high expression of zzso zzso diagnosed zzso in virtually all zzso Multiple reaction monitoring experiments further validated the results, illustrating the power of our zzso quantitative zzso approach for obtaining quantitative profiles of urinary zzso in a zzso comprehensive, and precise fashion and for zzso zzso
