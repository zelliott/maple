The zzso complex of zzso G proteins is the most outstanding example for the divergent regulation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex zzso some zzso zzso zzso and stimulates the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although former studies identified the zzso region located in the C2 domain of zzso as an important interaction site for zzso the zzso of the zzso effect of zzso has not been zzso Here, we identified the zzso domain as the zzso region using full-length zzso zzso The relevant zzso signal transfer motif in zzso was determined as zzso zzso acids zzso zzso acids of this zzso motif were absolutely necessary for zzso to be zzso by zzso whereas they were zzso for zzso or zzso zzso The zzso motif is present in all three zzso zzso zzso that are activated by zzso but is absent in other zzso zzso zzso as well as other known zzso of zzso The emerging concept of two contact sites on different zzso halves for effective regulation of zzso zzso is zzso
