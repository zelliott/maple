The zzso structure of the protein zzso in solution at zzso has been determined and is compared with the X-ray crystal structure, which was also solved in the Joint Center for zzso zzso zzso at zzso and at zzso zzso Both structures were obtained using the current largely automated zzso and solution zzso methods used by the zzso This paper zzso the accuracy and precision of the results from these recently established automated approaches, aiming for quantitative statements about the location of structure variations that may arise from either one of the methods used or from the different environments in solution and in the zzso To evaluate the possible impact of the different software used for the zzso and the zzso structure zzso and analysis, the concept is introduced of reference structures, which are zzso using the zzso software with input of zzso distance constraints derived from the molecular models representing the results of the two structure zzso The use of this new approach is explored to zzso global differences that arise from the different methods of structure determination and analysis versus those that represent interesting local variations or zzso The zzso of the protein core in the zzso and crystal structures thus provided a basis for the identification of complementary information from the two different zzso It was thus observed that locally increased zzso B values correlate with dynamic structural zzso in solution, including that the solution state of the protein involves a slow dynamic equilibrium on a time scale of milliseconds or slower between two ensembles of rapidly zzso zzso that contain, respectively, the zzso or trans form of the zzso zzso and represent about 25 and zzso of the total zzso
