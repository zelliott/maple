zzso that function in zzso are typically zzso by the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso by the nuclear DNA and therefore must be imported into the zzso It is becoming evident that zzso import into zzso is zzso widespread and is essential for cellular zzso but virtually nothing is known about the mechanism of zzso zzso We have identified and characterized zzso precursor zzso in zzso zzso The identification of zzso located precursor zzso clearly indicates that zzso zzso are imported as zzso The zzso precursor zzso zzso to cloned nuclear zzso zzso label with zzso using zzso zzso zzso and in isolated zzso via an zzso zzso activity, and are processed to mature zzso by zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso extract contains an zzso P activity capable of processing a zzso zzso precursor as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were detected on Northern blots of zzso zzso and the zzso ends of these zzso were characterized by primer extension zzso The structure of the precursor zzso and the significance of nuclear zzso precursor zzso within the zzso are zzso
