The utility of three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso for the assignment of zzso and zzso zzso of the inflammatory protein zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso is demonstrated at a protein concentration of zzso zzso It is shown that dramatic zzso of the zzso nuclear zzso effect spectrum zzso is obtained by editing with respect to the frequency of the zzso zzso in a third zzso The improved resolution in the zzso experiment largely zzso the assignment of protein zzso zzso and allows for the determination of distance constraints from otherwise overlapping zzso cross zzso for purposes of zzso structure zzso The results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso can facilitate the structure determination of small proteins and promises to be a useful tool for the study of larger systems that cannot be studied by conventional zzso zzso zzso
