Type zzso restriction zzso zzso recognize zzso DNA sequences and cleave both DNA strands at fixed positions downstream of the recognition zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso sequence zzso however it cuts at multiple sites in the vicinity of the target zzso We show that zzso is a zzso which has two DNA binding surfaces and displays optimal zzso activity when bound to two recognition zzso zzso is zzso by zzso into an zzso domain zzso which lacks zzso activity but binds specifically to the recognition sequence as a zzso and a zzso domain zzso which forms a zzso with zzso zzso zzso Fold recognition approach reveals that the zzso of zzso is structurally related to zzso Holliday junction zzso zzso We demonstrate that the isolated zzso zzso of zzso possesses zzso zzso activity and zzso cuts 3 zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso is zzso in the zzso and becomes activated upon specific DNA binding by the zzso This leads to a complicated pattern of specific DNA zzso in the vicinity of the target zzso zzso analysis identifies the zzso domain in the putative Type III zzso and functionally zzso zzso
