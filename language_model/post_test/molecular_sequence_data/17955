A set of zzso that are expressed in tomato zzso were zzso We further characterized two of these zzso zzso and zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso show low levels of zzso zzso in immature zzso and zzso levels in mature zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso genes are zzso in the tomato zzso and are linked on zzso 3, approximately 5 zzso zzso Although these zzso did not zzso their deduced protein sequences zzso and zzso have zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso and zzso genes each have two zzso but they are located in zzso zzso zzso and zzso show significant protein sequence similarity to zzso zzso of plant zzso zzso The similarity of zzso and zzso to the bacterial zzso zzso is equivalent to the zzso described for different zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso expression of zzso and zzso might relate to a requirement for zzso degradation during zzso tube zzso
