Several strains of group G zzso zzso form zzso when grown in zzso zzso strains interact with zzso and this study reports the isolation of a novel zzso and zzso protein of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of the fog gene revealed structural similarity with M proteins of both zzso and group A zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were found to multiply in human zzso All strains of zzso express protein G, a protein known to interact with the constant region of zzso G and zzso Surprisingly, a clinical isolate expressing protein G, but lacking protein zzso was killed in human whole zzso however, the addition of intact soluble protein zzso restored the ability of the bacteria to survive and multiply in human zzso This is believed to be the first report of a soluble zzso protein salvaging an zzso strain from being zzso The zzso property of protein zzso is dependent on its zzso zzso Thus, in zzso zzso zzso zzso and when added to whole blood, protein zzso triggers the formation of visible zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are disabled in their killing of the zzso Moreover, the results emphasize the importance of an intact zzso zzso as presented on the bacterial surface, for full protective zzso
