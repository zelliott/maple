Major zzso complex class I zzso molecules bind zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and deliver them to the cell surface for immune surveillance of viruses and zzso Whereas key steps of zzso assembly and its acquisition of peptides in the zzso are relatively well zzso little is known about how zzso molecules leave the zzso for cell surface zzso Here, we show that zzso export of human classical zzso molecules zzso is regulated by their zzso single zzso acid, zzso or zzso These zzso zzso zzso in nearly all known human zzso zzso serve as the zzso export signal by binding to the zzso complex, a structural component of coat protein complex II zzso zzso that mediate zzso zzso Together, our results strongly suggest that zzso export of human classical zzso molecules can occur via a zzso process dictated by a highly zzso zzso export zzso
