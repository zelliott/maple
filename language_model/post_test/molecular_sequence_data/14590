zzso one of the major toxins of South American zzso zzso zzso subspecies, is an zzso complex composed of two distinct zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso nontoxic zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso It's well known that CB has a high zzso zzso however the molecular aspects that determine this fact remain zzso In this study, an in zzso approach was used to predict the CA structure by zzso zzso and the zzso structure by means of molecular zzso CA structure was built using the software zzso taking zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso Different criteria measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were indicative of the reliability and the proper fold for the predicted structural model of zzso Then, a combination of this model and CB crystal structure was used to build the structure of zzso complex through zzso zzso zzso The zzso model suggested that by means of zzso and zzso stacking zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso and zzso zzso Those interactions could prevent the zzso zzso of the CB onto the zzso interface by blocking part of the zzso binding surface of the zzso This fact could explain the differences regarding to zzso activity between the zzso complex and zzso In addition, the zzso model showed zzso regions of CA that could bind the zzso expressed in target zzso
