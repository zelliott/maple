The product of the zzso gene from zzso coli is required for zzso zzso of zzso into zzso To make the zzso protein accessible to zzso analysis, the protein was zzso from cells that zzso the zzso gene from a zzso zzso promoter zzso It was calculated that the zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein was determined, and it confirmed that the initiation zzso of zzso zzso translation zzso the stop zzso of the preceding zzso gene by 4 zzso zzso similarity between zzso and zzso factors was demonstrated by limited zzso of zzso by zzso The zzso sites within zzso were identified by zzso sequencing of the two zzso zzso The position in the zzso protein of the major zzso site was zzso to a zzso zzso site which is characteristic for zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the levels of zzso are equivalent in zzso and zzso grown zzso the amount of the protein was estimated to be approximately zzso zzso coli zzso Upon zzso of cell zzso zzso was found to be partially associated with the zzso The results therefore indicate that zzso is the first known zzso zzso protein that has specificity for a particular charged zzso
