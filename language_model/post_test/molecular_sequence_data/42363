We examined the profile of two zzso zzso antagonists, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso in the small cell lung cancer zzso line zzso zzso B zzso a zzso zzso sharing sequence zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso release (in part) from zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso occurred between zzso and zzso depletion of zzso zzso is a likely mechanism because zzso zzso zzso release after a zzso desensitizing dose of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso competitively inhibited zzso zzso zzso In contrast, these compounds antagonized zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The pharmacological profiles obtained support zzso zzso for zzso peptides on this zzso line, zzso the need for thorough examination of zzso relationships when investigating effects of zzso zzso on intact zzso
