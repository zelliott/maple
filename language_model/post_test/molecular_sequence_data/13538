A highly repeated DNA sequence with a repeat unit of zzso 180 zzso was found in zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso The repeating units of six isolated, independent clones were zzso These units have 177 or 178 zzso are zzso zzso in their DNA base zzso and show zzso sequence zzso The copy number of this zzso repeat unit is about zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis with the repeating units as the probe and zzso analysis indicated that the repeated DNA sequence of zzso zzso is closely associated with the major zzso in the zzso regions of all 18 zzso at zzso zzso
