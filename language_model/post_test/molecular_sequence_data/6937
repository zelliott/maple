Renal brush border membrane zzso zzso activity is inhibited by hormonal mechanisms involving zzso of protein zzso A and zzso The recently cloned rat zzso zzso zzso contains several protein zzso C but no protein zzso A consensus sites zzso zzso In the present study we have expressed wild type and zzso zzso zzso C consensus sites zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The expression of transport function as well as the basic transport properties were unaffected by the removal of the consensus zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C with zzso zzso zzso led to a zzso zzso of expressed wild type zzso zzso simultaneous exposure to zzso zzso prevented the zzso induced zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not prevented by the removal of the protein zzso C consensus zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on wild type zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso regulation of expressed zzso does not involve the predicted consensus zzso The involvement of zzso zzso sites and/or of a zzso zzso protein is zzso
