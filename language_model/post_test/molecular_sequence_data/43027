zzso zzso is a member of a family of cell surface zzso zzso zzso that interact with zzso zzso growth factors and a variety of other zzso systems that support the zzso maintenance and repair of an zzso To investigate this apparent zzso of zzso at the cell surface, we have studied the expression of zzso in the mouse zzso and compared this expression with that of zzso The zzso of mouse zzso zzso clones that zzso to human zzso predicted that zzso and human zzso were highly similar in zzso zzso the analysis of zzso cells, zzso cell lines and zzso extracts indicated that the zzso zzso reacted specifically with zzso zzso zzso developed against the human zzso zzso as detected by zzso zzso zzso in sections of embryonic zzso occurred exclusively on zzso cells that represented the putative precursors of the hard and zzso tissue zzso No zzso was detected in zzso or in muscle zzso Areas where zzso was particularly abundant were sites of high zzso activity where intense zzso and zzso interactions are known to occur zzso the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was weak in the early zzso culminated during the zzso phase and at the moment of cell lineage zzso and persisted in the zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso in contrast, was primarily detected in zzso and zzso in some zzso cells, with zzso zzso that did not or only partially overlap with those of zzso In zzso zzso analyses confirmed these expression patterns at the zzso level, identifying zzso cells as the major source of zzso zzso These data indicate that the expression of zzso occurs along unique and zzso regulated patterns, and suggest that zzso and zzso may have distinctive functions during tissue zzso and zzso
