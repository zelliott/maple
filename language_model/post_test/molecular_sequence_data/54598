The role of the ancestral zzso cycle of the African zzso fever virus zzso is not well understood in the endemic areas of eastern zzso We therefore zzso the zzso infection status on samples collected from 51 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ticks from 26 independent zzso burrows at a single ranch in zzso zzso samples from 83 domestic pigs without clinical symptoms, originating from specific locations with no recent reported zzso outbreaks were included in this zzso All samples were derived from areas of central Kenya, where zzso outbreaks have been reported in the zzso zzso with zzso was confirmed in zzso of zzso zzso pools, zzso of adult zzso serum samples and zzso of domestic pig serum samples by using zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso were positive for zzso zzso investigated by using zzso but none of the domestic pig zzso were zzso Twenty zzso zzso 12 domestic zzso and three zzso viruses were zzso at four zzso zzso The zzso zzso from ticks and domestic pigs clustered within zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso viruses zzso directly from zzso zzso at same locality as the tick zzso were within zzso zzso IX and genetically similar to viruses causing recent zzso outbreaks in Kenya and zzso This represents the first report of the zzso of different zzso zzso in zzso zzso ticks and adult wild zzso The data from this and earlier studies suggest transfer of viruses of at least two different zzso zzso from wild to domestic pigs in East zzso
