Previously, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified only in zzso Here, we describe properties of the zzso and zzso zzso genes from mouse and rat that reveal an unusually high level of divergence from their human zzso In addition to a low level of zzso acid sequence conservation ( approximately zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a unique zzso motif of approximately 400 zzso within the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso were detected in brain and heart, whereas the mouse zzso zzso zzso was zzso in brain, zzso and zzso by Northern zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed a particularly strong signal for both zzso zzso in rat locus zzso in which expression was zzso from the first zzso zzso Lower levels of zzso were also detected in other zzso zzso and in the zzso However, the expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso was more widespread than that of zzso zzso being found also in the cerebral zzso of rat zzso In contrast to zzso brain, neither zzso was expressed in the zzso or zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are evolving at a much faster rate than other known zzso zzso zzso and that their expression patterns and functional properties may differ significantly between zzso
