The presence of RON and its zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human zzso zzso was examined by zzso using zzso sections and zzso analysis followed by direct sequencing of zzso product using zzso isolated from frozen zzso In normal zzso zzso RON was zzso expressed in zzso cells, especially in the bottom of zzso On the other hand, the expression was distributed zzso in zzso and in colon zzso The expression of RON was significantly related to the degree of differentiation of colon cancer and the deletion of the expression was observed in colon cancer specimens with high zzso The zzso analysis of zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso tissue revealed the presence of two RON zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso sequencing of major product of zzso was revealed to be identical to that of human zzso zzso On the other hand, major product of zzso was revealed to be almost identical to that of a zzso zzso of RON transcript which has been found in human gastric cancer cell line, zzso The results obtained in this study may indicate that both zzso RON and its zzso zzso play an important role in regulating the normal function of zzso zzso such as differentiation and zzso activity and the expression of both zzso RON and its zzso zzso could be considered to be reduced during zzso of human zzso zzso
