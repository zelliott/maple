zzso zzso that provide small molecular mimics to explore zzso acid recognition have been zzso Specifically, a family of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and their zzso characteristics zzso Single zzso acid modifications were made from the parent zzso zzso zzso which targets zzso zzso Moving the zzso at position 10 in the sequence of the appended zzso to position 6 zzso changed the sequence preference of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at position 6 to zzso zzso caused more complex changes in DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for these zzso zzso by zzso DNA zzso zzso with the zzso zzso At 55 degrees C in the presence of 5 zzso zzso zzso binds to a zzso site with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, whereas zzso binds to its target zzso site with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant for zzso with zzso DNA is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models have been developed and refined to account for the observed sequence zzso As with much larger zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso single zzso acid changes can lead to single or multiple base changes in the DNA site zzso
