The reductive zzso zzso of zzso zzso to vinyl zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, to zzso zzso by an zzso microbial community has been investigated by studying the processes and zzso of the main zzso components of the zzso zzso hydrogen, produced by zzso zzso was the electron donor for the zzso zzso to VC and zzso without forming any appreciable amount of other zzso zzso and in the near absence of zzso zzso The microbial community structure of the consortium was investigated by preparing a zzso zzso clone library and by zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso used in the clone library allowed the harvest of zzso zzso from both bacterial and zzso members in the zzso A total of zzso clones were screened by zzso analysis of the clone zzso followed by the sequencing of zzso group representatives and zzso zzso The clone library contained sequences mostly from zzso zzso zzso No sequences similar to those of the known zzso bacteria like zzso zzso or zzso zzso were found in the clone library, and none of these bacteria was present in the zzso consortium according to zzso Almost all clones fell into six previously described zzso of the bacterial domain, with the majority zzso zzso being zzso members of the zzso zzso Other clones were in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and a lineage that could not be affiliated with existing zzso zzso zzso No zzso clones were found in the clone zzso zzso to the zzso novelty of the microbial community with regard to previously cultured zzso no specific microbial zzso could be hypothetically affiliated with the zzso zzso The predominance of zzso in the microbial zzso the main group revealed by clone library analysis, was confirmed by FISH using a purposely developed zzso
