zzso is a zzso expressed inner nuclear membrane protein of unknown zzso zzso in its gene give rise to zzso zzso muscular zzso zzso a zzso condition with an associated life-threatening zzso We have previously reported that zzso is zzso in a cell zzso manner in human zzso cell lines zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting and cell zzso zzso of zzso contribute to the zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso 111, zzso Recently, five zzso in human zzso were identified as undergoing cell zzso zzso using a zzso egg zzso zzso model system zzso et zzso (2005) zzso of zzso from zzso is regulated through zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso egg zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso In the present paper, zzso human zzso was zzso from a zzso zzso expression system, analyzed by protein mass zzso and shown to exist in at least four different zzso species, each of which could be zzso by treatment with alkaline zzso Further analysis identified three zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso corresponding to the zzso and doubly zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso zzso was zzso and also demonstrated that this zzso was zzso in zzso Using an in zzso protein zzso A zzso we observed two zzso species, one of which was zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso A is thus the first zzso that has been identified to specifically zzso zzso These results improve our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso and point towards possible zzso pathways involved in regulating zzso zzso
