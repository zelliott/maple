We recently demonstrated that cell zzso in plants is regulated by a zzso zzso system, in which three zzso zzso zzso of Cell zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso binding zzso 1 zzso and zzso Resistance 1 zzso competitively regulate the expression of genes for cell zzso Here we show that zzso zzso Factor 2 zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso and zzso similar to zzso and also zzso regulate cell zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The expression of each zzso is zzso or induced by light, but zzso expression is dependent on zzso signaling and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso may play different roles in cell zzso in different signaling zzso
