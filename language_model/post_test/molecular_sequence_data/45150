As a highly reduced zzso zzso performs specialized functions to generate and carry zzso into the zzso by its zzso growing zzso zzso Yet the molecular genetic basis of these functions is poorly zzso Here, we identified zzso unique zzso most of which were not reported previously to be in zzso from mature zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso approach, zzso of them having more than one zzso zzso zzso reveals that an overrepresentation of the proteins was related to signal zzso zzso wall zzso and metabolism zzso and protein zzso assembly and degradation zzso as well as zzso and energy metabolism zzso Further, zzso of the identified proteins are functionally unknown and do not contain any zzso domain associated with known zzso These analyses also identified 5 novel proteins by de zzso sequencing and revealed several important zzso mainly involved in signal zzso (such as protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C2 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso assembly and degradation (such as zzso zzso processing zzso putative zzso zzso zzso and wall zzso and metabolism (such as zzso zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso The study is the first close investigation, to our knowledge, of protein complement in mature zzso and presents useful molecular information at the protein level to further understand the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and tube zzso
