After zzso transmission of zzso B virus, infants of zzso positive zzso carrier mothers may develop zzso zzso zzso Previously it has been suggested, that zzso zzso B in adults was associated with specific zzso in the zzso The aim of this study was to zzso whether specific viral zzso are associated with zzso zzso B in young zzso 

The complete zzso of five mothers and their infants with zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso amplified and directly zzso 

Between 6 and 43 base pair exchanges between the zzso zzso of the infants and their mothers were zzso The zzso spread over the entire virus zzso zzso exchanges in the basic core zzso and zzso region were identified in all zzso A zzso virus population was detected in four zzso 

Many new zzso were proved to emerge during zzso zzso B in zzso who had been zzso zzso zzso negative zzso were the zzso population in all children, whereas these zzso could only be detected as zzso in four zzso The data suggest that the selection of a specific zzso negative viral strain may be associated with the development of zzso zzso B in zzso
