Four zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso generated by a zzso zzso zzso scheme were characterized at the molecular level and all contained a zzso of the same region of the zzso When this region was cloned from zzso zzso and transferred into zzso on a shuttle zzso the same zzso zzso as the original zzso was observed, suggesting that the region contained a zzso of adherence and zzso The smallest piece of DNA identified which was capable of zzso adherence and invasion was a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene of zzso To confirm further that zzso was responsible for the observed zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene was inserted into the zzso gene of zzso to generate a strain with two zzso copies of zzso This zzso strain displayed the same zzso and zzso zzso as the original zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso resulted in an zzso zzso increase in adherence and invasion in zzso but this strain was unable to colonize or cause disease in zzso The zzso zzso strain, although able to colonize mice, was attenuated in a ferret disease zzso
