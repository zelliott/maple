zzso of zzso zzso stores evokes zzso entry across the plasma membrane by inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso currents in many cell zzso Recently, zzso and zzso proteins were identified as the molecular identities of the zzso channel zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, extensive database searching and zzso analysis revealed several zzso zzso events in the zzso protein family, which may account for the evolutionary origins of distinct functional properties among zzso zzso zzso Based on similarity to key structural zzso and essential zzso for channel functions in zzso zzso database searching also identifies a putative primordial zzso sequence in zzso zzso Furthermore, modern zzso appears to acquire new structural zzso as early as zzso before divergence into zzso The evolutionary patterns of structural zzso might be related to distinct functional properties of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso proteins display two zzso internal repeats located at zzso segments 1 and 3, both of which contain key zzso acids essential for channel zzso These findings demonstrate zzso and zzso relevance of zzso proteins in light of different evolutionary origins and will provide novel insights into future structural and functional studies of zzso zzso
