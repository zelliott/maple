The measurement of zzso contributions to the splitting of zzso zzso of zzso zzso pairs in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso The zzso appear as small zzso zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso of more than 90 zzso to specific sequential sites in the protein allows correlation of the zzso contributions with predictions based on the known zzso and known structure of the zzso zzso as an additional source of information for protein structure determination in solution are zzso
