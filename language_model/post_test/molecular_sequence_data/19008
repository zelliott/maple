Despite the evidence that the zzso zzso fluctuations have seriously affected the distribution of zzso diversity, less is known on its impact on zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to test the hypothesis that the divergence of two desert zzso species zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso occurred during the zzso We zzso 11 nuclear zzso in 60 individuals from the two species to estimate the divergence time between them and to test whether gene flow occurred after species zzso zzso time between the two species was estimated to be zzso million years ago zzso a time at which zzso was at its maximum in China and deserts developed widely in central zzso zzso model also indicated that the two species had zzso in the presence of gene zzso We also detected evidence of selection at GO in zzso zzso and to a lesser extent at zzso Together, these results underscore the importance of zzso climate zzso in triggering plant zzso as a result of zzso zzso
