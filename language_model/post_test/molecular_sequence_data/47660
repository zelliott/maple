zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso factor zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso M, and zzso which all share the zzso zzso as a signal zzso zzso zzso zzso acts on cells expressing zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structural zzso of zzso required for the recruitment of the individual zzso zzso have not yet been zzso Based on the structure of zzso a three-dimensional model of human zzso was zzso Using this model, 10 surface exposed zzso acid zzso of zzso were selected for zzso using analogies to the zzso zzso recruitment sites of zzso zzso and zzso The respective zzso of human zzso were expressed as soluble fusion proteins in zzso Their biological activities were determined on zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso with substantially decreased zzso and one zzso zzso were identified and further analyzed with regard to recruitment of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso still binds zzso but fails to recruit zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso more efficiently engages the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to bind to zzso These findings reveal a common mechanism of zzso recruitment in the family of zzso zzso and offer considerable perspectives for the rational design of zzso zzso and zzso
