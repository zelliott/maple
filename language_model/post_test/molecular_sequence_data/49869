zzso storage disease type zzso zzso is caused by a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso alignments identify a signature motif shared by zzso and a family of zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso signature motif zzso have been identified in the zzso gene of zzso zzso In this study, we characterize the activity of seven additional zzso within the zzso Five zzso lack zzso zzso zzso activity and one retains residual activity, suggesting that in zzso the signature motif is a functional element required for zzso zzso zzso
