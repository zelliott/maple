Distribution of zzso potential of DNA fragments was zzso A method for calculation of zzso potential distribution based on zzso law is proposed for long DNA fragments zzso 1000 zzso zzso For short DNA zzso this technique provides a good correlation with the results obtained using zzso equation thus zzso its application in comparative studies for long DNA zzso zzso was performed for several DNA fragments from zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso containing promoter and zzso zzso The results obtained indicate that coding regions are characterized by more homogeneous distribution of zzso potential whereas local zzso of DNA zzso profile is typical for promoter zzso The possible role of zzso interactions in zzso zzso recognition is zzso
