Some zzso zzso of the zzso sake zzso zzso was zzso revealing eight tightly clustered open reading frames zzso downstream from zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the genes are expressed as an zzso with zzso initiating upstream of zzso and terminating immediately 3' to the ninth zzso zzso zzso is also represented by two small zzso zzso and zzso which differ in size by approximately 90 zzso and primer extension experiments demonstrated a corresponding difference in the zzso zzso A zzso sequence constitutes the 3' zzso of both zzso and zzso and we propose that this sequence has a dual regulatory function in controlling the expression of las zzso acting both as a barrier to zzso zzso degradation of the zzso zzso and as a zzso zzso zzso which limits the expression of zzso zzso Three of the genes in the las zzso have identifiable counterparts in other zzso zzso zzso is likely to be involved in zzso zzso zzso which encodes an zzso transport zzso is probably involved in the zzso of zzso zzso while zzso specifies a zzso zzso zzso which may be the zzso S leader zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso by the resident zzso element zzso zzso zzso S zzso The remaining five zzso in the las zzso are apparently unique, and their significance with respect to the zzso S zzso is presently not zzso
