zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso opposite zzso zzso in DNA, thus preventing occurrence of zzso to zzso zzso In zzso extract prepared from the zzso of wild type but not zzso mice, zzso opposite zzso in DNA was excised by zzso however, the generated zzso (AP) site opposite zzso mostly remained zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso efficiently excised zzso opposite zzso and prevented mouse zzso zzso zzso from zzso the generated zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso site opposite zzso created by zzso DNA zzso or zzso opposite zzso was efficiently zzso by zzso in the presence of an excess amount of zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso excised zzso opposite zzso as efficiently as did zzso zzso but failed to prevent zzso from zzso the generated zzso zzso zzso zzso bound duplex zzso containing zzso pair with a lower apparent zzso than that of the zzso and prevented zzso from zzso zzso opposite zzso or the generated zzso zzso The zzso zzso failed to prevent zzso from zzso zzso opposite the generated zzso site, thus indicating that the protection of its own product by zzso is an intrinsic function which depends on the zzso domain of zzso
