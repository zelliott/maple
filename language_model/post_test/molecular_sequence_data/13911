zzso the transport characteristics of zzso a new orally active zzso in rat small zzso zzso zzso 

A rapid zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso was zzso by an inwardly directed zzso but did not show zzso zzso To investigate the transport system, the zzso and zzso effects of various compounds on zzso zzso were zzso Although the zzso and zzso composed of zzso acids with zzso side chains did not inhibit the zzso of zzso those having zzso zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso acid showed an zzso zzso Among the oral zzso tested, zzso showed marked zzso while zzso and zzso had no zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso were observed only when the zzso were preloaded with zzso peptides such as zzso or zzso while other compounds which exhibited zzso had no zzso zzso 

Based on the above results, there seems to be zzso zzso in the zzso transport system which may depend on the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be zzso transported via a system that recognizes peptides having zzso as the zzso zzso zzso
