The zzso and zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso coli were expressed in zzso coli and zzso Their zzso activity was examined using a zzso DNA region containing the putative promoter of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is responsible for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso shift zzso indicated specific binding of zzso and zzso to a region of 78 zzso spanning zzso positions zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start of the first open reading frame of the zzso This region includes stretches of zzso to zzso coli zzso 70 promoter consensus sequences and to the zzso coli zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso proteins was not found at a zzso consensus, typical for various promoters of zzso gene zzso zzso activity was not detected for zzso alone and only high zzso of zzso were able to interact with the zzso promoter in our zzso The two proteins bind zzso at the indicated region of the zzso promoter and further evidence is provided showing that the zzso complex formed involves a zzso of zzso and zzso The specific activity of zzso but not of zzso was enhanced when the protein was expressed in zzso coli at 28 degrees C, relative to expression at 37 degrees zzso In addition, zzso complex formation is affected by zzso The zzso coli zzso proteins bind to the same region of the zzso promoter and are able to interact with the zzso proteins from zzso zzso
