During cell zzso binding of zzso proteins to zzso zzso and zzso are important for zzso and activity of these proteins at nascent zzso zzso zzso Here, we report on a transient interaction between the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso an early component of these sites, during spreading of zzso cells on zzso In zzso binding of protein zzso zzso to zzso tail was found dependent on free calcium and zzso zzso but independent of a functional zzso zzso The interaction was enhanced by conditions that favor the zzso of zzso zzso by protein zzso zzso reached zzso zzso of zzso of zzso tail and required the zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso of peptides derived from in zzso zzso zzso tail identified zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding at the zzso tail by zzso or deletion reduced the rate of zzso to zzso or zzso We suggest a possible mechanism zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso may lead to exposure of a zzso site for protein zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso and/or zzso interaction partners, thereby affecting the formation of cell zzso zzso
