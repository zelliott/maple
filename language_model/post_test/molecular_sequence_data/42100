Human serum zzso G was separated into its heavy and light chains by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and transferred zzso to a zzso zzso zzso fragments liberated from the light chain by in zzso zzso with zzso were then analyzed by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso On comparing the zzso patterns of these fragments derived from three major zzso marker zzso types, two distinct zzso specific for the zzso types were zzso zzso of the two specific peak peptides confirmed that they were identical to a stretch zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso light chain, which contains zzso zzso variation at position zzso
