We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso cells by stabilization of its zzso In the present report, we showed that zzso of the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso coding sequence significantly reduced the stability of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso of the zzso transcript was markedly prolonged after zzso zzso A zzso protein factor from zzso cells was found to specifically bind to zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells resulted in the reduction of the zzso binding activity in a zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso mapping revealed a zzso sequence within the zzso which interacts with the protein zzso Competition experiments with zzso further demonstrated the importance of zzso for the binding zzso Point zzso in zzso of the zzso sequence reduced the protein binding to zzso while increasing the stability of the zzso zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that the zzso sequence in the zzso is involved in zzso regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
