zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso isolated from human zzso consists of a set of at least three zzso with apparent molecular masses of 72, 64, and 54 zzso zzso This zzso is confirmed by the detection of three zzso zzso of 50, 48, and 36 zzso which can be zzso by zzso to zzso zzso beta G obtained by in zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso To examine the structural relationships between these zzso two zzso clones of 1912 base pairs zzso and zzso base pairs zzso zzso human zzso beta zzso were isolated from a human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso portions of these two zzso are identical with the exception that clone zzso contains an additional 86 base pairs at the end of the common zzso zzso This zzso could result in the generation of a zzso beta G species of zzso zzso acid zzso instead of the zzso zzso acid zzso predicted by the sequence of clone zzso The calculated molecular masses of the two zzso zzso by zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso close to the size of the major zzso zzso beta G of 48 zzso The identity of proteins coded for by these zzso clones was confirmed by comparing the predicted zzso acid sequences to sequences determined from zzso zzso peptides obtained from human zzso zzso beta zzso Two zzso zzso beta G zzso of zzso bases zzso and zzso bases zzso have been detected by Northern zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso zzso mapping experiments demonstrated that zzso beta G zzso have zzso zzso zzso
