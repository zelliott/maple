The growth and differentiation of zzso cells are regulated by signal zzso through zzso protein zzso Recently, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso X), was identified in human bone zzso zzso and found to be expressed predominantly in zzso zzso cell zzso Our preliminary analyses indicated that the zzso gene was also highly expressed in human zzso 

Mouse zzso zzso was isolated, zzso and found to zzso a zzso approximately zzso identical to the human zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso of tissue sections indicated that zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso of the developing heart as well as in the zzso of the left zzso and in the zzso of large arteries in adult zzso A weak signal was seen also in coronary zzso zzso 

zzso shows a unique specificity of expression among zzso zzso genes and may be involved in signal zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that specific signal zzso mechanisms are present in such zzso
