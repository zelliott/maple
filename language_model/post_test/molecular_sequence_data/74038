In zzso zzso the growing bud zzso a portion of the zzso network from the mother cell soon after it zzso Although this polarized transport of zzso is thought to require functions of the zzso there are conflicting reports concerning the nature of the zzso element zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso in which both zzso inheritance and zzso cables zzso of zzso zzso are zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso with no zzso to other characterized zzso Extra copies of zzso a gene zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso suppress zzso inheritance defects and partially restore zzso cables in zzso delta zzso zzso zzso is also observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso strain to a lesser zzso Together, these results provide compelling evidence that zzso inheritance in zzso is an zzso zzso zzso and zzso also exhibit the same pattern of genetic zzso zzso in zzso are zzso lethal with zzso in zzso and zzso but not zzso Although zzso and zzso are both required for the formation and/or stabilization of zzso cables, zzso in these genes disrupt zzso inheritance and nuclear segregation to different zzso Thus, zzso and zzso may act in zzso to establish molecular and functional zzso of the zzso zzso
