zzso and transmission of the prion disorders zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a modified zzso of the prion protein zzso zzso protein gene zzso zzso associated with relative zzso to zzso have been identified in zzso humans and possibly zzso zzso data have not been derived for mule zzso a species susceptible to the zzso chronic wasting disease zzso zzso analysis of the open reading frame zzso in zzso 3 of the mule deer zzso gene revealed zzso in all 145 samples zzso with 10 potential zzso zzso Because zzso zzso of the samples were zzso for a coding change zzso at zzso 138 zzso zzso and a zzso zzso at zzso zzso and individual deer with three or four different zzso were identified a possible gene zzso was zzso Analysis of zzso clones containing mule deer zzso genes revealed a full length functional gene and a processed zzso The zzso was characteristic of previously described zzso in that it lacks zzso and is flanked by repeat zzso Three zzso of the functional gene were identified, with coding changes only at zzso 20 zzso and 225 zzso zzso of zzso functional gene zzso from 47 zzso mule deer showed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso were grouped by coding changes in the functional zzso four of the six possible zzso combinations were identified in infected zzso Three zzso zzso with coding changes in zzso 3 were identified in the mule deer samples zzso Because the zzso appear to be zzso zzso disorders, the presence of an untranslated zzso is not expected to affect disease zzso zzso selection of a zzso method specific for the functional gene is critical for large-scale studies to identify the role of the zzso gene in zzso to zzso in mule zzso
