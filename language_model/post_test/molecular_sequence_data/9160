The zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in regulating zzso stability and cancer prevention by controlling the key proteins involved in the DNA damage zzso Despite this important role in controlling other zzso zzso itself has not been recognized as a target for zzso Here, we report that zzso regulation plays a central role in DNA damage signal zzso We find that stabilization of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, is accomplished by a specific zzso of zzso zzso which is zzso at zzso 18 by the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and thus contributes to zzso stabilization and zzso of zzso After zzso radiation, zzso of zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Our findings provide a quantitative transmission mechanism of the DNA damage signal to coordinate a zzso DNA damage zzso
