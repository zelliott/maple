We used zzso cloning to identify the zzso Clock gene in zzso Clock is a large zzso unit with 24 zzso spanning approximately 100,000 zzso of DNA from which transcript classes of zzso and approximately 10 zzso zzso Clock encodes a novel member of the zzso family of zzso zzso In the Clock zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso in a zzso donor site causes zzso skipping and deletion of 51 zzso acids in the zzso zzso Clock is a unique gene with known zzso function and with features predicting DNA zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso represents the second example of a zzso zzso clock protein zzso zzso zzso which suggests that this motif may define an zzso zzso feature of the zzso clock zzso
