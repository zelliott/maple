By adding zzso to the zzso mixture, we previously established a zzso method to amplify a DNA segment of the zzso G gene of B virus zzso derived from a zzso zzso We have found that DNA of other zzso strains derived from zzso zzso and zzso zzso can also serve as the template in our zzso zzso Under the same conditions no product was obtained with DNA of zzso agent 8 of green monkeys and zzso zzso 2 of zzso or the human zzso zzso viruses types 1 and zzso Thus, this zzso method is useful to discriminate zzso from other closely related zzso zzso
