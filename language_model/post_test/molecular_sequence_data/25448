A zzso zzso sequence of the gene zzso on zzso 4 of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been zzso The sequence includes zzso zzso zzso upstream and 523 zzso 3' downstream of the coding zzso The zzso zzso upstream region of the gene shows little similarity to zzso regions of other sequences genes expressed in the developing cereal zzso The coding sequence is interrupted by one zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso consists of 399 zzso acids and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso This sequence confirms protein zzso to be a member of the zzso zzso of zzso The similarity with other members of the family expressed as zzso acids in identical positions is in the order of zzso and pronounced in the zzso half of the zzso zzso zzso assumed to form clusters stabilizing the zzso structure are highly zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the developing zzso without a signal zzso and protein zzso zzso was evenly distributed among the free and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso An internal zzso region of 21 zzso acids zzso zzso may serve as a signal for targeting the zzso into the zzso of the zzso zzso The gene for protein zzso could not be detected in the barley variety zzso and some of its zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 7, enhance and zzso respectively, the expression of the protein zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso of another zzso zzso of the barley zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso region, have been zzso Small insertions and deletions and the presence of an internal stop zzso identify this zzso as part of a zzso related to the protein zzso zzso
