The spreading ability of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso is the result of directional assembly and zzso of zzso filaments at one pole of the zzso zzso the 120 zzso outer membrane protein that is required for zzso zzso is located at the pole of the zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso growing in laboratory media and within infected cells release a certain proportion of the zzso zzso after zzso zzso In this study, we report the characterization of the zzso gene which is located on the zzso zzso and encodes the protein responsible for the zzso of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso exhibits zzso identity with those of the zzso and zzso outer membrane zzso of zzso zzso The construction and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is required for exclusive polar zzso of zzso on the bacterial surface and proper expression of the zzso zzso in infected zzso
