At present the zzso gene identification methods in microbial zzso have a high prediction accuracy of verified translation termination site zzso zzso but a much lower accuracy of the translation initiation site zzso zzso zzso The latter is important to the analysis and the understanding of the putative protein of a gene and the regulatory machinery of the zzso zzso the accuracy of prediction of zzso is one of the remaining open zzso 

In this paper, we develop a zzso statistical model to describe the zzso of zzso zzso The model incorporates several features with biological zzso including the correlation between translation termination site and zzso of zzso the sequence content around the start zzso the sequence content of the consensus signal related to zzso binding sites zzso and the correlation between zzso and the upstream consensus zzso An entirely zzso training system is constructed, which takes as input a set of zzso coding open reading frames zzso by any gene zzso and gives as output a set of zzso parameters (without any prior knowledge or empirical zzso and zzso The novel zzso is tested on a set of reliable zzso of genes from zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso may correctly predict zzso of the start sites of 195 zzso confirmed zzso zzso zzso of 58 reliable zzso zzso Moreover, the test results indicate that the zzso gives higher accuracy for more reliable zzso and is robust to the variation of gene zzso zzso may be used as a zzso for a gene zzso After processing by our program, the improvement of gene start prediction of gene zzso system is zzso zzso the accuracy of zzso predicted by zzso zzso increases from zzso to zzso for zzso zzso verified zzso while that by zzso zzso increases from zzso to zzso for the same zzso These results show that our zzso is one of the most accurate methods to identify zzso of zzso zzso 

The program zzso can be zzso through the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso
