zzso zzso are large zzso complexes that catalyze the synthesis of biologically active peptides in zzso and zzso and typically have an unusual structure and zzso zzso zzso have recently been engineered to modify the zzso specificity to produce peptides of a new zzso In this study we show that zzso zzso can also be modified by moving the zzso intrinsic zzso region to the end of the internal zzso acid binding zzso thus generating strains that produce new truncated peptides of the predicted zzso zzso of the zzso domain results in zzso zzso thus showing the essential role of this region and the possibility of obtaining peptides of different lengths by genetic zzso zzso of the peptides depends on the presence of a functional zzso zzso
