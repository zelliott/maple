The zzso element can repress P element mobility in zzso zzso Three zzso zzso elements were made that had either two zzso acid zzso or a single zzso acid deletion in the putative zzso zzso domain found in the zzso zzso Each zzso element was expressed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso control construct strongly zzso P element mobility, measured by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The single zzso acid deletion zzso failed to repress P mobility by the double zzso acid substitution zzso was position zzso The results show that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is important for P element zzso This supports the zzso model of P element repression, because zzso zzso motifs are involved in zzso zzso
