The persistent zzso duct syndrome zzso is a rare form of male zzso characterized by the persistence of zzso derivatives in otherwise normal zzso Two zzso present in the zzso state, have been previously described in such zzso The present observation is the first example of compound zzso in this zzso DNA was obtained from a zzso patient with zzso in whom no serum zzso hormone zzso could be detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso of cloned zzso chain reaction amplified fragments of the zzso gene revealed a zzso deletion in the second zzso of the maternal zzso this deletion disrupted the open reading zzso It occurred at a site containing two zzso direct repeats zzso a zzso sequence and removed one whole repeat plus all of the intervening zzso It may be the result of a slipped zzso at the DNA replication zzso The paternal zzso contains a stop zzso in the third zzso These two zzso zzso both zzso zzso are consistent with the occurrence of zzso and are shared with a zzso normal younger zzso In this family, various other zzso devoid of zzso significance, suggest that the zzso gene is highly zzso
