The zzso locus is the most zzso of the class I genes zzso within the human major zzso zzso This zzso is mainly located in zzso 2 and 3, which code for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and includes the zzso zzso binding zzso However, information about adjacent zzso regions zzso 1 and 2) has not been extensively reported but could be very important in establishing an understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms involved in the zzso generation of zzso and the zzso zzso In the present work, zzso 1 and 2 of 14 zzso zzso are studied and their significance is zzso 10 have been zzso in our own laboratory and the other 4 have been previously reported by zzso Different zzso families share the complete zzso 1 zzso at this region, 12 out of 14 zzso zzso could be included in four groups with the same zzso 1 zzso a) zzso zzso zzso b) zzso zzso zzso c) zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso latter two zzso have specific characteristics in both zzso 1 and 2, which may reflect a common evolutionary zzso and zzso zzso zzso The other zzso zzso and zzso do not have identical zzso 1 sequences compared to any of the described groups, but share many similarities with zzso The zzso evolutionary zzso seems to be very specific since it branches separately from other zzso both in zzso 1 and zzso 2 zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso group distribution and similarities according to zzso 1 sequences were not confirmed when using zzso 2, especially in the cases of zzso zzso and zzso This would suggest that both point zzso fixed by genetic drift and gene conversion events are involved in zzso zzso The latter events could be supported by the strong zzso between zzso 1 and, to a lesser extent, zzso 2, and also the zzso content within zzso Finally, the precise knowledge of these zzso regions could be important for developing DNA base typing strategies for the zzso zzso
