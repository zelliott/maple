zzso is a zzso protein in brain and the only zzso protein zzso under the control of zzso zzso which plays a critical role in zzso zzso signals to cellular zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso by binding to the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here, we report crystal structural studies of zzso bound to a zzso zzso The zzso protein containing zzso and the zzso zzso forms an intimate zzso in which zzso displays a zzso extended zzso and the zzso zzso shows zzso zzso zzso the zzso lobe from one zzso and the zzso lobe from the second zzso form a combined binding site to trap the zzso Thus, the zzso provides two binding sites, each of which is reminiscent of the fully collapsed zzso of zzso commonly observed in complex with, for example, the zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso The interaction between the zzso and zzso is highly specific and similar to zzso
