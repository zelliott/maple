The disease zzso caused by the fungus zzso zzso is acquired directly from environmental exposure rather than transmitted zzso One explanation for the zzso of this species is that interactions with environmental predators select for zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso can cause a zzso from the normal zzso zzso to a zzso form, enabling zzso to survive exposure to zzso yet zzso reducing zzso in zzso models of zzso Like other human zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso changes that influence the biology of the zzso and outcome of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso switch also happens under in zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that this zzso switch, rather than being under zzso control, is controlled by DNA zzso since all zzso strains bear zzso within genes zzso components of the zzso zzso High rates of isolation of zzso strains can be explained by the physical size of zzso zzso genes and a zzso zzso of the strain used in zzso switching zzso zzso to wild type zzso zzso in zzso or within a zzso host can occur through different mechanisms, with one being zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso reveals several zzso clearance of the infection, zzso maintenance of the zzso or zzso to wild type forms and progression of zzso These findings demonstrate a key role of zzso events in zzso to zzso the ability of a zzso pathogen to cause zzso
