To zzso the relationship between the frequency of core zzso and zzso zzso of zzso B virus zzso in Japanese zzso carriers, we investigated the zzso sequence of the zzso region of zzso in 26 Japanese zzso carriers zzso who were zzso zzso zzso and 11 who were zzso zzso The number of zzso acid changes zzso zzso zzso in the core region of zzso in zzso was significantly greater than that in the zzso carriers zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso stop zzso zzso was found in zzso of zzso zzso carriers, while no zzso zzso was found in the zzso zzso carriers, suggesting that the frequency of core zzso may be associated with the presence of the zzso stop zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in the frequency of zzso acid changes among zzso zzso The mean number of core zzso acid changes of liver zzso patients, chronic active zzso patients, chronic persistent zzso patients, and zzso carriers were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We detected hot spots for core zzso which showed characteristic zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected exclusively in patients with chronic liver disease with or without zzso To address further the relationship between frequency of core zzso and the presence of the zzso stop zzso zzso we investigated the zzso zzso sequence serially along with zzso in three patients with chronic zzso B in whom the zzso either became inactive or remained active after the zzso zzso of the zzso stop zzso zzso and a significant increase in core zzso changes after zzso were noted in all three zzso Our results suggest a close association between the frequency of core zzso acid changes and the presence of the zzso stop zzso zzso some characteristic core zzso may be associated with the clinical course of chronic zzso B in Japanese zzso
