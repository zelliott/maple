zzso zzso protein zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso that is involved in cell division and zzso zzso zzso is unique among all known zzso in having a zzso tail zzso region in the zzso tail and a zzso region following the motor zzso zzso through zzso has been shown to zzso regulate the interaction of zzso with zzso Here we have used the zzso zzso system to identify the proteins that interact with the tail region of zzso A protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was found to interact specifically with the tail region of zzso zzso is related to a group of protein zzso specific to plants that has an additional sequence between zzso zzso and VIII of the zzso zzso zzso domain and an extensive zzso zzso The zzso domain alone of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso protein but strongly with full-length zzso whereas the zzso region did not interact with either zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was confirmed using zzso zzso Using zzso expressed full-length and truncated zzso we have shown that the zzso domain is capable of zzso zzso The association of zzso with zzso suggests regulation of zzso or zzso proteins by zzso and/or that zzso is involved in targeting zzso to its proper cellular zzso
