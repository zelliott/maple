A highly sensitive test based on reverse zzso followed by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was developed to detect the Australian zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso organ virus zzso of zzso zzso The zzso detected viral zzso in as little as 10 zzso zzso organ total zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso of serial zzso of a zzso zzso clone showed that the zzso zzso was sufficiently sensitive to detect a single zzso equivalent using a DNA zzso The specificity and sensitivity of the zzso was also demonstrated using zzso infected zzso zzso zzso where zzso sequences could be amplified from zzso organ and zzso zzso as early as 6 h post infection zzso and from zzso by 24 h zzso In contrast, transmission electron zzso zzso identified zzso and zzso in zzso organ cells and zzso from Days 3 and 6 zzso respectively, while there was no evidence of infection in zzso cells at any zzso The practical application of the zzso was demonstrated by screening healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso The high prevalence zzso of zzso that were positive by zzso suggests that zzso is endemic in northern zzso In addition, results with zzso organ, zzso and zzso zzso suggest that small zzso zzso may be best suited to the zzso testing of valuable zzso The speed and sensitivity of the zzso make it a useful adjunct to zzso for diagnosing zzso infection of zzso zzso with the additional benefit that screening of zzso zzso may facilitate selection of zzso zzso
