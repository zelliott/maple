zzso is a zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso or low amounts of functional zzso factor VIII zzso Replacement therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a proportion of patients which makes further treatment of these patients ineffective and zzso To zzso mechanisms underlying inhibitor development, seven zzso clones specific for zzso were generated from two zzso A patients with high zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso variable region heavy zzso chain gene family usage was identified by zzso using zzso specific zzso zzso sequences of the zzso gene of zzso specific clones were determined and aligned to the most zzso germ line genes in the zzso Analysis of the expressed zzso genes by zzso revealed that the zzso zzso either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso gene zzso Three zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes and two by zzso zzso zzso all from the zzso gene zzso Of zzso family expressing zzso one belonged to zzso zzso and the other one to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso length was found to be highly different amongst these clones ranging from 11 to 22 zzso acid zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso use zzso gene segments derived from zzso gene zzso Diversity of the expressed zzso genes and their zzso length implies that different zzso are recognized by these zzso
