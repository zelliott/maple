The mass zzso strategy including three steps is presented for primary structure determination of the zzso blocked zzso First, the zzso sequencing is performed by using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso coupled with zzso Y zzso Then, the zzso is zzso according to the obtained zzso sequence information and the resulting peptides are identified by mass zzso and zzso degradation after zzso by zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso is zzso by tandem mass zzso The strategy was successfully applied to the sequence determination of two novel zzso blocked peptides named zzso and zzso
