Recent studies have shown that zzso phase shifts of the zzso rhythm of locomotor activity are associated with zzso expression in the zzso nucleus zzso and zzso leaflet zzso of the lateral zzso nucleus of zzso In order to determine whether zzso expression is necessary for the phase shifting effects of a zzso zzso we assessed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso at various times after an injection of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso time zzso 6; zzso at a time when zzso zzso an acute increase in locomotor activity and zzso phase advances in the zzso rhythm of locomotor zzso zzso zzso zzso was not observed in the zzso or zzso regions of any animals treated with zzso or vehicle at any time point zzso These results indicate that exposure to an zzso stimulus at zzso times when this stimulus zzso phase shifts does not induce zzso protein synthesis in the zzso or zzso zzso
