A novel zzso named zzso was produced by zzso zzso zzso with medicinal zzso Its zzso gene cluster zzso has been previously zzso For the functional study of the zzso gene in zzso zzso it was disrupted with a double crossover via zzso zzso The zzso composition of zzso zzso produced by the zzso strain zzso zzso 139 zzso was found altered from that of zzso with zzso decreasing zzso For zzso characterization of zzso the zzso gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso With a continuous coupled zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to have the ability of catalyzing the transfer of zzso specifically from zzso zzso to a zzso zzso the zzso carrier located in the zzso membrane of zzso zzso 139 zzso zzso the zzso gene has been identified to code for a zzso which plays an essential role in the formation of repeating zzso units during zzso zzso
