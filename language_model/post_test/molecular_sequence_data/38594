The zzso zzso gene is a marker for zzso neural zzso In this study, we analyze later expression in putative zzso of the peripheral nervous zzso Prior to neural crest migration, zzso expression is zzso in crest zzso zzso expression appears initially in loose clusters of cells in positions corresponding to zzso zzso Double zzso with a zzso marker shows that zzso cells are not differentiated zzso and generally lie peripheral to zzso in zzso Later, expression appears associated with the zzso lateral line and other zzso zzso For the zzso lateral line zzso we show that zzso extends zzso along this nerve in tight correlation with lateral line zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is consistent with these cells being satellite zzso and zzso zzso
