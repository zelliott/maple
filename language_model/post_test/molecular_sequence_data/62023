The zzso are a family of zzso zzso binding to zzso acids on the cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed at much higher levels in inflammatory zzso and specifically binds to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The terminal zzso zzso is thought to be the main zzso recognized by zzso To understand the basis of this biological recognition reaction we combined zzso experiments with a molecular modeling zzso We employed zzso transfer difference zzso zzso experiments to characterize the binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 to zzso at atomic zzso The experimental results were compared to a zzso zzso model and to X-ray data of a complex of zzso zzso and zzso The data reveal that zzso mainly recognizes the zzso zzso acid and a small part of the zzso zzso of zzso The crystal structure of a complex of zzso with zzso zzso 1 was used as a basis for a modeling study using the zzso zzso The model generated was very similar to the original crystal zzso zzso the X-ray data were used to predict theoretical zzso values utilizing the zzso zzso The good agreement between experimental and theoretical zzso values indicates that a combined zzso zzso approach yields a reliable structural model for the complex of zzso with zzso 1 in zzso zzso
