We have cloned the zzso zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso The gene (named zzso is unique in zzso zzso and has been identified through zzso with the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein composed of zzso zzso zzso The identity between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is about zzso and there is a greater degree of similarity between the N zzso than the C zzso A disruption of the zzso coding sequence diminishes the ability of zzso cells to grow on zzso acid as a sole carbon zzso The expression of the zzso gene is regulated at the level of transcription, and is induced more than zzso by the addition of zzso acid to the zzso
