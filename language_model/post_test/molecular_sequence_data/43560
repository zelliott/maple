The interactions responsible for the zzso zzso binding of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to its consensus DNA binding site have been zzso A three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso complex is zzso with emphasis on the structure of regions of observed zzso zzso This structure is based on zzso distance restraints derived from zzso data, along with zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso and results from zzso and zzso interference zzso zzso III of the zzso binds in the major groove of the DNA and the zzso arm binds in the minor groove, in zzso with other zzso complexes whose structures have been zzso The zzso zzso recognizes the unusual DNA consensus sequence zzso The roles in sequence specificity and strength of binding of individual zzso acid zzso that make contact with the DNA are zzso We show, based primarily on the observed zzso zzso that the interaction of zzso with the DNA is the major zzso of this uncommon zzso binding specificity in the zzso zzso zzso
