A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a hot spring in zzso zzso zzso The cells were zzso and possessed an zzso a zzso type cell wall and a single polar zzso zzso zzso grew by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as electron donors and used only carbon dioxide as a carbon zzso The optimum growth conditions were 45 degrees C, pH zzso and the absence of zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene revealed that the isolate was a member of the zzso and related to the zzso zzso and zzso in the family zzso However, the zzso tree constructed using zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso was distant from any other known bacteria with sequence similarities of less than 90 zzso On the basis of zzso features and zzso analysis, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of a new zzso within the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
