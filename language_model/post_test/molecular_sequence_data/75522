zzso sequences were isolated from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone containing two zzso zzso regions was zzso DNA sequencing of one of these regions zzso revealed that it contains a zzso closely related to the zzso class of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso end zzso zzso including the zzso is identical to the corresponding part of the zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso a zzso derived transcript of zzso zzso is present in zzso at the zzso forming zzso
