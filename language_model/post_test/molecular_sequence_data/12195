Human zzso A zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso by a gene on zzso zzso of this zzso result in zzso disease, an zzso zzso disorder that leads to premature death in affected zzso For treatment of genetic diseases, we have developed a zzso zzso system, zzso that enables zzso of zzso markers with a second zzso gene as part of a zzso message using the promoter from the Harvey zzso zzso virus and an internal zzso entry site zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso based on this system that carry the human zzso A zzso either upstream zzso zzso or downstream zzso zzso from the zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Each of eight independent zzso zzso zzso clones and all four zzso zzso zzso zzso clones showed significantly higher activity of zzso A than the parental zzso More than 50% of the zzso zzso zzso clones and all four zzso zzso Gal zzso clones showed significantly higher activity of zzso A than the parental zzso In these zzso zzso the zzso whose translation was zzso zzso was expressed at higher levels than when the same zzso was translated in an zzso manner zzso These zzso may prove useful in the gene therapy of zzso zzso
