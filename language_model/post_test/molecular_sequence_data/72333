The structure of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been solved at zzso to an R factor of zzso making zzso the second low activity zzso zzso solved to zzso Although zzso is zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso (a regulatory loop near the active zzso adopts a different fold in zzso The zzso zzso binding site and the zzso binding site are also different from those of zzso The results explain why zzso zzso are specific for different zzso zzso zzso and zzso A model presented for zzso and zzso interactions has implications for the evolution of protein zzso zzso
