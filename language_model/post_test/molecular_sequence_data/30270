A vertical gel zzso apparatus is described which can distinguish DNA fragments differing by single base pair zzso The system employs a zzso zzso gel containing zzso and a temperature zzso which runs either perpendicular or parallel to the direction of zzso The zzso system zzso several features of the zzso system zzso and is relatively inexpensive to zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso differing by one, two, or nine base pair zzso were zzso DNA zzso mobility changed abruptly with the temperature induced unwinding of DNA zzso zzso to AT zzso at different locations within the first melting domain, as well as an AT to zzso zzso were separated with temperature zzso parallel to the zzso zzso The relative zzso of the zzso observed in the gels were compared to predictions of DNA melting zzso General agreement was observed however complete correspondence was not zzso
