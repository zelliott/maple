zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes bacterial zzso a serious disease of rice zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor of zzso implicated in degradation of rice cell walls and the zzso zzso of innate immune responses, such as zzso deposition and programmed cell zzso Here, we present the high-resolution structural characterization of zzso that reveals an zzso zzso binding module as a distinct functional attachment to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso binds to a zzso zzso through a rigid pocket zzso distinct zzso and zzso chain recognition sites where the zzso zzso is situated 15 A from the anchored zzso Point zzso zzso the zzso anchor site or blocking the pocket, even at a considerable distance from the zzso active site, can abrogate in zzso zzso function, exemplified by loss of both zzso and the ability to elicit host defense zzso A high conservation of the module across zzso zzso emphasizes the significance of this unique plant cell zzso function for this important group of plant zzso zzso A comparison with the related structural families illustrates how a typical zzso is recruited to act on plant cell walls to promote zzso thus providing a remarkable example of the emergence of novel functions around existing scaffolds for increased proficiency of zzso during zzso zzso
