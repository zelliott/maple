zzso zzso of bovine brain derived zzso zzso growth factor zzso with zzso and sodium zzso reduces its capacity to stimulate zzso in zzso zzso cells, and this zzso with the modification of less than 3 of its 12 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso on immobilized zzso shows that the affinity of the modified zzso for zzso is also decreased zzso The capacity of zzso zzso of low zzso affinity zzso to stimulate zzso is also reduced, and this zzso with a reduced affinity for its cell surface zzso zzso characterization of zzso using zzso mapping and sequencing procedures demonstrates that zzso is the primary site of zzso The results indicate that in zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso binding and suggest that this zzso and its local environment are involved in the interaction of zzso with both zzso and its cell surface zzso
