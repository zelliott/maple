The signal zzso cascade zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a Ras zzso zzso that mediates diverse cellular responses to environmental cues and contributes to zzso zzso zzso Here we report that the Ras zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso cascade to zzso zzso by limiting functional assembly of the core zzso components through the zzso of zzso a zzso protein that couples activated zzso to its zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that, on zzso of zzso is modified by zzso which releases the zzso of zzso complex zzso Thus, Ras activates the zzso zzso cascade through simultaneous dual zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso complex zzso zzso depletion results in increased zzso zzso zzso without zzso in the timing or duration of the zzso These observations suggest that zzso functions as a threshold zzso controlling sensitivity of the cascade to stimulus and providing a mechanism to allow zzso zzso of the cascade in chronic or complex zzso zzso
