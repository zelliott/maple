zzso N zzso is a plasma zinc zzso which consists of two zzso active small zzso zzso and two large zzso zzso that protect the protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from peptides found in the zzso such as complement zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso By removing only one zzso acid, zzso has the ability to change zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso is a member of a larger family of zzso many of which also cleave zzso and zzso Because of the highly zzso active sites and the possible redundant functions of zzso it has been difficult to zzso the role of zzso in disease zzso The future use of gene zzso technology may be the most appropriate way to understand the function of zzso in zzso
