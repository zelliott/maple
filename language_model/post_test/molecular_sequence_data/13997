The triple zzso is an important motif found in the family of zzso as well as a set of zzso zzso This zzso may be identified by its strict sequence constraints, including zzso as every third zzso and a high content of zzso zzso The first high-resolution structure available for a triple zzso has confirmed the model of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and has defined a highly ordered water network whose zzso depends on the presence of zzso The role of the zzso triple zzso lies in its capacity to zzso in a variety of forms as well as its ability to bind a wide range of zzso The extensive zzso water network, together with the high content of zzso restricted zzso zzso are the major contributors to the stabilization of triple zzso whereas zzso and zzso interactions define zzso association and zzso zzso zzso in the repeating zzso sequences of triple zzso have been shown to cause a variety of human zzso
