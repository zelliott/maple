The zzso sequence of the zzso gene from six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonging to the zzso species group was determined to examine details of evolutionary change in the structure of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is comprised of one zzso zzso region, eight zzso seven zzso and three 3' zzso zzso zzso organization was identical in all the species zzso but different from that of zzso zzso zzso divergence in the entire zzso gene followed the common zzso it was low in the zzso high in the zzso and intermediate in the zzso zzso The degree of zzso divergence differed within these regions, suggesting that selection exerts constraints zzso on zzso change of the zzso zzso A zzso tree of the zzso zzso constructed from zzso variation of total sequence was consistent with those obtained from other zzso
