zzso is a zzso modification of proteins in which the zzso zzso becomes zzso bound to various zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This modification is important for the biological activity of several zzso especially the regulation of several zzso involved in various types of zzso zzso DNA zzso human zzso zzso has been previously zzso however, the zzso organization of zzso has not been zzso Attempts to amplify zzso fragments corresponding to zzso zzso sequence yielded only one zzso We have searched databases using both the zzso and sequence of one of the zzso sequence and this identified a human zzso clone sequence from zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso coding information on human zzso 17 resulted in the complete structural identity of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is composed of 11 zzso and 10 zzso with consensus zzso zzso Finally, we show that 140 zzso from the zzso end of recently reported full-length zzso of zzso was not part of this zzso region raising the possibility for zzso modification in generating larger transcripts likely by trans zzso Further, the availability of this zzso sequence will assist in unraveling the molecular basis for several observed zzso zzso
