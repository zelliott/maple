We analyzed the presence of zzso members at five zzso in the rice strains belonging to seven species with AA zzso in the zzso zzso by the methods including zzso chain reaction zzso Four zzso members zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present at the corresponding zzso in all the strains zzso One member zzso was, however, not present at the corresponding locus in most of the African strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but was in the other zzso The zzso fragments containing zzso in many strains were found to be larger due to zzso of either one of two zzso zzso named zzso and zzso within or near zzso zzso zzso is 157 zzso in length with terminal zzso repeat sequences of about 56 zzso zzso is only 13 zzso in length with a T stretch at its zzso zzso was not present in the corresponding locus in all the strains belonging to zzso zzso zzso and in some strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso was present only in the two strains of zzso zzso These results and previous ones obtained from the analysis of the other two zzso members zzso and zzso in the zzso gene indicate that the zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been inserted into the respective zzso during divergence of the rice species with AA zzso The patterns for the presence and absence of the zzso elements at the respective zzso enabled us to zzso the rice strains with AA zzso into ten groups and to zzso their zzso
