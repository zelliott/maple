zzso of the zzso components of anthrax toxin zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso cells depends on the ability of the activated protective zzso zzso component to form a channel zzso in the membrane of an zzso zzso zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso we characterized zzso truncated forms of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso 27 or 36 zzso strongly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso across the plasma membrane of zzso cells and zzso the zzso ability to block zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso at a small positive zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso to the N zzso of the truncated proteins restored both zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tags were accessible to zzso and zzso respectively, added to the trans compartment of a zzso zzso On the basis of these findings, we propose that the N zzso of zzso zzso or zzso factor enters the zzso under the influence of zzso pH and a positive zzso potential and zzso zzso in an zzso to zzso zzso
