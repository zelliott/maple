The zzso zzso channel from rod zzso is composed of two distinct zzso zzso and zzso The properties of the alpha zzso which can form functional channels by itself, are modified by zzso with a zzso zzso designated the beta zzso However, the alpha zzso from rod zzso zzso zzso with a 240 zzso protein that is significantly larger than this putative beta zzso We now demonstrate by zzso sequencing and by cloning and functional expression of zzso that the 240 zzso protein represents the complete beta zzso with an unusual zzso zzso The zzso part is essentially identical to a zzso zzso protein zzso whereas the zzso part is highly zzso to the previously cloned human zzso zzso zzso of the complete beta zzso in zzso zzso cells results in a zzso with the same apparent molecular weight as the 240 zzso protein of the native rod zzso zzso of the alpha zzso with the full-length beta zzso yields zzso channels with properties characteristic of the native zzso
