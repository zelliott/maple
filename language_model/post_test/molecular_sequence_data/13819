It is known that transfer of the zzso zzso gene into zzso cells from transgenic mice increases their sensitivity to drug and zzso zzso However, unlike many human tumors, these transgenic cells do not express zzso zzso and it is not known from these earlier studies whether zzso zzso dominates the effects of zzso zzso with respect to drug and radiation zzso We addressed this question in glioblastoma, a disease characterized by an unusually high level of intrinsic resistance to therapy and poor zzso mean survival time from diagnosis is only about 1 zzso We introduced the gene for zzso zzso into human zzso zzso cells, which express zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso had enhanced sensitivity to zzso and gamma radiation, compared with parental cells, control zzso cells, and zzso cells that had lost expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression after zzso gene transfer by a zzso zzso also zzso the cells to zzso and correlated with the induction of zzso The zzso effect was also observed in zzso zzso zzso small cell lung zzso cells, which express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer has dominant effects over zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells to therapy, which supports the potential of zzso gene therapy to enhance the efficacy of traditional zzso
