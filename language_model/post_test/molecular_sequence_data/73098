The zzso box genes that zzso regulatory proteins play important roles in both the formation of flower zzso and the determination of floral organ zzso We have characterized a zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso gene family from rice, designated zzso The zzso displays the structure of a typical plant zzso box zzso which consists of a zzso domain, K domain, a short I region between the zzso and K domain, and the zzso region downstream of the K zzso The gene was classified as a member of the zzso gene family from sequence zzso zzso The zzso protein is the most similar to zzso of rice zzso zzso In spatial and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was expressed zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso During flower development, the gene was more highly expressed in the early floral stage than in the zzso To study the functions of the zzso the zzso clone was expressed zzso using the zzso zzso promoter in a zzso tobacco plant zzso zzso plants of zzso exhibited the zzso of weak zzso and early zzso These results indicate that zzso is structurally related to the zzso family and may be involved in controlling flowering zzso
