The navel zzso zzso zzso Walker zzso zzso is the most serious insect zzso of almonds and pistachios in California for which environmentally friendly alternative methods of zzso zzso zzso highly zzso Some constituents of the sex zzso are unstable and could be replaced with zzso which may be designed on the basis of molecular interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

By analyzing extracts from zzso and zzso zzso we identified putative zzso zzso obtained their zzso zzso acid sequences by zzso degradation, and used zzso zzso to clone the corresponding zzso by SMART zzso Additionally, we used zzso zzso based on zzso sequences of known proteins to fish out other candidate zzso zzso We expressed the gene zzso a newly identified zzso zzso which was analyzed by circular zzso fluorescence, and nuclear magnetic zzso and used in a binding zzso to assess affinity to zzso zzso 

We have cloned nine zzso zzso zzso proteins from the navel zzso including two zzso zzso two general zzso zzso one zzso zzso one zzso zzso one zzso binding protein X, one sensory zzso membrane zzso and one zzso zzso Of these, zzso is highly enriched in male zzso zzso CD and zzso studies suggest a dramatic zzso zzso change, with high affinity to zzso constituents at neutral pH and no binding at low zzso
