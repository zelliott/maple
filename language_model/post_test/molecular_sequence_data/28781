The enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso is increasingly used as a reporter gene in viral zzso for a number of zzso To establish a system to study the activity of zzso cellular regulatory zzso we deleted the viral zzso in zzso zzso zzso and replaced it with cell zzso zzso In this study, we use this system to demonstrate the activity of the human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso enhancers in cell lines and in primary cells zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, we compare findings obtained with zzso as the reporter gene to those obtained replacing zzso with zzso an unstable zzso of zzso characterized by a much shorter zzso compared to zzso and by reduced zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were generated at zzso which were not different from those generated by the corresponding zzso carrying zzso Moreover, the activity of a zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso could be readily detected following zzso of target cells with either zzso or zzso zzso However, the activity of the relatively weak zzso and zzso enhancers was exclusively detected using zzso as the reporter zzso These findings indicate that zzso replacement is a feasible and promising approach to address the function of cell zzso regulatory elements in zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso
