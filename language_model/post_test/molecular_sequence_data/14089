A zzso zzso virus zzso was constructed by inserting cloned sequences from zzso zzso A avian zzso virus coding for the viral envelope zzso zzso into a zzso region of zzso DNA downstream from a synthetic zzso zzso from chickens zzso with the zzso zzso neutralized the zzso of the zzso zzso A virus zzso but only zzso neutralized the zzso of zzso zzso virus, another zzso A avian zzso zzso Similarly, vaccination of zzso zzso with this zzso zzso protected against infection with zzso virus but not against infection with another zzso A zzso virus zzso These results show that such a zzso zzso can be used to protect chickens against avian zzso virus and confirm previous observations that a zzso zzso zzso existed within the zzso A avian zzso virus zzso
