Many areas of biology and biotechnology have been revolutionized by the ability to label proteins genetically by fusion to the zzso green fluorescent protein zzso In previous zzso the zzso has been treated as an zzso entity, usually appended to the zzso or zzso zzso of the host zzso occasionally inserted within the host zzso The tightly zzso three-dimensional structure and intricate zzso zzso required for zzso formation would suggest that major zzso or insertions within zzso would prevent zzso However, we now show that several zzso of zzso in which the zzso and zzso portions are zzso and rejoined with a short zzso connecting the original zzso still become zzso These circular permutations have altered zzso values and zzso of the zzso with respect to a fusion zzso Furthermore, certain locations within zzso tolerate zzso of entire zzso and zzso changes in the insert can have profound effects on the zzso For example, insertions of zzso or a zinc finger domain in place of zzso of a yellow zzso zzso yellow fluorescent zzso of zzso result in indicator proteins whose zzso can be enhanced zzso upon metal zzso The zzso graft into enhanced yellow fluorescent protein can monitor zzso zzso in single zzso zzso The tolerance of zzso for circular permutations and insertions shows the folding process is surprisingly robust and offers a new strategy for creating genetically zzso zzso zzso
