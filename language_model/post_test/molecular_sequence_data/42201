Low affinity of zzso for altered zzso protein 2 zzso 2) of zzso zzso that are zzso resistant to zzso zzso has been zzso at least partly to the zzso of an additional zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to detect the presence or absence of this extra zzso zzso in 34 zzso producing zzso zzso with decreased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 strains sensitive to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso isolated in Greece and previously characterized by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was found in all zzso strains as well as in strains with intermediate resistance to zzso but was absent from all strains exhibiting an zzso of zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso No association of the zzso zzso to any particular zzso or zzso was zzso These results expand the previously reported correlation between the presence of the zzso zzso and reduced sensitivity to zzso and shows that this particular zzso is common among zzso distinct zzso zzso
