Nine zzso coli and 5 zzso zzso clinical zzso resistant to various zzso and zzso were identified in a Japanese general hospital between 1995 and zzso All nine zzso coli zzso and one zzso zzso isolate carried zzso while the other four zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gel zzso patterns of the nine zzso zzso coli zzso were almost zzso suggesting their zzso zzso while those of the five zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso profiles, Southern zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the genes for the zzso and the zzso zzso were located on very similar zzso plasmids in zzso coli and zzso zzso The genetic environment of zzso was identical to that of zzso A single zzso acid zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso region was observed between zzso and zzso This substitution was suggested to be responsible for the expansion of the zzso activity against several zzso zzso and this finding was consistent with the kinetic parameters determined with zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso genes found in the four zzso zzso zzso might have originated from zzso gene following a point zzso and dispersed among genetically different zzso zzso zzso via a large zzso zzso
