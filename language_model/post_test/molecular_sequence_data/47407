We have used quantitative zzso I and zzso radical zzso with three DNA fragments to examine the zzso recognition of DNA by five novel minor zzso zzso which contain a structural motif in which a zzso zzso ring is flanked by two zzso zzso zzso The compounds are all zzso and bind better to zzso than zzso zzso The zzso bind more tightly to zzso and zzso than zzso zzso and zzso and avoid sequences containing central zzso zzso Different side groups cause subtle changes to the sequence recognition properties of these zzso
