zzso and zzso are found on late zzso zzso particles containing the export zzso zzso zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zinc finger protein whose function in zzso zzso has not been previously zzso zzso and zzso localized predominately to the nucleus and zzso respectively, but could be zzso suggesting that they are zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a modest zzso of zzso zzso in the nucleus, suggesting that zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to cold sensitivity and zzso of zzso to the zzso where it remained bound to free zzso zzso However, deletion of zzso or the fusion of enhanced zzso zzso to zzso suppressed the cold sensitivity of an zzso zzso The presence of zzso on zzso or its neighboring protein zzso reduced the binding of zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso binds to zzso zzso in the vicinity of the exit zzso zzso in zzso that disrupted its binding to zzso also suppressed an zzso zzso and restored the normal nuclear zzso of zzso These results indicate that the cold sensitivity of zzso cells is due to the persistence of zzso on zzso zzso in the zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that zzso is needed for release of zzso from nascent zzso zzso after export to the zzso but not for the subsequent nuclear import of zzso
