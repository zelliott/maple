The zzso is the only known avian species with zzso zzso It is a primarily zzso zzso and has a distended crop and zzso zzso which has evolved for the microbial zzso of zzso zzso zzso samples collected from 10 individual animals from the zzso River area, zzso State, Venezuela were examined for the presence and density of zzso using zzso zzso gene clone libraries and real-time zzso prepared from pooled and individual zzso zzso A total of 197 clones were zzso revealing 24 different zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Of the 24 unique zzso 16 zzso of 197 zzso formed five unique zzso within the zzso zzso with the largest group of clones zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso The remaining eight zzso zzso zzso formed four unique zzso that had only zzso identity to zzso zzso Based upon zzso sequence identity, we identified 17 of the 24 zzso zzso from the zzso as possible new species and zzso with three zzso representing possible new zzso zzso sequence zzso Although none of the zzso zzso zzso had zzso sequence identity to any other zzso sequences in the zzso database, the zzso crop zzso sequences formed sister groups with known rumen zzso Mean population zzso zzso per gram wet zzso of zzso zzso rumen bacteria and zzso zzso estimated using real-time zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The crop microbial data presented here provide an excellent example of zzso evolution of zzso zzso in the zzso similar to that of zzso
