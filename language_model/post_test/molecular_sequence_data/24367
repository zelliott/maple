Several processes of plant development, such as zzso zzso release, fruit zzso and seed zzso require zzso or zzso to physically zzso or split zzso Due to the zzso of plant cells, these processes occur through coordinated mechanisms of cell separation that are not found in zzso zzso produces dry zzso fruits zzso making it a convenient system for the genetic study of cell separation associated with zzso 

We describe here a novel zzso in zzso called zzso zzso which prevents zzso of fruit by specifically blocking the separation of the valve cells from the zzso The zzso gene is shown to zzso a protein related to the zzso family of zzso factors and is expressed in the valve margins of the zzso which is the site of cell separation during zzso zzso studies using zzso indicates that zzso enables cell separation in zzso fruit zzso by promoting the differentiation of a strip of zzso zzso cells sandwiched between layers of zzso zzso zzso plants expressing zzso or zzso zzso are defective in zzso zzso 

Cell separation in fruit zzso requires a specialized cell layer which is zzso and capable of zzso specified by a zzso protein zzso by zzso These findings may have relevance to other processes requiring cell zzso as well as for the practical design of crops with reduced seed zzso
