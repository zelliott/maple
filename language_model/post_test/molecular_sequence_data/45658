zzso zzso and zzso channels elicit currents in opposing directions and thus have opposing effects on zzso zzso zzso in genes zzso zzso or zzso channels often interact zzso leading to either zzso suppression or enhancement for genes with opposing or similar effects on zzso zzso For example, the effects of zzso in Shaker zzso which encodes a zzso channel zzso are suppressed by zzso zzso in the zzso channel structural gene zzso but enhanced by zzso zzso in a second zzso channel zzso by zzso Here we identify two novel zzso that suppress the effects of a zzso zzso on behavior and zzso zzso We used zzso mapping to zzso both zzso to the zzso zzso and we used sequence analysis to determine that both zzso are caused by a single zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso Because these novel zzso zzso zzso opposite zzso to zzso zzso zzso we suggest that zzso causes an zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso substitution may cause zzso zzso or zzso opening of the zzso channels by favoring the zzso state of the zzso
