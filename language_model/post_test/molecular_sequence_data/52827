zzso of most insects consist of zzso zzso repeats, although the repeats are absent in zzso and some other insect species, where the zzso regions are perhaps maintained without zzso To understand various and unusual zzso formation in insects, we have studied the characteristic features of a putative insect zzso that has not been previously zzso Using a modified zzso repeat amplification protocol zzso we first detected the zzso activity in zzso cockroaches and two zzso zzso The zzso from zzso and cockroaches required zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso as a zzso and sequence analyses of the products of zzso revealed that the zzso repeats are zzso by zzso The zzso zzso was detected both in zzso zzso body, muscle and neural zzso and germ line zzso cells, suggesting that expression of this zzso is not regulated in a zzso manner at an adult zzso While we detected high levels of zzso activity in zzso and cockroaches, we could not detect activity in all zzso and cell cultures of the zzso zzso zzso and in two zzso and one zzso cell zzso This supports the theory that zzso insects maintain their zzso without zzso
