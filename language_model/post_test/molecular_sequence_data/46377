zzso B virus zzso and zzso delta virus zzso interplay was investigated by examining liver and serum samples from 21 zzso and 22 zzso patients with chronic liver zzso Different real-time zzso zzso were applied to evaluate zzso amounts of zzso DNA, zzso closed circular DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Besides zzso DNA and zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso in the zzso were also zzso zzso cases showed significantly lower median levels of serum zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than those of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso zzso amounts were significantly lower (both zzso zzso in zzso patients, whereas serum zzso zzso were comparable between the two patient zzso zzso zzso and zzso amounts per zzso zzso were higher in zzso patients zzso and 1 zzso respectively), showing that zzso replication was reduced, whereas synthesis of envelope proteins was not specifically zzso The ratios of zzso to zzso total zzso DNA showed a larger proportion of zzso molecules in zzso zzso For these patients, both zzso and serum zzso zzso amounts were associated with zzso but not with zzso or zzso DNA zzso Finally, zzso zzso with large deletions in the zzso core zzso region were detected in zzso zzso patients but in no zzso patients and were associated with lower zzso zzso These findings provide significant information about the interference exerted by zzso on zzso replication and zzso activities in the human zzso
