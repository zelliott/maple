In many applications, sets of similar texts or sequences are of high zzso zzso examples are revision histories of documents or zzso zzso Modern zzso sequencing technologies are able to generate DNA sequences at an ever-increasing zzso In parallel to the decreasing experimental time and cost necessary to produce DNA zzso zzso requirements for analysis and storage of the sequences are steeply zzso zzso is a key technology to deal with this zzso Recently, zzso zzso schemes, storing only the differences between a zzso input and a known reference zzso gained a lot of interest in this zzso In this paper, we propose a general zzso framework to compress large amounts of biological sequence data called zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Our basic zzso zzso is shown to be one to two orders of zzso faster than comparable related work, while achieving similar zzso zzso We also propose several techniques to further increase zzso ratios, while still retaining the advantage in zzso 1) selecting a good reference zzso and 2) rewriting a reference sequence to allow for better zzso In zzso propose a new way of further boosting the zzso ratios by applying zzso zzso to already zzso compressed files zzso zzso This technique allows for zzso ratios way beyond state of the art, for zzso and higher for human zzso We evaluate our zzso on a large data set from three different species (more than 1,000 zzso more than 3 zzso and on a collection of versions of Wikipedia zzso Our results show that real-time zzso of highly similar sequences at high zzso ratios is possible on modern zzso
