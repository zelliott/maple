Although recognized as a significant respiratory zzso there is a dearth of information on genetic diversity of human respiratory zzso virus zzso strains among children in zzso 

To study prevalence and zzso diversity of zzso strains among children zzso years of zzso with acute respiratory tract infection zzso at zzso zzso Roy Memorial Hospital for Children, zzso Eastern zzso 

During September 2005 to August 2008, zzso and/or throat zzso from children with zzso were screened for presence of zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of G gene of zzso strains were achieved with different primer pairs designed for amplification of zzso and/or zzso zzso regions zzso and zzso of zzso A and B zzso The zzso and zzso of G gene of 27 and 22 zzso B strains were zzso 

One hundred zzso seven of zzso clinical samples were positive for zzso Group B strains were detected at higher rates zzso against zzso zzso than A in zzso whereas in consecutive years, the rate of detection of group A were higher zzso against zzso zzso The group B strains were genetically related to globally spreading BA zzso exhibiting zzso nature of stop zzso six zzso deletions in zzso and formed single zzso clusters for both zzso and zzso 

The detection of significant high rates of group B strains in zzso followed by increase in prevalence of A strains in subsequent years highlight the dynamic nature of prevalence of zzso zzso among children with zzso in Eastern zzso
