The structural genes zzso zzso an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a strain capable of zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso zzso experiments uncovered the presence of an additional zzso 184 zzso downstream of zzso showing a high degree of sequence identity with a gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso in other zzso In addition, the zzso start point was identified zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso structural genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, Northern zzso clearly showed that zzso are transcribed under nitrogen fixing conditions, but not in the presence of combined zzso A putative zzso binding site was identified in the promoter region upstream of zzso zzso at zzso zzso with respect to the zzso start zzso zzso zzso of a zzso DNA zzso zzso the putative zzso zzso was significantly affected by an zzso coli zzso extract containing zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the zzso regulation of zzso
