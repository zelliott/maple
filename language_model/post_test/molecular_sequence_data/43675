zzso of zzso protein zzso from the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is induced by the zzso zzso zzso Genes required for zzso production, zzso and zzso lie 3-5 zzso upstream, but can function at much greater zzso The zzso transcripts zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso at the extreme zzso zzso Neither production of this zzso nor translation of the zzso end of zzso transcripts was found to be necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to activate zzso zzso even in the absence of zzso production, and does not affect initiation of zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein that appears to be required for translation of zzso and a zzso zzso at the 3' end of zzso may be required for zzso of zzso to zzso from the zzso zzso Although the entire positive control region is transcribed zzso from the zzso promoter, translation of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso occur only after induction with zzso The combined data are consistent with a model in which the positive regulatory molecules and zzso zzso activate zzso expression zzso
