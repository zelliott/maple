zzso a zzso composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the primary zzso zzso found in muscle and peripheral nerve and is essential for the development and stability of basement zzso in these zzso zzso of a domain zzso zzso zzso results in muscle zzso and peripheral nerve zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We have expressed zzso zzso VI through zzso of the zzso zzso as well as its zzso zzso counterpart, to identify candidate zzso functions of this critical zzso Using zzso zzso recognition sites for the zzso and zzso zzso were identified in the short arms of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparisons with a zzso zzso short arm protein possessing zzso domain VI further localized these activities to zzso domain zzso In addition, we found that the zzso zzso short arm supported zzso outgrowth independent of other zzso zzso A zzso zzso binding activity was also localized to this region of the zzso zzso zzso These data provide the first evidence that domain VI of the zzso zzso mediates interactions with cell surface receptors and suggest that these zzso and zzso binding sites, alone or in concert, may play an important role in muscle and peripheral nerve zzso
