To identify a protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso we examined zzso zzso for the presence of the highly zzso zzso zzso at position 73 by zzso acid analysis of the whole protein and by zzso acid analysis and mass zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that zzso is not zzso A similar lack of modification was also found in zzso from the zzso zzso zzso while rabbit muscle zzso revealed the expected zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences suggests that this modification was introduced in evolution after the divergence of zzso from higher zzso organisms, including zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso contain zzso Our methodology for the zzso determination of zzso in zzso offers an improved approach for investigating zzso zzso in zzso
