A zzso library cloned in zzso zzso 11 expression zzso was screened with specific zzso inhibitor zzso heavy zzso chain zzso Among seven positive clones selected, two overlapping clones were zzso The corresponding consensus sequence encompasses a stretch of bases with one single open reading frame, and the deduced zzso sequence displays no zzso with the full length zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the corresponding zzso from clone zzso zzso revealed an zzso zzso of Mr zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a single population of zzso of zzso zzso These data provide new evidence for the presence of distinct H and L chains in the 180 zzso zzso zzso
