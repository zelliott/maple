zzso interactions can be modulated by the zzso of zzso zzso As a means of testing this, we recently described a conditional zzso system, based on the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have used this conditional zzso system to explore the effect of zzso zzso in modulating zzso interactions in a subset of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso hub protein zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were first validated in the absence of zzso The major zzso zzso zzso zzso was subsequently included in the conditional zzso zzso initially to determine the degree of zzso that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed as zzso zzso with five and two novel zzso zzso sites mapped by zzso zzso on these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso previously predicted but not confirmed as zzso of zzso were also found to be zzso with five and seven sites mapped zzso zzso was found to be a novel zzso of zzso with two sites zzso Finally, we investigated the interactions of zzso with the five interaction partners in the presence of active zzso and in the presence of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso We found that the interaction between zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso were significantly increased in the presence of active zzso the interaction of zzso and zzso showed a similar degree of increase in interaction but this was not statistically zzso The interactions of zzso and zzso along with zzso and zzso were not significantly increased or decreased by zzso We conclude that zzso may be a widespread means by which the interactions of proteins are zzso
