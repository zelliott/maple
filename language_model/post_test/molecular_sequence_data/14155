zzso zzso are routinely used in the laboratory diagnosis of human zzso virus zzso zzso infection, but the zzso chain reaction zzso is ultimately the most sensitive and direct method for establishing definitive zzso As an alternative to the conventional radioactive zzso procedure we have developed and evaluated a pair of rapid zzso flow zzso detection zzso Using zzso zzso we directly incorporated zzso zzso or zzso zzso into the zzso The labeled zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and sense zzso followed by capture of the hybrid DNA using zzso beads which were finally analyzed in a flow zzso by 1) direct detection of the zzso intensity of the zzso incorporating zzso and 2) zzso of the zzso incorporating zzso by zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso were functionally comparable with zzso probe in reliably detecting as low as five copies of zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso of zzso consistently yielded higher mean channel zzso and gave a stable signal over an extended period of zzso zzso In testing a panel of 20 pedigreed zzso specimens from blood donors with or without zzso infection, the results of both flow zzso zzso were identical with those of the conventional radioactive zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso incorporation in zzso zzso with a pair of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of hybrids by flow zzso analyses is the zzso method of choice for zzso of zzso zzso
