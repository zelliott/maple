U2 zzso is an essential component of the zzso apparatus in zzso zzso Three possible secondary structures for the highly zzso zzso half of U2 zzso are consistent with U2 zzso sequence zzso To distinguish among these models and to test the function of U2 structural zzso we made greater than 35 zzso in the zzso U2 zzso zzso Some of the zzso were designed in pairs so that combinations could be made that would restore zzso to differentiate zzso requirements from primary sequence zzso The zzso identify an essential zzso structure adjacent to the zzso interaction zzso A zzso zzso to the loop just upstream of the zzso site and an additional zzso zzso are zzso for U2 function, even in the background of a previously identified large internal zzso zzso base zzso at the zzso base pair in the essential stem lead to a variety of temperature and zzso zzso as well as an zzso of zzso precursors in zzso Chemical structure probing of U2 zzso in zzso reveals that the bulk of U2 in a zzso cell adopts a structure in good agreement with that deduced from genetic zzso We suggest that this zzso is not a binding site for an intrinsic U2 zzso protein but may interact with other factors during zzso assembly or zzso
