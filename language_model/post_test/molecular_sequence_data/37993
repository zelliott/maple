zzso relationships between 35 clinical zzso of zzso A9 zzso collected during the last five decades from different geographical regions, were investigated by partial zzso Analysis of a 150 zzso sequence at the zzso junction region identified 12 zzso zzso While most of the strains within each zzso showed geographical zzso the analysis also provided evidence for long-range zzso of virus zzso zzso analysis of a longer region around the zzso junction zzso 390 zzso revealed that the designated zzso actually represented zzso zzso The zzso grouping pattern of the zzso in the analysis of the zzso region was similar to that obtained in the zzso region whereas analysis of the zzso region indicated a zzso different zzso which suggests that zzso events may occur in the region zzso the zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in the interaction of the virus with zzso was fully zzso among the zzso
