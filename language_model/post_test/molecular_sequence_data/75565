The zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso from zzso coli was characterized and shown to cause the following zzso 1) zzso zzso was markedly impaired in zzso 2) zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities were decreased zzso 3) zzso were zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso it appeared that integration between F1 and zzso was zzso This was confirmed directly by the demonstration that the zzso F1 bound poorly to stripped zzso from a normal zzso zzso soluble zzso F1 had normal zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso which is strongly zzso in zzso of zzso lies in a region of the zzso important for membrane zzso Thus, three regions of the zzso have now been zzso specialized for membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal transmission, zzso The approximate locations of the three regions are zzso
