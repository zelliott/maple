zzso from zzso has been known since 1925 to contain strong zzso zzso However, attempts to purify and identify the zzso were not successful, mainly because of the lack of zzso of the zzso Here, we describe the characterization of zzso activity of the latex of zzso zzso and the identification of a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was enriched zzso from crude latex of zzso zzso to a specific activity zzso of 57 zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso The extract was also active on zzso zzso zzso 655 zzso ), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH ranged from zzso to zzso The protein content of the zzso fraction of latex was analyzed by zzso followed by mass zzso and 28 different proteins were zzso The protein fraction was incubated with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and a 45 zzso protein zzso by the inhibitor was identified as being a putative zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso a 55 zzso protein was further zzso and its deduced sequence had zzso similarity with peptides from the 45 zzso zzso with a coverage of zzso The protein zzso by this zzso had zzso sequence identity and 51% similarity to zzso bean acid zzso suggesting that it is the zzso responsible for the important zzso activities detected in zzso zzso
