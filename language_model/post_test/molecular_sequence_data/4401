During a search for genes zzso electron transport proteins from a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene bank, a zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso increased sensitivity to the zzso agent zzso upon an zzso coli zzso was isolated and cloned in zzso zzso The zzso had an identical restriction zzso map to a zzso which has been found in zzso zzso strains isolated from many different parts of the zzso The zzso was present at between two and four copies per zzso and contained a region of approximately 5-6 zzso which was also found on the zzso This region was zzso and found to have four complete zzso which when translated had high percentage zzso acid similarity to zzso zzso proteins of the zzso regulator family, zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso of a methane zzso In zzso protein analysis using an zzso zzso zzso system indicated that three of the four products zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso are zzso proteins and it is likely that the proteins on zzso represent an electron transport system of as yet unknown zzso Surprisingly, although genes for zzso proteins have been isolated from other bacteria by screening gene banks for increased sensitivity to zzso the region of zzso containing the genes for these proteins was not responsible for the increase in zzso sensitivity zzso by the zzso The region of zzso which did zzso increased zzso sensitivity to an zzso coli zzso zzso was a 319 zzso region of DNA close to the origin of zzso zzso This region contained no zzso and was identical to that previously reported for the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
