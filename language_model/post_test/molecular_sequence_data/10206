zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site inserted between the two zzso of zzso fusion proteins has been used at both the zzso and the zzso scale to obtain the mature zzso In this study a model protein containing a fusion precursor of zzso growth factor I was used to investigate the influence of the operating conditions on the zzso reaction and the formation of zzso side products such as zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the stability of the zzso site toward zzso was examined and a zzso study performed to define the effect of the reaction conditions on the zzso yield and on the formation of side zzso
