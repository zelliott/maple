The reaction mechanism of zzso zzso zzso is believed to be similar to that of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to form an zzso zzso intermediate as the first step of their reaction zzso However, the second zzso step in the zzso reaction zzso is characterized by the elimination of zzso and collapse of the zzso to form zzso instead of zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso and zzso amounts of zzso in the space group zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso This structure shows that the zzso is a zzso composed of interacting zzso zzso zzso rather than the hallmark zzso barrel structure of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in each of the three zzso in the zzso unit bind to a zzso zzso that is present in the zzso zzso zzso in the three zzso in the zzso unit are localized at the mouth of the active site and can be ascribed to the presence or absence of a bound zzso zzso 

In agreement with zzso zzso and zzso zzso the structure suggests that zzso acts as the zzso zzso Further, zzso and zzso are involved in zzso salt zzso These salt bridges may provide a zzso for zzso zzso zzso
