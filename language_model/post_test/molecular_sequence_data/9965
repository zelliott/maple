zzso G zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso lineage found in the zzso of zzso that has been suggested to play a role in zzso DNA zzso zzso We have isolated and zzso the entire mouse zzso G zzso determined the limits of the zzso and mapped the promoter zzso The coding sequence of the single copy gene is interrupted by two zzso and analysis of the transcripts does not support a model by which more than one zzso G zzso could be produced by alternative zzso We have also characterized a full-length human zzso G zzso and comparison at the protein level of the human, zzso and zzso zzso indicates a high degree of conservation except in the respective zzso targeting zzso zzso G is zzso expressed and the zzso levels of its zzso vary by a factor greater than seven between different zzso The relationship between the zzso copy number and zzso G zzso levels is not strictly zzso but zzso richer in zzso have higher amounts of the zzso and vice zzso
