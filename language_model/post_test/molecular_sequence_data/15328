zzso not only exhibits complex zzso differentiation but also produces a plethora of secondary zzso particularly zzso To improve our general understanding of the complex network of zzso zzso zzso regulation, we used an in zzso zzso system to identify novel regulators that influence Red production in zzso zzso zzso Using this screening system, we obtained 25 zzso zzso zzso of these zzso had a zzso inserted in the previously described Red zzso gene cluster and produced different amounts of another secondary zzso zzso zzso One zzso was shown to have an zzso in a different region of the zzso upstream of the previously zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso which encodes a putative zzso family zzso zzso Compared with zzso strain zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased Red production and decreased Act zzso A high level of zzso expression resulted in a severe reduction in Red production and Act zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso regulated Red production by controlling zzso zzso zzso while no change was observed at the transcript level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects on Act zzso might arise from competition for precursors that are common to both zzso
