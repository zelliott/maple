zzso zzso zzso from the tropical rubber tree zzso zzso is a 29 zzso single chain protein that zzso the breakdown or formation of a zzso bond by zzso addition of zzso acid to zzso or zzso The primary sequence of zzso has no significant zzso to known zzso zzso zzso investigations employing zzso and secondary structure prediction zzso suggest that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso fold protein family and contains a zzso zzso as functional zzso for zzso The significance of predicted zzso zzso was tested and confirmed by zzso zzso and expression of zzso and zzso proteins in the zzso zzso zzso Based on these data we suggest a zzso model for the zzso synthesis zzso by zzso zzso from zzso zzso
