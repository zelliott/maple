Various strategies for local zzso performed by using zzso and zzso are zzso In experimental mice models, the zzso reaction zzso through the injection of little amounts of zzso and zzso at the tumor growth site is significantly enhanced by the zzso of zzso from tumor bearing mice artificially zzso to challenging tumor zzso These zzso act as zzso or helper cells that elicit both a local and a systemic long lasting immune reaction by the release of additional zzso The reaction activated mostly involves draining zzso zzso where multiple reaction mechanisms are zzso The local injection of cocktails of zzso defined zzso can also mimic the helper action of zzso and trigger a similarly effective zzso zzso A set of pilot clinical trials with zzso or zzso injected zzso were initiated in patients with advanced primary or zzso localized tumors of the head and neck and the zzso This treatment appears to elicit a local reaction by zzso a few pathways of patients zzso whose efficiency may well be high, as shown by the tumor zzso often zzso
