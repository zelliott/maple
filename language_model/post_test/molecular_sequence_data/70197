A specific complex of zzso and zzso interacts with responsive genes in target zzso of developing zzso and controls its zzso In order to examine zzso changes in zzso zzso gene expression during embryonic zzso formation, variations in transcript levels have been determined using a simple zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as the primer for reverse transcription, and the amount of zzso product for zzso zzso was zzso against those for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that either zzso or zzso were suitable internal standards, and that the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso a significant decrease of zzso at the zzso stage of embryonic mouse zzso shelf zzso zzso of the zzso demonstrated a significant change in the distribution pattern of zzso zzso during the zzso stage of secondary zzso zzso Our present data suggest that zzso variations in zzso zzso level control zzso events of secondary zzso zzso
