Surface proteins of zzso zzso are anchored to the cell wall zzso by a mechanism requiring a zzso sorting signal with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso group of zzso is subsequently zzso to the zzso group of zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso revealed the close proximity of the zzso site zzso zzso 184 with zzso zzso however, no structural evidence for a zzso zzso pair could be zzso We report that zzso substitution of either zzso 184 or zzso 120 zzso in zzso and in zzso sorting zzso Further, zzso substitution of zzso zzso a zzso that is in close proximity of zzso zzso reduces the zzso activity of zzso These results suggest a model zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso pair for the zzso of its zzso reaction and that the position of zzso zzso assists in the formation of this zzso zzso
