zzso zzso the first zzso approved fusion inhibitor for zzso displayed outstanding effects of fusion zzso by binding to the envelope zzso zzso But with the continuous emergence of zzso zzso the exploration of zzso binding mechanism onto zzso wild type zzso and the related resistance mechanism is zzso In this work, a complete structure model of zzso including the fusion zzso zzso and zzso in complex with three molecules of zzso was obtained by structural modeling and molecular dynamics simulation zzso In this zzso model, the zzso zzso zzso composed of the zzso sequence zzso formed zzso zzso instead of a zzso structure, which enabled more zzso of zzso to contact zzso to exert its zzso zzso Essential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso formed strong zzso interactions with some zzso cavities on the zzso as never seen in other zzso zzso core zzso Based on the zzso model, seven corresponding structure models of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed and fully zzso by zzso Most zzso the zzso and zzso zzso led to collapse of the coiled zzso structure, causing greatest change in binding zzso Also notably, the zzso and zzso zzso hindered the binding of zzso through zzso zzso and thus also resulted in dramatic change in binding zzso Besides, zzso zzso zzso and zzso only caused minor zzso and energetic zzso In all, these results could provide new clues for the design of zzso zzso zzso to target the zzso zzso
