zzso for the transformation of zzso zzso have been developed recently and hold much promise for the characterization of these organisms at the molecular zzso In order to understand zzso organization and gene regulation in zzso we have begun the characterization of genes involved in zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso These studies are facilitated by the many zzso zzso of zzso zzso that have been zzso In this project we demonstrate that zzso DNA prepared from zzso coli can be used to transform an zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A set of zzso clones covering most of the zzso of zzso zzso was used to isolate the gene which is defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso region responsible for zzso DNA sequence analysis of this region revealed an open reading frame zzso a putative protein zzso zzso acids in zzso A search of the DNA and protein data bases revealed that this open reading frame encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso the sequence of which is also known for zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
