Previous studies have shown that a zzso zzso analogue of the zzso zzso from link protein can function as a growth factor and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultures of normal human zzso cartilage from a wide age range of subjects zzso et zzso Arthritis zzso 41 zzso zzso The present work further shows that link zzso increased zzso synthesis by cartilage cultured in both the presence and absence of serum, suggesting that the mechanism of zzso may be different from that of zzso growth zzso The zzso zzso during stimulation with link zzso were of normal zzso size and the ratio of core protein to zzso side chains and the proportions of the large zzso zzso to the small zzso zzso and zzso remained zzso zzso molecules were equally capable of forming zzso as those from control zzso and the relative proportions of zzso and zzso were unchanged showing that both were zzso zzso These results confirmed that this novel zzso is a potent zzso of zzso synthesis by zzso cartilage and showed that the newly zzso zzso were of normal zzso
