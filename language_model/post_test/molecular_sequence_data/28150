The zzso gene of zzso coli which encodes an zzso zzso contains a putative zzso site in its upstream zzso region, and its expression has been investigated using an zzso zzso zzso of the fusion was found to be reduced during zzso growth, and experiments with hosts containing an zzso zzso and/or a zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso repression of the zzso gene is zzso by the zzso zzso Thus zzso can function as an zzso zzso as well as an zzso zzso zzso The results are consistent with the zzso function attributed to the proposed consensus zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso exhibiting positive and negative regulation by zzso it was further shown that the depletion of metal zzso in growth media with zzso agents mimics oxygen with respect to the activity of zzso zzso roles for metal zzso in the zzso zzso associated with zzso function are zzso
