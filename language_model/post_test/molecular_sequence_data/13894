In the preceding study zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we suggested that a zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso is involved in the zzso zzso In this work, we have isolated the zzso clone coding the zzso protein in an effort to investigate its structure and zzso The zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso were zzso according to the zzso acid sequences of zzso of the native protein and zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso with these three zzso was isolated from the zzso library derived from the zzso zzso corpus zzso It encodes a novel protein with zzso zzso acid zzso in an open reading zzso Its overall zzso acid sequence was significantly zzso zzso to the zzso precursor of zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein could digest both zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting that it is an zzso zzso The expression of this protein was specific to zzso and was localized to the very narrow parts of zzso the border of the zzso and corpus zzso This protein may serve as a good marker for the functional differentiation in zzso zzso A possible role of this protein in the zzso zzso interaction is zzso
