The zzso zzso has been implicated in many different pathways ranging from membrane fusion to zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso complex directs zzso to act in the zzso fusion of zzso zzso We now describe another binding complex zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso protein degradation whereas zzso zzso has been implicated in nuclear zzso In rat liver zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso complex, which exists either alone or bound to zzso zzso competes with zzso for binding to zzso and so zzso zzso membrane zzso This suggests that it is involved in another cellular function zzso by zzso the most likely being zzso events during zzso The fact that the binding of zzso and zzso is mutually exclusive suggests that these protein complexes act as zzso directing a basic zzso activity into different cellular zzso
