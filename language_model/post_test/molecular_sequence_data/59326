zzso zzso channels are complexes of zzso zzso alpha and zzso ancillary zzso zzso The primary zzso effect of zzso of alpha and beta zzso is to increase the intrinsic rate of zzso of the alpha zzso For one beta zzso zzso beta zzso zzso is enhanced through an zzso zzso A second beta zzso zzso beta zzso has been shown to increase zzso but through a distinct zzso Here we show that the degree of enhancement of zzso beta zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso acid composition in the pore mouth of the alpha zzso and the concentration of zzso zzso Experimental conditions that promote zzso zzso also enhance the stimulation of zzso by zzso beta zzso showing that this beta zzso directly stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso containing just the zzso zzso region of zzso beta zzso fused with an alpha zzso behave in a similar fashion to zzso zzso beta zzso and alpha zzso This shows that it is the zzso domain of zzso beta zzso that mediates the increase in zzso zzso from the zzso side of the zzso We propose a model zzso the N zzso of zzso beta zzso acts as a zzso binding zzso domain that associates with the zzso zzso of the alpha zzso to effect a zzso change leading to enhancement of zzso zzso
