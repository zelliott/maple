The zzso and zzso nitrogen zzso gene products are required for the full zzso of both the zzso and zzso of zzso from zzso zzso Because the two zzso component proteins both require the assembly of zzso clusters for their zzso it has been suggested that zzso and zzso could have complementary functions in the zzso of sulfur and iron necessary for zzso zzso cluster zzso The zzso protein has been shown to have zzso zzso activity and can be used to supply zzso for the in zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso The zzso protein was previously zzso and shown to be a zzso with a zzso cluster in each zzso In the present work, primary sequence zzso zzso acid substitution experiments, and optical and resonance zzso zzso characterization of zzso produced zzso and zzso fragments are used to show that zzso has a modular zzso One module is contained in approximately the zzso third of zzso and is shown to provide a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are necessary for binding iron in the zzso mode and visible extinction zzso indicate that up to one zzso zzso can be bound per zzso zzso The second module is contained in approximately the zzso half of zzso and provides the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso provide zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso involved in zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso site and those that provide the zzso cluster zzso are all required for the full zzso function of zzso The only two other zzso contained within zzso zzso and zzso are not necessary for iron binding at either site, nor are they required for the full zzso function of zzso The results provide the basis for a model where iron bound in zzso zzso sites within zzso is used for zzso cluster zzso The zzso clusters contained within zzso are proposed to have a zzso function involving the release of zzso from zzso and/or the release of zzso or an zzso cluster precursor from the zzso binding zzso
