To examine the unique zzso repertoire in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, we zzso the zzso zzso region of zzso chain in zzso of young (1 month old) and aged (6 month old) zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso from zzso was used for zzso synthesis and zzso zzso products were cloned and zzso Young zzso mice showed high frequency zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso at position zzso in zzso chain compared to that zzso in young zzso zzso Aged zzso mice and zzso mice showed increase of frequency zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso These results indicate that zzso cells that have zzso zzso at zzso in zzso region of zzso chain increase with age in normal zzso zzso prone mice show high frequency of zzso zzso at zzso in zzso chain even at the age of 1 zzso These T cells may interact with zzso zzso and might contribute to the onset and/or the progression of systemic zzso in concert with other genetic elements in zzso zzso
