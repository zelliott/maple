To understand the mechanisms that control the differentiation of zzso zzso precursors into zzso stem cells zzso and the zzso of zzso we conducted a study to identify genes expressed at the earliest stages of both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Our strategy was to zzso zzso Display by means of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to compare patterns of gene expression between zzso populations representing different levels of zzso activity obtained from the mouse zzso zzso bodies zzso and mouse cell zzso We report the molecular cloning of two groups of genes expressed in the zzso zzso a group of genes expressed in the zzso zzso zzso at higher levels than in the zzso zzso proper and zzso during zzso development, and another group of zzso zzso zzso genes not expressed in the zzso zzso proper or in zzso Specifically, we describe the molecular cloning of the first zzso zzso gene to be found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso gene has the unique property of zzso both zzso zzso and zzso protein forms, revealing novel aspects of zzso metabolism that may be relevant during zzso zzso
