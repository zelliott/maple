Three main patterns of response are seen when zzso zzso is used for the treatment of chronic zzso zzso 1 sustained response with zzso zzso zzso that is maintained after zzso of therapy, with or without clearance of serum zzso C virus zzso zzso 2 transient response with zzso zzso during therapy followed by zzso after its withdrawal, and 3 no response with no or only partial reduction in zzso zzso In order to define variables that could predict each of these three types of response we studied 321 cases of chronic zzso C treated with zzso in two consecutive trials conducted in our zzso By zzso analysis, age zzso 45 years zzso zzso zzso known disease duration zzso 60 months zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and infection by zzso zzso 2 or zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso were found to be statistically associated with sustained response while age zzso 45 years zzso zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and elevated gamma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso were associated with no zzso By zzso analysis sustained response was predicted by zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso known disease duration zzso zzso zzso patient's age zzso zzso zzso and associated with the use of a more aggressive treatment schedule zzso zzso zzso zzso response with zzso was predicted by known duration of disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and female sex zzso zzso zzso No response was statistically associated with elevated gamma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso higher body weight zzso zzso zzso and with the less aggressive regimen of 3 zzso of natural zzso given three times weekly for 6 months zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso as well as the schedule of treatment greatly affect the pattern of response to zzso in chronic zzso C and allow us to define criteria to predict which type of response is more likely in individual zzso
