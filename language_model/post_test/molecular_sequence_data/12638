This work investigates the effect on zzso of zzso writhe located in the region immediately upstream of the zzso consensus sequence of zzso coli zzso A set of zzso zzso each with an unique DNA zzso were zzso zzso and zzso into an area of naturally occurring right-handed zzso zzso immediately upstream of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso All the zzso showed reduced promoter activities in zzso coli zzso However, rightward zzso writhe clearly facilitated zzso when compared with the effect produced by a straight DNA zzso zzso writhe greatly zzso zzso A plane curve showed an intermediate zzso This phenomenon was due not only to the difference in the ability of the segment to drive an open complex formation, but also to the difference in the binding affinity of zzso zzso to the zzso The positive effect of rightward writhe was also observed in zzso for the promoter of the zzso resistance gene of zzso The sense and extent of zzso writhe of a DNA zzso seem to determine its influence on promoter zzso
