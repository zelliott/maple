zzso zzso zzso is the zzso catalyzing the formation of zzso from zzso zzso activity is expressed specifically in mast zzso zzso cells in stomach, and zzso zzso in zzso As a first step in the analysis of the regulation of zzso gene zzso we have cloned the zzso coding for zzso from a zzso library of a human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso We identified two types of zzso zzso representing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in these zzso zzso analysis of these zzso revealed that the zzso zzso contains the insert sequence of zzso bases and suggests that both zzso and zzso zzso may represent the alternatively spliced transcripts of the zzso zzso Using expression plasmids containing a zzso for each zzso zzso we analyzed the function of possible zzso zzso We show that only the zzso zzso encodes functional zzso and is expressed in human brain and zzso However, we were unable to detect the zzso zzso in these zzso Thus, the zzso zzso may be generated by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated the increase in the level of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso cells following treatment with zzso zzso zzso
