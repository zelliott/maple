This paper presents evidence that a member of the zzso family of zzso cell zzso molecules is a zzso for protein zzso zzso and zzso identifies the highly zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain as the principal site of zzso and demonstrates that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells is subject to zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso or zzso of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso Furthermore, both zzso and the related zzso zzso are zzso zzso in a zzso regulated pattern in rat zzso The zzso sequence is present in the zzso zzso of all members of the zzso family of neural cell zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso recovery after zzso demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso also increases lateral mobility of zzso expressed in zzso cells to the same extent as removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, appears to regulate the dynamic behavior of zzso and is the target for regulation by zzso zzso in response to external zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso at the zzso site represents a highly zzso zzso used by the entire class of zzso cell zzso zzso for regulation of zzso connections to the zzso zzso
