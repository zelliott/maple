When the precursor to zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a rabbit zzso zzso translation system zzso its properties are quite unlike those of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that molecular zzso present in zzso zzso the folding of zzso To investigate the structural basis for this, we have used zzso resistance to monitor the extent of folding for several related zzso after synthesis in zzso and in wheat germ extract zzso In addition to zzso the following proteins were zzso the mature form of zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso counterpart zzso a zzso protein consisting of the zzso of zzso attached to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in which the zzso and the zzso domain of the mature zzso are deleted zzso zzso zzso In zzso delta zzso zzso folds somewhat faster than intact zzso whereas the truncated delta zzso zzso is unable to zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso both fold with extreme zzso After synthesis in zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso never acquire a zzso zzso whereas the folding of zzso and zzso still occurs zzso We conclude that the zzso has only a minor role in determining the folding rate of the zzso zzso precursor protein in zzso or zzso and has no influence on the folding of the zzso zzso Rather, the primary sequence of the mature part of the protein seems to dictate whether or how molecular zzso regulate folding zzso
