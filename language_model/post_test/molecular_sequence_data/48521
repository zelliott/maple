zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso perform multiple functions, such as maintaining zzso of essential metals, zzso of toxic metals and scavenging of zzso In this study, the promoter region of a zzso zzso gene from Bay zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso was cloned by the technique of zzso DNA walking, and the zzso in this region were screened to find their association with zzso or tolerance to high temperature zzso One zzso zzso zzso and zzso single zzso zzso zzso were identified in the amplified promoter zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were selected to analyze their distribution in the two Bay zzso populations collected from southern and northern China coast, which were identified as heat resistant and heat susceptible stocks, zzso There were three zzso zzso zzso and zzso at locus zzso and their zzso were zzso zzso and zzso in the heat susceptible stock, while zzso zzso and zzso in the resistant stock, zzso There was no significant difference in the frequency distribution of different zzso between the two stocks zzso In contrast, at locus zzso three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were revealed with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the heat susceptible stock, while zzso zzso and zzso in the heat resistant stock, zzso The frequency of zzso zzso in the heat susceptible stock was significantly higher zzso than that in the heat resistant stock, while the frequency of zzso in the heat resistant stock was significantly higher zzso than that in the heat susceptible zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso zzso in scallops with zzso zzso was significantly higher than that with zzso zzso zzso after an acute heat treatment at zzso for zzso These results implied that the zzso at locus zzso of zzso was associated with the zzso of scallops to heat stress, and the zzso zzso zzso could be a potential marker available in future selection of Bay zzso with heat zzso
