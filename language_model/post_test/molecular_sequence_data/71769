zzso of ammonium zzso to zzso cells growing on zzso as the sole nitrogen source zzso zzso of the general zzso acid zzso zzso and its subsequent degradation in the zzso An essential step in this zzso is zzso zzso through a process requiring the zzso zzso zzso We show in this report that zzso a second gene required for zzso zzso of zzso codes for the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is strongly reduced in zzso zzso The zzso zzso results in substitution of an aromatic zzso acid located in a zzso sequence shared by some zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In this zzso as in zzso cells, the amount of free zzso zzso is at least four times lower than in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso of the zzso can be restored in zzso cells by zzso of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso at two zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso triggers rapid zzso of zzso the zzso chains being specifically formed by linkage through the zzso 63 zzso of zzso zzso is thus zzso differently from the proteins targeted by zzso for zzso by the zzso but in the same manner as the zzso zzso also subject to zzso zzso When zzso through zzso is zzso the zzso zzso still zzso zzso zzso but to a lesser zzso
