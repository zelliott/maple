Aedes aegypti is a major zzso of zzso viruses such as yellow fever virus and dengue zzso Efforts to discern the function of genes involved in important zzso such as zzso competence and host seeking through reverse zzso would greatly benefit from the ability to generate targeted gene zzso zzso zzso are selfish elements which catalyze zzso DNA zzso breaks in a zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all able to induce zzso breaks in adult female zzso aegypti zzso as well as catalyze the zzso zzso of a zzso These experiments provide evidence that zzso zzso can be used to manipulate the zzso of this important disease zzso
