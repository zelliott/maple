zzso are a diverse family of zzso with an zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso are restricted to Madagascar and one zzso the otter zzso zzso occurs on the zzso zzso studies have generated conflicting hypotheses according to which both zzso and zzso zzso are either zzso or zzso Competing hypotheses have different implications for the zzso history of zzso At present, there are no molecular studies that address these zzso The present study provides sequences of a nuclear zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes from a zzso zzso New sequences of these genes are also reported for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences from these zzso were combined with data already available for this locus from two other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses provided strong zzso support for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The majority of statistical tests rejected zzso claims for both a zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso clock estimates suggest a split of otter zzso and zzso zzso at approximately 53 zzso We estimate that the zzso of zzso zzso dispersed to Madagascar subsequent to this split but prior to about 37 zzso
