zzso zzso zzso are members of the zzso copper zzso zzso and are composed of four zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso center where oxygen is reduced, while zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso thought to channel electrons from the donor zzso into the zzso zzso Like many other bacterial members of this zzso the zzso zzso zzso contains a fourth, zzso zzso which is termed zzso In the present study, we analyzed the role of zzso on the stability and activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data showed that zzso is a zzso membrane protein with a zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso activity is significantly reduced, irrespective of the growth zzso Blue native zzso gel zzso analyses revealed that the lack of zzso specifically impaired the stable recruitment of zzso into the zzso zzso zzso This suggested a specific zzso interaction, which was confirmed by chemical zzso zzso our data demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso was required for optimal zzso zzso activity because it stabilized the interaction of zzso with the zzso core complex, leading subsequently to the formation of the active zzso zzso zzso zzso
