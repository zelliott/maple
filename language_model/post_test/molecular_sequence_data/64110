zzso in zzso and zzso cause the same zzso in zzso zzso feeding behavior: the zzso is unable to pump rapidly in the presence of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that functions in the zzso zzso It is localized to the zzso between zzso muscle and the main zzso zzso motor zzso zzso and it is required for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso encodes a small protein that has no zzso to previously characterized zzso It has a single zzso domain and a short zzso zzso zzso genetic interactions between zzso and zzso suggest that zzso interacts physically with the zzso zzso While zzso appears to be required specifically for zzso zzso zzso also appears to be required for the function of other zzso receptors in the zzso In zzso zzso the gross zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso is normal, suggesting that it is not required for zzso These data indicate that zzso could be a novel component of the zzso zzso zzso
