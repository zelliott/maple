There is evidence that the gene for the B zzso of zzso zzso is regulated during cell zzso is under hormonal control, and is activated in a small cell lung zzso In order to investigate further the mechanisms of these zzso the human gene was isolated and the structure of the promoter region was zzso A human DNA zzso of 8 zzso pairs was shown to zzso the entire coding region and zzso base pairs zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso was zzso into three cell lines and shown to express functional zzso The zzso of the gene is split by a zzso zzso that is located 12 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation occurs at a site that is approximately 69 zzso upstream of the zzso of this zzso The DNA sequence in the region upstream of the zzso of the zzso is suggestive of two superimposed promoters that contain additional sequence elements that are known to regulate expression of other zzso zzso The zzso also has a remarkable zzso to the overlapping promoters of the zzso zzso zzso These elements collectively form the basis for initial investigations of how this gene is zzso
