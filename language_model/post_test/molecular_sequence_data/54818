Four types of titanium zzso zzso were tested in the same microbial fuel cell zzso zzso zzso Their zzso performances and the dominant microbial communities of the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso were identical in shape, zzso surface area, and core material but differed in either surface coating zzso or zzso metal zzso or surface texture zzso or zzso The zzso was zzso with zzso active, zzso zzso that had been enriched in the zzso compartments of zzso zzso over a period of 4 zzso The original zzso consisted of zzso sludge samples amended with zzso zzso strain zzso Overall, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher current production than the zzso zzso zzso zzso of extracted DNA of the zzso liquid and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated differences in the dominant bacterial zzso zzso formation on the zzso zzso was poor and insufficient for further zzso zzso samples from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso and zzso showed several zzso bacteria, of which selected species were dominant, on the surface of the zzso In contrast, zzso samples showed less diversity, and the enriched strains were not dominant on the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso zzso but not all zzso to zzso zzso strain zzso Other bacterial species were also detected in the system, such as a zzso species that was dominant in the zzso liquid and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
