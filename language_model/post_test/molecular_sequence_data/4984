The human zzso zzso locus zzso maps on zzso zzso and directs the synthesis of zzso zzso light zzso This locus is formed by three gene clusters zzso zzso and zzso that zzso the variable coding genes and the zzso cluster plus the joining segments and the constant zzso Recently the variable zzso gene clusters were mapped by the zzso methodology which located all the known functional zzso genes and zzso The 30 functional zzso genes described so far were zzso into ten families zzso zzso I to V zzso X), but zzso studies have estimated that the zzso repertoire contains about 70 zzso Based on sequence zzso we defined specific zzso zzso for the unique zzso gene zzso The cloned zzso zzso product obtained from zzso DNA with these zzso was zzso and used as probe in Southern zzso zzso zzso analysis of Brazilian zzso We detected the zzso gene in a zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso present in all the individuals zzso in agreement with the physical map of the zzso zzso Moreover, we detected an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso is a gene zzso
