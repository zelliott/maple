The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed at a variety of different levels in zzso and zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso function showed that it could not substitute for zzso despite being present at a wide range of zzso at or above the zzso zzso zzso of regions of functional similarity between the two proteins using zzso zzso revealed that only the zzso zzso domain of zzso could functionally substitute for the corresponding region of zzso The role of this domain was revealed by zzso zzso experiments that demonstrated that in both zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso had zzso zzso and integral membrane zzso similar to those of its zzso zzso and that an intact zzso domain was essential for regulating integration of this protein into the plasma zzso These results suggest strongly that the previously observed cycle of membrane zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso 1994) is common to these two bacteria, and they demonstrate the importance of the zzso zzso domain in promoting this zzso
