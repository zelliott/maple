Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso zzso is an accessory protein with no known zzso In this study, we report the interaction of a zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and human zzso interaction was identified using a zzso system screen and confirmed with interaction screens in cell culture and cellular zzso zzso The zzso domain of interaction was mapped by deletion zzso analysis and results indicated that zzso repeat 2 zzso zzso was essential for zzso We also showed that zzso zzso with zzso structural proteins M zzso and E zzso which have been shown to be essential for zzso particle zzso Taken together, our results coupled with data from studies of the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso could be involved in the zzso possibly assembly of zzso
