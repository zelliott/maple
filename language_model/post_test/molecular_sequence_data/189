The microbial response to produced water zzso zzso in a North Sea oil field was investigated by a combination of zzso and zzso molecular zzso zzso Special zzso was put on the relationship between zzso bacteria zzso and zzso bacteria zzso and results were used to evaluate the possibility of nitrate treatment as a zzso management tool during zzso zzso were collected by reversing the flow of the injection water, which provided samples from around the injection zzso The zzso samples were compared to produced water from the same platform and to zzso samples from a zzso seawater zzso which was the previous injection water treatment of the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso of produced water promoted growth of zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso zzso and potential zzso zzso bacteria were also zzso The finding of zzso zzso makes nitrate treatment during zzso possible, although higher nitrate concentration will be necessary to compensate for the increased zzso zzso
