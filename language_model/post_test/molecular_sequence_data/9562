zzso dynamics simulations of a zzso complex have been conducted to predict the binding affinity of four different peptides toward human zzso Free energy calculations on the zzso interaction with the zzso model demonstrated that zzso interactions are believed to be the main driving force stabilizing the zzso The molecular zzso surface area methodology used for the free energy calculations demonstrated that the zzso constant in the zzso interior plays a major role in the free energy calculations, and the only way to obtain accordance between the free energy calculations and the experimental binding results was to use the average zzso zzso
