Although the zzso of many microbial pathogens have been studied to help identify effective drug targets and novel drugs, such efforts have not yet reached full zzso In this study, we report a systems biological approach that efficiently zzso zzso information for drug targeting and discovery, and apply this approach to the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso First, we partially zzso and fully zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and accordingly reconstructed its zzso zzso network, zzso The validated network model was employed to systematically predict drug targets using the concept of zzso essentiality, along with additional filtering zzso Target genes zzso zzso that interact with the five essential zzso finally selected were zzso zzso These five essential zzso are critical to the survival of the cell, and hence were used to guide the cost-effective selection of chemical zzso which were then screened for zzso activity in a zzso zzso This approach is expected to help fill the existing gap between zzso and drug zzso
