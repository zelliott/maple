zzso are zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso is surrounded by a zzso zzso which is penetrated by zzso zzso The structure of the zzso virus zzso (the type zzso core protein zzso was previously determined and found to have a zzso zzso SCP is a zzso zzso which zzso itself from a zzso zzso Forest virus zzso is among the most zzso related zzso to zzso Similar to zzso zzso is inhibited in zzso after zzso of the zzso by leaving the zzso zzso in the specificity zzso The structures of two different crystal forms (I and zzso of zzso core protein zzso have been determined to zzso A and zzso A resolution, zzso The zzso zzso backbone structure is very similar to that of zzso The zzso association between zzso A and B, found in two different crystal forms of SCP is also present in both crystal forms of zzso However, a third zzso C, occurs in zzso crystal form zzso While zzso A and B make a zzso zzso zzso zzso B and C make a head-to-head zzso zzso A zzso pocket on the surface of the zzso zzso the proposed site of binding of the zzso zzso has large zzso differences with respect to SCP and, in contrast to zzso is found devoid of bound zzso In particular, zzso is pointing out of the zzso pocket in zzso whereas the equivalent zzso in SCP is pointing into the zzso The zzso of zzso found in zzso is consistent with its availability for zzso as observed in the zzso zzso zzso This suggests, by comparison with zzso that zzso binding to zzso causes major zzso changes, including the burial of zzso which would stabilize the intact virus on budding from an infected zzso The zzso contacts found in the zzso and zzso associations within the zzso zzso in the same zzso surface regions as found in the zzso zzso zzso
