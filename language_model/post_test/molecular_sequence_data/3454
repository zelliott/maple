The zzso zzso of a zzso virus zzso zzso closely related to the previously zzso zzso 6, was cloned and zzso The zzso organization of zzso was compared to 41 published zzso zzso sequences representing 17 zzso In the majority of zzso the open reading frame zzso 2 region was divided into two separate zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence was zzso among all zzso while the zzso region showed more zzso The two corresponding putative proteins of zzso were expressed in zzso and their zzso potential was zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the presence of zzso DNA were studied in the zzso of 89 constitutionally healthy zzso By zzso using the small zzso proteins as zzso strong zzso and zzso zzso were found in 9 and zzso of subjects, zzso zzso studies for zzso years of three subjects showed either a persistent coexistence of zzso and zzso DNA or the appearance of viral DNA regardless of pre-existing zzso The low prevalence of zzso could be due to the weak zzso of these probably zzso proteins or to a zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region, the prevalence of zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso 6 sequences were found by specific zzso in 3 of 35 zzso zzso The low prevalence of zzso zzso compared to the high zzso DNA zzso the coexistence of zzso and viral DNA and the appearance of zzso DNA regardless of pre-existing zzso suggest that the zzso immunity against these minor zzso proteins would not be cross zzso
