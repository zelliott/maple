zzso assembles into zzso complexes in the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso in the zzso zzso sequence zzso have no apparent effect on E complex formation but block the assembly of the A complex and the zzso zzso of U2 small nuclear zzso particle zzso zzso zzso a novel complex, designated zzso assembles on zzso containing zzso zzso Unlike the E complex, the zzso complex accumulates in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are tightly bound to zzso in the E complex, are not tightly bound in the zzso zzso zzso previous work showed that zzso zzso and zzso become zzso from zzso after E complex assembly on normal zzso Thus, our data are consistent with a model in which there are two steps in the transition from the E complex to the A complex zzso In the first step, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in an zzso zzso zzso In the second step, the stable binding of U2 zzso occurs in a zzso zzso
