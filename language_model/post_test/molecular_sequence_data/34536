As the zzso potent zzso factor of the zzso virus, the zzso protein enhances viral replication in the brain by an unknown zzso Due to the high energy demands of the brain and the at times inadequate energy supply and small energy reserves to support zzso activity, the ability of this organ to support energy requirements for replication of a virus is zzso We investigated the possible role of the zzso protein in the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the brain to sustain viral zzso In zzso and in zzso monitoring and comparison of zzso levels in mouse brain tissue infected with a zzso zzso virus or a zzso deletion strain zzso revealed differences in zzso zzso and a significant difference in zzso levels in zzso after 5 days of zzso Because of poor replication of the zzso Lister zzso virus in the brain, a role for the zzso protein in the zzso of zzso levels to support viral replication in the brain could not be zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence and predicted secondary structure of the zzso protein and sequence and structural zzso zzso provided evidence of putative zzso and zzso binding sites and a possible zzso function for this zzso
