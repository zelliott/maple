A new method of monitoring the rate of reactions in zzso zzso synthesis is zzso A zzso detector in the reaction cell zzso applied zzso enables the zzso washing and subsequent zzso stages to be examined in zzso The zzso of the reactions can be calculated and hence the optimum reaction times can be zzso zzso sequences are sensed and appropriate action taken completely zzso
