The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso interacts with more than 30 zzso of different sizes and structures that can all be replaced by the zzso protein zzso The double module of complement type repeats, zzso of zzso binds many zzso including all three zzso of zzso and zzso which promotes the zzso of the zzso implicated in Alzheimer's zzso To understand the zzso zzso the zzso structure of zzso has been solved and zzso binding experiments with zzso domain 1 zzso have been zzso From chemical shift zzso of both binding partners upon complex formation, a zzso model of the complex between zzso and zzso has been zzso The binding zzso are similar to a common binding motif suggested from zzso binding studies and provide evidence for an understanding of their mutual zzso zzso The present structural results convey a simultaneous description of both binding partners of an zzso complex and open a route to a broader understanding of the binding specificity of the zzso zzso which may involve a general zzso zzso recognition motif common to all zzso zzso The present result may be beneficial in the design of zzso of zzso binding to the LDL zzso family, and especially of drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's zzso
