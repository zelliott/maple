zzso mosaic virus zzso is a zzso infecting members of the family zzso Early infections in zzso zzso zzso lead to yield losses of zzso Besides intensive biological zzso of zzso only minor molecular data were zzso zzso we determined the complete zzso sequence of a Nigerian isolate of zzso The complete zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso and its zzso organization showed three major zzso coding for a putative movement protein zzso of M r zzso zzso a large zzso protein zzso of M r zzso zzso and a coat protein zzso of M r zzso zzso zzso of secondary zzso structures showed three hairpin structures with internal zzso in the zzso region zzso and a zzso zzso structure zzso which comprises the zzso for zzso typical for a member of the zzso zzso zzso comparisons based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences showed the close relationship of zzso not only to other completely zzso zzso like zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso but also to zzso yellow vein virus zzso zzso yellow vein virus zzso and zzso yellow zzso virus zzso This is the first report of a complete zzso zzso sequence from one of the various zzso zzso originating from West Africa described so zzso Additionally, the experimental host range of zzso including several zzso species was zzso
