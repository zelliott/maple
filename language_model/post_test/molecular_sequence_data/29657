A zzso cluster of zzso genes was previously shown to mediate zzso zzso switching of surface zzso zzso in the bovine pathogen zzso zzso This study revealed that field strains of zzso zzso possess modified versions of the zzso gene complex in which extensive sequence variations occur primarily in the reiterated coding sequences of the zzso structural zzso These findings demonstrate that there is a vastly expanded potential for zzso variation within populations of this zzso
