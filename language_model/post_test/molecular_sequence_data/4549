zzso the zzso 1 familial Alzheimer's disease zzso has been shown to be involved in programmed cell death by three complementary experimental zzso Reduction of zzso protein levels by zzso zzso protects from zzso whereas zzso of an Alzheimer's zzso zzso increases cell death induced by several zzso In addition, zzso a truncated zzso zzso encodes an artificial zzso zzso segment that zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generated by both an alternative zzso transcript and zzso zzso We find that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso Furthermore, a similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is generated by zzso zzso at zzso These results suggest that zzso not only activates zzso zzso but also generates a negative feedback signal in which zzso zzso the progression of cell zzso Thus, whereas zzso is required for zzso zzso and zzso oppose this process, and the balance between zzso and these zzso fragments may dictate the cell zzso
