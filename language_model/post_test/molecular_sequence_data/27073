zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso to the outer nuclear membrane where they connect the nucleus to the zzso zzso proteins interact with zzso zzso proteins to transfer forces across the nuclear envelope to position zzso or move zzso A new zzso zzso zzso was identified in a membrane zzso zzso screen of a zzso zzso library using the zzso protein zzso as zzso zzso also zzso with zzso zzso was enriched at the nuclear envelope in a variety of zzso and required zzso for nuclear envelope zzso in the zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso was essential for embryonic zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso delayed the entry into zzso in zzso led to a small zzso zone in the zzso and caused an zzso zzso Aspects of these zzso were similar to those seen in zzso suggesting that zzso functions with zzso in the zzso and early zzso The data suggest that zzso is a novel zzso protein that functions to ensure the timely progression of the cell cycle between the end of S phase and the entry into zzso
