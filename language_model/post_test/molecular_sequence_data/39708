The zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso signaling for the majority of known zzso zzso family members and is zzso activated in some zzso Here we examine the mechanisms by which the adapter proteins zzso and zzso regulate the activity of zzso We show that like zzso zzso binds zzso at multiple sites and that binding to zzso zzso is essential for zzso to increase active zzso and to be zzso by zzso zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso site zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso increase zzso activity independent of their zzso zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso require only the zzso domain and only one zzso to be bound to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso acids zzso to zzso in zzso are a critical component of a larger regulatory region within zzso most likely including zzso acids within the zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso and possibly the zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso and zzso do not activate zzso as a consequence of their own zzso recruitment of an zzso of zzso or direct competition with a zzso inhibitor for binding to zzso Rather, they most likely induce or stabilize an active zzso of zzso
