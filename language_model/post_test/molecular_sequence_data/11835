alpha zzso zzso zzso is one of the major zzso zzso in zzso Its primary zzso function is to inhibit zzso zzso activity in zzso but it also zzso other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have previously reported a novel alpha zzso zzso zzso from rabbit that is induced up to zzso in the liver during acute inflammatory condition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ray, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we present evidence that the expression of this alpha zzso zzso gene is also induced in zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso From the cloned zzso DNA, we have identified a zzso zzso zzso located between zzso and zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso start zzso In zzso zzso studies demonstrated an interaction of an zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor with a zzso zzso present in this zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso of zzso B zzso the zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso element virtually abolished the zzso induction of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso B induced the zzso promoter zzso Taken together, these results demonstrated that during zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors play a crucial role in the zzso induction of the inflammation responsive alpha zzso zzso
