The recently identified zzso zzso is transcribed from a single zzso zzso previously thought to be an zzso zzso zzso Although expression levels of the three known human zzso genes zzso only slightly in all cell types and zzso zzso zzso expression is limited to certain cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Like zzso the protein zzso by zzso is heat stable and binds to zzso in a zzso zzso Despite the shared identity of zzso of their 148 zzso zzso however, zzso and zzso protein are easily distinguished zzso and zzso zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso protein recognize a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 16,000 which is abundant in cultured normal human zzso zzso cells, but which is absent or barely zzso in zzso or tumor cell zzso The zzso distribution of zzso protein in zzso normal zzso suggests that expression of the gene is regulated during zzso zzso The majority of a small number of zzso zzso examined had lowered or zzso zzso protein expression relative to normal zzso Given its restricted distribution, the zzso protein may be involved in the initiation or maintenance of certain differentiated zzso Its absence may be due to or necessary for the manifestation of the transformed zzso in certain cell zzso
