zzso defects in the zzso synthesis zzso lead to a group of zzso disorders termed the zzso Numerous factors influence the clinical expression of zzso primarily by altering the rate of zzso zzso To date, no zzso correlation has been made to explain the variable zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso and other acute zzso zzso As first and rate determining gene in the zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso appears to be an ideal candidate zzso Previous studies established critical mechanisms for zzso regulation and a direct zzso response to drugs by defined zzso zzso sequences zzso To identify possible functional zzso within the zzso region of zzso selected regulatory regions, including the zzso zzso were screened by DNA sequencing analysis in 26 VP patients zzso for the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two novel zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In zzso analyses indicated that the zzso transition is located immediately zzso to a zzso putative zzso zzso binding zzso zzso experiments with an zzso zzso zzso expression zzso in zzso cells, suggest that this region mediates an increased zzso response in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in transcription, while the zzso double zzso zzso showed a zzso increase in zzso compared to expression in the absence of zzso The highest induction was observed for the zzso zzso zzso that generated an increase of zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso functions as an zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso that the zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso
