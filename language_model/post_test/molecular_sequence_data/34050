Large libraries of randomly zzso genes are applied in directed evolution experiments in order to obtain sufficient zzso These libraries, however, contain mostly inactive zzso and the very low frequency of improved zzso can only be isolated by zzso zzso Small but efficient libraries comprise an attractive zzso Here, we describe the application of ancestral zzso based on zzso predicted by zzso analysis and ancestral zzso We designed and constructed such libraries using serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso as model zzso Both of these zzso families exhibit a range of activities in drug metabolism and zzso of zzso The ancestral serum zzso and zzso libraries were screened by zzso means, including zzso using zzso and/or reactions with which all family members exhibit low zzso The libraries showed a remarkably high frequency of highly zzso and functionally diverse zzso zzso of as few as 300 zzso enabled the isolation of zzso with up to zzso higher activity than the starting point zzso zzso and kinetic zzso of an evolved zzso zzso show how few ancestral zzso reshaped the active site and modulated the zzso zzso zzso libraries therefore comprise a means of focusing diversity to positions and zzso that readily trigger changes in zzso and/or reaction zzso thereby zzso the isolation of new zzso zzso for a variety of different zzso and reactions by zzso or even zzso zzso
