zzso of zzso were analyzed using zzso with zzso zzso that were based on two published repetitive DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were originally isolated from zzso zzso The various zzso produced a zzso zzso zzso product having high zzso with the repetitive DNA zzso The zzso fragments produced from different zzso differed mainly in amplification quantity and in base composition at 89 variable zzso On the other hand, amplification products from the primer set for zzso were of different sizes and zzso zzso These results show that the two repetitive DNA sequences have different evolutionary zzso zzso is present in all zzso tested, although differences in copy number and zzso sequence are zzso zzso is more zzso specific, zzso fewer zzso possess this family of repetitive zzso It was concluded that the repetitive sequence zzso family is an ancient one that existed in zzso zzso prior to divergence of annual and perennial zzso In contrast, sequences similar to zzso have only evolved following zzso zzso
