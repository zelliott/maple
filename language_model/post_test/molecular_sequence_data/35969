A zzso of human zzso growth factor II zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso the zzso coding for zzso and zzso were changed to yield zzso and zzso respectively, thus creating two pairs of basic zzso zzso and zzso as zzso sequences of the remaining C zzso zzso zzso II was expressed in zzso cells as a processed zzso zzso with a deletion of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso by three zzso zzso This zzso II showed zzso and zzso reduced affinities to the type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso zzso cells, respectively, whereas the zzso incorporation potency was the same as that of zzso zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso between the reduced binding to the type 1 zzso zzso and the full zzso incorporation potency is due to the zzso reduced affinity of the expressed zzso to the zzso zzso binding protein 3 zzso The results suggest that zzso II assumes a zzso very similar to zzso II, and that the entire length of the C domain is not essential for biological zzso
