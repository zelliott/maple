The complete zzso acid sequence of the unusual zzso zzso zzso c from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso has been determined using classical chemical sequencing techniques and mass zzso The zzso sequence shows almost no similarity with any other known zzso zzso zzso but the zzso site of the protein is similar to that of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso domain of the protein covers only the zzso part of the zzso and there is evidence for at least one more domain containing four zzso zzso which might bind another zzso possibly a zzso zzso zzso This domain is similar to a sequence zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso which confirms the high conservation of the genes involved in zzso zzso
