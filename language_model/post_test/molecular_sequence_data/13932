zzso zzso zzso including 146 zzso zzso were aligned on the basis of conservation of secondary structure and the avoidance of gap zzso Of the 182 positions needed to accommodate all the zzso zzso only 84 are common to all, including the absolutely zzso zzso and zzso The mean number of zzso acid zzso per position ranges from 8 to 13 for all zzso and 5 to 9 for internal zzso Although the total sequence volumes have a variation approximately zzso the variation in volume per position ranges from approximately zzso for the internal to approximately zzso for the surface zzso zzso correlations exist between zzso acid substitution and the variation in volume per position for the 84 common and the internal but not the surface zzso The zzso acid substitution zzso derived from the 84 common positions was used to evaluate sequence similarity within the zzso and between the zzso and zzso C and zzso A, via calculation of zzso similarity zzso The scores for zzso comparisons over the 84 common positions overlap the zzso and zzso scores, with the former being zzso For the subset of internal positions, overlap is minimal between the three groups of zzso These results imply a zzso of zzso acid sequences able to assume the common zzso zzso structure and suggest that the zzso of the latter include sites other than those zzso to zzso
