zzso factor D is a zzso zzso regulated by a novel mechanism that depends on zzso changes rather than zzso of a zzso for expression of zzso zzso The zzso changes are presumed to be induced by the single natural zzso zzso and to result in zzso zzso of the zzso center and of the zzso binding site of factor D, both of which have zzso zzso Here we report that replacement of zzso zzso and zzso of factor D zzso zzso has been used for comparison zzso with the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is sufficient to induce substantially higher zzso activity associated with a typical zzso zzso alignment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results provide a partial structural explanation for the low zzso of zzso factor D toward synthetic zzso
