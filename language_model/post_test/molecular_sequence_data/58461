The four members of the zzso gene family give rise to proteins that are part of the zzso zzso factor zzso When studying zzso zzso in a leukemia cell line from zzso we found that the zzso gene zzso for the zzso zzso became strongly zzso as the leukemia cells started to zzso It was therefore of interest to determine the zzso zzso of the human zzso gene zzso including a comparison to zzso aberrations observed in leukemia zzso Based on sequence information from the rat and chicken zzso zzso we were able to zzso a zzso zzso zzso covering zzso 4 of zzso This zzso was employed as probe for both radioactive and zzso in zzso zzso to human zzso zzso allowing us to assign zzso to zzso The zzso of the gene to zzso 2 was independently verified by zzso amplification of a zzso zzso from a panel of zzso zzso cell zzso
