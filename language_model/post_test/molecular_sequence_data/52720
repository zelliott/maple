Two new zzso structures of WW zzso the mouse zzso binding protein and a putative zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso show that this domain, only 35 zzso acids in zzso defines the smallest zzso zzso zzso zzso protein domain that is stable in the absence of zzso bonds, tightly bound zzso or zzso The structural roles of zzso zzso have been studied using zzso zzso of both wild type zzso zzso interactions responsible for the stability of the WW structure have been zzso Based on a network of highly zzso long range interactions across the zzso structure that supports the WW fold and on a systematic analysis of zzso zzso in the WW family, we have designed a folded zzso WW zzso
