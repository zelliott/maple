The natural zzso zzso by the zzso delta virus zzso zzso contains a zzso linkage at the zzso zzso however, a zzso zzso backbone can also be zzso by both zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso With zzso containing either linkage, the zzso zzso generated zzso zzso and zzso groups suggesting that the mechanisms of zzso in both cases were by a zzso attack on the zzso center by the adjacent zzso zzso zzso metal zzso was required for zzso of either zzso However, although the zzso was zzso slightly faster in zzso than in zzso the zzso was zzso in zzso (or zzso but not zzso This dramatic difference in zzso specificity is strongly suggestive of a crucial zzso interaction at the active zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso at a zzso bond was not efficiently zzso by the zzso zzso The relaxed linkage specificity of the zzso zzso may be due in part to lack of a rigid binding site for sequences zzso to the zzso zzso
