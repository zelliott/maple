From a human zzso zzso library we isolated a novel zzso clone zzso a protein containing a zzso domain that is highly zzso among several zzso zzso The zzso domain is thought to be essential for their association with zzso The zzso designated zzso (for zzso protein I, zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of 579 zzso zzso 193 zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed expression of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in size, in all zzso zzso The zzso transcript was significantly higher in brain and heart than in other zzso This gene was mapped by FISH to zzso bands zzso
