The zzso zzso nuclear zzso family has been zzso from zzso to zzso Although knockout mice for each of the zzso proteins have been generated, their function during zzso development has remained zzso As an alternative to obtain insights on zzso role in development, we have zzso the expression pattern and function of one member of this family, zzso during zzso zzso Our expression analysis indicates that zzso is expressed from zzso to zzso stages in a dynamic pattern, becoming restricted after zzso to anterior regions of the developing zzso and later on concentrated predominantly in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso shows that reducing zzso levels zzso neural zzso cell proliferation and survival, revealing an essential function of this gene for the growth of zzso zzso The brain growth zzso zzso by decreasing zzso expression are specific and independent of zzso patterning events, initial establishment of neural zzso or neural differentiation occurring in this zzso However, zzso is necessary for zzso expression and is positively regulated by sonic zzso zzso examination shows that zzso is likely to be the zzso of the only member of this family present in zzso as well as to the previously described mouse zzso and to human zzso zzso zzso Thus, we provide evidence as to the role of zzso in brain growth in zzso
