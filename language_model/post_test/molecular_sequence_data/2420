The sequence of zzso zzso acids zzso the zzso zzso from rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso has been deduced by cloning and sequencing the complementary zzso The predicted structure suggests that the calcium release channel activity resides in the zzso region of the zzso zzso whereas the remaining portion constitutes the zzso structure spanning the zzso gap between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
