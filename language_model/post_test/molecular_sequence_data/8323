Two zzso fragments capable of driving the expression of the zzso B resistance gene zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso Two libraries consisting of random, zzso fragments of zzso DNA inserted zzso of a zzso zzso gene were constructed and used for transformation of zzso zzso Both libraries transformed zzso zzso at a low zzso zzso tolerated up to 800 zzso of zzso B, while zzso colonies were inhibited completely by 50 zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso from zzso by simply zzso the zzso DNA with zzso which cuts once in the zzso zzso to the zzso and transforming zzso coli with the zzso zzso The recovered plasmids transformed zzso zzso with a frequency of up to zzso zzso of zzso Both promoter fragments were zzso and found to contain zzso and zzso boxes as well as zzso zzso This method makes it possible to easily isolate many fragments with promoter activity from zzso zzso and should facilitate the investigation of the promoter structures necessary for the expression of zzso zzso
