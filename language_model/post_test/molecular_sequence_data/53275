zzso a member of the basic zzso zzso family of zzso regulators, is a central factor for the regulation of the differentiation of committed zzso precursor cells of the peripheral nervous zzso We have previously produced zzso a single chain version of this zzso zzso by linking the zzso end of the first zzso to the zzso zzso of the second zzso through a flexible zzso zzso We have now determined by zzso zzso zzso the zzso parameters zzso the DNA binding reactions of zzso The DNA binding specificity was relatively low and comparable to that observed for zzso zzso zzso At 32 degrees C and pH 7, the concentration of zzso at which 50% DNA binding occurred was determined as zzso and 152 zzso for binding to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso the free energy of the association was only slightly temperature dependent, while both the zzso and the zzso change were strong functions of zzso The free energy of DNA binding was independent of the pH for the pH range between 6 and zzso zzso of the zzso change of the association reaction suggested that the two basic zzso and the zzso region between the zzso underwent a folding transition from a mainly unfolded to a predominantly ordered zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso the DNA binding reaction of zzso follows an induced fit zzso
