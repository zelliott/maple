To compare and analyze the variation of zzso genes of zzso A zzso from Guangzhou during 2009 to 2011 with the zzso A zzso from all over the world, to lay the foundation of functional research and interaction mechanism of the zzso zzso 17 Novel zzso influenza viruses and 1 seasonal zzso influenza virus have been isolated from human in Guangzhou during 2009 to 2011 that were cloned into zzso zzso zzso for zzso Then, 68 zzso genes of zzso from human around the world were downloaded from zzso database and analyzed using molecular biological zzso The zzso tree result shows that the zzso genes of zzso from the world separated into two main zzso There is high zzso of zzso genes of one Seasonal zzso virus and Novel zzso viruses which were isolated in Guangzhou compared with the global Novel zzso zzso And all of them got the 11 zzso acids truncated protein by zzso included one seasonal zzso strain isolated by our zzso There is no variation of zzso genes of Novel zzso virus in Guangzhou compared with the worldwide zzso However, one seasonal zzso virus which isolated by our laboratory shows analogous truncated zzso of zzso of Novel zzso virus, it reveals that the zzso gene might has done the early zzso between the Novel zzso virus and seasonal zzso zzso
