The full-length zzso of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso also known as human zzso zzso related 1 zzso or zzso entry zzso C, was cloned and showed a zzso identity with its human zzso zzso is expressed in some zzso cell lines, exemplified by zzso zzso and L cells, and in zzso zzso It mediates entry of an extended range of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and bovine zzso zzso A soluble form of the zzso blocked zzso in zzso and human zzso zzso cells, suggesting a physical interaction of the zzso with zzso The higher zzso of soluble zzso required to block zzso relative to soluble zzso suggest that the target of the two molecules is not zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso was blocked by soluble zzso in zzso zzso and L zzso Two features were zzso First, soluble zzso failed to physically interact with zzso zzso D zzso at a zzso level, although it zzso physically with zzso Second, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not restrict zzso or zzso infection, whereas zzso of zzso and zzso did restrict infection, suggesting that zzso fails to be zzso by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso serves as a zzso zzso for entry of the human and animal zzso This activity, at least for zzso is independent of a zzso binding to zzso
