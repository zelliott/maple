Two sites, zzso and zzso in the zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso both direct zzso zzso formation 15 zzso upstream of the zzso box sequence zzso Site zzso which defines the 3' end of the zzso zzso does not terminate zzso whereas site zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso can be converted into a zzso site with termination activity by a single point zzso 2 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso formation at zzso is unchanged by this zzso zzso a point zzso 2 zzso downstream of the zzso box zzso termination without affecting zzso zzso Our results identify two zzso events occurring at the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation by processing and zzso zzso zzso The two processes are directed by two zzso but zzso signals in the DNA zzso Site zzso in zzso zzso is damaged in the second process by a natural zzso
