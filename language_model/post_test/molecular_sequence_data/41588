Signaling by the zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso is essential for early urinary tract zzso Individual or a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in mice cause zzso zzso reminiscent of zzso anomalies of the kidney or urinary tract zzso in humans and distinct from zzso zzso zzso in complete zzso or zzso zzso We zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 122 unrelated living zzso patients to discover deleterious zzso that cause zzso Novel or rare deleterious zzso in zzso or zzso were found in six unrelated zzso A family with duplicated collecting system had a novel zzso zzso which showed markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso Two patients with zzso zzso zzso additional rare zzso zzso zzso and zzso The patient with double zzso zzso had multiple defects including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso was necessary to affect zzso zzso zzso zzso and next-generation sequencing revealed a novel deleterious zzso zzso in zzso the zzso for zzso in this zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso was inherited from the unaffected mother and the zzso zzso from the unaffected zzso Our studies indicate that zzso of living zzso patients harbor deleterious rare zzso or novel zzso in zzso zzso We provide evidence for the coexistence of deleterious rare and common zzso in genes in the same zzso as a cause of zzso and discovered novel zzso associated with the zzso zzso
