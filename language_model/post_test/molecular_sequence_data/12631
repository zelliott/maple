zzso of target cells zzso by zzso zzso involves the zzso of zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso cell zzso Recently, a zzso zzso mechanism involving the interaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso has been revealed in T zzso However, whether the zzso zzso zzso also functions in zzso cells has not been zzso We zzso human peripheral zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso and zzso treatment zzso zzso message and zzso the zzso cells to lyse a zzso zzso This zzso was partially inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso or by zzso fusion zzso We also found that zzso is zzso expressed on the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso and that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso pathway, as well as the zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso interactions are involved in zzso recognition by zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by zzso at a higher level than a zzso zzso line, whereas zzso zzso with zzso alone was zzso zzso of zzso zzso was partially zzso as indicated by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of several zzso by zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso in zzso Thus, fresh human zzso cells and the human zzso cell line zzso are capable of using the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso interactions appear to influence the zzso zzso zzso
