In zzso zzso of zzso gamma group II zzso zzso with low doses of 254 zzso zzso light zzso a single major zzso This zzso was mapped within the domain 3 zzso of this zzso and one of the participating zzso was zzso When an zzso containing only the domain 3 zzso is zzso under the same conditions, an zzso zzso forms between two specific zzso one of them identical to the zzso zzso in the full-length zzso zzso In both zzso the zzso is zzso zzso and zzso A trans zzso for domain 3 function was developed and used to find that the zzso domain 3 zzso remains highly zzso This suggests that zzso has trapped a functional, zzso folded state of this group II zzso zzso and that this folding is probably independent of the other zzso of the zzso
