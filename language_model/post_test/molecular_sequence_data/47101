DNA zzso as models for slipped strand DNA have been analyzed by zzso gel migration and atomic force zzso zzso All zzso containing one hairpin or loop have reduced zzso zzso compared with that expected for their molecular zzso The retarded gel mobility zzso with the formation of a sharp zzso detected by zzso zzso the hairpin length from 7 zzso to 50 zzso results in a zzso decrease in gel mobility of zzso This secondary zzso effect appears to depend only on the hairpin size since the zzso data show no dependence of the zzso angle on the hairpin zzso zzso zzso with a loop or hairpin in opposite strands migrate with distinct zzso Analysis of gel migration of zzso with altered hairpin zzso as well as of truncated zzso indicates that the difference in mobility is due to an inherent zzso in one of the long zzso This is confirmed by the zzso distance zzso from zzso zzso In addition, significant variation of the zzso distances is consistent with a dynamic structure of zzso at the three-way zzso Double zzso containing one hairpin in each of the complementary strands also separate in a gel as two zzso Their appearance in zzso showed a complicated pattern of flat representations of the three-dimensional structure and may indicate a certain degree of interaction between complementary parts of the zzso that are several zzso turns zzso
