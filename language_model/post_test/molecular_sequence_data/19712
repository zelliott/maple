The crystal structure of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined with a zzso A zzso zzso is the major soluble zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and is zzso of a zzso and a zzso zzso In the zzso state two molecules of zzso are in close contact to each other, although the presence of zzso in free solution could be ruled out by zzso zzso The overall architecture of zzso is similar to that of other zzso zzso such as zzso Short zzso segments are linking the zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso sequence identity (of 216 aligned zzso with the respective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain has the most primitive fold yet identified for this zzso zzso It is zzso identical to the zzso domain of the zzso Wilson zzso zzso zzso structurally aligned zzso zzso zzso with zzso suggests a putative zzso site in zzso The zzso domain of zzso is structurally related to the corresponding part of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a bound zzso zzso was identified at the zzso zzso In solution state, the potential binding of zzso to zzso was zzso with zzso Bound zzso could be readily displaced by zzso at zzso concentration as well as by zzso at zzso zzso It is possible therefore to assign the structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso to a state related to the zzso intermediate state of the zzso zzso
