The zzso zzso was isolated and zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso fragments were separated by zzso zzso sequencing identified a total of 96 zzso from four distinct zzso The sequence showed that zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso coli, and zzso zzso from zzso zzso The sequence was essentially identical to the translated sequence of an zzso gene of zzso zzso currently placed at zzso zzso of the zzso Our results and other data suggest, however, that this gene is actually the zzso zzso which is more correctly placed in the 34 zzso region of the zzso The zzso peptides were also screened with 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by Western zzso These results, in conjunction with the prediction of the zzso folding pattern based on the known three-dimensional structure of zzso coli zzso showed a close zzso relationship among zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso and zzso and a strong conservation of sequences within the zzso beta strands of these zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso
