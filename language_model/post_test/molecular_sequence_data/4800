We have asked whether comparative zzso analysis and rat zzso can be used to identify functional regulatory zzso in the gene locus zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the zzso zzso of these zzso A zzso stretch of 46 zzso spanning the zzso zzso locus has been zzso and nine putative genes were zzso Unlike the OT and zzso zzso which are closely linked in the zzso zzso in a zzso orientation, zzso IT and VT genes are linked head to tail and are separated by five zzso When a zzso containing the zzso zzso locus was introduced into the rat zzso we found that the zzso IT gene was specifically expressed in rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso the response of the zzso OT gene to an zzso zzso These data show that zzso elements and zzso factors zzso the zzso and zzso regulation of the OT and IT genes are zzso between zzso and zzso The combination of zzso zzso analysis and zzso in a zzso is a powerful tool for identifying and analyzing zzso zzso regulatory zzso
