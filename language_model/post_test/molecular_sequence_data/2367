zzso interactions involving zzso and promoter sequences within the zzso regions of several avian zzso long terminal repeats zzso were studied by zzso I zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso bound to all four viral zzso zzso The zzso zzso virus binding site corresponded closely to the zzso limit of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were protected as a pair of adjacent binding zzso The zzso zzso virus zzso bound zzso at a single site at zzso zzso to zzso zzso also bound to the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso to zzso The avian zzso virus zzso bound zzso at three sites: zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso We have previously observed binding of zzso to an zzso in the gag gene of avian zzso A heat-treated nuclear extract from chicken liver bound to all of the same zzso sequences as did zzso zzso of the avian zzso binding sequences with the published binding sites for zzso in two zzso boxes and in the zzso virus 40, zzso and zzso zzso virus enhancers suggested zzso as a consensus sequence for binding of zzso When two bases of this consensus sequence were altered by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso virus zzso binding of the zzso chicken protein was zzso
