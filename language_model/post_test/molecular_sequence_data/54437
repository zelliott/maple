zzso and zzso are essential proteins for zzso zzso zzso zzso in synaptic zzso fusion via dual roles: as a zzso protein by binding closed zzso and as a fusion protein that binds zzso complexes in a zzso zzso dependent zzso The two roles are associated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso binding to zzso is not highly selective, suggesting that other parts of the zzso complex are involved in binding to zzso We also find that zzso with an N zzso and a physically anchored C zzso binds to zzso and that this complex can participate in zzso complex zzso We report a zzso crystal structure that, together with other data, reveals how zzso might transit from a zzso that binds closed zzso to one that may be compatible with binding open zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest the possibility that structural transitions occur in both zzso and zzso during their zzso zzso We zzso that zzso domain zzso zzso a zzso change that may allow zzso interactions with zzso zzso
