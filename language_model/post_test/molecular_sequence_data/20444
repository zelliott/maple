A novel zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared in zzso zzso zzso by a zzso in zzso zzso procedure using a zzso mixture consisting of functional zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methanol with added zzso zzso 20,000 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The preparation of the zzso was zzso by investigating the ratio of functional zzso to zzso and the effect of zzso zzso molecular zzso The resulting zzso zzso was used as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso as the testing zzso the extraction performance of this zzso zzso towards zzso compounds was zzso Finally, the zzso zzso was applied for selective enrichment of zzso and zzso
