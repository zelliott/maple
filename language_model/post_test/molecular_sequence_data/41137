In this study, 116 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recovered in various regions of zzso were zzso All zzso were zzso to zzso one isolate was also zzso to zzso making it a step closer to zzso zzso Among 72 zzso tested by zzso zzso carried zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No zzso or zzso genes were zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso Among these, zzso was found upstream of zzso in 54 zzso All but two of these zzso also carried zzso highlighting the coexistence of zzso and zzso genetic platforms, zzso the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dissemination of zzso class D zzso zzso zzso and zzso found within zzso and zzso may reflect either multiple genetic structures in the origin of zzso acquisition or zzso complex zzso These results indicate that there may exist different genetic origins for zzso resistance among zzso zzso Six zzso profiles were associated with three major sequence types, with zzso zzso or zzso being widely zzso since zzso zzso zzso so far as endemic in zzso and zzso (which zzso with zzso before zzso appeared to have been gradually replaced by zzso The new zzso zzso was detected for the first time in this zzso Identification of an extensively drug-resistant zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both in community and zzso facilities, demonstrates the menace of zzso zzso zzso
