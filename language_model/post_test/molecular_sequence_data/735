zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso led to identification of an open reading frame zzso a novel fusion zzso zzso with a putative function in zzso metabolism via zzso oxide and zzso zzso Gene cluster analysis indicated that the highly related fusion proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in a similar zzso zzso Whereas 413 zzso acids of the N zzso of zzso are highly similar to those of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso the residual 160 zzso acids of the C zzso show significant zzso to the zzso zzso of these zzso Cloning and functional expression of zzso revealed for the first time that the fusion protein does in fact catalyze two separate zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso and highly zzso zzso of zzso to zzso oxide were zzso zzso studies and zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated the absence of tightly bound zzso and zzso zzso in this self-sufficient zzso zzso zzso a spectrum of aromatic compounds similar to those of zzso zzso However, the specific activities of the zzso and zzso functions of zzso are one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso
