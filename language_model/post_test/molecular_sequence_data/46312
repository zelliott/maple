Atlantic zzso zzso zzso inhabiting the zzso Superfund site in New Bedford Harbor zzso zzso have evolved genetic resistance to the toxic effects of these zzso They also lack induction of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso responses after exposure to zzso zzso suggesting an overall zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In this study, we hypothesized that the genetic resistance is due to altered zzso expression resulting from zzso of DNA in the promoter region of zzso genes in fish inhabiting New Bedford zzso To test this hypothesis, we cloned and zzso zzso and zzso promoter regions and employed zzso zzso chain reaction zzso followed by zzso analysis to compare the zzso status of zzso islands of zzso and zzso in zzso of adult zzso collected from New Bedford Harbor and a reference site zzso Creek, zzso No significant differences in zzso profiles were observed in either zzso or zzso promoter regions between zzso and SC zzso However, zzso of the zzso promoter correlated with low expression of transcripts in the liver in both zzso In comparison to zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is high and its promoter is zzso Taken together, our results suggest that genetic resistance to zzso in zzso fish is not due to altered zzso of zzso promoter regions, but that promoter zzso may control zzso expression of zzso genes in zzso
