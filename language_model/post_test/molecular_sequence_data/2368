When incubated at a restrictive temperature, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells accumulate inactive and incompletely zzso forms of zzso zzso Three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso accumulated within a zzso zzso presumably the zzso zzso and resisted zzso degradation unless the membrane was zzso with zzso zzso cloning and DNA sequence analysis of the zzso gene predicted an extremely zzso protein product of 59 zzso This prediction was confirmed by zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso zzso which was translated in a soluble fraction from zzso cells, was zzso into, but zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso of zzso cells was zzso compared with the activity of zzso zzso zzso restoration of zzso was obtained in reactions that were supplemented with zzso or zzso but not those supplemented with other sugar zzso These results were consistent with a role for the zzso protein in the transfer of zzso to zzso zzso
