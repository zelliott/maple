zzso which is a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family, was found originally in immature cells and cancer cells but not in zzso adult zzso The subsequent identification of four other alternative zzso zzso that possess distinct functions and zzso suggested the diverse roles of zzso zzso An unspecified zzso of zzso was found recently to be induced in terminally differentiated zzso by zzso that prolong the zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso suggesting the importance of zzso in blocking zzso in zzso To examine the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso we attempted to induce zzso by zzso in an zzso cell line that was differentiated into zzso by zzso zzso acid and zzso and freshly isolated human zzso The zzso zzso zzso which was decreased during zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso differentiated zzso In contrast, in normal zzso zzso zzso was observed to increase spontaneously after 24 h zzso and no additional zzso was induced by zzso which exerted their zzso effects on the zzso in 6 zzso despite the lack of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso detected zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso with no other zzso in the freshly isolated or incubated zzso Our study revealed that the expressed zzso and the response to zzso were different between the zzso and normal zzso which predominantly expressed zzso zzso not likely involved in zzso zzso by zzso
