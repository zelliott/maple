Using an in zzso zzso screen for zzso clones of brain zzso zzso we isolated a rat transcript that encodes a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso DNA databases, we found two zzso protein zzso One zzso zzso by multiple zzso is extant in zzso and zzso but not zzso The second zzso appears to be recently evolved because it has been identified only in zzso Multiple transcripts zzso each zzso and exhibit different tissue expression patterns throughout rat brain and zzso with abundant expression in the zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed zzso expression of zzso in distinct zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas expression of zzso zzso was zzso expressed in select zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Combined with the genetic evidence that zzso has zzso functions in plants, the complexity of zzso biology observed here may suggest auxiliary functions for zzso proteins in the zzso nervous zzso
