zzso alignment and structure prediction are used to locate zzso zzso zzso zzso and the positions of their zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso branching zzso and zzso branching zzso zzso involved in zzso or synthesis of zzso linkages in starch and related zzso This has allowed identification of the zzso active site of the zzso zzso zzso and the locations of zzso zzso making up the active sites of all zzso zzso zzso and specificity of the zzso are discussed in terms of zzso zzso acid zzso and loop zzso An evolutionary distance tree of 47 zzso and related zzso is built on 37 zzso representing the four best zzso zzso of the zzso It exhibits clusters of zzso close in zzso with the branching and zzso zzso zzso being the most zzso zzso
