Group A zzso zzso zzso is the most common strain affecting humans around the world over the past few zzso In this study, we examined genetic variation in the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso detected in children of four major cities of Vietnam during three different zzso seasons: zzso zzso and zzso in order to assess the evolution of the virus over 11 zzso zzso samples zzso from children hospitalized for zzso caused by zzso zzso were analyzed by DNA sequencing of gene 9 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso gene of the zzso strains from 1999 contained a lineage I, while zzso from 2009 clustered in lineage zzso Both of these lineages were found zzso in zzso zzso While different zzso of lineage I and II zzso in the zzso and zzso seasons, almost all strains in 2009 belonged to zzso zzso In the analysis using selected 10 zzso the zzso genes of these 2 zzso lineages were all grouped in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid analyses indicated that there were thirteen zzso acid zzso between strains of two zzso Of those, two were found in zzso regions A and C, zzso possible zzso differences between these two zzso The zzso strains in Vietnam are very genetically diverse and zzso zzso the frequent monitoring on evolution of zzso will be important to assess efficacy of zzso vaccine in zzso
