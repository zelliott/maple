A zzso gene has been constructed that expresses zzso zzso in transformed plant zzso but not in bacterial zzso This gene has proved extremely useful for monitoring transformation during the period immediately following gene transfer from zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso 2 days after zzso peaked at zzso days and then zzso if selection was imposed expression increased again after 10-14 zzso The extent of transient expression after 4 days correlated well with stable integration as measured by zzso resistance, hormone independence, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso leaf discs confirmed the transient peak of zzso expression zzso days after zzso The most surprising result was that the blue zzso was concentrated in localized zones on the circumference of the zzso within these zones, essentially all the cells appeared to be expressing zzso We suggest that the frequency of gene transfer from zzso is extremely high within localized regions of leaf zzso but that the frequency of stable integration is several orders of magnitude zzso
