A pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed from two relatively zzso regions of the zzso open reading frame of most human zzso zzso The size of the generated zzso was about zzso zzso zzso using these zzso was found capable of amplifying DNA from zzso zzso of the zzso types tested, its sensitivity being zzso copies for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso of zzso samples and in zzso zzso of normal skin zzso from patients with various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and six zzso novel zzso types were zzso No correlation was found to exist between specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso surface zzso samples from one or more sites on three of four healthy volunteers were found to contain zzso types 12 and 49 being identified, as well as eight novel zzso types, two of which were also found among the zzso In all, zzso was detected in zzso zzso of those tested, five zzso types and 12 novel candidate types being identified, and 37% zzso of zzso samples were found to manifest more than one zzso zzso All the zzso detected zzso high degrees of zzso sequence similarity with zzso types associated with skin zzso and zzso zzso The overall zzso finding in the skin samples was 50% zzso using the zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso using another zzso test designed for skin zzso The results thus suggest the new method to be sensitive and generally zzso for detecting zzso zzso
