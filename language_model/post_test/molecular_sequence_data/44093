zzso zzso specialized in energy conservation reactions in zzso cells, have evolved from zzso zzso whose closest known relatives are the zzso group of zzso Because characterized zzso zzso vary markedly in structure, it has been impossible to zzso from them the initial form of the zzso zzso This would require the identification of minimally derived zzso zzso that better reflect the ancestral zzso Here we describe such a primitive zzso zzso in the freshwater zzso zzso zzso This zzso displays zzso characteristics that ally it with the zzso a zzso group that lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso base zzso contains the largest collection of genes zzso so far identified in any zzso including genes for zzso zzso zzso the zzso component of zzso zzso and at least 18 proteins not previously known to be zzso in zzso Most surprising are four genes specifying a zzso zzso zzso zzso Features of gene content together with zzso characteristics of zzso organization and expression not found before in zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso more closely resembles the ancestral zzso zzso than any other zzso investigated to zzso
