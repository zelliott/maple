The zzso zzso of liver, zzso and zzso zzso are major sites for zzso and recycling of waste zzso through zzso binding to a disparate family of scavenger zzso Among the most complex is zzso a large zzso protein containing tandem zzso zzso zzso growth zzso repeats, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which functions as an zzso zzso for zzso low density zzso and advanced zzso end zzso zzso zzso has also been reported to mediate both zzso of zzso across zzso zzso high zzso zzso and zzso of zzso tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso Currently, however, it is not clear how zzso mediates these distinct zzso To address the issue, we have investigated the tissue and zzso zzso of zzso in detail and assessed the functional status of its zzso zzso We show that zzso is almost entirely zzso in zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cultured zzso cells but that a finite population, zzso only by fluorescent zzso or zzso zzso low density zzso zzso cycles rapidly between the plasma membrane and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) early zzso In addition, we show using full-length zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso cells that zzso targeting is influenced by the zzso zzso tail, which contains a putative zzso zzso zzso to zzso sorting zzso Finally, we provide evidence that the zzso zzso domain binds neither zzso nor other zzso These properties support a role for zzso as a rapidly recycling scavenger zzso and argue against a role in cell zzso or zzso zzso
