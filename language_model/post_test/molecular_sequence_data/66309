Juvenile hormones zzso are key regulators of both metamorphosis and adult zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is thought to be an important zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, catalyzing zzso of zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso zzso Previous evidence in other insects suggested that zzso is rate limiting and regulated by a zzso family, the zzso A full-length zzso zzso a 296 zzso acid putative zzso has been zzso A zzso zzso was zzso expressed and a specific zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso activity using a zzso zzso In this zzso no activity was detected either with zzso alone or when added to a corpus zzso CA zzso zzso analysis was used to confirm the presence of zzso in the CA of zzso zzso ring zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and zzso release in wild type and zzso stocks in the presence and absence of zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso has little if any effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to have a select effect on zzso zzso zzso and not zzso or zzso Additional analysis of zzso zzso and zzso release in strains with a zzso or decrease of zzso compared to wild type shows no significant decrease in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso strains that reduce the level of zzso showed reduced longevity relative to zzso but this result may be due to other genetic zzso
