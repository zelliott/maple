zzso butterflies are recognized as model organisms in zzso evolutionary biology, zzso and conservation biology but present numerous unresolved zzso zzso We zzso zzso relationships for 51 of about 205 species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso sequences of zzso and nuclear DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso I and II and zzso zzso of zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso trees were recovered within zzso from analyses of combined data using maximum likelihood, zzso analysis, and maximum zzso zzso zzso Several disagreements with the traditional zzso of zzso were zzso Five major previously hypothesized subdivisions within zzso were well zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further studies are required to clarify relationships within traditional zzso which was zzso Several biologically interesting characteristics of zzso appear to have zzso origins, including zzso adults, zzso host associations, and zzso zzso Early diversification within zzso is estimated at zzso million years ago based on a combination of zzso time constraints rather than zzso This divergence time suggests that zzso has slower apparent substitution rates than do zzso and zzso zzso and/or zzso corrected using zzso substitution models are still being consistently zzso The amount of sequence divergence between zzso subdivisions is equivalent to zzso between zzso in other tribes of the zzso and between zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
