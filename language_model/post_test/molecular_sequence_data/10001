zzso gene D zzso is carried on the zzso of the plant pathogen zzso zzso zzso tomato with zzso zzso zzso widely distributed among the zzso We now report sequences in the soft rot pathogen zzso zzso that zzso to zzso suggesting a zzso function beyond zzso zzso zzso may have been transferred zzso among zzso zzso DNA linked to zzso shows evidence of class II zzso and contains a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso short sequences linked to zzso are similar to zzso genes from a variety of unrelated zzso We have also identified the gene cluster that controls zzso zzso
