zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso as sole source of carbon and zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso was constructed and a zzso zzso strategy was set up to isolate a zzso DNA zzso containing genes required for zzso zzso A zzso portion of the cloned DNA was zzso revealing thirteen open reading zzso Two zzso hypothetical proteins zzso and zzso similar to zzso regulators and one zzso located on an zzso element zzso zzso a putative zzso Three other putative proteins zzso zzso and zzso displayed strong similarity with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso for the degradation of zzso breakdown zzso The remaining hypothetical proteins displayed only limited similarity with zzso sequences available from zzso Suicide zzso zzso and genetic zzso showed that integrity of the zzso zzso zzso was an absolute requirement for zzso degradation to zzso These findings were further supported by the analysis of zzso in bacterial culture zzso obtained from appropriate zzso The results presented here demonstrated the suitability of the genetic tool constructed and supplied the first genetic evidence for the participation of a zzso zzso zzso in a bacterial zzso degradation zzso
