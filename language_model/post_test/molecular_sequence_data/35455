zzso zzso factor zzso zzso directs zzso to the A site of zzso zzso In addition, more than zzso zzso zzso of zzso A1 and zzso whose expression in different zzso is mutually zzso may fulfill a number of independent zzso functions in the zzso for instance, the unusual appearance of zzso in an zzso tissue was recently linked to the induction of zzso The structural background explaining the different functional performance of the highly zzso proteins is zzso Here, the main difference in the structural properties of these proteins was revealed to be the improved ability of A1 to zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso X-ray scattering zzso and zzso zzso Besides, the zzso zzso at different zzso zzso revealed the low resistance of the A1 protein to zzso zzso of the proteins by zzso dye zzso showed that the A1 zzso is more zzso than zzso As the different association properties, zzso and stability of the highly similar zzso zzso did not influence considerably their translation functions, at least in zzso we suggest this difference may indicate a structural background for zzso zzso zzso
