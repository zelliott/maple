zzso of zzso zzso is emerging as an important control mechanism for zzso gene zzso In this essay, we review the basis of the current view of the regulation of zzso in the human zzso gene and discuss similarities in zzso control among the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Based upon these similarities, we propose a model for control of expression of these genes at the zzso phase of zzso This model suggests that distinct promoter elements direct the assembly of zzso zzso II zzso complexes which differ in their zzso zzso
