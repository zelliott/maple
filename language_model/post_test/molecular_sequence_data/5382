zzso inhibitor 2 zzso folds zzso as a single domain zzso It has been shown that elements of native secondary structure do not significantly form in fragments as the 64 zzso protein is progressively increased in length from its N zzso until at least 60 zzso are zzso Here, we zzso peptides of increasing length from the C zzso and find that zzso structure is not present even in the largest, zzso zzso We have examined sets of peptides of the form (1 - zzso and zzso + zzso to detect zzso The only pair that readily zzso and gives zzso structure is zzso and zzso where zzso occurs in the zzso loop of zzso But, all the pairs of peptides (1 - zzso + zzso complement for zzso zzso 40, as do all pairs of zzso + zzso where zzso zzso zzso The zzso complexes appear to be equivalent to zzso zzso with the overlapping sequence being zzso Thus, the folding of zzso is extremely zzso and interactions have to be made between zzso zzso and zzso This is consistent with the mechanism proposed for the folding zzso of intact zzso in which a diffuse nucleus is formed in the transition state between the zzso in the zzso region of the protein and zzso zzso contacts in the zzso region of the zzso It is with these protein design features that zzso can be an effective zzso zzso
