zzso that reduce the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso DNA zzso prevent viral replication in resting cells, which contain low zzso zzso but not in rapidly dividing cells such as cancer cells, which contain high levels of zzso We therefore tested whether zzso in regions of the zzso type 5 zzso DNA zzso that interact with the zzso zzso or DNA template could alter virus zzso The majority of the zzso created, including conservative zzso were incompatible with virus zzso Five zzso zzso were recovered from zzso cells, but four of these zzso failed to replicate in zzso lung zzso cells and zzso normal lung zzso zzso zzso proteins from these viruses exhibited only a zzso to zzso reduction in their zzso zzso efficiency but nonetheless could not be zzso even when zzso zzso zzso were artificially raised by the addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The fifth zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso by the viral zzso by zzso The corresponding virus zzso to zzso levels in three different cancer cell lines but was significantly impaired in all normal cell lines in which it was zzso zzso replication and zzso cell killing were rescued by the addition of zzso zzso to normal lung zzso zzso zzso confirming the zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso these data provide zzso support for the notion that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be created by zzso the efficiency with which the viral DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso
