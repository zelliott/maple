The DNA sequence family zzso consists of repeated DNA sequences that occur dispersed in the zzso of zzso zzso Members of this DNA sequence family were recovered from two zzso DNA clone banks obtained by zzso of the two Y zzso zzso loop threads and zzso from primary zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of two of the zzso DNA clones revealed zzso to the DNA region coding for a reverse zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts of a size of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that at least parts of these transcripts are zzso in these Y zzso zzso zzso which were originally used for zzso Also the zzso of primary zzso contains zzso zzso zzso These observations are discussed in the context of zzso loop function and zzso
