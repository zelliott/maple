zzso zzso 2 zzso 2) is a key zzso in zzso taste signal zzso To analyze the taste system in zzso at molecular level, we cloned zzso 2 as a zzso fish zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso 2 is expressed in the lip and zzso region where zzso zzso are zzso zzso detection of nerve fibers near the zzso 2 positive cells suggests the characteristic of peripheral sensory zzso These results suggest that zzso 2 is expressed in the zzso sensory cells of zzso This may provide a molecular basis for the taste reception at multiple zzso in fish zzso
