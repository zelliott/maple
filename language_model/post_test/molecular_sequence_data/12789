A zzso for zzso zzso was cloned by use of a synthetic zzso as zzso The probe was designed on the basis of the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and by complete zzso sequence of the zzso was zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso base pairs, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a putative signal sequence from the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso yielded a mature protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso identity to zzso fruit and bean zzso zzso zzso zzso plot analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence suggests that zzso zzso belongs to family E in terms of the zzso zzso domain, and zzso fruit and zzso bean zzso also belong to this zzso zzso markedly increased the level of the zzso zzso in cultured cells, while zzso zzso and zzso acid each zzso zzso of this zzso The transcript was also detected in the roots and stems of intact plants, although the level of zzso was much lower in intact zzso than in cultured zzso zzso Southern analysis indicated that a small family of gene for zzso exists in zzso
