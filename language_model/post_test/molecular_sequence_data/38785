zzso are being identified in an expanding number of zzso and zzso zzso These molecules consist of an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain, and are considered to function in storage or as sensors for zzso and in defense against zzso stress and/or zzso However, their zzso significance has not yet been zzso Here, we isolated and analyzed two zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which lie close to each other in the zzso zzso were induced by submerged conditions, and enriched in the sexually mature cells of zzso zzso Although they were not essential for growth or development under standard laboratory conditions, disruption of both genes caused an increase in number of large but zzso cells, and hypersensitivity to higher zzso of zzso and to NO zzso These results indicate that zzso are responsible for zzso NO signals to maintain normal cellular conditions against environmental zzso
