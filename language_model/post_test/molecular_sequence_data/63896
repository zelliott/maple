The molecular structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso formerly known as zzso B, was solved by multiple zzso replacement phasing methods and refined to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso In addition to the structure of the zzso zzso the structure of a product complex of zzso zzso II bound in the active site of the zzso was also zzso We propose the name zzso zzso B zzso for this zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso identified at the active site, we suggest the name zzso for the zzso zzso The previously zzso zzso fold is that of a zzso each sheet has seven zzso zzso A zzso product, zzso bound in the active site of zzso has allowed for identification of the zzso zzso and the zzso in zzso S1, zzso and zzso which are important for zzso zzso The most likely zzso mechanism involves zzso attack of a general base zzso water zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso atom to form a zzso zzso zzso assistance and zzso stabilization is provided by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso nitrogen is accomplished by the general acid function of the zzso zzso group of zzso
