A total of 59 bacteria samples from Antarctic sea water were collected and screened for their ability to produce zzso The highest activity was recorded from an isolate identified as an zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows a molecular mass of about 50,000 Da and a zzso of zzso The zzso is stable from pH zzso to 9 and has a zzso activity at pH zzso Compared with other zzso from zzso and zzso the zzso zzso displays a higher activity at low temperature and a lower stability at high zzso The zzso zzso requires both zzso and zzso for its zzso zzso zzso is also quite efficient as an zzso zzso The comparison of the zzso acid composition with those of other zzso from various organisms shows that the cold zzso has the lowest content in zzso and Pro zzso This could be involved in the principle used by the zzso zzso to adapt its molecular structure to the low temperature of the zzso
