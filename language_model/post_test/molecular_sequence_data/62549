zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most successful biological zzso In this study, we cloned and zzso a zzso zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso of the zzso isolate zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso We compared this highly zzso region with that of other zzso zzso contained two zzso zzso and zzso in common with zzso zzso zzso zzso that were not present in other zzso The zzso gene has zzso to a zzso 3' repair zzso and appears to have been acquired from an zzso zzso The zzso gene product has the potential to be involved in virus zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from other group I zzso in that zzso and zzso gene zzso were missing from the region downstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic zzso suggest the zzso gene is absent from zzso
