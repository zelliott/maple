Two highly zzso avian influenza zzso virus clones that met the criteria for zzso avian influenza zzso by possessing a zzso zzso zzso zzso site, were isolated from an H5N1 outbreak in Norfolk, England, in zzso These two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed differences in zzso as determined by intravenous zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequencing of these two zzso identified 10 zzso acid differences throughout the zzso three in zzso and zzso B2 zzso and two in zzso B1 zzso and single zzso in zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso passages were performed in zzso or zzso specific pathogen free zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso from each bird passage displayed increases in zzso zzso index values (from 0 to zzso and therefore zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and DNA sequencing on viruses isolated at each passage displayed nine out of the 10 zzso associated with the higher zzso zzso of zzso except for the zzso found in zzso which retained the zzso acid zzso associated with zzso zzso passage through zzso SPF zzso chicken eggs and serial intravenous passage in zzso birds could not reproduce these zzso These results further highlight that zzso changes in the zzso other than at the zzso zzso site can zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
