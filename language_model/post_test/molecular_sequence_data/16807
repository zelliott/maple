zzso zzso acid zzso zzso has shown very high zzso specificity compared with similar zzso acid zzso zzso found in zzso zzso The zzso zzso also zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso a very high zzso zzso reaction zzso and a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso These two characteristics indicate that there are fundamental differences in the zzso activity between this bacterial zzso and the zzso zzso By employing a computer simulation approach, a zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to structurally match zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso in all related sequences of bacteria and zzso Point zzso experiments of this zzso to seven different zzso acids resulted in complete elimination of zzso zzso However, point zzso on the neighboring zzso to eight other zzso resulted in reduction, to various degrees, of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso for zzso also showed that this zzso influenced the minor activity of the zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results show the value and potential of structural modeling for predicting target zzso for further study and for directing zzso of zzso structure and zzso
