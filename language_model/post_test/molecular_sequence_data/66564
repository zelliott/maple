The zzso and zzso viruses are highly zzso zzso that recently emerged from flying zzso to cause serious disease outbreaks in humans and livestock in Australia, zzso Singapore and zzso Their unique genetic zzso high zzso and wide host range set them apart from other zzso These characteristics have led to their zzso into the new zzso zzso within the family zzso and to their designation as zzso Level 4 zzso The fusion zzso an enveloped zzso essential for viral entry, belongs to the family of class I fusion proteins and is characterized by the presence of two zzso repeat zzso regions, zzso and zzso These two regions associate to form a zzso hairpin zzso that juxtaposes the viral and cellular zzso to facilitate membrane fusion and enable subsequent viral zzso The zzso and zzso virus fusion core proteins were zzso and their structures determined to zzso A zzso The zzso and zzso fusion core structures are zzso zzso with three zzso zzso packed against the zzso grooves on the surface of a central coiled zzso formed by three parallel zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso Because of the high level of conservation in core regions, it is proposed that the zzso and zzso virus fusion zzso can provide a model for membrane fusion in all zzso The relatively deep grooves on the surface of the central coiled zzso represent a good target site for drug discovery strategies aimed at zzso viral entry by blocking hairpin zzso
