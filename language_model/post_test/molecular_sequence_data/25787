Previous analyses of the nuclear zzso of zzso cells have revealed three major protein components zzso A, B and zzso that have been identified by protein sequence zzso as members of the intermediate filament zzso protein zzso It has been claimed that zzso cells contain either all three zzso or zzso B zzso Using zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso cloning we identified a second major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus showing that zzso composition in zzso is more complex than previously zzso zzso B2 is zzso with zzso B1 (formerly termed zzso zzso in all zzso cells and zzso species that we zzso including a variety of cells currently believed to contain only a single zzso This suggests that two zzso zzso are necessary to form a functional zzso in zzso zzso zzso By zzso cloning we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression during zzso of zzso and zzso shows striking zzso The first zzso expressed in the early zzso are the two zzso zzso while zzso zzso are only detected much later in zzso These findings indicate that the zzso differentiation into two zzso zzso occurred early in zzso evolution and has been maintained in both their primary structure and pattern of zzso
