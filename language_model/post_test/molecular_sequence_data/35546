zzso are the most damaging zzso of many agricultural and zzso zzso there is an urgent need to develop effective zzso against these zzso zzso of zzso toxicity zzso an opportunity to improve currently available commercial products into more effective control agents against diverse zzso A zzso zzso DNA fragment, zzso amplified from native zzso of zzso using zzso gene specific zzso was cloned in expression zzso zzso and then used for transformation of zzso coli zzso zzso The sequence of the cloned crystal protein gene showed almost complete zzso with a zzso active zzso toxin gene with 117 zzso scattered in different domain regions zzso a protein of 645 zzso acid zzso in zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso analysis could be compulsive for zzso zzso zzso zzso allowing them to be grouped with related zzso zzso The toxicity of zzso protein was determined against zzso zzso zzso Marshall zzso zzso zzso zzso Genes coding for zzso active zzso proteins have been isolated and their efficient expression will provide the tools necessary to increase the efficacy of zzso zzso against economically important zzso
