zzso activity is important in bacterial zzso and could contribute to the zzso role of zzso zzso by degradation of the gastric zzso and in maintaining long-term zzso Our aim was to determine the degree of variation in the zzso A gene zzso of zzso zzso from different geographic locations, and to investigate links between zzso zzso and clinical disease severity, as well as with variation in zzso status and zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis with zzso and zzso was used to study 124 zzso from 10 countries that included the two zzso strains zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was amplified with a frequency of zzso The presence of zzso was confirmed in the other strains using an alternative forward zzso zzso were distinguished by zzso analysis with 10 zzso and four zzso restriction patterns that combined to give 25 distinct zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain zzso was most common zzso in the UK but similar strains came from several other zzso zzso was evident in zzso sequences of strains representing different zzso types, and five zzso strains each had a distinct zzso sequence zzso zzso variation was independent of gastric disease severity as well as strain zzso status and zzso zzso with the exception of eight geographically diverse strains all with the zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly from zzso zzso zzso The study indicated a spectrum of zzso zzso and was supportive of a zzso function in zzso zzso zzso and persistence rather than in zzso of zzso
