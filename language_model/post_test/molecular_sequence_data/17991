zzso zzso is a new, stable alpha chain zzso that was detected in two members of a Caucasian family living in zzso zzso data were within normal zzso It is characterized by an zzso replacement at position alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso of the large alpha zzso zzso separation of the resulting fragments by reversed phase high performance liquid zzso and sequence analysis of a few of these peptides greatly facilitated the identification of this zzso
