Human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection is associated with elevated levels of inflammatory zzso in the serum and zzso fluid of infected zzso but the sources of these proteins as well as the specific stimuli which trigger their production and release have not been fully zzso In this study, we evaluated the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso clones derived from zzso persons to release gamma zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso upon contact with target cells presenting viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones as well as freshly isolated peripheral blood zzso cells from infected persons were tested in parallel for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Target cells consisted of zzso and zzso zzso cell lines zzso with synthetic zzso peptides containing the zzso recognized by these zzso zzso production was measured by specific zzso zzso zzso of culture zzso zzso zzso zzso clones directed at zzso zzso reverse zzso and zzso zzso specifically released zzso zzso and zzso upon contact with their relevant target zzso but not following contact with irrelevant zzso These zzso were released in an zzso class zzso fashion, and release was zzso as early as 4 to 6 h of incubation and remained elevated at 48 zzso Fresh peripheral blood zzso cells from a zzso person likewise released zzso in an zzso and zzso class zzso manner when incubated with target cells presenting a zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity of these zzso These studies indicate that in addition to zzso direct zzso zzso zzso may affect other immune responses by releasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels of these zzso which have been detected in serum and zzso fluid of infected persons may be due at least in part to the persistent zzso zzso zzso
