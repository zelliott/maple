Plant growth under low zzso availability or salt stress requires tight control of zzso and zzso zzso long-distance zzso and zzso The family of membrane zzso named zzso (for zzso zzso zzso permeable either to zzso and zzso or to zzso only, is thought to play major roles in these zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso possesses a single zzso zzso involved in zzso transport in vascular zzso a larger number of zzso zzso are present in rice zzso zzso as well as in other zzso Here, we report on the expression patterns and functional properties of three rice zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso experiments revealed overlapping but distinctive and complex expression patterns, wider than expected for such a zzso type, including vascular zzso and root periphery but also new locations, such as zzso leaf zzso cells zzso in leaf zzso zzso analyses in zzso zzso zzso revealed striking zzso zzso and zzso shown to be permeable to zzso only, are strongly different in terms of affinity for this zzso and direction of transport zzso only or zzso zzso displays diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or inhibited states, depending on external zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso concentration zzso The whole set of data indicates that zzso zzso fulfill distinctive roles at the whole plant level in rice, each system playing diverse roles in different cell zzso Such a large diversity within the zzso zzso family might be central to the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
