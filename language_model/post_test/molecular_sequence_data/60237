zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso has long been regarded as essential for initiation of protein synthesis in zzso Here, we show that this process is, in fact, zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso resulted only in a moderate decrease in the rate of cell growth, whereas in zzso coli cell growth was severely zzso The ability of the zzso zzso zzso strain to grow was not due to an additional copy of the zzso zzso gene or to zzso of the zzso zzso by a group other than zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso can carry out zzso initiation of protein zzso using the zzso zzso zzso the dogma that zzso require zzso of the zzso zzso for initiation of protein synthesis may have been an invalid zzso of results obtained with zzso zzso
