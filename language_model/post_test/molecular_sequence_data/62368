In this study, we demonstrate the versatility of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso protein profiling for the species differentiation of a diverse suite of zzso zzso zzso protein profiles of 11 different strains of zzso spores, encompassing nine different species, were zzso zzso species selected for zzso analysis represented the zzso bacterial diversity of typical class zzso clean room spacecraft assembly zzso A zzso sample treatment and zzso preparation were used to minimize the sample preparation zzso A library of zzso zzso was created from these nine zzso species, the most diverse protein profiling study of the zzso reported to zzso Linear correlation analysis was used to successfully differentiate the zzso protein profiles from all strains evaluated in this zzso The zzso protein profiles were compared with zzso zzso sequences for their bacterial zzso and molecular zzso zzso The zzso profiles were found to be complementary to the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso were pursued to identify proteins represented by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Four small, zzso proteins zzso B, C, and zzso one DNA binding zzso hypothetical protein zzso J, and four proteins associated with the spore coat and spore coat formation zzso zzso coat zzso coat zzso and zzso were zzso The ability to zzso zzso coat proteins (10 to 25 zzso as well as smaller proteins zzso zzso with zzso profiling is critical for the complete and effective species differentiation of the zzso zzso
