The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulates various cellular zzso including gene zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key player in this pathway, zzso the activities of several zzso and nuclear proteins via zzso Here we report the characterization of the zzso protein zzso A zzso as a zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso on zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso signaling with zzso or zzso of zzso to Ala on zzso prevents zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso on zzso is significantly enhanced by the expression of zzso zzso and antagonized by zzso zzso or specific reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration of human melanoma cells is significantly reduced by zzso zzso Together, these data provide substantial evidence that zzso zzso zzso on zzso in zzso Given that zzso of zzso on zzso is required for zzso membrane zzso our results suggest a novel role for zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso
