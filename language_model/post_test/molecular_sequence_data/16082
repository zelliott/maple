zzso zzso of zzso coli cells, a zzso protein of 2 zzso 85 zzso is distinguished by the property of containing a stable organic free radical zzso zzso zzso in its resting zzso The zzso zzso achieves zzso conversion to zzso via two distinct zzso zzso + zzso in equilibrium zzso + zzso zzso + zzso in equilibrium zzso + zzso the first of which has been proposed to involve zzso zzso zzso bond zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 81, zzso Present studies identified zzso as the zzso zzso zzso via zzso fragmentation of zzso and zzso of the isolated zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of the zzso analogue zzso with zzso was investigated and found to produce zzso with a zzso linkage to the adjacent zzso The structure was determined from the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso 44 zzso and by chemical zzso through degradation into zzso with zzso or zzso This novel zzso synthesis involves the zzso free radical and is proposed to resemble the zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso from zzso and zzso These findings are interpreted as proof of a radical mechanism for the action of zzso zzso The central zzso pair of the active site shows a distinctive zzso property even in the inactive zzso form of the zzso as determined using an zzso zzso
