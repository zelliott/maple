zzso is a recently discovered zzso zzso 3 zzso protein that is a major in zzso binding partner for zzso To further characterize zzso we generated an zzso zzso zzso is enriched in the brain, and zzso analysis reveals a high concentration of the protein in synaptic zzso where it zzso with zzso In zzso binding zzso demonstrate that zzso binds through its zzso zzso 3 domain to zzso and zzso analysis with the zzso zzso reveals that zzso is zzso associated with zzso in the nerve zzso zzso with an zzso against zzso I and II, which interact through their zzso zzso 3 zzso with zzso and zzso at sites distinct from those for zzso reveals a second stable complex, which includes zzso and zzso but excludes zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is present in two separate complexes in the nerve terminal and support an important role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
