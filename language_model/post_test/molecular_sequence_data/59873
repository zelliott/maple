By a number of criteria, we have demonstrated that the translation termination factor zzso zzso release factor 1) associates with protein zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso was zzso from rabbit skeletal muscle using an affinity zzso zzso In addition to the 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso and established regulatory zzso of 65 zzso zzso and 55 zzso zzso zzso preparations contained two proteins with apparent Mrs of 54 and 55 zzso zzso zzso revealed that the 55 zzso component is a novel zzso whereas the 54 zzso protein was identified as zzso a protein that functions in zzso termination as a zzso chain release zzso Using the zzso zzso system, human zzso was shown to interact specifically with zzso but not with the zzso or zzso zzso By deletion analysis, the binding zzso were found to be located within the 50 zzso zzso acids of zzso and between zzso acid zzso 338 and zzso in the zzso part of human zzso This association also occurs in zzso since zzso can be zzso with zzso from zzso zzso We observed a significant increase in the amount of zzso associated with the zzso when zzso was zzso expressed in zzso cells, and zzso zzso from those zzso contained associated zzso Since we did not observe any dramatic effects of zzso on the zzso chain release activity of zzso (or vice zzso we zzso that zzso also functions to recruit zzso into zzso thus bringing the zzso into contact with putative targets among the components of the zzso zzso
