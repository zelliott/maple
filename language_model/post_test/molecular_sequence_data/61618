In zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain is located in the middle of the sequence which folds into the zzso zzso zzso The N domain of zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, is zzso zzso identical with the N domain of zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso involved in binding of zzso are found in zzso However, the sequence zzso in the N domain of zzso resembles the motif zzso which forms part of the zzso site in protein zzso This motif is also found in Wilson disease protein where several disease zzso cluster in zzso In the present work, we have made a set of disease zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso At low zzso these zzso zzso are poorly zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso can, however, be partially zzso or fully zzso compensated for by using a higher zzso suggesting that these zzso lower the affinity for zzso In all three zzso zzso zzso by zzso has become less sensitive to the presence of zzso also consistent with the proposal that the zzso motif plays a role in zzso zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we have zzso the N domain of zzso using the zzso zzso zzso structure as a zzso In the model, the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso and zzso are located in the proximity of the zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso data and the molecular model are consistent with the idea that the two zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a role in zzso binding and zzso
