Human zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is restricted in diversity in the individual and the population with a limited number of variable region genes zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso shows restricted zzso focusing gel patterns and light chain usage with frequent restriction to use of only zzso light zzso Shared zzso zzso are expressed on zzso The heavy chain of zzso to the zzso zzso is predominantly zzso by two members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso based on complete identity in zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the suggestion of zzso in this region, and zzso based on zzso zzso usage in unrelated individuals, may be important for zzso zzso Six or more different zzso gene families zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the majority of individuals uses the zzso zzso II gene in zzso or near zzso zzso which encodes an zzso designated zzso zzso can also be zzso by V zzso I, zzso V zzso II, V zzso III, V zzso IV, V zzso II, and V zzso zzso zzso Although different zzso genes can be used, unrelated individuals appear to use the same V zzso III zzso V zzso II zzso zzso zzso and V zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso diversity accounts for differences in fine binding zzso with zzso zzso II genes not zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and V zzso zzso genes and some of the zzso V zzso genes zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso light chains and the zzso in zzso of zzso sequences and in zzso of zzso zzso sequences of zzso appear to be important zzso for zzso zzso A relatively limited degree of zzso zzso has occurred in the zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Further studies comparing the zzso of zzso V genes to zzso V genes are needed to clarify this zzso Research comparing this repertoire to zzso directed to other bacterial zzso and to self zzso and defining zzso binding relationships is in zzso
