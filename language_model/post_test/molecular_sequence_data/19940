zzso structure of the first zzso zzso zzso 3 domain of human zzso zzso was determined using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso method and revealed that it was a zzso zzso domain, which has a typical zzso zzso Using chemical shift zzso and surface zzso resonance experiments, we studied the binding properties of the zzso domain with two different peptides from zzso hinge zzso zzso and zzso The observations illustrated slightly different affinities of the two peptides binding to zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso belonged to intermediate exchange with a modest binding zzso while the interaction between zzso and zzso had a low binding zzso The structure and zzso interface of zzso provide a structural basis for the further functional study of this important zzso
