zzso membrane fusion is zzso by the formation of a zzso bundle comprised of zzso zzso Every cell expresses a large number of zzso proteins that are localized to particular membrane zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso trafficking might in part be determined by specific zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso pairing in zzso suggests that the information for membrane compartment organization is not zzso in the inherent ability of zzso to form zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso from zzso cells is only inhibited or rescued by specific zzso The data suggest that zzso pairing does zzso zzso trafficking zzso and that specific zzso interactions with other proteins may facilitate the correct zzso
