zzso of zzso organisms contain populations of DNA molecules that are packed into zzso structures called zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso of zzso DNA zzso into zzso is zzso primarily by the zzso group zzso zzso protein zzso which is an important player in stabilization and metabolism of zzso Although it is evident that analogous proteins must exist in other zzso species, an apparently fast divergence rate has precluded their zzso characterization and comparative zzso Using in zzso analysis of the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we predicted that the zzso zzso assigned as zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso which contains two zzso boxes, zzso contains only one zzso zzso zzso In addition, it contains one putative zzso domain with a potential role in protein zzso Fluorescence zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso revealed its zzso zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and native zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso properties indicate that zzso is, similarly to zzso a zzso zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso we constructed strains lacking one functional zzso of the zzso gene and carrying one zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso Under zzso conditions this strain exhibited a more than zzso decrease in levels of zzso zzso which was correlated with a substantial decrease in the number of zzso copies as well as zzso zzso The dramatic effect of reduced levels of zzso on zzso metabolism indicates that the protein is involved in essential molecular transactions that relate to the zzso zzso
