The zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are both known to zzso the European zzso zzso zzso zzso disease has a global distribution and is responsible for considerable economic losses among zzso In this study, 336 zzso samples from 18 different zzso in Japan were examined for the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a zzso zzso Although zzso zzso was not detected in most of the zzso surveyed, the zzso was detected at three of the sites zzso Further, zzso zzso appears to be zzso distributed across Japan and no apparent geographic difference was observed among the areas zzso In addition, the apparent absence of zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso may be zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed the possible existence of two zzso zzso groups from different geographic regions in zzso It seems likely that these zzso zzso were introduced into Japan through the zzso of either contaminated zzso products or infected zzso This study confirmed that zzso detection is effective for indicating the presence of this pathogen in seemingly healthy zzso It is therefore hoped that the results presented here will improve our understanding of the epidemiology of zzso disease so that effective controls can be zzso
