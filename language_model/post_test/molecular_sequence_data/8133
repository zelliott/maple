The mouse protein zzso has a central Ras zzso zzso exchange domain, and a long zzso zzso tail which contains several potential binding sites for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso growth factor stimulation results in the recruitment of zzso into complexes with activated receptors and zzso zzso such as zzso which are apparently involved in Ras zzso and subsequently to an increase in zzso zzso on zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso contain several potential sites for zzso by zzso protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso the zzso tail of zzso Comparative zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso and of zzso zzso from zzso cells, revealed several zzso in zzso These common zzso sites have been mapped to a region encompassing the first three zzso zzso motifs in the tail of zzso Furthermore, a region of zzso containing the first two zzso motifs could associate with zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso of zzso did not affect binding of zzso to zzso but appeared to decrease binding of the zzso complex to zzso and the zzso These findings suggest a potential zzso role for zzso in attenuating zzso exchange on zzso by zzso zzso from zzso zzso complexes that lead to Ras zzso
