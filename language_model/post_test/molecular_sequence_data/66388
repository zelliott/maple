zzso exhibits biological activity as zzso zzso Key step in vitamin A formation is the zzso of zzso to retinal by an zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso Recently, it is reported that expression of zzso gene in the zzso is under feedback regulation by zzso acid zzso However, the regulation of zzso gene expression in various other zzso is still zzso 

In the present study, we identified the full-length zzso zzso the rat zzso gene and investigated the regulation of its expression in several zzso by zzso in the presence of vitamin A zzso 

We cloned the full-length zzso zzso zzso gene from a rat zzso zzso library by zzso zzso The zzso gene expression was examined using Northern zzso and reverse zzso zzso We also investigated whether zzso gene expression was regulated by zzso in several zzso of vitamin zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of this clone revealed an open reading frame of zzso bases zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso human, and chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in the zzso and liver, while there was weak expression in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that rat zzso is a zzso zzso zzso gene expression was increased in the small zzso by vitamin A zzso compared with that in rats on a control diet, while this zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in the lungs and zzso was also suppressed by zzso or zzso zzso in rats with vitamin A zzso However, zzso zzso gene expression was only decreased by zzso and zzso expression was not affected by either zzso As the small zzso is the major site of zzso conversion, zzso zzso gene expression may be more tightly zzso 

These data suggest that zzso gene expression in several zzso may be zzso by zzso at the level of conversion of zzso to zzso To prevent an excess of retinol, zzso may occur at the level of conversion of zzso to retinal in several zzso
