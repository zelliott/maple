zzso ensures genetic diversification of zzso and sexual zzso For successful zzso multiple events such as DNA zzso zzso and zzso segregation must occur zzso in a strict regulated zzso We investigated the zzso roles of zzso zzso in the initiation of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso by zzso and other zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso reveals that zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso I zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso region of zzso a zzso ancillary protein required for zzso formation and zzso by zzso zzso zzso contains two types of zzso zzso sites near the zzso site zzso One zzso is essential for zzso zzso formation, and the others exhibit a cumulative effect to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso on these sites zzso severe defects in zzso formation even when the zzso zzso is present at zzso zzso of zzso display defects in the zzso binding of not only zzso but also zzso and zzso other zzso zzso that may assist zzso binding to zzso hot zzso We thus propose that zzso in concert with zzso regulates zzso loading to zzso sites via zzso zzso
