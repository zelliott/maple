The aim of the present study was the characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and the analysis of its zzso zzso Two zzso with considerable sequence identity were found zzso and zzso From zzso zzso transcript zzso with different untranslated first zzso but identical coding regions could be zzso zzso transcripts were not zzso In the sheep brain and zzso zzso cells transcript zzso starting with the untranslated zzso zzso and 2, respectively, were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which had been described in zzso could not be detected in sheep and the major zzso untranslated region of the bovine zzso transcript, zzso zzso was also not found to predominate in the sheep zzso However this zzso frequently was combined with a new untranslated zzso zzso zzso thus generating an alternative zzso zzso The main zzso transcripts in sheep had a different first zzso zzso zzso Two alternatively spliced zzso of this transcript were found with zzso zzso From the present data it can be zzso zzso that the zzso zzso contains two copies of zzso of which only one is transcribed and may zzso a functional zzso and zzso that in spite of being closely related species, sheep and cattle have remarkable differences concerning zzso transcript distribution and zzso promoter zzso
