The zzso zzso is involved in multiple aspects of zzso cancer, including tumor zzso and zzso which makes the zzso a key target for the development of zzso zzso We report here on the production, the characterization and the in zzso zzso and zzso properties of a novel zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso library made with zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso form of zzso displayed an zzso motif and zzso with zzso zzso zzso in surface zzso resonance studies, in a zzso and zzso sensitive zzso A three-dimensional molecular model of zzso in complex with zzso predicted a large surface of contacts with the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso melanoma cell line zzso to zzso zzso zzso 555 zzso and 225 zzso respectively), and zzso inhibited their proliferation without direct cell zzso but did not affect the binding nor the proliferation of a human breast zzso cell line zzso not expressing zzso In zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in a zzso plug zzso in zzso nude mice zzso zzso 83 zzso When injected zzso to zzso mice together with zzso melanoma cells, zzso zzso and zzso inhibited lung zzso monitored by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a potent new inhibitor of zzso adherence mechanisms involved in zzso and tumor zzso zzso
