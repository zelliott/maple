Recently it was shown that putative zzso zzso zzso does not code for an zzso of the zzso C zzso but for one of the zzso proteins zzso zzso We have isolated human zzso zzso from human zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso has two zzso motifs completely zzso among the zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso protein contained a zzso zzso activity which was completely abolished when zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso in both of the two zzso Furthermore, we have identified a soluble form of zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso of normal rat kidney cells, the expression level of zzso was elevated at the protein zzso In zzso cells transformed with zzso activated zzso zzso or zzso the expression level of zzso was zzso in proportion to their transforming zzso These results indicate that a soluble form of zzso exists and that this protein may control both zzso and zzso zzso activities through its zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it is likely that zzso is involved in the zzso zzso
