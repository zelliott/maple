Single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso or their target sites zzso within the zzso of zzso are increasingly thought to play a major role in pathological zzso of gene zzso Here, we studied the functional role of zzso on zzso zzso regulation of gene zzso First, analyses were performed on a zzso located in the zzso target site within the zzso of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso Second, a zzso in the zzso of the muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso was studied which is located outside of binding sites of zzso and zzso Using these zzso we investigated their effects on local zzso structure, on local structural accessibility and on functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso folding analyses of the zzso zzso in either case predicted significant changes of local zzso structure in the vicinity of the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso experimental in zzso probing of zzso showing differential zzso patterns and reporter zzso zzso indicated functional differences of zzso regulation of the two zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we describe a novel model explaining the functional influence of zzso zzso on zzso control of gene expression via zzso changes of local zzso structure in zzso regions of zzso This concept substantially extends the meaning of zzso zzso identified in non zzso transcribed sequences within or close to zzso binding zzso
