zzso gamma chain has previously been shown to interact with the zzso complex, the zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso and the class I and zzso zzso receptors zzso gamma zzso and zzso gamma zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso gamma chain associates with zzso alpha R in zzso zzso B zzso zzso alpha R could be expressed at the surface of zzso B cells by itself, but was devoid of signaling zzso Upon zzso of zzso gamma chain, a physical interaction with zzso alpha R could be zzso This association proved crucial for the triggering of both zzso zzso calcium increase and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso We next tested the hypothesis that a positively charged zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain of zzso alpha R promotes association with zzso gamma zzso We therefore constructed zzso alpha R molecules where zzso was zzso to either a positively charged zzso a zzso charged zzso acid, or an zzso zzso A functional association between zzso alpha R and zzso gamma chain was observed only with a positively charged zzso zzso or zzso present within the zzso alpha R zzso zzso These data show that zzso signal zzso by the zzso alpha R is zzso via zzso gamma chain, and that zzso alpha R requires a positively charged zzso within the zzso domain to promote functional zzso
