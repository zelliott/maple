A zzso possessing a zzso permissible structural zzso in and adjacent to the zzso III zzso binding site has been isolated from zzso zzso zzso bovine lung zzso by using strong zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso On the basis of two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso experiments, including zzso correlated zzso zzso and rotating frame nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso zzso the primary structure of this zzso was zzso established as delta zzso zzso zzso (where delta zzso represents zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso experiment proved to be particularly valuable in offering sequence zzso zzso from a variety of species and tissue sources were examined by zzso mapping using zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso Two of these zzso are used as zzso they are zzso zzso zzso zzso and bovine lung zzso The zzso zzso site in zzso zzso contained an zzso zzso zzso We now report the structure of the zzso zzso site in bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study shows the presence of one or both types of zzso zzso in all of the zzso that were zzso
