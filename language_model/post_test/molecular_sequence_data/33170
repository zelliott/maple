A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a marine fish zzso zzso zzso zzso with radiation as a selective zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso exhibited highest similarity zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and strain zzso was zzso degrees C, indicating that the novel strain was distinct from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso respiratory zzso was zzso zzso zzso could grow at zzso degrees zzso the optimum temperature for growth was 35 degrees zzso The strain grew well at pH 6-9, with optimum growth at pH zzso The cell wall contained zzso The major fatty acids were 16 : 0, 16 : zzso 16 : zzso and 18 : zzso Three zzso and one zzso were the major polar zzso Based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso was significantly different from zzso zzso zzso zzso and, therefore, it was identified as representing a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
