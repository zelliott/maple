The identification of zzso (both molecules and zzso in patient zzso offers enormous interest for the diagnosis of zzso In this context, the detection of zzso to tumor cell zzso zzso possesses great zzso The zzso immune response represents a form of biological amplification of signals that are otherwise weak because of very low zzso of zzso especially in the early stages of zzso zzso we present the use of integral zzso spotted with zzso proteins to investigate the zzso repertoire in the zzso of lung cancer patients and zzso The use of two-dimensional liquid zzso allowed us to separate proteins from the lung zzso cell line zzso into zzso zzso which were printed in zzso along with various controls, onto zzso coated zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso to detect singular zzso in zzso were first validated through the recognition of zzso containing a lung marker zzso by zzso zzso Twenty zzso were initially selected as highly zzso against the zzso zzso and subsequent mass zzso analyses confirmed the identity of zzso protein in four of zzso As a result, the importance of neighboring zzso in zzso detection was revealed due to the spreading of proteins during the separation zzso Next, the zzso were individually incubated with 14 serum samples from patients with lung cancer patients, 14 zzso from colon cancer patients, and 14 control zzso from normal zzso The zzso of the selected zzso was zzso and the level of zzso bound to each fraction by each serum sample was zzso Eight of the 20 zzso offered p values zzso zzso and were recognized by an average of four reacting patients, whereas no serum from normal individuals was positive for those zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso hold the diagnostic potential of uncovering zzso that induce an immune response in patients with certain types of zzso
