zzso family members of zzso proteins have been identified as important regulators of growth and development in the zzso zzso heart, zzso and zzso In addition, zzso expression has been detected in the zzso where it is vital for the final differentiation of zzso In our present paper, we have analyzed the zzso necessary for nuclear transport of zzso With the help of deletion zzso we identified two separate nuclear zzso signals zzso Interestingly, both zzso are situated in the zzso They belong to the zzso class of zzso the zzso zzso has the sequence zzso and lies at the very zzso of the zzso while the more zzso zzso zzso is at the zzso zzso Each zzso per zzso is sufficient for nuclear transport of zzso into the nucleus, although zzso Both identified zzso act zzso in zzso complete nuclear transport of zzso
