A member of the zzso calcium channel family was identified in mouse brain by taking advantage of zzso acid sequences that have been evolutionary zzso The identified sequence is similar to that of the recently cloned rat zzso zzso calcium channel, but there are differences in two insertions in the zzso connecting zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that its expression is strong in the zzso In zzso zzso revealed that, in mouse brain, the zzso zzso is found in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso calcium channel zzso zzso and zzso through the zzso channel expressed in zzso cells did not differ in terms of current density, zzso dependence of current zzso zzso and zzso and speed of recovery from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were significantly slower than those of zzso The expressed zzso channel has a relatively high sensitivity to zzso but is only slightly affected by zzso
