Alternative zzso and zzso are important mechanisms for creating the zzso diversity necessary for the nervous system to fulfill its specialized zzso The contribution of alternative zzso to zzso diversity in the nervous system has been well zzso whereas the role of alternative zzso in this process is less well zzso Since the zzso zzso protein is known to be an important regulator of zzso zzso we examined its expression in brain and other zzso 

We discovered several closely related zzso zzso of zzso - collectively called zzso - that could potentially contribute to zzso diversity in the nervous zzso The zzso zzso zzso are found predominantly in the brains of several zzso species including mice and zzso The major zzso zzso zzso is generated by inclusion of two alternate zzso zzso we call zzso zzso and zzso found between zzso 8 and 9 of the zzso zzso and contains an additional 147 zzso zzso 49 additional zzso zzso Some zzso of zzso contain only the first alternate zzso zzso zzso while other zzso contain both alternate zzso zzso and zzso In mice, the zzso form of zzso also contains a deletion of 78 zzso from zzso 9, although that zzso is not seen in any other species zzso including zzso zzso and zzso analyses of mouse nuclear extracts indicate that a protein corresponding to zzso is expressed in brain at approximately equal levels to zzso Since zzso zzso zzso family members were found in the brains of all zzso species examined (including zzso and zzso this suggests that zzso has an zzso zzso function in these zzso zzso was present in both zzso and zzso mice and in different regions of the nervous system, suggesting an important role for zzso in neural gene expression throughout zzso Finally, experiments in representative cell lines suggest that zzso is expressed in zzso but not zzso 

This is the first report of a family of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso protein that is expressed in a nervous zzso zzso We propose that zzso contributes to zzso diversity by regulating alternative zzso of neural zzso
