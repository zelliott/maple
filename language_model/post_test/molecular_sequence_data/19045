zzso zzso or foam cells are characterized by massive zzso zzso zzso zzso deposition containing mostly cholesterol zzso zzso derived from the zzso cleared from the zzso zzso zzso zzso from foam cells is considered to be zzso Because cholesterol is zzso as free cholesterol, zzso zzso in zzso may limit free cholesterol zzso Our objective was to identify proteins that regulate cholesterol trafficking through zzso 

In a zzso analysis of the zzso fraction of zzso zzso zzso we identified an zzso zzso protein with a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif and a predicted zzso fold, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which we named zzso zzso zzso zzso association with zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso was labeled with a probe specific for active zzso zzso zzso showed relatively weak in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, cholesterol zzso in intact cells supported a significant role of zzso in zzso zzso because zzso zzso and zzso decreased and increased, respectively, zzso cholesterol and zzso in human embryonic zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso impaired active zzso probe zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity, and cholesterol-lowering effect in cells, whereas this zzso still localized to the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso from zzso and, interestingly, zzso is highly expressed in zzso areas within mouse and human zzso zzso 

The data identify a candidate target to promote reverse cholesterol transport from zzso zzso
