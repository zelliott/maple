Since the recognition of zzso as essential components of the oceanic food zzso zzso have been acknowledged as zzso of most major zzso processes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been challenging, however, as most major zzso have never been cultured or have only been grown to low zzso in sea zzso Here we describe the zzso sequence of zzso zzso a member of the marine zzso zzso zzso 1), the relatives of which comprise approximately zzso of coastal and oceanic zzso zzso This first zzso sequence from any major zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso base zzso and zzso zzso base zzso Genome analysis indicates that this zzso relies upon a zzso strategy that uses zzso compounds zzso monoxide and zzso to supplement zzso zzso zzso also has genes advantageous for associations with zzso and suspended zzso including genes for zzso of zzso compounds, use of zzso from reducing zzso rapid growth and zzso zzso This zzso has a physiology distinct from that of marine zzso adding a new strategy to the recognized repertoire for coping with a zzso zzso
