zzso B virus zzso replicates by reverse zzso of an zzso zzso the zzso zzso The first step of zzso zzso replication is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso termed zzso into the core zzso which is preceded by recognition and binding of zzso DNA zzso to zzso The zzso zzso contains two identical zzso elements due to its terminal zzso one near the zzso end and another near the 3' zzso Despite the fact that both zzso elements have an identical zzso only the zzso zzso but not the 3' zzso is functional for zzso To understand the molecular nature of this position effect, we made a series of zzso zzso expression plasmids which contain the zzso element at various positions from the zzso end of the zzso Following zzso the zzso zzso in zzso core particles were measured by zzso protection zzso for zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso with zzso positioned up to 65 zzso from the zzso end were zzso whereas the zzso zzso with zzso positioned further downstream were zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso transcribed by zzso zzso zzso was not zzso zzso that the zzso cap structure is required for zzso of the zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso DNA zzso must somehow recognize the cap structure and/or its associated factors, as well as the zzso zzso for zzso to zzso
