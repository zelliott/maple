zzso zzso are expressed during early development in species of several zzso To understand zzso function in zzso zzso we studied the zzso system of zzso zzso a model zzso species in experimental zzso We first zzso and zzso the liver zzso from zzso zzso This zzso protein shares the main structural properties of known zzso zzso and is more closely related to avian than to fish or zzso zzso Using this zzso we designed zzso zzso to amplify and isolate a zzso clone from a zzso cell line zzso zzso This zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein that is zzso identical with the zzso zzso zzso cadmium, and copper zzso are very efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso liver and cell zzso
