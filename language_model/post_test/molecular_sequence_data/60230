A newly isolated zzso strain zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso which was directly enriched and isolated from a freshwater zzso in defined minimal medium containing zzso zzso zzso as the sole carbon and energy zzso The use of a zzso with a continuous zzso gas stream as a method of enrichment, followed by zzso in deep zzso tubes, resulted in a pure zzso Since the only zzso zzso by strain zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso this zzso is considered an zzso zzso zzso like most other zzso zzso zzso zzso differs from all other zzso zzso since it was isolated from a freshwater pond and requires zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso typical of the zzso zzso required by freshwater zzso for zzso zzso was zzso effectively only in a zzso culture in the presence of low hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to the zzso significantly decreased degradation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cultures indicated that transfer of the first zzso group during zzso degradation is a zzso zzso On the basis of its low level of zzso with the most closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso its position on the zzso tree, its zzso (which is different from that of members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its salt tolerance and optimum (which are characteristic of freshwater zzso we propose that strain zzso is a representative of a novel zzso This isolate was named zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso microscope revealed the presence of zzso which were zzso identical to zzso zzso as described in this zzso Considering its zzso properties, zzso zzso zzso is probably responsible for degradation of zzso and zzso in freshwater sediments in zzso Due to the zzso of the zzso conversion, zzso like strain zzso can also be involved in the formation of zzso through zzso of zzso This phenomenon, which previously has been shown to occur in zzso zzso of freshwater origin, might affect the zzso zzso and, consequently, the total flux of zzso and zzso in these zzso
