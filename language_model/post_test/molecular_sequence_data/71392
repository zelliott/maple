Ten transcripts zzso zzso to protein zzso of the zzso family have been isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso ice zzso zzso range in size from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso proteins whose zzso zzso are between zzso and zzso identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is tissue zzso Two zzso are present only in roots zzso and zzso three in young leaves zzso 8 and zzso two in old leaves zzso and zzso and two in zzso leaves zzso and zzso zzso is strongly expressed in roots and also in seeds, zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso is specific for leaf zzso and zzso is found in root and leaf zzso zzso is restricted to zzso zzso zzso is only present in mature zzso zzso (in roots and zzso zzso (in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso are induced by zzso stress and drought conditions with different zzso in different zzso but other zzso are zzso by zzso Cold stress (4 degrees zzso leads to a decline in zzso and zzso but low temperature provoked a long-term zzso increase in zzso levels in leaves and a transient increase (less than 24 zzso in zzso Four full-length transcripts have been zzso In each case, after zzso in zzso coli, the isolated proteins exhibited zzso zzso zzso protein zzso activity, although activity against zzso varied among different zzso zzso of tissue zzso and stress response specificity of zzso will facilitate functional studies of zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
