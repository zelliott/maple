Wild type and zzso zzso carriers zzso from zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli as inclusion bodies, zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso This zzso can function as coupled zzso zzso zzso and zzso net zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The basic kinetic properties of these three transport modes were zzso The kinetic properties closely resemble those of the zzso zzso from beef heart zzso A competitive inhibitor of zzso transport by the zzso zzso acid, was used to establish functional overlap between the the zzso transport modes and the induced zzso zzso Replacement zzso were used to relate the zzso switch from zzso to zzso to a specific zzso of the zzso There are only three zzso in the zzso zzso They are at positions 28, 134, and 300 and were replaced by zzso both individually and in zzso zzso 300 near the zzso loop and zzso zzso located within the third zzso segment are accessible to bulky zzso zzso from the zzso side, whereas zzso 28 within the first zzso segment is zzso None of the three zzso is relevant to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified to be the major target of bulky zzso zzso that lead to complete zzso of the zzso transport zzso The zzso conversion between coupled zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso depends on the presence of one single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso two zzso in the functionally active zzso The consequences of this result with respect to a functional model of the carrier protein are zzso
