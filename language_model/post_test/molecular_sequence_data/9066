zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that regulate zzso stability and protein expression by imperfect base pairing with the zzso region zzso of target zzso Many zzso have been documented to be zzso expressed in human zzso but the role of zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso remains poorly zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on zzso development and to explore its molecular mechanism in zzso zzso 

zzso quantitative zzso was applied to evaluate the expression level of zzso in zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso The invasion ability of zzso in zzso zzso cells was analyzed by zzso zzso after zzso or zzso zzso For the invasion mechanism analysis of zzso on zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to predict the possible target gene of zzso zzso activities zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to reveal that the predicted target genes of zzso were direct and zzso zzso interference technology was used to confirm that the invasion zzso of zzso was directly induced by zzso 

Our study showed that zzso was zzso in human zzso specimens compared to that in NC zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso invasion and this zzso effect on zzso cells could be restored by zzso knock zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was a direct and specific target of zzso The zzso effect on zzso cell invasion was zzso by zzso zzso of the translation of a zzso zzso 

zzso expressed zzso contributes to zzso cells invasion partly through directly zzso zzso protein expression in zzso This zzso signature offers a novel potential therapeutic strategy for zzso
