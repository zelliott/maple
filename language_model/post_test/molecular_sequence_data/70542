The zzso zzso zzso protein binds DNA through a basic region like those of zzso proteins and through a flexible zzso arm segment similar to those with which numerous zzso proteins bind to bases in the minor zzso A recent X-ray zzso structure suggests that the zzso zzso arm provides only zzso DNA zzso In this study, however, we demonstrate that this segment mediates recognition of an zzso element that is part of the preferred zzso binding site and thereby significantly increases the sequence specificity with which zzso binds zzso zzso experiments show that multiple zzso acid zzso within the arm are involved in zzso These zzso provide binding affinity through distinct but partially redundant interactions and enhance specificity by discriminating against alternate zzso The zzso element minor groove is important for binding of the arm, which appears to affect DNA zzso in this zzso This zzso effect does not seem to involve DNA bending, however, because the arm does not appear to affect a modest DNA bend that is induced by zzso The data illustrate an example of how a small, flexible protein segment can make an important contribution to DNA binding specificity through multiple interactions and zzso
