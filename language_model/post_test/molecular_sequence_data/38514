Major zzso complex zzso class I and class II molecules bind to and display zzso zzso acquired from pathogens that are recognized by zzso zzso and executing zzso immune zzso The two classes of zzso proteins have nearly identical zzso structures and were derived from a common zzso that probably existed not long before the emergence of the zzso zzso Class I and class II genes are genetically linked in zzso but are not zzso in zzso fish, a zzso zzso derived from the oldest zzso zzso examined to zzso zzso fish zzso skates, and zzso are in the oldest zzso of extant zzso zzso we have carried out segregation analyses in two families of nurse zzso and one family of the banded zzso that revealed a close linkage of class zzso and beta genes both with each other and with the classical class I zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the primordial zzso giving rise to classical class I and class II occurred in zzso and the close linkage between these two classes of genes has been maintained for at least 460 million years in representatives of most zzso zzso
