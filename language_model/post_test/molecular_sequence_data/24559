We previously determined the complete DNA sequence of the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso start sites of zzso were determined to be 41 zzso zzso 153 zzso zzso and 157 zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso of zzso by rapid amplification of zzso zzso Based on the locations of zzso and zzso a zzso promoter zzso was determined to be located in the open reading frame region of upstream zzso in addition to the zzso promoter zzso DNA zzso 6 (1999) zzso In the in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcribed zzso from zzso and zzso transcribed it from zzso and zzso In both cases, the level of zzso was higher at 42 degrees C than at 30 degrees zzso No transcript was detected when zzso or zzso was zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso recognize zzso promoter and zzso promoter, respectively, and also prove that the synthesis of zzso zzso is zzso upon heat zzso
