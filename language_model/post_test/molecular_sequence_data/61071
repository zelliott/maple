The first and second internal transcribed zzso sequences of 28 zzso species of horse zzso were zzso and specific zzso zzso were designed for some species based on the zzso zzso zzso these zzso a zzso approach was developed for the specific amplification of zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The method allowed the zzso amplification of zzso DNA derived from zzso samples and/or zzso demonstrating the potential of the approach for the diagnosis of zzso zzso The establishment of this zzso zzso also has implications for studying the biology and epidemiology of zzso zzso and zzso resistance using zzso egg count reduction zzso
