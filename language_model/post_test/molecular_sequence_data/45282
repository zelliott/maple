zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a child with zzso zzso fever in zzso zzso zzso produces variable major proteins zzso which undergo zzso zzso We previously reported zzso of the zzso zzso which is one of the zzso genes in strain zzso detected in zzso zzso In the current study, we zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein by affinity zzso and produced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was examined by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to comprise five regions zzso within the zzso primary zzso acid zzso zzso peptides spanning zzso of three of five regions, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reacted strongly with the zzso zzso and these zzso were identified as zzso In particular, the zzso domain zzso of this protein was zzso Further research based on our results will promote the development of a zzso vaccine for zzso zzso zzso
