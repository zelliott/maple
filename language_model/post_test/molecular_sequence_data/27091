zzso acquired resistance zzso is a plant immune response induced by local zzso pathogen zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso plants zzso with zzso of salicylic acid zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential and sufficient signal for zzso In a genetic screen to search for negative regulators of zzso gene expression and zzso we found a new zzso that is hypersensitive to zzso and exhibits enhanced induction of zzso genes and resistance against the virulent zzso zzso zzso zzso The enhanced pathogen resistance in the zzso is zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was identified by zzso zzso and it encodes a protein with high zzso to zzso Factor C zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso thus, the zzso was named zzso zzso zzso plants are smaller than zzso plants and have zzso leaves and zzso On the zzso of true leaves, there are fewer cells in zzso compared with the wild zzso Cell production rate is reduced in zzso zzso roots, indicating that the zzso zzso slows down cell zzso As zzso Factor C is involved in zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso assembly and zzso may play important roles in the negative control of zzso gene expression and zzso
