zzso were originally recognized as proteins contributing to the transparency of the zzso eye zzso zzso they have been found in many, but not all, members of the zzso zzso and zzso Most members of the diverse zzso family have four common structural and functional features: zzso a small zzso molecular mass between 12 and 43 zzso zzso the formation of large zzso zzso zzso the presence of a moderately zzso central region, the so-called zzso zzso and zzso molecular zzso zzso Since zzso are induced by a temperature zzso in many organisms, they are often referred to as small heat shock proteins zzso or, more accurately, zzso zzso are integrated into a highly flexible and synergistic zzso network evolved to secure protein quality control in the zzso Their zzso activity is limited to the binding of unfolding zzso in order to protect them from irreversible zzso zzso release and zzso of captured proteins into the native state requires close cooperation with other cellular zzso In addition, zzso seem to play an important role in membrane zzso The review compiles information on the zzso sequence zzso regulation, structure, and function of zzso with an emphasis on the microbial members of this zzso zzso
