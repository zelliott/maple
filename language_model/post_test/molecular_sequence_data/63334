The zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and skeletal zzso The molecular basis for this syndrome was recently identified as a zzso in a novel zzso protein termed the zzso syndrome zzso zzso Beyond human zzso descriptions, there are little data addressing the role of zzso during zzso and zzso zzso We zzso that zzso gene function is essential for zzso and zzso development in the zzso By zzso searching, we identified the zzso zzso zzso and then analyzed its expression by reverse zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso We found that the zzso gene is expressed zzso during zzso To study the function of zzso during development, we induced loss of gene function by zzso gene zzso The zzso induced a zzso zzso in the zzso altering the spatial relationship between zzso and zzso zzso We also noted zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso We conclude that zzso function is essential for normal zzso and zzso development in zzso These data provide novel insight into the role of the zzso gene and support using zzso as a model system to study zzso gene function and for evaluation of novel zzso
