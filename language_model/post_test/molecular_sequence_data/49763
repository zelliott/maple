We have cloned and characterized a single copy zzso zzso gene containing an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso exhibits zzso identity with two zzso zzso human zzso and an unnamed mouse zzso zzso sequences are also present in several zzso zzso and fish zzso but no zzso have been found in the completed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using a specific zzso we have localized zzso to zzso structures, namely zzso bodies, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also specifically recognized human zzso by zzso and stained zzso bodies and zzso of human zzso cells as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso open reading frame in zzso orientation in zzso resulted in zzso zzso cells, which suggests a role for this protein in ensuring proper cell zzso Thus, zzso could represent the founding members of a new class of highly zzso proteins that are associated with zzso zzso
