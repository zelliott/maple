zzso acids in three highly zzso segments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso have been proposed to participate in formation of the zzso binding zzso We have tested this hypothesis by investigating the properties of zzso with zzso to zzso acids within these zzso Most of the zzso were found to be defective in zzso transport zzso The inactive zzso could be separated into two classes on the basis of the zzso of zzso intermediate formation and zzso One group, zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed zzso zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso and with zzso zzso only in the absence of zzso indicating that both the high affinity zzso binding sites and the zzso binding sites were zzso In each of these zzso however, the zzso zzso intermediate zzso decayed to the zzso zzso intermediate very slowly, relative to the zzso zzso Thus the inability of these zzso to transport zzso was accounted for by an apparent block of the transport reaction at the zzso to zzso zzso zzso Another group, zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not form zzso zzso zzso from either zzso or zzso Although we have demonstrated an effect on zzso transport of zzso in each of the highly zzso regions predicted to be involved in zzso zzso we cannot yet define their roles in zzso zzso zzso
