In order to analyze the onset mechanism of experimental zzso zzso zzso two experimental models were zzso one was zzso induced by one injection of zzso bovine zzso zzso protein zzso with complete zzso zzso in Lewis zzso and the other was an zzso zzso zzso that occurred spontaneously in nude zzso mice at 4 weeks of age zzso by the zzso of rat embryonic zzso zzso nude zzso zzso develops when the zzso zzso in the regional zzso are zzso zzso begins when the T zzso recognizes the zzso for the zzso bound to a major zzso complex zzso zzso in the zzso cell by way of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso ten zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso were revealed to be sufficiently capable of zzso zzso for zzso and it was also shown that zzso acid positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso play important roles as the zzso or zzso in developing zzso On the other hand, two zzso acids of zzso zzso acid positions zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to be the zzso inducing zzso zzso in the zzso nude zzso A study of the variable region of the zzso with a residual zzso specific zzso line from the zzso nude mouse revealed that as many as zzso zzso the zzso zzso V beta 6 gene and that the zzso zzso complex was recognized by restricted zzso zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso were also found to play an important role as zzso in zzso of zzso in the zzso process of zzso zzso seemed to result from an immune reaction in the eye occurring when the T zzso arrives there, zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also found to be involved in the zzso process of inflammatory zzso our zzso examination revealed that zzso was present in the retinal zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso body zzso the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso Finally, the tolerance of zzso was discussed and it was zzso demonstrated that the absence of zzso zzso in human beings and certain experimental animals resulted from zzso zzso serving as a zzso we assumed that the breakdown of this zzso would induce zzso due to zzso dysfunction or zzso zzso zzso
