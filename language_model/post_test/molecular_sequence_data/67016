zzso are becoming increasingly aware that the interaction of animals, including humans, with their zzso bacterial partners is essential for zzso This growing awareness has been a driving force for the development of models for the study of beneficial zzso zzso In the zzso model, symbiotic zzso zzso induce dramatic zzso changes in the light organ of host zzso zzso over the first hours to days of their zzso We report here the creation of a juvenile zzso specific zzso zzso 

We generated zzso zzso libraries from the light organ of zzso zzso at zzso significant time points with and without colonization by zzso zzso Single pass 3' sequencing efforts generated zzso expressed sequence tags zzso of which zzso passed our quality criteria and were then clustered via the zzso program into zzso zzso zzso The zzso clones representing these zzso sequences were zzso from the zzso end of the zzso and zzso of these resulting sequences overlapped significantly with the associated 3' sequence to generate zzso zzso with an average sequence length of zzso zzso All sequences were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and Gene zzso zzso 

Both the number of zzso generated from each library and GO zzso are reflective of the activity state of the light organ during these early stages of zzso Future analyses of the sequences identified in these libraries promise to provide valuable information not only about pathways involved in colonization and early development of the zzso light organ, but also about pathways zzso in response to bacterial colonization across the animal zzso
