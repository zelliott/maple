We describe the zzso sequencing and expression of the 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso gene of zzso zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso total DNA constructed from zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso derived from a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso insert were zzso and found to contain an open reading frame of zzso zzso that zzso to a protein of 231 zzso acid zzso A search for zzso proteins was zzso No similarity was observed when comparing 3 zzso with known members of the zzso zzso zzso However a small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso with the zzso sequence of bacterial zzso zzso zzso
