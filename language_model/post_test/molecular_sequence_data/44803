zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso was inadequate for zzso as a labeled zzso The binding activity of labeled zzso to the zzso was markedly zzso To supplement this zzso and facilitate zzso we constructed two zzso zzso zzso (one zzso zzso was added at the zzso of zzso and zzso (six zzso zzso were further added at the zzso of zzso The zzso and zzso characteristics of these zzso derivatives were essentially the same to those of zzso These derivatives were useful not only as standards for zzso zzso zzso but also as labeled zzso for zzso These results clearly indicate that the zzso of these modified zzso to zzso zzso is almost equivalent to that of human brain zzso zzso and that even if the modified zzso are labeled, they retain their binding affinities to zzso in contrast to zzso
