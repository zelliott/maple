zzso of the neural cell zzso zzso zzso reduces the efficacy of zzso zzso binding and is regulated both during development and in regions undergoing zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso are two related zzso that catalyze the zzso of zzso We have isolated a zzso clone for the rat zzso of zzso and compared its zzso acid and zzso sequence to that of rat zzso This analysis revealed regions of high sequence similarity corresponding to the zzso zzso of the two zzso Other regions of lower similarity were used to generate specific zzso for in zzso zzso The distribution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso were analyzed at three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed abundantly throughout the nervous system at embryonic day 15 and zzso day 4 and were zzso in most zzso zzso In the adult brain, zzso expression was reduced relative to zzso and expression of both zzso was restricted to zzso of cells in areas undergoing constant synaptic zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that both zzso and zzso participate in the zzso of zzso in zzso and that their expression levels are zzso controlled during development and zzso
