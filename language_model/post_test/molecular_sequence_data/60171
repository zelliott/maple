zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and is involved in the synthesis of zzso which is an essential constituent of the zzso for normal cell zzso We zzso the zzso zzso zzso by an improved method including zzso zzso and studied the fine characteristics of the zzso zzso study of zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso with similar zzso and the zzso activities towards both zzso were competitively and zzso inhibited by zzso which is a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also showed a drastic descent of zzso activity zzso to the degradation of zzso at entry into the stationary phase of cell zzso
