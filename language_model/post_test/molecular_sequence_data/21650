zzso zzso zzso is one of the key components of the bacterial zzso It assembles into short filaments that lie just underneath the membrane and organize the cell wall synthesis zzso Here we show that zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso coli binds directly to cell zzso This function is essential for cell shape determination in zzso coli and is proposed to be a general property of many, if not all, zzso We demonstrate that membrane binding is zzso by a membrane zzso loop in zzso and by an zzso zzso zzso in zzso and show that zzso zzso assembles into double filaments on a membrane surface that can induce zzso This, the first example of a zzso zzso filament, zzso a fundamental rethink of the structure and dynamics of zzso filaments within zzso
