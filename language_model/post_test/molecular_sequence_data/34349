China faces an increasing prevalence of two zzso circulating zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso were previously demonstrated to originate in Yunnan and spread to zzso from Yunnan via injection drug use zzso in zzso zzso it is true, we are unable to answer why only zzso rather than both zzso together, was transmitted to zzso 

We investigated the zzso of zzso and zzso using multiple zzso zzso regions with zzso zzso zzso zzso reconstructions showed that all zzso sequences were divided into two zzso Yunnan and zzso and all strains from other regions of mainland China clustered within the Xinjiang zzso zzso geographic diffusion links of Xinjiang with other regions (including zzso Beijing, zzso and zzso were supported by zzso factor zzso The zzso dynamics analyses showed that zzso spread from Xinjiang to zzso in zzso and to zzso in zzso The analyses of zzso not only confirmed the previous conclusion on zzso and spatial dynamics of zzso but also indicated that the zzso strains from zzso and Shanghai originated from zzso The analyses of zzso zzso showed that it was introduced into Xinjiang in the early 1980s, and spread from Xinjiang to Yunnan in zzso and to zzso in zzso and further from Yunnan to zzso in zzso The zzso and spatial dynamics of zzso zzso were similar to some extent to that of zzso zzso and/or zzso suggesting a possible association in migration patterns between zzso and zzso through zzso In addition, zzso zzso spread from Xinjiang to Pakistan, zzso a drug trafficking route linking zzso 

zzso as the most important transfer station for drug trafficking from Golden zzso to other regions of China, plays a very crucial role in the transmission of viruses zzso zzso and zzso through zzso in zzso
