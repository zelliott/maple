Human zzso protein 6 zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso The zzso counterparts were cloned and zzso zzso employed to confirm that the zzso sequences were full zzso zzso from the highly zzso signal zzso zzso the zzso contained at least six zzso of less than 50 zzso Multiple zzso zzso involving these zzso were cloned in the human, the majority of which was also found in zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the tissue distribution of the zzso was very similar in human and zzso The human zzso gene was assigned to the X zzso in a region, which is zzso to the zzso The zzso sequence predicted a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A membrane preparation and protein zzso method was adopted to identify the zzso zzso zzso Two sets of peptides were chosen for zzso production, assuming that protein zzso had occurred within the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed abundant zzso proteins in human and zzso zzso an approximately 180 zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the large zzso were highly zzso the zzso side chains dramatically increasing the apparent molecular zzso zzso studies revealed that both zzso were associated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso duct zzso
