zzso zzso zzso 5 isolated from corn produces a novel zzso termed zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso Q was zzso from the culture zzso of this zzso and its molecular mass was determined to be zzso Da by mass zzso zzso analyses of zzso acid and DNA sequences revealed that zzso Q comprised 53 zzso acid zzso and that its zzso zzso zzso was zzso In contrast to most zzso produced by zzso bacteria, zzso Q had no zzso extensions such as leader or signal zzso It showed zzso and zzso identity to zzso a hypothetical protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The characteristics of zzso Q were determined and compared to those of zzso zzso Similar to zzso A, zzso Q exhibited zzso activity against various zzso zzso zzso Q was very stable against heat treatment and changes in zzso in particular, it was stable at alkaline pH values, while zzso A was zzso Moreover, zzso Q induced zzso zzso from a zzso zzso strain in a shorter time and at a lower concentration than zzso A, indicating that the former affected indicator cells in a different manner from that of the zzso The results described here clarified the fact that zzso Q belongs to a new family of class II zzso and that it can be employed as an alternative to or in combination with zzso zzso
