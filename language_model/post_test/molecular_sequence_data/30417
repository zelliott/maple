zzso of rabbit DNA have been cloned which zzso the gene for rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso which contains both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene spans at least 25 zzso and contains 8 zzso which have zzso and zzso and are located in the same positions as in other family II zzso The zzso zzso region contains a consensus zzso site about 25 zzso from the zzso initiation site which was mapped by the primer extension zzso Other potential regulatory sequences include a zzso sequence and sequences similar to binding sites for the zzso factor zzso and the general zzso factors zzso and zzso The gene sequence differs from the zzso zzso cloned zzso sequence in only 2 of zzso zzso 1 of which results in an zzso acid zzso Since sequences coding for zzso 1 and part of zzso 2 were not present in the cloned zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso end of the zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso The sequence of this zzso was identical with the gene zzso zzso The protein sequence derived from the gene differs in nine positions from that determined directly for the zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence by zzso with other zzso zzso proteins revealed that, in general, the similarity was greater in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
