The age-related and T zzso zzso properties of most zzso zzso limit their use as vaccines, especially in children under 2 years of zzso To overcome these limitations, zzso zzso have been successfully zzso to a variety of carrier zzso such as diphtheria zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the diphtheria zzso zzso to produce very successful zzso zzso The increasing demand for new zzso vaccines requires the availability of additional carriers providing high and long-lasting T helper cell zzso Here we describe the design and construction of three zzso carrier proteins zzso zzso zzso constituted by strings of 6, 10 or 19 human zzso T cell zzso from various zzso zzso including zzso and proteins from zzso zzso influenza virus and zzso B zzso Each of these zzso is defined as universal in that it binds to many human zzso class II zzso When zzso to zzso zzso type b zzso zzso these carriers elicit a potent zzso zzso response in zzso In the case of the zzso zzso this response is at least as good as that observed with zzso a zzso vaccine currently used for mass zzso We also show that some of the universal zzso zzso the zzso carriers are specifically recognized by two human in zzso systems, suggesting that T cell memory is provided by the selected zzso The data indicate that rationally designed zzso zzso proteins represent excellent candidates for the development and clinical testing of new zzso zzso
