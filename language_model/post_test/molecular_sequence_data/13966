The cattle zzso zzso zzso zzso has multiple forms of zzso zzso To investigate their diversity, zzso and reverse zzso zzso were used to isolate zzso DNA and zzso fragments, respectively, zzso different zzso zzso Seven genes have been identified, zzso from amplification of zzso DNA and zzso from amplification of zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequences indicates that the zzso zzso zzso are zzso rather than zzso in zzso However, there is considerable diversity among the zzso zzso and zzso are most similar to one another zzso zzso while zzso and zzso are the least closely related zzso zzso All but one of the genes are zzso the exception being zzso which was present in multiple copies in one of the three zzso zzso Single transcripts were detected for each of the seven zzso zzso was expressed at the highest levels, while transcripts for zzso were only just zzso In zzso zzso zzso the strain from which the zzso DNA and zzso were isolated, transcripts of the five other genes were present at intermediate zzso When two other zzso were compared with zzso differences in the expression of individual genes were apparent, with either one or two of them not zzso In spite of these differences the major zzso zzso detected in the three zzso using zzso appeared zzso The data show that the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is due, in part at least, to the presence of multiple genes and that some of the genes zzso zzso zzso which are not among the zzso zzso detected zzso
