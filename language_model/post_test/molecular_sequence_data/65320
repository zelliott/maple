A novel zzso zzso was isolated from seawater collected from zzso Beach in zzso Republic of zzso A comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that the zzso designated zzso was closely related to members of the zzso zzso As found for other species of the zzso zzso strain zzso possessed zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso zzso acid, contained zzso as the major zzso contained polar lipids that included zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso and had zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as the zzso fatty zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso The zzso closest relative was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso However, zzso zzso of strain zzso showed zzso % zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel isolate could be clearly distinguished from zzso zzso zzso zzso on the basis of some cultural, zzso and zzso zzso A battery of zzso and genetic data obtained in this study suggest that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
