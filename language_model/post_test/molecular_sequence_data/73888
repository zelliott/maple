Although zzso zzso have been identified on the zzso zzso envelope complex, efforts to exploit this information through the construction of synthetic zzso vaccines have been largely zzso Unfortunately, synthetic peptides tend to be poorly zzso and most often lack the zzso characteristics of the corresponding zzso in the native zzso In an effort to circumvent these difficulties, we have zzso an zzso II zzso zzso as a molecular scaffold for the construction of two zzso constrained zzso zzso zzso Previously we demonstrated that zzso II zzso zzso can function as zzso for the induction of zzso zzso responses to incorporated zzso In this instance, one zzso zzso is the crown of the zzso loop from zzso and the other, zzso is a zzso zzso from zzso The zzso of these zzso into a specific loop region of the zzso heavy chain zzso was found to preserve the zzso II zzso activity of these zzso zzso and the zzso were recognized by zzso specific zzso zzso When zzso as zzso each of these zzso zzso zzso was able to induce zzso zzso zzso responses in guinea zzso These responses were zzso specific in that the zzso binding was not inhibited by the synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso in zzso These data demonstrate the potential to construct zzso constrained zzso zzso zzso and thus establish an alternative approach to the design of an effective zzso zzso zzso
