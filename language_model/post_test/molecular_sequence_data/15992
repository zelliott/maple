We have combined three zzso previously shown to stabilize zzso zzso against zzso zzso Two of these zzso are in zzso 3, where zzso and zzso have been replaced by zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso The other zzso which replaces zzso with zzso allows the protein to form an zzso zzso bond zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 25, zzso zzso zzso show that the two zzso zzso stabilize zzso by about 8 degrees C, that the zzso bond zzso zzso by about 8 degrees C, and that the triple zzso is 16 degrees C more stable than zzso zzso
