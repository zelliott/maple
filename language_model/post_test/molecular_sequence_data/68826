zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in generating the zzso activity necessary for invasive zzso and is dependent on binding to its specific cellular zzso zzso for efficient zzso We report here that the zzso zzso compound zzso zzso the activity of this zzso zzso system, in a manner independent of its antagonism of the zzso interaction zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurring at a zzso zzso zzso This zzso was found to be due to effects on the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso mechanism zzso zzso 2 zzso which did not involve a direct effect on zzso zzso zzso Similarly, its effect on zzso zzso was not due to a direct zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso which occurred exclusively with zzso zzso appeared to be due to a reversal of the zzso zzso which result from the zzso of zzso zzso although zzso did not inhibit the cellular binding of zzso zzso This suggests that this effect is due to interference with interactions between components of this system on the cell surface, and that zzso may be useful in gaining further insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in the functional assembly of this zzso zzso zzso the effective zzso of this system by zzso indicates an zzso potential that may contribute to the zzso effect of zzso in zzso
