This study was undertaken to identify novel zzso membrane proteins that are potential targets for zzso zzso zzso were incubated in the presence of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein was subjected to zzso and zzso gel zzso to purify a major zzso protein of approximately zzso zzso The determined zzso sequence of the zzso zzso corresponded to a segment of zzso c zzso zzso IV, an inner membrane protein of zzso zzso The identity of the zzso was confirmed by two-dimensional zzso and Western zzso The results identify zzso zzso c zzso zzso IV as a protein which is zzso by an zzso zzso
