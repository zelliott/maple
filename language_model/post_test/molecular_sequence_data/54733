zzso is a zzso 2 zzso that is zzso throughout zzso and in some zzso for repair of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso DNA zzso Atomic structures of zzso zzso have allowed zzso insights into zzso and zzso functions, but have also highlighted structures that currently lack a known function, such as an unexpected zzso zzso zzso zzso This domain and similar overall protein structural organization was also identified in other zzso 2 zzso that process zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso and zzso We survey the structure of zzso with regard to its zzso domain in particular and its zzso in maintaining structural integrity of the overall zzso ring structure, and possibly during interactions of zzso with other proteins and/or zzso zzso
