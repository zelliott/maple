The use of zzso and molecular zzso has begun to reveal how differentiation is brought about in zzso zzso zzso zzso Alternative pathways to aerial zzso formation may be activated on different zzso In some cases, zzso signals are transmitted or zzso zzso proteins may act as zzso in the zzso of aerial zzso A rare zzso zzso is apparently confined to zzso from a few genes important only for early stages of zzso it is absent from zzso or zzso late zzso zzso of aerial zzso involves at least four specific regulatory zzso including a zzso factor and an unusual small zzso A complex interplay between the zzso regulatory zzso rather than a simple linear dependence zzso is zzso
