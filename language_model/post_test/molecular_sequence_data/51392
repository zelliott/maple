The objectives of this work were to engineer the cloned zzso gene zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso III for controlled zzso in zzso coli and to devise a facile zzso scheme permitting the large-scale production of pure zzso zzso The zzso signals of zzso were restructured by expression cassette zzso zzso et zzso 1990, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 87, zzso and the modified gene was inserted into the expression zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1983, in zzso in zzso zzso 101, zzso zzso Academic Press, San zzso under the strict control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter and its zzso zzso When the system was zzso at 32 degrees C, soluble DNA zzso III accumulated at levels zzso zzso of total cellular zzso The zzso protein was zzso to greater than zzso purity by utilizing a tandem combination of zzso blue zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The properties of the zzso zzso protein were indistinguishable from those of native zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso
