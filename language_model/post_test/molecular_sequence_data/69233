Among the proteins specialized in signal zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso member of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Since the early finding of a zzso restricted shell of lipids zzso zzso the protein in its native zzso there is growing experimental evidence supporting the notion that this interface region is the locus of a variety of zzso relevant zzso including some of the actions of local zzso steroids, and other zzso zzso zzso data on the composition and metabolism of zzso zzso and cells, combined with zzso data on their structure and zzso are beginning to provide information on the nature of the zzso zzso zzso data on cells expressing the zzso protein add another dimension to this knowledge, enabling correlations to be established between the chemical composition of zzso cells and the functional properties of the zzso protein in zzso at the single-channel zzso The effect of free fatty zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, and steroid zzso hormones on the function of the zzso is zzso In the case of steroids, their effects at the single-channel level bear a relationship to their use in pathological conditions of medical zzso zzso in the treatment of the disease zzso zzso
