zzso successfully zzso the synthesis of several zzso derivatives from zzso zzso or zzso and zzso acid or zzso zzso or zzso in zzso solutions at pH zzso An optimal zzso ratio depended on the structure of starting zzso especially their fit to the zzso binding sites of the zzso For zzso zzso formation, an equilibrium yield was attained at zzso zzso ratio that indicated high efficiency of zzso in synthesis zzso In the course of the equilibrium zzso zzso zzso gradually disappeared from the liquid phase due to its zzso within a zzso formed by the zzso product, while retaining its zzso The inclusion into the zzso was not specific for zzso so far as zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso when added to the reaction mixture, became also zzso with the zzso zzso It appears that zzso of zzso an important factor limiting the zzso efficiency, might be operative as well for other zzso used to catalyze zzso zzso
