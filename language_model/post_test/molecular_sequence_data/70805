zzso analysis of the zzso of 18 different African zzso fever virus zzso zzso showed that the zzso open reading frame zzso was present as either a long form or short form in all of the zzso zzso of the zzso from eight zzso confirmed that both forms of the zzso were well zzso zzso raised against the zzso protein identified the long form of the protein as a 21 zzso protein expressed late during zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso expressed zzso forms of the zzso protein showed that the long form of the protein localized predominantly to the nucleus and within the zzso In contrast, although the short form of the protein was also present predominantly in the nucleus, it did not zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso 14 zzso acids from the long form of the zzso zzso which includes a high proportion of basic zzso zzso abolished the specific zzso zzso of the zzso although the protein was still present in the zzso zzso of this 14 zzso acid sequence to zzso or replacement of the zzso 14 zzso acids of the zzso short form with those from the long form directed both of these modified proteins to the zzso This indicates that this 14 zzso acid sequence contains all the signals required for zzso zzso
