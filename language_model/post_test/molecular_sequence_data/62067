The global regulator, zzso zzso zzso for antibiotics and cyanide sensor zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was required for increased resistance to hydrogen zzso as cultures zzso zzso bands of zzso and zzso activity were absent in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed earlier and to a greater extent than in the zzso In the zzso cell, transcript zzso of zzso was higher in late zzso zzso cells than cells from mid zzso or zzso zzso abundance from zzso was reduced in the zzso zzso throughout the growth phase compared to the zzso zzso The sequence of a small zzso zzso found downstream of zzso in other zzso was lacking in zzso zzso This zzso is implicated in the control of genes activated by the zzso zzso Thus, the mechanism by which zzso mediates the zzso of genes under its control requires further investigation in zzso zzso
