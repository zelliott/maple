zzso have the remarkable ability to zzso many body parts following catastrophic injuries, including a fully functional spinal zzso following a tail zzso The molecular basis for how this process is so exquisitely zzso assuring a faithful replication of missing structures every time, remains poorly zzso Therefore a study of zzso expression and function during zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso Using zzso zzso it was found that 78 highly zzso zzso display significant changes in expression levels during the early stages of tail zzso as compared to mature zzso The role of zzso which was highly zzso in the early tail zzso and spinal cord, was then further zzso zzso of zzso expression in this context resulted in a zzso in zzso yielding zzso shortened tails with spinal zzso defects in formation of the terminal zzso A more detailed characterization of this zzso revealed downstream components of the zzso zzso to include key zzso of tissue patterning within the spinal cord, including zzso and zzso As such, our zzso establishes zzso as an essential regulator of tail zzso acting upstream of key zzso and zzso patterning events within the spinal zzso
