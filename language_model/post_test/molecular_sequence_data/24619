Recently several zzso have been described zzso zzso zzso zzso Their deduced zzso acid sequences are characterized by a strong similarity in the zzso region, corresponding to the zzso zzso family zzso domain, and by marked differences in the zzso zzso Different biological functions have been described for zzso zzso in addition to their traditionally assumed zzso zzso To answer the question of whether these different functions are carried out by different zzso zzso zzso and active forms of these zzso are zzso At present only the classical form of zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterize the zzso zzso zzso In view of the strong sequence zzso with the zzso domain of other zzso zzso we chose to purify the protein from bovine zzso using zzso specific to the zzso domain of the zzso We have isolated a zzso protein identified by zzso acid sequencing as the bovine zzso zzso zzso which is zzso at the zzso sequence at positions zzso by a zzso activity, as revealed after zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso protein was largely zzso but further processing in zzso by bone zzso zzso led to an zzso that was active on zzso and collagen zzso
