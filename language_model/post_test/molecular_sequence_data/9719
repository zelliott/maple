zzso regulation by zzso hormone is zzso by nuclear zzso hormone receptors zzso acting on zzso hormone response elements zzso We examine here the role of human zzso a zzso zzso with central nervous zzso zzso in the regulation of target genes whose expression are decreased by zzso zzso Using transient zzso studies, we found that zzso achieved significantly greater zzso zzso on the zzso hormone zzso and common zzso zzso genes than either zzso or zzso A zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso functioned like the zzso zzso on these zzso confirming that the zzso zzso of zzso was both necessary and sufficient to mediate this zzso By constructing deletion zzso of the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso acids zzso mediate this zzso This domain, important in zzso zzso on negative zzso is discrete from a previously described zzso domain in the zzso portion of zzso We conclude that the central nervous zzso zzso zzso has a unique effect on negative regulation by zzso that can be mapped to zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso of the human zzso
