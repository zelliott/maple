zzso and zzso are two recently cloned genes with zzso to the tumor zzso zzso whose protein product is a key zzso regulator of genes involved in cell cycle arrest and zzso While all three proteins share zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso have an additional zzso zzso zzso We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of this zzso zzso domain of human zzso The structure reveals a small zzso bundle with striking similarity to the SAM zzso alpha zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso The SAM domain is a putative zzso interaction domain found in a variety of zzso signaling proteins and has been shown to form both zzso and zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso and do not interact with one another, suggesting that this domain may interact with zzso as yet zzso proteins in a signaling and/or regulatory zzso
