zzso strains of human influenza A zzso viruses isolated between August 1986 and January 1991 were analyzed in this zzso zzso of the total viral zzso of 12 strains by zzso mapping revealed that considerable genetic zzso exists among these zzso zzso sequencing of each of the zzso zzso segments of 4 viruses having divergent zzso zzso maps indicated that only one was a zzso virus that had genes from both the influenza A zzso and zzso zzso This zzso obtained its zzso gene from a virus of the zzso zzso and the other 7 zzso segments from an zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes of these 18 strains revealed that although these viruses are zzso similar to the reference strains zzso and zzso 7 zzso zzso acid zzso that are shared by recently isolated zzso viruses have occurred in the main stream of evolution of the zzso zzso Our data indicate that: zzso zzso zzso continues to contribute to genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso viruses are zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of recent zzso viruses are related to those of the 1986 reference zzso zzso Although there has been little zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes of human epidemic influenza A zzso viruses have continued to evolve at an evolutionary rate similar to that for the zzso and zzso viruses analyzed zzso
