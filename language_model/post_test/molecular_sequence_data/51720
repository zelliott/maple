zzso zzso zzso protein has dual functions as a zzso zzso in zzso and as a zzso protein involved in oral zzso and in zzso behavior during zzso By zzso using zzso and zzso zzso following two-dimensional gel zzso we demonstrated that the zzso filament protein fraction contained two zzso proteins whose zzso points were zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso reacted only to a zzso zzso zzso while two other zzso zzso and zzso reacted only to a zzso zzso zzso From the zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso protein was identified as the previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso zzso protein zzso sequence had no similarity with that of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein is considered to be a zzso zzso protein since the zzso zzso protein zzso with the zzso zzso protein during two cycles of an assembly and zzso zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing the zzso zzso protein gene from a zzso zzso zzso library, we identified the zzso zzso protein as zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso based on it sharing zzso sequence identity with zzso alpha from several zzso
