The human zzso virus type 1 zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso of zzso replication in cell zzso The rapid emergence of drug-resistant escape zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso is predominantly linked to the zzso zzso Because zzso acids zzso and zzso appear to be located within the drug binding site of the zzso we studied the impact of zzso of both zzso acids on the zzso zzso and on the zzso of the zzso to different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to reduced sensitivity, albeit of varying zzso to all zzso zzso zzso No resistance was observed to zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was similar to that of the zzso zzso (18 zzso zzso zzso The zzso constant of the zzso zzso was zzso higher and that of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso Whereas zzso displayed a linear zzso zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso when zzso zzso was used, the pattern of zzso became competitive or uncompetitive with zzso or zzso zzso Thus, the zzso binding site of zzso zzso seems to be functionally and/or zzso related to the natural zzso zzso binding zzso
