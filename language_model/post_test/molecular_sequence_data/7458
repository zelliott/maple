zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins during incubation with zzso and various protein zzso zzso peptides at 30 degrees C was analyzed by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso A marked difference in zzso was observed in a 30 zzso zzso This protein was strongly zzso after the addition of zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, a zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso a protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso as well as control samples but only slightly zzso in the presence of a zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso at 30 degrees C remained high in control samples and following the addition of zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso but decreased markedly following the addition of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the 30 zzso protein is identified as a zzso for zzso or a zzso protein in zzso zzso and that zzso of this protein is involved in the regulation of zzso movement at 30 degrees zzso
