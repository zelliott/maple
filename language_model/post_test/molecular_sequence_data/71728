zzso is essential for normal zzso development and is controlled by the local balance of zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe a novel mouse zzso sequence zzso zzso that is a potent zzso to vascular zzso growth factor zzso and show for the first time its in zzso zzso In zzso zzso and Northern zzso analysis with zzso specific for zzso or zzso showed that the relative abundance of their zzso changed markedly in zzso cells in the zzso as gestation zzso On day 11 of pregnancy, zzso zzso was zzso but zzso readily apparent, and by day 17 zzso zzso was abundant but zzso barely zzso zzso was identified in zzso medium of cultured zzso from day 17 pregnant mice and likely to be present in the zzso as there is a substantial increase of zzso activity in the serum from day 13 of pregnancy, which zzso with the abundant zzso expression in zzso zzso of zzso was also observed in adult zzso zzso liver, and zzso These data suggest a novel mechanism of regulation of zzso by alternative zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of pregnant mice with zzso zzso from day 9 to 17 of pregnancy, which alters the ratio of zzso to zzso resulted in an increase in the number of zzso sites and zzso deposition in the zzso of ongoing zzso These findings have important implications for understanding zzso function and may be relevant in a range of disease zzso
