zzso H zzso is an integral zzso zzso membrane protein which zzso a key control step in zzso zzso The overall arrangement of the zzso H zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso membrane was examined in zzso zzso zzso cells, using zzso zzso A bacterial zzso zzso was used for selective plasma membrane zzso and a zzso zzso for general membrane zzso zzso cells were zzso with six zzso specific for particular zzso H zzso zzso segments and one zzso specific for an inserted viral reporter zzso Control experiments established that zzso a zzso marker, was accessible to zzso zzso after zzso treatment, whereas zzso against protein zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso marker, bound only after zzso treatment, Using this approach to investigate zzso H zzso it was found that zzso treatment was sufficient to obtain zzso of zzso zzso by zzso specific for the zzso zzso segment, for the viral reporter inserted at the zzso and for the zzso region near zzso In contrast, zzso treatment was necessary for zzso by zzso specific for peptides spanning zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeted against zzso zzso did not stain zzso cells even after zzso zzso although they did bind to zzso zzso H zzso These results indicate that the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso can be exposed on the zzso side of the zzso zzso zzso whereas regions near zzso sites are confined to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso from either side of the zzso zzso zzso
