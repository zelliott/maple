zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso are zzso zzso involved in numerous cellular processes and diverse diseases including mood disorders, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and zzso However, in zzso the information on zzso is very zzso Identification and characterization of pig zzso are not only important for pig genetic improvement, but also contribute to the understanding and development of zzso models for human disease prevention and zzso 

Five different zzso of zzso were identified in zzso different zzso in which three zzso are zzso These zzso had differential expression patterns in the fetal and adult of the zzso different zzso The zzso expression level of zzso zzso was zzso regulated during the course of the insulin treatment, suggesting that different zzso zzso may have different roles in insulin signaling zzso Moreover, zzso had a different role on regulating the zzso zzso activity, zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso gene compared to other zzso zzso 

We are the first to report five different zzso of zzso identified from the zzso different zzso zzso zzso of zzso exhibit differential activity towards zzso zzso These results provide new insight into roles of the zzso on regulating zzso zzso
