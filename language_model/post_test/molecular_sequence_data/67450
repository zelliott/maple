Here we characterize a novel protein in zzso zzso It has a high degree of zzso with the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the gene for this protein is, in many zzso fused with and in the same reading frame as that zzso zzso the zzso of the human zzso checkpoint zzso We name the protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso does not possess zzso activity, but is important for resistance to ultraviolet light in the zzso phase and to treatment with zzso a drug that arrests DNA replication zzso in the S zzso However, we find no evidence of a checkpoint function of zzso Furthermore, absence of zzso results in an advancement of zzso entry after a zzso arrest as well as earlier recovery from a zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed mainly in the zzso phase and zzso is localized to the zzso We conclude that zzso regulates the initiation of the S phase and may cooperate with zzso in this zzso
