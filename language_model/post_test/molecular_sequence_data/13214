zzso zzso I of zzso coli is a zzso zzso with zzso symmetry and zzso a complex ring expansion reaction conducive to the formation of zzso zzso from zzso The zzso structure of a complex of the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso bound at the active site was determined at a resolution of 3 zzso In the zzso 10 equivalent active sites are present, each of which contains a zzso deep pocket formed by surface areas of 3 adjacent zzso The zzso forms a complex hydrogen bond network with the zzso Active site zzso were modified by zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso proteins were zzso On this basis, a mechanism of the zzso reaction is zzso zzso of the zzso ring is initiated by zzso of zzso by zzso followed by the attack of water at zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be involved in this reaction zzso Opening of the zzso ring may be in concert with zzso of the zzso ring to generate a zzso base from the zzso The zzso of zzso may be involved in the subsequent zzso zzso of the zzso side chain by zzso the zzso group of zzso
