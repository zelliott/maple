zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a tandem zzso mismatched base pair zzso zzso duplex, zzso has been made by two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso correlated zzso zzso downfield zzso zzso have been assigned by a pure zzso phase zzso zzso zzso correlated spectrum to be associated with the zzso on the zzso and zzso of the mismatched zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for each of the zzso of the zzso were obtained from the zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso The two most zzso zzso zzso each appear to consist of two overlapping signals that can be resolved into two distinct zzso with different zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This as well as the temperature dependence of the zzso zzso demonstrates that two distinct zzso exist at lower zzso By use of a modified zzso relationship, the zzso zzso angles zzso were zzso A linear correlation between zzso chemical shifts and the measured zzso zzso is quite good zzso when the larger set of zzso zzso of the two most downfield zzso signals is zzso The zzso chemical shifts as well as the measured zzso zzso tend to follow the zzso variation seen in other duplexes of interior zzso zzso more zzso than terminal zzso and of interior zzso exhibiting smaller zzso zzso however, this pattern is disrupted at the site of the zzso Modeling and initial zzso distance restrained molecular mechanics energy zzso and restrained molecular dynamics support previous observations that the mismatched zzso and zzso bases are both in anti zzso Most significantly, the zzso backbone zzso angle zzso calculated from the zzso distance restrained structures are in agreement with both the crystal structure values and the measured zzso zzso zzso
