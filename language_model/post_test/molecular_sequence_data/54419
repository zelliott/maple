zzso acid zzso one of the zzso belonging to the zzso pathway, has been described as an important zzso compound, its zzso being associated with several pathological zzso In human brain, the majority of zzso production is sustained by zzso zzso II zzso zzso A selective zzso II inhibitor would be an important pharmacological zzso since it would reduce zzso formation without causing complete depletion of this zzso zzso zzso described as a potent and selective inhibitor of rat zzso II, is zzso ineffective towards the human zzso although the two zzso share a remarkably high degree of sequence zzso We investigated the molecular basis for this intriguing zzso by adopting a zzso zzso and structural zzso We propose that the source of the inhibitor specificity toward the rat zzso could reside on zzso zzso with a flexible loop that controls zzso admission to the active site by a classical zzso zzso Our data further highlights that even in case of highly zzso molecular targets, the flexibility of zzso important structural elements can have a significant impact on the selectivity of inhibitor zzso
