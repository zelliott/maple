A new type of zzso plate capable of binding zzso zzso in a one step procedure was used to map linear zzso zzso in two different proteins using a zzso solid phase zzso The method was compared with a conventional zzso method using passive zzso to zzso zzso An array of zzso zzso overlapping by five zzso zzso representing the entire sequences of zzso and zzso tumor necrosis zzso respectively, was zzso The peptides were immobilized zzso using the new, specialized zzso plates or zzso using conventional zzso zzso plates of the high zzso zzso zzso specific zzso to zzso or zzso tumor necrosis zzso were added to identify potential linear zzso zzso All zzso which were recognized on the conventional zzso plates, were also recognized on the plates with the zzso bound zzso In addition, the zzso zzso method revealed zzso that were not identified using the method for zzso binding although the peptides were in fact present on the zzso binding zzso The interaction with the zzso surface of the conventional zzso plate apparently zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso plates described here could be useful for identification of new zzso zzso in protein zzso
