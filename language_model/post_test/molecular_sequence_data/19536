There is still concern about the effects of zzso compounds zzso on marine organisms, and especially on their zzso zzso We investigated the toxicity of zzso oxide zzso on zzso in a marine fish, zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure caused serious zzso damage to the zzso including reduction in counts of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso cells around the seminal zzso Analysis of the incorporation of zzso into zzso cells revealed zzso of the proliferation of germ zzso To find a zzso for evaluation of the effects of zzso on fish zzso we cloned genes zzso by zzso exposure in the zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso contained an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence of zzso was very similar to that of the zzso zzso of the rainbow trout, zzso zzso Furthermore, Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso was produced specifically in the zzso We therefore identified zzso in the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that exposure of the fish to zzso significantly reduced zzso expression in the zzso To some extent, this reduction was zzso with that of zzso incorporation into zzso zzso The zzso gene can therefore be used as a zzso for evaluating the effects of zzso on fish zzso In addition, levels of expression of the zzso gene in control fish were well correlated with increments in the zzso zzso index zzso below zzso zzso that were thought to have zzso damage caused by zzso could be zzso from those considered zzso The results suggest that zzso is involved in the suppression of fish zzso and that analysis of both zzso values and zzso gene expression is useful for evaluating the levels of zzso pollution in coastal zzso
