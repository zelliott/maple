zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is activated in response to both hormones and zzso zzso stress zzso zzso is regulated by zzso on the alpha zzso and by zzso zzso control previously thought to be zzso by both alpha and gamma zzso Here we present evidence that adjacent gamma zzso pairs of CBS repeat sequences (after zzso zzso zzso form an zzso binding site related to, but distinct from the classical zzso binding site in zzso that can also bind zzso The zzso binding site of the zzso zzso pair, modeled on the structures of the CBS sequences present in the zzso zzso zzso crystal structure, contains three zzso zzso 70, 152, and zzso and zzso The zzso gamma zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso and when this is introduced into zzso zzso zzso control is substantially lost and explains why the zzso zzso complex is insensitive to zzso zzso in zzso zzso to the site of zzso in human zzso and pig zzso genes previously identified to cause an unusual cardiac zzso and zzso storage disease, zzso zzso of any of zzso binding site zzso zzso to zzso substantially zzso zzso zzso control in expressed zzso zzso The zzso zzso also suppress the previously described zzso properties of zzso and render the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso acts as an zzso inhibitor by bridging the alpha and gamma zzso and that zzso functions to zzso zzso zzso
