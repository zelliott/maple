zzso pathogens use a variety of their surface molecules to bind to host zzso zzso zzso components to establish an effective zzso However, zzso components can also serve as an integral part of the innate zzso Mice lacking expression of zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso have an impaired ability to clear bacterial infection, and zzso zzso show defective responses to a broad spectrum of microbial zzso Moreover, zzso binds directly to bacteria and their components and functions as an zzso for zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso is essential in the initiation of the innate immune response and represents a unique zzso zzso in the zzso for microbial zzso
