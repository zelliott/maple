Two novel zzso of rapidly growing, zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso from a zzso sample collected from the South China Sea zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso at a depth of 42 m and strain zzso zzso from a coastal zone sand sample collected in zzso United Arab Emirates, were obtained in our zzso Their zzso positions were determined by a zzso zzso Good growth of the two strains was observed at 28 zzso and pH zzso with zzso zzso on zzso soy zzso zzso Both strains formed round zzso zzso strain zzso zzso had a rough surface, while zzso zzso was zzso Cellular fatty zzso zzso protein profiles and TLC analysis of their zzso acids show significant differences from reference zzso zzso characteristics and zzso sequence analysis zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences indicated that both strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso values revealed a low zzso zzso of the two zzso with the type strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The low zzso zzso values zzso between strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso distinctiveness indicated that the two strains were representatives of different novel species of the zzso zzso The names proposed for these novel species are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
