Construction of a zzso zzso zzso bank containing a vast variety of zzso against human tissue proteins is important for zzso zzso A novel strategy of zzso zzso using zzso native proteins was developed for high zzso generation of zzso against human plasma zzso By this novel approach, the bottleneck of zzso preparation can be overcome by combining repeated zzso of animals with zzso zzso of plasma or tissue proteins and identification of target zzso by zzso spectrum zzso Plasma freshly collected from healthy adults was pooled and three zzso were prepared by size exclusion zzso Mice were zzso with the zzso plasma zzso and 205 strains of zzso zzso zzso were obtained after zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In the first round, 110 strains of zzso were established, in which 77 strains zzso zzso were identified against 10 human plasma zzso zzso In the second round, plasma fraction I was absorbed with zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso The absorbed fraction I was used as zzso for the second round zzso and cell zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso were zzso Although the target zzso of zzso from 82 strains of zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso about zzso zzso obtained from this round were identified as new zzso when compared with zzso obtained in the first round zzso with plasma fraction zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso with zzso plasma proteins followed by identification of zzso with zzso spectrum may be an effective approach for rapid preparation of zzso against zzso zzso plasma or tissue zzso
