zzso has been shown in bacterial zzso to be the principal zzso agent in diesel zzso zzso It has also been shown to be zzso in human zzso and zzso in zzso To investigate the kinds of zzso induced by this zzso and compare them with those induced by a structurally related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso McCormick, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso we treated a shuttle zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso intermediate zzso of zzso which forms the same DNA zzso as the parent compound, and introduced the plasmids into a human embryonic kidney cell line, zzso for DNA replication to take zzso The treated zzso zzso carrying a bacterial zzso zzso target zzso zzso was allowed 48 h to replicate in the human zzso zzso plasmids were then zzso zzso and introduced into bacteria carrying an amber zzso in the zzso gene in order to detect those carrying zzso in the zzso zzso The frequency of zzso increased in direct proportion to the number of zzso zzso formed per zzso At the highest level of zzso formation tested, the frequency of zzso zzso was 26 times higher than the background frequency of zzso X zzso DNA sequencing of 60 unequivocally independent zzso derived from zzso plasmids indicated that zzso contained a single base zzso zzso had two base zzso zzso had small insertions or deletions (1 or 2 base zzso and zzso showed a deletion or zzso of 4 or more base zzso zzso data from 25 zzso zzso derived from zzso plasmids showed that zzso contained deletions of 4 or more base zzso The majority zzso of the base substitution in zzso from zzso plasmids were zzso with zzso of these being G zzso C zzso T zzso zzso This is very similar to what we found previously in this system, using zzso but each zzso produced its own spectrum of zzso Of the five hot spots for base substitution zzso produced in the zzso gene with zzso two were the same as seen with zzso zzso However, the three other hot spots were cold spots for zzso zzso zzso four of the other five hot spots seen with zzso plasmids were cold spots for zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso for the frequency of zzso zzso induced per DNA zzso showed that zzso zzso were zzso times less than zzso zzso However, the zzso cell excised zzso zzso faster than zzso zzso
