zzso In this study we have examined the effects of zzso an zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso on the membrane properties of rat locus zzso zzso zzso in zzso using zzso and whole cell patch clamp zzso zzso When locus zzso zzso were zzso clamped to zzso zzso application to zzso caused an outward current in all cells examined zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of 90 zzso Neither the potency nor the zzso effect of zzso was altered in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso or zzso (2 zzso zzso The outward currents caused by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed polarity at zzso zzso more negative than the predicted zzso reversal potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso resulted in a shift of the reversal potential of zzso zzso a shift consistent with a zzso zzso The zzso activated by zzso showed mild inward zzso zzso Application of a high concentration of zzso (3 zzso zzso the current produced by simultaneous application of high zzso of zzso (10 zzso (3 zzso zzso and UK zzso (3 zzso indicating that zzso activated the same zzso as zzso and zzso receptors and alpha zzso zzso The actions of zzso were zzso antagonized by the zzso zzso zzso with zzso estimated from 2 cells of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso the zzso zzso zzso (30 zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso another putative zzso zzso for zzso caused a robust outward current in locus zzso zzso that was, however, completely antagonized by moderate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Continuous application of zzso (3 zzso resulted in a decrease of the outward current to a steady level of zzso of the maximum response with a zzso of zzso zzso was largely zzso because simultaneous application of zzso (30 zzso during the zzso period of the zzso response resulted in an outward current that was zzso of control responses to zzso in the same zzso zzso continuous application of zzso (30 zzso resulted in a decrease of zzso current to a steady level that was zzso of the initial zzso During this zzso period application of zzso (3 zzso resulted in a current that was zzso of the control responses to zzso in the same zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso activates an inwardly zzso zzso zzso in locus zzso zzso with a pharmacological profile consistent with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A does not appear to be a zzso for zzso in rat locus zzso zzso
