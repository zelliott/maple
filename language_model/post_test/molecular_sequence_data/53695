A promoter tagging program in the zzso zzso zzso was initiated to identify plant genes involved in the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Seven transformed plant lines expressing the zzso reporter gene zzso zzso zzso specifically in roots and/or zzso were zzso Four of these expressed zzso in the roots only after zzso with zzso zzso zzso In one line zzso zzso activity was found in the root zzso including root zzso During zzso growth, zzso expression gradually became focused in developing zzso and disappeared from root zzso No zzso activity was detected when a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was used to inoculate the zzso The zzso zzso in this plant line was located zzso zzso upstream of a putative coding sequence with strong zzso to zzso zzso Four motifs were identified, which were very similar to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso each binding one zzso We have named the gene zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses showed that this gene is expressed specifically in roots of zzso zzso zzso was reduced in roots zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and in progeny zzso for the zzso zzso suggesting a link between the zzso zzso and this zzso
