We have approached the problem of folding and assembly of the heavy zzso chain of human zzso by zzso point zzso that affect this zzso zzso is an ideal model system to approach the problem of protein folding and assembly into zzso zzso We have developed a zzso hybrid zzso that allows us to select for zzso zzso in which the zzso process is altered or completely zzso The selection procedure is based on a zzso protein which consists of a fusion between the H chain of human zzso and the zzso of zzso In the wild type situation, the zzso domain is zzso inside the zzso shell upon assembly and is unable to interact with the zzso and perform its zzso zzso We show that by selecting for zzso that restore zzso activity we are able to identify zzso zzso that affect the zzso zzso The selective procedure was applied to the analysis of the zzso acid side chains that are important for the zzso of the correct zzso of the zzso E zzso in the zzso zzso
