The expression of the tobacco zzso zzso is induced by zzso pathogen infections as well as microbial zzso and zzso factors known to induce the plant zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso region is sufficient to mediate zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso in stable transgenic zzso We have used in zzso zzso techniques in order to zzso the zzso elements of the zzso zzso region that mediate the induction of zzso zzso Our results indicate that a zzso repeated short element, named zzso box, is involved in the zzso zzso of the tobacco zzso zzso in association with the plant zzso signaling zzso
