The aim of this work was to develop an approach for zzso engineering of the zzso zzso zzso A selection strategy for zzso zzso had previously been zzso this strategy was based on zzso a zzso zzso strain with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The current work identified an additional selective marker, zzso which encodes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a zzso zzso the available zzso selection was used during the deletion of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The alternative zzso selection was in turn used while deleting the zzso zzso zzso Since both deletions are unmarked, the zzso and zzso markers may be zzso Through the double zzso zzso zzso zzso the difficulties that are associated with spontaneous zzso and unintended zzso integration of zzso molecules are zzso The selection efficiency in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by targeting putative zzso zzso zzso zzso using a linear zzso containing a marked deletion with zzso and 810 zzso of zzso and 3' zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso were zzso rather than zzso The correct replacement of an internal zzso zzso with the zzso marker was confirmed by Southern zzso analysis of the zzso Thus, it appears that target genes in the zzso zzso zzso can be readily replaced with linear molecules in a single step by zzso zzso
