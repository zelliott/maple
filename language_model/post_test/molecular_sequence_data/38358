zzso zzso zzso has previously been used for the study of protein zzso However, the procedures does not seem to be easy for zzso of this field, zzso this approach has not been widely zzso We introduce here a simple protocol with zzso zzso to study in zzso zzso in zzso zzso The effectiveness of this method was verified using synthetic peptides and zzso proteins of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whose zzso are considered to have important roles in synaptic zzso We show that a decrease in the pH of the sample solution after the zzso reaction is critical for the separation of the zzso zzso In the analysis of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso sites of which had not zzso been well zzso we found the presence of at least three protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this method allows prediction of the origins of each of the zzso zzso Thus, the techniques we described here is useful for examination of protein zzso and permits us to safely conduct repetitive zzso
