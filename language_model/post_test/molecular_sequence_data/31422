zzso zzso a zzso zzso protects against the development of pulmonary zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this observation remain zzso The imbalance of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso We hypothesized that zzso protects against zzso by zzso the imbalance between zzso and zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso and zzso mice were exposed to cigarette smoke zzso The protein level and activity of zzso were increased in lungs of zzso mice exposed to zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and these effects were attenuated by zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the level of zzso which was zzso in zzso transgenic mice compared with zzso zzso by zzso However, the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was not altered by zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso reduction was associated with imbalance of zzso and zzso in lungs of smokers and COPD zzso Mass zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso on specific zzso zzso was increased, whereas its interaction with zzso and zzso was reduced in mouse lungs with zzso as well as in lungs of smokers and COPD zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and these effects were attenuated by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso protects against zzso in part, via zzso the zzso imbalance involving zzso zzso Thus zzso the zzso imbalance by pharmacological zzso of zzso is an attractive approach in the intervention of zzso
