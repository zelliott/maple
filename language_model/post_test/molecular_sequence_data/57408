To determine the biological significance of the existence of highly specific receptors for the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso we investigated the role of this zzso in bacterial zzso The zzso protein of the zzso coli zzso zzso was identified as having an zzso zzso sequence and a zzso zzso coli with the zzso gene on zzso zzso was shown to be an zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso genes in conventional zzso zzso coli zzso by zzso light or hydrogen zzso increased zzso production up to zzso A zzso strain, incapable of zzso zzso was a low zzso producer of zzso and showed no increased production with zzso light or zzso zzso We propose that host zzso respond to zzso and closely related peptides because they are generated by bacteria under zzso zzso Increased zzso production may signal to the host a change in the zzso biological status from zzso to pathogen because of the invasion into zzso exposing bacteria to high zzso levels and zzso zzso
