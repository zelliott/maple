The zzso zzso ( zzso zzso has become a popular animal model for several human infectious diseases, such as zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Investigation of zzso responses in experimental infectious diseases in zzso zzso has benefited from an expanding understanding of the diversity of zzso zzso class I heavy chains and the restriction of zzso presentation by zzso class I zzso Here we add to this understanding with the first zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including a portion of the zzso region zzso In zzso comparison, the zzso protein of zzso zzso differs from human and zzso zzso by nine zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso by one zzso difference in the signal zzso region zzso zzso zzso variations were identified at one site in the zzso A structural analysis of human or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggests that the differences cluster in three zzso clusters and do not involve contacts with the class I heavy zzso We predict that human and zzso zzso should bind zzso with the class I heavy chains of the other species, and show that four zzso zzso class I zzso form cell surface complexes with human zzso Further, we predict that zzso (a zzso zzso that recognizes a combined zzso of some class I heavy chains and zzso with a subtle species zzso should bind similarly human or zzso class I molecules that are bound with zzso of either species, supported by evidence of recognition of both zzso and zzso complexes of zzso class I heavy zzso Our findings contribute to the growing understanding of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to the zzso of zzso in zzso
