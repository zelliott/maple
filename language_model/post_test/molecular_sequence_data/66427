Most zzso of molecular clocks require resolved zzso However, one of the zzso relaxed clock approaches accepts input zzso that include zzso We explored the effects of resolved and zzso input zzso in a zzso sequence data set for zzso a member of the seed plant lineage zzso zzso has 10 species in South America, 1 in tropical West Africa, and 20 to 25 in tropical Asia, and explanations for the ages of these zzso involve long-distance zzso and/or the breakup of zzso To resolve relationships within zzso we zzso most of its species for six zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso the nucleus zzso and the zzso gene second zzso and the zzso zzso gene second zzso Because zzso has no fossil record, we relied on fossils from other zzso and from the seed plant lineages zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso a molecular clock and obtain absolute times for zzso divergence zzso zzso among zzso and the other seed plant lineages are still zzso and we therefore used differently resolved zzso including one that contained a zzso zzso among zzso For a small set of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso and zzso satisfied the clock zzso we also obtained time estimates from a strict clock, zzso with one zzso zzso The changing zzso relationships among seed plants (and accordingly changing zzso of distant zzso resulted in small changes of zzso estimates because zzso closest constraints overrode more distant zzso Regardless of the seed plant zzso zzso relaxed clock estimates suggest that the extant zzso of zzso began zzso from each other during the Upper zzso zzso clock estimates imply a zzso zzso These estimates, together with the zzso for zzso from the six combined data sets, imply that the single African species of zzso is not a remnant of a once zzso zzso zzso and zzso range expansions are zzso for the Asian zzso of zzso which stem from an zzso that arrived from zzso These findings fit with seed zzso by water in several species of zzso zzso similarities among apparently young species, and incomplete concerted evolution in the nuclear ITS zzso
