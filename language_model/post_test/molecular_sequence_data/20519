A quantitative linear model accurately zzso zzso zzso describes the zzso of 54 characterized members of a family of zzso zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso made by zzso zzso of three zzso zzso demonstrating that the contributions of zzso sequence blocks to stability are predominantly zzso Thirty-one of 31 predicted zzso zzso II zzso have zzso zzso temperatures higher than the most zzso parent zzso II, from zzso zzso and the model predicts that hundreds more zzso II zzso share this superior zzso Eight of eight zzso zzso zzso zzso the solid cellulosic zzso zzso at temperatures at least 5 degrees C above the most stable parent, and seven of these showed superior activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso model identified a single block of sequence that adds zzso degrees C to zzso zzso zzso individual zzso in this block identified the zzso substitution as responsible for the entire zzso zzso zzso this zzso into the two zzso parent zzso zzso not featuring it zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso increased maximum zzso zzso temperature, and improved long time zzso zzso This zzso also stabilized and improved zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso II, which is only zzso identical to zzso parent zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso increased total zzso zzso zzso II activity zzso by the zzso zzso expression host more than zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso enables quantitative prediction of zzso zzso zzso and efficient identification of stabilizing zzso
