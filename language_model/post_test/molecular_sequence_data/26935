zzso zzso a zzso base of zzso zzso can be employed as a good probe zzso to reveal the significance of the minor groove of zzso zzso in zzso interactions because zzso possesses a similar structure to zzso lacking its zzso zzso In this study, we examined zzso efficiencies of restriction zzso zzso on DNA zzso with zzso in their recognition zzso As a zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso with zzso (in place of zzso was prepared together with its complementary sequences with zzso zzso or zzso zzso as the counter zzso At 37 degrees C incubation for 1 zzso zzso and zzso showed higher DNA zzso zzso on zzso DNA zzso than on normal ones, whereas zzso showed lower values on zzso zzso Such high zzso performance of zzso and zzso on zzso DNA zzso is in contrast to the results obtained 20 years ago, in which short DNA zzso zzso or zzso and low reaction temperatures zzso degrees zzso were zzso These new results suggest that the lack of the zzso zzso group of zzso could contribute to enhanced recognition access of zzso and zzso to DNA zzso
