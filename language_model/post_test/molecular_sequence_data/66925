Ion channel zzso to specific cell surface regions is essential for proper zzso zzso The zzso zzso channel forms large clusters on the plasma membrane of zzso zzso and zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso Using live cell imaging, we address mechanisms underlying this zzso zzso in both zzso cells and cultured zzso zzso The zzso surface clusters have properties unlike those expected for a scaffolding protein bound zzso After channel is delivered to the plasma membrane via zzso transport zzso it remains localized at the zzso zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso zzso and quantum dot tracking experiments indicate that channel within the surface cluster is mobile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso s in zzso cells and zzso zzso The cluster perimeter is not static, because after fusion of adjacent zzso green fluorescent protein zzso completely exchanged between the two zzso within 60 zzso Treatment of zzso zzso expressing zzso with 5 zzso zzso A resulted in a significant increase in average cluster size from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso decrease in cluster zzso Additionally, zzso was no longer restricted to the cell body, suggesting a role for cortical zzso in both cluster maintenance and zzso Thus, zzso surface zzso likely trap mobile zzso channels within a well zzso but fluid, perimeter rather than being tightly bound to a scaffolding zzso zzso Channel moves directly into these clusters via trafficking zzso Such zzso allow for efficient trafficking to the cell surface while zzso channel with signaling zzso
