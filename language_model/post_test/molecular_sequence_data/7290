To date the vaccines most successful in the zzso zzso virus zzso model of AIDS are live attenuated zzso However, the zzso immune response induced after infection of monkeys with attenuated zzso has not been described zzso zzso we investigated the cellular immune response of eight zzso zzso infected with a zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to monkeys infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso developed a zzso zzso zzso In addition, all animals showed a zzso zzso response to recall zzso and zzso In six of eight monkeys zzso zzso zzso directed against different zzso zzso were zzso In two animals, however, the truncated zzso gene reverted to full length 12 weeks after zzso zzso These two monkeys developed zzso zzso indicating an zzso zzso with the onset of disease the animals lost their zzso responsiveness against recall zzso Eight weeks later their zzso zzso against zzso was also zzso The results indicate that live attenuated zzso induced a zzso cellular immune response in monkeys which might be associated with the previously reported resistance to zzso with zzso zzso Paradoxically, if the attenuated zzso reverts in zzso to a more virulent virus, the zzso immune response was inefficient to prevent the onset of zzso in the zzso
