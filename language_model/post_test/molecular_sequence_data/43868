We have previously demonstrated an zzso zzso segregating in a family with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study the regulatory elements with known zzso enhancement activity of the silenced zzso zzso were zzso In the zzso B element, a T was zzso for a C at position - zzso whereas no other zzso were found in the adjacent zzso section of the zzso zzso This substitution was not seen in the zzso B elements of the corresponding genes involved in normal zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso B element sequences of classical functional major zzso complex zzso class I zzso demonstrated a high degree of zzso In contrast, many zzso class I zzso showed zzso in their zzso B zzso These results may indicate that the single zzso detected in the zzso B element plays a pivotal role in the zzso of membrane expression of the zzso zzso
