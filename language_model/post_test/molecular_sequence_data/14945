zzso binding proteins are abundant in bacteria by virtue of their essential roles as zzso receptors in ABC transport systems and zzso One of the best studied of these receptors is the so-called zzso zzso Here, we report the X-ray structure of the zzso zzso protein bound to the zzso relevant zzso zzso solved by molecular replacement, and refined to zzso A resolution with R and zzso values of zzso and zzso The structure identifies three zzso acid zzso that are diagnostic of zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso as opposed to binding to the zzso zzso and zzso These three zzso are zzso in essentially all available zzso protein zzso indicating that the binding of zzso is the rule rather than the exception for receptors of this zzso The role of zzso in bacterial biology is zzso Further, comparison of the available structures provides the most complete description of the zzso changes of zzso protein to zzso The structures follow a smooth and continuous path from the most closed structure zzso bound to zzso to the most open (an zzso zzso
