The authors previously reported increased zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and suggested a possible correlation between changes in zzso protein levels and zzso zzso The current study was performed to identify one of these zzso proteins zzso zzso and to analyze the clinical significance of its zzso 

The protein was zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso and identified by zzso acid sequence zzso The authors studied the expression of this protein in 101 zzso and 23 zzso zzso by zzso methods and in 26 zzso by zzso zzso A survival analysis was performed on patients with advanced zzso using the zzso method with approximate zzso statistics for the log rank zzso 

The target protein for zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found in 19 of 49 advanced zzso zzso by zzso methods and in 9 of 16 zzso by zzso analysis, whereas the frequency was much lower in early zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso In the zzso zzso analysis of strongly zzso positive zzso an intense zzso zzso band was zzso Nine of 21 zzso zzso type zzso showed a zzso positive, high-grade component within a zzso negative, zzso zzso indicating the acquisition of zzso expression during zzso Among 23 patients with a single advanced zzso zzso the zzso free survival time was significantly shorter in the zzso positive group than in the zzso negative zzso 

The results of this study demonstrate the acquisition of zzso expression during zzso and the possible regulation of zzso zzso activity by a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso might play a significant role in promoting the zzso potential of zzso
