A zzso strategy for engineering zzso directed against orphan targets or zzso that are difficult to purify was developed and used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes a zzso zzso of a zzso membrane zzso termed zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso on tumor cells is associated with resistance to zzso drugs, a major obstacle in zzso zzso zzso was used to enrich and screen a zzso zzso library to identify zzso zzso One zzso termed zzso was enriched to a greater extent than others and subsequently was expressed as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso fusion protein bound zzso specifically and inhibited binding of zzso to cells expressing elevated levels of zzso To zzso zzso the zzso zzso determining regions were grafted onto zzso human heavy and light chain variable region zzso zzso zzso that differed between the zzso zzso and the zzso human templates were analyzed and zzso five framework positions potentially important for maintaining the specificity and affinity of zzso were zzso A zzso library consisting of 32 zzso zzso all possible combinations of zzso and human zzso at the five differing framework positions was expressed in a zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso fusion protein was used as surrogate zzso to screen the zzso library to identify the framework combination that most preserved the binding activity of the zzso On the basis of the initial screening against the zzso four zzso zzso were selected for further zzso The binding affinity of these zzso for the zzso fusion protein correlated with their binding to cells expressing elevated levels of zzso Thus, zzso zzso which can be identified for virtually any zzso including those that recognize zzso or zzso zzso can serve as zzso templates for zzso zzso
