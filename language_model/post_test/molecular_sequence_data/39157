To test the zzso of zzso candidate vaccines, a zzso with four repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of the principal zzso domain zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso on zzso were zzso and zzso coupled to a carrier protein zzso zzso of zzso mice and New Zealand White zzso with these zzso vaccines engendered strong zzso responses against the zzso zzso serum zzso by zzso rabbit serum zzso by zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso could induce high levels of zzso zzso in the mice and rabbits zzso serum zzso by zzso rabbit serum zzso by zzso while a zzso zzso zzso vaccine induced a low level of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in mice and zzso To confirm the above results, zzso zzso were isolated from rabbit zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In fact, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso serum were isolated from rabbit zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso serum were identified in rabbit serum induced by zzso zzso In the control group, only zzso zzso proteins per zzso serum were found in pooled zzso serum zzso zzso These results from mouse and rabbit experiments indicate that zzso and zzso vaccines both induce high levels of zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso vaccines may be a new strategy to induce protective zzso
