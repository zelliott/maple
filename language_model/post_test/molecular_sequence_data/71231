The signaling pathways linking zzso zzso to zzso stress fiber zzso during growth zzso cell shape change are still to be zzso Recently our laboratory demonstrated the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso stress fiber formation in Swiss zzso zzso The present work shows that zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso also significantly reduced zzso stress fiber formation, demonstrating a role for zzso zzso activity in this process, most likely upstream of zzso Furthermore, the zzso form of zzso zzso was localized to zzso stress zzso as was previously shown for zzso as well as to a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso known to be capable of association with zzso was present in a predominantly zzso distribution with no presence on zzso zzso suggesting the existence of distinctly localized zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from cell zzso resulted in only partial depletion of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity, confirming the presence of a zzso zzso pool located on the zzso stress zzso Our data, therefore, point to the importance of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in signal zzso and to a novel action of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the stimulation by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso stress fiber zzso
