Ten different zzso resistance plasmids zzso high-level zzso resistance were isolated from an activated sludge bacterial community of a wastewater treatment plant by applying a zzso zzso One of these zzso designated zzso mediates resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and low zzso of zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso and zzso Its size is 47 zzso zzso zzso zzso exists between the zzso zzso zzso module and the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The second zzso backbone module encodes a zzso type zzso zzso system with zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with the help of the zzso zzso zzso providing transfer functions in zzso A 20 zzso resistance region on zzso is located within an zzso zzso zzso The variable region of the class 1 zzso carries the genes zzso for a zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso and zzso for a so far unknown zzso class A extended spectrum zzso The zzso zzso zzso is connected to a zzso resistance zzso consisting of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of unknown zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, a putative mobile element with the zzso resistance genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was identified upstream of the zzso zzso gene zzso The second zzso zzso region on zzso zzso four distinct mobile genetic zzso another zzso belonging to a new class and zzso of two more zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso membrane fusion protein zzso of the zzso is zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso resistance genes zzso zzso and zzso were detected on eight other zzso zzso isolated from activated sludge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also obtained from zzso preparations of the final zzso of the wastewater treatment plant indicating that zzso plasmids are released with the final zzso into the zzso
