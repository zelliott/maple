zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso that degrade most of the zzso making up the zzso zzso zzso zzso infection increases the zzso of zzso in the gastric zzso leading to severe zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate if genetic zzso in zzso involved in the inflammatory response to zzso zzso could zzso patients with chronic zzso zzso infection to develop gastric zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso zzso patients undergoing zzso were zzso for 20 zzso covering the zzso zzso zzso and -9 genes by zzso zzso zzso and single marker analysis was conducted to assess associations with gastric zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso G of the functional promoter zzso zzso was significantly associated with gastric zzso zzso a zzso increased risk zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In addition, carriage of zzso A of a coding zzso in zzso 6 of zzso zzso a zzso increased risk zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso for gastric zzso 

The level of association found in this study is in agreement with the nature of a complex genetic zzso zzso variations in the zzso and -9 gene may be part of a complex genetic risk profile to develop gastric zzso in chronic zzso zzso zzso Further studies are warranted to zzso the zzso role of these genes in zzso
