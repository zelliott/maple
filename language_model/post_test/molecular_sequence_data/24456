The primary structure of the newly sequence zzso zzso tissue protein 13 zzso was highly zzso to several members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso the three-dimensional structure of zzso was built based on high-resolution crystal structures of zzso and also their characteristic zzso fold was found in the case of zzso Our model has been deposited in the Brookhaven zzso Data zzso By multiple sequence alignment and zzso secondary structure zzso we zzso the structural similarity of zzso with its zzso The secondary structure of zzso was identical with zzso zzso consisting of a five- and a zzso zzso joined by two zzso and zzso highly zzso zzso domain zzso was also present in zzso Of the eight consensus zzso in the zzso four identical and three conservatively zzso were shared by zzso By zzso simulations zzso possessed zzso activity with highest affinity to zzso and zzso typical of most zzso All zzso were zzso into the putative zzso of zzso Based on several lines of evidence discussed in this paper demonstrating that zzso is a novel zzso zzso was also designated zzso These zzso results provide some new insights into the possible role and importance of zzso in various processes of the human body and can be of help in the initial steps of further functional zzso
