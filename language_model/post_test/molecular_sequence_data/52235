zzso of the zzso alpha and beta zzso genes is influenced by a complex series of regulatory zzso For example, unequal amounts of zzso zzso are detected in several zzso both at rest and upon zzso zzso even though equal quantities of zzso proteins zzso We therefore studied zzso stability and zzso efficiency of wild type, deletion zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso translation system, to examine the possible role of zzso events in regulating zzso zzso alpha 1 zzso translated less efficiently than beta 1 zzso and zzso less efficiently for zzso translation zzso zzso of the zzso region of alpha 1 zzso significantly increased its translation zzso zzso the alpha 1 zzso region impaired translation of beta 1 zzso when attached upstream of the beta 1 coding zzso This region is zzso and has a complex zzso secondary zzso We propose that differential zzso efficiency may contribute to the equal zzso of zzso proteins in those zzso in which zzso zzso either exist in unequal amounts or are zzso zzso
