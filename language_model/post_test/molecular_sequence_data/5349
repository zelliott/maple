Point zzso in the gene for the zzso zzso have been reported previously in a zzso of patients with severe zzso zzso Here, we investigated the frequency of these specific zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso disorders undergoing treatment with zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso including the critical region zzso zzso from the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso were amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction, and DNA was zzso directly and after transformation in zzso zzso Four of 30 patients with severe zzso zzso displayed a point zzso in the tested zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso Two of the four patients with a zzso zzso zzso developed acute zzso leukemia secondary to zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed in zzso cells taken at different time points in the four patients with the zzso zzso and no correlation between occurrence of the zzso and time or dose of zzso treatment was zzso No point zzso in the zzso zzso critical domain could be detected in cells from the other 26 zzso zzso zzso Additionally, no zzso zzso point zzso could be seen in zzso blood and bone zzso zzso cells from patients with zzso or idiopathic zzso and bone zzso zzso cells from patients suffering from severe zzso zzso Similar results were obtained by zzso et zzso demonstrating that five out of 25 patients with zzso zzso reveal zzso zzso zzso These data show that the point zzso in the critical region of the zzso part of the zzso zzso occur only in a zzso of severe zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that the described zzso zzso point zzso are not correlated with the start, duration or doses of zzso treatment, but might result from genetic instability in the zzso zzso gene in severe zzso zzso
