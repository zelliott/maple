zzso II is a zzso modified zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso which zzso the energy metabolism of sensitive zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso II is zzso which is capable of forming three zzso zzso It was not obvious, however, how the three zzso bridges are zzso To examine the zzso the zzso zzso zzso products of zzso II and its zzso generated by protein engineering, zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by mass zzso Analysis of the wild type zzso and the zzso zzso excluded several possibilities and also indicated a high zzso of formation of the zzso zzso This allowed us to further resolve the structure by analysis zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso of the zzso zzso zzso fragments of the zzso and zzso zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis established the presence of one and two zzso zzso in zzso II and the zzso zzso respectively, thus yielding the final zzso The results of this investigation showed that the zzso part contains three zzso bridges connecting zzso zzso 15, 26, and 27 to zzso zzso 10, 12 and 19, respectively, with zzso being modified to zzso
