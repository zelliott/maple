zzso fusion protein is widely used as an zzso to raise zzso against the zzso of a target zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso in resulting zzso reduces the production of the desired zzso and brings about unwanted zzso immune zzso It is proposed that the carrier protein transgenic animal could be used to solve this zzso To validate this hypothesis, enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso transgenic mice were zzso By zzso the mice with fusion protein zzso we showed that the zzso from the transgenic mice had higher zzso zzso against zzso tag and lower zzso zzso against zzso compared with that from zzso zzso zzso this report describes an improved method to raise high zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso transgenic mice that could have application potential in zzso zzso
