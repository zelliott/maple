A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seeds and its functional expression zzso The zzso protein was highly zzso with those from other plant species zzso while a much lower degree of sequence zzso zzso was found with other organisms such as humans, zzso algae, zzso zzso bacteria and other zzso A zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso containing a disrupted zzso for zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso gene encodes a functional zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene zzso as a different zzso or family zzso Southern zzso revealed several copies of the zzso gene present in the zzso zzso and northern zzso indicated that expression of the zzso may be organ zzso Salt stress during zzso seed zzso had an adverse influence on zzso of zzso greatly reduced transcript levels as the duration of exposure to a saline environment increased and zzso concentration zzso zzso initiation of zzso seeds was severely delayed as zzso level zzso These results suggest that expression of zzso is zzso by salt stress during zzso seed zzso
