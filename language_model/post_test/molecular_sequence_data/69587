Most human T cells express the zzso zzso and either zzso or zzso molecules zzso positive, zzso however, small numbers lack zzso and zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso negative, zzso T cells zzso express certain beta variable region zzso zzso families and may arise via unique zzso zzso Increased percentages of zzso zzso T cells have been identified in some human and zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, their contribution to disease pathology or normal immunity is zzso To study the cell surface zzso and zzso diversity of human zzso zzso T cells, these cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy zzso The proportion of zzso zzso T cells expressing molecules associated with zzso zzso previous exposure to zzso zzso and zzso function zzso zzso and zzso was increased relative to SP T zzso The zzso V beta repertoire of zzso zzso T cells was different from that of zzso SP T cells, although most major gene families were zzso For example, higher proportions of V beta 11, a minor gene family in peripheral blood zzso were found in most zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to mice, no dominant V beta family was used consistently in different human zzso Within an individual zzso zzso T cells possessed an zzso zzso beta repertoire with conservation of several distinct zzso zzso acid motifs with one joined to three different V beta genes in two individuals, suggesting that these cells have undergone a selection process driven by a limited set of zzso The possibility that they may zzso at least in part, originally SP T cells zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso must also be zzso Overall, this study demonstrates that human peripheral blood zzso zzso T cells possess unique zzso and zzso beta repertoire characteristics when compared with the major zzso SP T cell populations and thus may serve specialized zzso functions and/or have an unusual zzso
