For identification of the zzso carrying cellular zzso activity, normal human zzso 2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, or 12 zzso with a zzso marker gene zzso was introduced into the human cervical zzso cell line zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso percent zzso of the zzso clones obtained by the transfer of zzso 2 showed a remarkable change in zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso of them ceased to divide zzso prior to zzso population zzso whereas most of the clones generated by the transfer of other zzso exhibited a zzso similar to that of the parental cells and continued to zzso zzso analyses suggested that cells which escaped from zzso contained only a small zzso derived from the transferred zzso 2, whereas the transferred zzso were apparently intact in most of the continuously growing zzso hybrids with introduction of other zzso These results indicate that the normal human zzso 2 carries a gene or genes that induce cellular zzso in zzso zzso
