Of zzso disorders with suspected zzso zzso zzso are zzso and have an established molecular zzso Although individually zzso zzso diseases collectively account for zzso of infant mortality and zzso of pediatric zzso zzso zzso together with genetic counseling of carriers, has resulted in remarkable declines in the zzso of several severe zzso diseases including zzso disease and zzso zzso However, extension of zzso screening to most severe disease genes has zzso been zzso Here, we report a zzso carrier screen for zzso severe zzso childhood zzso Rather than costly, complete sequencing of the human zzso zzso regions from zzso target genes were enriched by hybrid capture or zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso by next-generation sequencing zzso to a depth of up to zzso zzso and assessed with stringent zzso zzso At a zzso zzso average target coverage, zzso of zzso had at least zzso coverage, and zzso zzso had zzso sensitivity and zzso specificity for zzso zzso zzso and gross deletion zzso and zzso zzso In 104 unrelated DNA samples, the average zzso carrier burden for severe pediatric zzso zzso was zzso and ranged from 0 to zzso The distribution of zzso among zzso samples appeared zzso zzso percent of zzso cited in the literature were found to be common zzso or zzso zzso the need for better zzso databases as part of a comprehensive carrier testing zzso Given the magnitude of carrier burden and the lower cost of testing compared to treating these conditions, carrier screening by zzso made available to the general population may be an economical way to reduce the zzso of and zzso suffering associated with severe zzso childhood zzso
