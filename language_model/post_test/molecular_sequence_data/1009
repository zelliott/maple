The ability of five zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso A, zzso I, and II, zzso crude zzso zzso isolated from the skin of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and four zzso peptides zzso from hybrid striped bass zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined for their ability to reduce the zzso of channel zzso virus zzso and zzso virus 3 zzso All compounds, with the exception of zzso I, markedly reduced the zzso of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was zzso to zzso less sensitive to these zzso Similar to an earlier study employing two other zzso zzso the agents used here acted rapidly and over a zzso zzso relevant, temperature range to reduce virus zzso These results extend our previous findings and strongly suggest that various zzso and zzso zzso may play important roles in protecting fish and zzso from zzso zzso
