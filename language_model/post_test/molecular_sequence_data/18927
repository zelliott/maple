zzso is a bulk degradation zzso that removes zzso materials to maintain cellular zzso The zzso gene 13 zzso and zzso associate protein 1 light chain 3 zzso proteins are required for zzso zzso We demonstrate that each of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interacts with zzso via the zzso interacting region zzso of zzso Using X-ray zzso we solved the zzso structures of zzso and zzso along with the complex structures of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Together, our structural and binding analyses reveal that the zzso of zzso of zzso acts as a gatekeeper to regulate binding of the zzso We verified this observation by zzso of zzso zzso which significantly reduces zzso positive zzso formation in cultured zzso Our results suggest that specific affinity of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso is required for proper zzso zzso
