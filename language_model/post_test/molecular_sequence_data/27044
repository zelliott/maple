zzso zzso zzso has a pivotal role in cell proliferation and is considered a potential target for zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso forms a zzso binding module for zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of minimal zzso that specifically interact with the zzso of human zzso but not those of the closely related zzso and zzso Comparative binding studies and analyses of crystal structures of the zzso zzso in complex with the minimal zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso anchor, whereas the zzso zzso are crucial for providing specificity and affinity to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso peptides was sufficient to induce zzso arrest and zzso cell zzso The mode of interaction between the minimal zzso and zzso may provide a template for designing therapeutic agents that target zzso
