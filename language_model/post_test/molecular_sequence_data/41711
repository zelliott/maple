zzso zzso permits structural analysis of protein zzso in zzso in hanging zzso allowing for comparison with zzso zzso in zzso Nevertheless, the two methods sometimes reveal subtle differences in structure that are often ascribed to the water layer surrounding the zzso The novel method of zzso deposition zzso zzso zzso exploits an intermediate phase that, although zzso zzso has been shown to preserve protein structural features present in zzso The potential of this new approach to bridge the structural gap between proteins in solution and in zzso is explored here with zzso protein zzso of zzso II from zzso zzso In the high-resolution zzso zzso zzso crystal structure of zzso reported here, several segments of the protein chain are present but zzso Analysis of the three kinds of zzso zzso of zzso suggests that most of the subtle differences can indeed be attributed to the water zzso which is shown here to have a similar zzso intensity in glassy and crystal zzso Using molecular dynamics simulations zzso by zzso solution data, two unresolved segments of the zzso crystal structure were modeled as zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso to contain an additional beta zzso The complete zzso structure was compared with that of the zzso protein zzso which plays a more peripheral role in zzso II zzso The comparison suggests possible interaction surfaces of zzso with zzso zzso zzso This work provides the first complete structural picture of this key zzso and it represents the first systematic comparison of zzso data from solution, zzso and zzso states of a zzso
