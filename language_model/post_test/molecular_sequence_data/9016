Heading date and grain weight are two determining zzso traits of crop zzso To date, molecular factors controlling both heading date and grain weight have not been zzso Here we report the isolation of a zzso zzso heading and grain weight zzso which delays heading and reduces grain weight in zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso cell number in the zzso and zzso both zzso the zzso zzso that is known to determine the size and shape of brown zzso zzso cloning and characterization of the zzso gene showed that it encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso domain protein localized in the zzso and nucleus, and functions as a key upstream regulator to promote expressions of heading zzso and grain zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analysis in rice and zzso indicated that zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso with genes zzso various components of zzso machinery, zzso a fundamental role for the zzso zzso in heading date and grain weight zzso
