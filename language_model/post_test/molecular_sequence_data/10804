Multiple zzso zzso type 1 zzso is tightly linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso This region of the human zzso contains additional zzso zzso implicated in the development of zzso diabetes zzso familial zzso type 2, zzso zzso type 5, zzso syndrome and zzso zzso described in zzso zzso zzso We approached cloning of candidate disease genes from zzso by large-scale zzso zzso We obtained zzso 106 zzso of sequence around the zzso gene and established a zzso map that includes: zzso two genes previously localized to zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso center zzso zzso human zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso a novel zzso expressed gene of unknown function zzso center zzso neighboring zzso zzso
