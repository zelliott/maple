The solution structure of the zzso zzso protein zzso a recently identified prostate cancer zzso zzso gene that encodes a zzso acid zzso was zzso The structure of this zzso zzso protein was developed by defining and modeling sections zzso A complete three-dimensional structure for the zzso protein was developed by combining the individually modeled zzso The zzso zzso bundle structure was predicted combining information from several methods including zzso transform analysis of zzso zzso for zzso zzso The structure of the zzso large zzso domain was modeled based on the solved crystal structure of the zzso domain of another zzso zzso protein member, zzso zzso C virus envelope zzso zzso zzso This is a novel protein fold consisting of five alpha zzso held together by two zzso bonds for which the zzso protein is the first solved zzso zzso dynamics studies were performed to test stability and to relax the total model zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso structural model should be a useful tool for predicting modes of zzso and associations with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso binding zzso zzso for probing the interactions of zzso with zzso and with other binding partners are zzso Published 2001 zzso zzso
