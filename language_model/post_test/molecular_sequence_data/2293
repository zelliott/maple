We have analyzed a series of zzso events at the zzso chain locus of the B cell lymphoma, zzso Each of these zzso events results in the replacement of the zzso gene segment of the rearranged H chain gene zzso with that of an upstream zzso gene zzso zzso on the productive and zzso zzso have been zzso In each case, the zzso occurs in close proximity to a highly zzso zzso sequence zzso which is located at the 3' end of the zzso coding zzso In the two examples of zzso on the productive zzso that have been zzso the initial zzso gene is replaced by different zzso zzso On the zzso zzso sequential replacement events have been zzso the initial zzso zzso is first replaced by a closely related zzso zzso followed by a second replacement using a zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis using zzso zzso indicates that these zzso may be accompanied by the deletion of zzso zzso genes belonging to both the zzso and zzso families, suggesting that these gene families are zzso in the zzso zzso
