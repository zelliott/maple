The gene expression profile of peripheral blood zzso zzso from extreme performing pigs after infection with zzso zzso was zzso using a custom complementary DNA zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso zzso Four high performing animals with low zzso zzso three low performing animals with high zzso zzso and one medium performing animal with medium zzso zzso were selected for zzso zzso zzso zzso from these eight pigs collected before and at zzso after zzso infection, was zzso The study identified 92 genes that were zzso and four genes that were zzso in zzso zzso from zzso pigs compared to LP zzso The majority of zzso expressed zzso genes were identified by virtue of their elevated expression in the zzso animals at zzso zzso A large number of zzso DE genes are involved in innate immune response zzso The gene expression profile of 10 DE candidate genes was further explored across the entire pig population in the same infection trial using zzso zzso zzso variation in zzso gene expression was observed, especially in the LP zzso The zzso analysis suggested that only one true LP pig might be present in this study, which contributes significantly to the differential expression profile of the selected genes in zzso animals following zzso zzso This study has therefore identified a set of genes which could serve as molecular indicators for an effective immune response to zzso in pigs and which could also serve as source for gene marker development in molecular zzso studies of zzso immune zzso
