The zzso protein was identified in our laboratory as specific protein zzso C zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso is poorly translated in zzso and acts promoting zzso degradation and establishing a feedback loop of zzso However, our understanding of mechanisms by which the expression of zzso is zzso is zzso In the present work we investigated the zzso expression of zzso in human zzso by Northern zzso and zzso demonstrating that it is highly expressed in brain zzso Moreover, since the zzso analysis of the gene promoter region showed two sites zzso 1 and Box 2) similar to consensus sequences for zzso and zzso factors, we investigated their ability to bind to these zzso zzso mobility shift zzso showed that zzso factors zzso zzso with Box 2, while zzso elements linked zzso Box 1 zzso We suggest that the interaction of these zzso factors with Box 1 and Box 2 could regulate the zzso of the zzso gene and, consequently, the expression of zzso
