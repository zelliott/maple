zzso zzso and other zzso cells harboring the linear double stranded zzso DNA plasmids zzso and zzso zzso a killer toxin consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso into the culture medium zzso zzso 5, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the killer toxin was successfully expressed in zzso zzso when it was cloned on a circular zzso with its putative promoter region replaced with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso zzso of the killer toxin in zzso cells resulted in the death of the host zzso This killing activity by the zzso zzso was prevented by the expression of the killer zzso indicating that the killing activity of the killer toxin complex was carried out by the zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso was zzso as a intact precursor protein with its own signal zzso it was not zzso into the culture medium but remained in the host zzso This indicated that zzso zzso killed host cells from inside of the cells rather than from zzso We further suggested that zzso killer zzso without zzso and zzso zzso did not kill the zzso cells from zzso
