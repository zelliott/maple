zzso proteins are essential molecular zzso regulating multiple cellular processes in distinct zzso zzso In this study, we report the functional characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with an open reading frame predicted to zzso an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso has a well zzso zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased during heat stress at 35 degrees C or zzso zzso zzso also functions as a zzso protein by preventing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The intrinsic zzso activity of zzso was inhibited by zzso an zzso zzso and the zzso reduced the zzso activity of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso
