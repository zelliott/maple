zzso channels exist in the zzso outer membrane of all zzso zzso Of the different zzso present in one zzso it seems that one of these is the zzso zzso whose properties and zzso structure are highly zzso The fundamental role of these channels is to control the flux of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso Based on many functional studies, the fundamental structure of the pore wall consists of one zzso zzso and 13 zzso strands zzso at a zzso zzso This results in a pore with an estimated internal diameter of zzso This structure has not yet been zzso The published zzso structure consists of 19 zzso strands and is different from the functional structure that forms zzso zzso The selectivity of the channel is zzso being able to select for zzso over molecules of the same size and zzso zzso gating involves two separate gating zzso The mechanism involves the zzso of a positively charged portion of the wall of the channel to the membrane surface resulting in a reduction in pore diameter and volume and an inversion in zzso zzso This mechanism is consistent with experiments probing changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Other published mechanisms are in conflict with experimental zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso structure, function, and regulation of zzso zzso
