A full-length zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was characterized in zzso The predicted protein of zzso shows very high sequence identity to reported zzso zzso from various plant zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso was strongly induced by zzso stresses and zzso acid zzso The expression of zzso zzso reporter gene under the control of zzso promoter transformed into rice was strongly induced by drought and salt zzso Interestingly, strong zzso zzso zzso activity was also detected in the transgenic rice containing the reverse sequence of zzso promoter fused to zzso zzso suggesting of a zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso zzso 11 and transgenic plants containing single copy of zzso were tested for drought resistance at zzso zzso The positive transgenic plants zzso was zzso had significantly higher grain yield and seed setting rate than the wild type and the negative transgenic control (no zzso of the zzso under the severe drought stress conditions, whereas the potential yield of transgenic plants under normal growth conditions was not zzso zzso activity zzso showed that the crude protein of the positive transgenic plants had stronger zzso activity than the negative zzso zzso plants had less decrease of total proteins than the wild type under drought zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso might potentially be useful in the genetic improvement of drought resistance in zzso
