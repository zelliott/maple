zzso is a zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso and cancer predisposition syndrome zzso We have identified a novel zzso repeat containing zzso zzso that interacts with zzso The zzso gene consists of 25 zzso maps to human zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 121 zzso zzso appears to be a zzso located protein whereas we and others have shown previously that zzso is predominantly zzso with only a small proportion of cells showing strong zzso zzso However, when zzso and zzso are zzso the proportion of zzso zzso dramatically increases, suggesting that zzso may regulate zzso function by controlling its zzso zzso zzso expression of both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso a secondary body zzso providing further evidence for a functional link between the two zzso This zzso resembles the effects of zzso expression of zzso zzso members and their downstream zzso A possible role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is supported by the observation that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso factor zzso forming a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso give rise to juvenile zzso syndrome, which is clinically similar to zzso Our data suggest an zzso zzso link between these two zzso
