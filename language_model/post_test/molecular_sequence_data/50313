A 15 zzso acid synthetic zzso which spanned the zzso zzso site zzso to zzso zzso in its zzso canine zzso was zzso by zzso zzso Using this zzso in combination with a zzso specific for the zzso region of zzso a simple zzso was developed to monitor zzso zzso of the zzso bond in the zzso zzso zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso D, and mouse zzso were found to be effective in this zzso zzso zzso only this bond to liberate the zzso zzso The pH dependence of the reaction indicated that zzso zzso D, and zzso exhibited significant activity at zzso characteristic for zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso D were shown to process the native precursor at zzso as high as zzso These results, although not proof, are consistent with the idea that zzso with zzso specificity may be involved in the processing of the zzso precursor in zzso zzso
