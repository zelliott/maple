zzso zzso is a member of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso that functions as a negative regulator of skeletal muscle development and growth in zzso However, few reports are available about the structure and function of zzso in zzso Here, the zzso gene was cloned from sea perch zzso zzso by zzso cloning and zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso three zzso two zzso and zzso and 3' zzso sequences were zzso The sea perch zzso gene encodes a zzso acid zzso including a signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that zzso was highly expressed in eyes, brain, and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso liver, and zzso It was demonstrated that zzso zzso was highly expressed in embryonic stem cell line zzso but it was zzso in several types of zzso cell lines from sea perch, including zzso cell, zzso cell, and zzso zzso Further, it was demonstrated that the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene can drive the expression of green fluorescent protein zzso reporter gene in zzso cells and transgenic zzso zzso zzso This is the first report on the expression profile of zzso gene in various types of cell zzso
