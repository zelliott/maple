We here identified human zzso zzso zzso peptides from zzso 3, type 1, zzso zzso and zzso family member zzso zzso that were found to be specifically expressed in cancer cells through zzso expression profile zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso successfully induced specific zzso zzso and these selectively responded to zzso cells expressing both zzso and respective protein while did not respond to parental cells or zzso cells expressing either zzso or respective zzso Furthermore, zzso clones responded to cancer cells that zzso express zzso and respective zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are naturally presented on zzso zzso of human cancer zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are novel zzso zzso zzso and would be zzso for zzso cancer zzso
