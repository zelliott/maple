zzso zzso is an important T cell and mast cell product that zzso in allergic and zzso responses, as well as functions as a growth factor for B, zzso and inflammatory zzso Studies of the expression of zzso by T cells present in inflammatory reactions would be facilitated by using zzso chain reaction zzso coupled to reverse zzso of zzso to amplify the small quantity of zzso present in these zzso In order to use this method in a quantitative manner, a zzso was constructed that contained a modified form of mouse zzso zzso This zzso was transcribed to produce zzso for this modified zzso The zzso was used as an internal standard for the reverse zzso and amplification of zzso transcripts in zzso samples from mouse zzso zzso of zzso native zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso standard zzso produced a 155 zzso product, which reflected a deletion introduced into the original zzso zzso zzso zzso of the amount of the zzso zzso native product to the amount of 155 zzso standard product enabled the quantitative determination of zzso expression in each zzso This method was used to demonstrate that zzso zzso factor increases the expression of zzso in mouse zzso and in a mouse T cell zzso The expression of zzso by zzso exposed to zzso factor zzso may reveal an important link between inflammation and the maturation of T cells in the zzso
