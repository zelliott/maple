zzso zzso a potent zzso and zzso zzso hormone, is almost completely zzso during a single circulation through the rat zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso which can zzso the zzso bond of zzso and zzso zzso zzso act in concert to degrade zzso in the pulmonary zzso To test this hypothesis, an inhibitor of zzso P was designed and zzso zzso - zzso zzso inhibited zzso rat lung zzso zzso P with a Ki value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso or other known zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit zzso degradation in the isolated zzso rat zzso zzso zzso was zzso through the isolated lung in the presence or absence of zzso The zzso was then subjected to zzso to identify and zzso zzso zzso In the absence of zzso no intact zzso was found in the zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso was intact zzso and the remaining zzso indicated zzso of the zzso zzso When zzso (40 zzso was zzso along with zzso degradation of zzso was almost completely blocked zzso zzso zzso intact zzso in the zzso The results indicate that the zzso activity in the rat pulmonary vascular bed can be fully accounted for by zzso P zzso and zzso zzso
