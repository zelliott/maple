zzso plant cell walls lose their ability to expand and become unresponsive to zzso This phenomenon is believed to be due to zzso of zzso zzso or zzso groups in the zzso By screening various zzso zzso we found that zzso of zzso zzso zzso cucumber zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso could restore zzso zzso zzso extension in mature cell walls in zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited similar capacity to zzso zzso zzso and PG also enhanced the zzso zzso extension of the zzso zzso segments of cucumber zzso However, the effective zzso of zzso and PG for enhancing the zzso zzso extension were greater in the zzso segments than in the zzso zzso whereas zzso behaved in the opposite zzso These data are consistent with distribution of more zzso zzso in cell walls of the zzso segments and less zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Associated with the degree of zzso of zzso more calcium was found in cell walls of zzso segments compared to zzso zzso zzso of the calcium zzso zzso could also restore mature cell zzso zzso to zzso by removing calcium from mature cell zzso Because zzso zzso do not zzso other wall zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cannot restore the mature zzso zzso we can conclude that the zzso network, especially zzso bridges, may be the primary factor that determines cucumber zzso mature cell zzso zzso to zzso
