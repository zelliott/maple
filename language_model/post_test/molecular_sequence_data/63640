During zzso maturation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso extensive zzso of zzso proteins generates a large pool of free zzso acids that drive zzso of the zzso zzso By cloning zzso zzso zzso and using mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso to identify the zzso proteins zzso we show that multiple forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the liver, but only a single major class of the zzso derived from zzso zzso in the zzso Some zzso derived from zzso and zzso appear also to be incorporated in the zzso and eggs, but only at background zzso During zzso zzso the zzso zzso heavy chain zzso and its zzso zzso are completely zzso leaving only a processed zzso light chain zzso zzso as the major zzso protein for embryonic zzso The zzso zzso site of the zzso is identified as two zzso acids downstream from the zzso zzso of zzso in Atlantic zzso In addition, although a zzso zzso 18 zzso is present in the zzso it is not fully zzso during the zzso zzso
