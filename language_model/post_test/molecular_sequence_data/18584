zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein whose modification affects protein interaction and zzso zzso In the present study, we show that, under normal growth conditions without stress, zzso interacts with zzso and stress zzso proteins such as zzso nuclear zzso zzso fragile X mental zzso protein and fragile X mental zzso zzso protein 1 in an zzso zzso We also show that, after zzso treatment, a proportion of full-length zzso protein zzso with the typical stress zzso marker zzso zzso zzso in the zzso stress zzso zzso zzso with an zzso central zzso or zzso zzso or zzso segments zzso the zzso central or zzso region, were recruited to stress zzso upon zzso treatment but with reduced zzso In addition, upon zzso treatment, the zzso of zzso changed from a diffuse zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso A similar distribution was observed when cells were treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and was also detected for zzso or zzso domain deletions and all three zzso fragments even without stress zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso treatment delays the zzso of zzso with stress zzso zzso retains zzso in the zzso regardless of zzso zzso Our study indicates that zzso zzso is correlated with recruitment of zzso to stress zzso and zzso and its retention zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of an zzso protein that is shifted simultaneously to zzso stress zzso and zzso two zzso zzso zzso upon zzso
