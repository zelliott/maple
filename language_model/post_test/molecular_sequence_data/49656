The zzso of the coronavirus zzso zzso virus zzso has been engineered as an expression zzso with an infectious zzso The zzso led to the efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso and stable zzso zzso expression of a zzso gene zzso fluorescent protein zzso driven by the zzso sequences zzso of open reading frame zzso zzso inserted in the site previously occupied by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels driven by this zzso were higher than those of an expression cassette under the control of regulating sequences engineered with the N gene zzso The zzso zzso including the zzso gene was still zzso albeit with a zzso to zzso reduction in enteric tissue zzso Interestingly, a specific zzso immune response against the zzso protein has been zzso in zzso and their zzso The engineering of an additional zzso site for the zzso gene between viral genes N and 7 led to instability and to a new genetic organization of the 3' end of the zzso zzso As a consequence, a major species of zzso zzso was generated from a zzso with the zzso core sequence zzso Extension of the zzso between the zzso and sequences at the 3' end of the viral leader was associated with zzso zzso of zzso core zzso The engineered zzso led to expression levels as high as those of well-established zzso and seems very promising for the development of vaccines and, zzso for gene zzso
