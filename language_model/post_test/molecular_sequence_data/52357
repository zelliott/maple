We have introduced two zzso into a full-length human zzso zzso zzso that delete 114 zzso acids or the entire 139 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso versions of the zzso were introduced into cultured Chinese zzso lung zzso cells, which do not produce zzso type I zzso and into zzso mouse cells, which produce zzso zzso zzso chains but not zzso zzso zzso As judged by resistance to zzso neither zzso impaired zzso triple zzso assembly of human alpha zzso zzso in zzso cells, or of zzso type I collagen comprised of human alpha zzso and mouse alpha zzso chains in zzso zzso Thus, the zzso is not necessary for zzso assembly of the main zzso collagen domain of type I zzso In zzso cells the rate of zzso of the zzso zzso was greatly reduced as compared to wild type zzso and by zzso and zzso zzso the zzso chains were shown to be accumulated in large zzso expansions of the rough zzso zzso When such cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso human alpha zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso chains were not rescued and zzso containing the zzso chains were also retained in the zzso zzso By contrast, deletion of the zzso did not affect zzso of zzso containing zzso chains from zzso zzso Thus, an intact zzso appears necessary for efficient zzso of type I collagen from some but not all cell zzso
