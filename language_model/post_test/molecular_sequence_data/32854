The giant protein zzso is essential for zzso muscle development, structure, and zzso All zzso zzso reported to date cause zzso dominant disorders involving either skeletal muscle or the zzso Our aim was to delineate the zzso and determine the genetic defects in two zzso families with an zzso zzso muscle and cardiac zzso 

Clinical and zzso zzso of the five affected children, zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso studies were zzso 

All children presented with zzso muscle weakness and zzso fatal zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso showed zzso centrally located zzso and/or zzso zzso In each family, we identified a zzso zzso deletion in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Both deletions cause a zzso downstream of the zzso zzso domain and protein zzso zzso confirmed that truncated zzso lacking the zzso end were incorporated into zzso zzso 3 was zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso cause the first zzso and purely zzso zzso and the first to involve both cardiac and skeletal zzso These results expand the spectrum of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso segments downstream of the zzso domain are zzso for skeletal and cardiac muscle development, but are crucial for maintaining zzso zzso
