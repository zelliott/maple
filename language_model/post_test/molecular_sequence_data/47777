Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from the zzso fungus zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows that zzso has a modular structure consisting of a zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso domain separated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso consists only of a zzso domain and lacks a zzso and zzso zzso Both proteins are zzso to zzso zzso in family 7 of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso of the zzso and zzso genes is induced by zzso but not by zzso and, in addition, requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso
