In zzso crosses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso only zzso of opposite mating type can form zzso that undergo zzso and zzso producing zzso zzso To determine the role played by the mating type in these steps, the four mat genes were zzso in zzso and introduced into a strain deleted for its mat zzso zzso and zzso analyses of these zzso strain, crossed to each other and to wild type, showed that zzso information is required for recognition of nuclear identity during the early steps of sexual zzso In crosses with strain carrying a zzso zzso two unusual zzso patterns were zzso zzso cells, resulting in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso after zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso identity leads to selfish behavior of the zzso zzso it zzso alone or zzso ignoring its zzso partner in all zzso zzso zzso zzso This behavior is zzso because, in the same zzso the zzso zzso form only zzso zzso In zzso zzso mat genes are thus required to ensure a zzso zzso state but appear zzso for later zzso such as zzso and zzso
