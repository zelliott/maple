The course of human infection with zzso zzso is zzso ranging from zzso infection to chronic zzso It is therefore a useful system in which to study zzso aspects of zzso including the effects of zzso zzso on host zzso In the present study, we report on the cloning of, expression of, and comparative analyses of patient immune response to two different zzso zzso genes zzso to the genes for the zzso zzso and zzso heat shock zzso zzso contains a potent zzso zzso which zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from all zzso zzso individuals to zzso and to produce zzso zzso gamma zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was found to differ depending on the portion of the zzso used to stimulate zzso zzso which represents the nearly full-length zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso In contrast, a approximately zzso protein representing the zzso region of zzso zzso the production of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation from patients with zzso disease but, unlike zzso did not stimulate zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients were not zzso by zzso to either zzso or produce zzso This suggests that the zzso of zzso patient zzso to zzso heat shock proteins does not involve an zzso phenomenon resulting from zzso with self zzso In general, although the zzso profile of patient zzso in response to both of these zzso heat shock proteins represents a mixed zzso pattern, the levels of gamma zzso and zzso were significantly higher than those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Patients with active zzso and zzso disease but not zzso individuals had significant zzso G zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso but not to the zzso zzso It therefore appears that differential patient immune responses to zzso zzso and zzso may be of particular significance in the induction of protective immune responses as well as in the development of tissue damage in cases with particularly strong hypersensitive zzso
