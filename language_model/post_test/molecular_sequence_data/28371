Some of zzso have been known to possess zzso G zzso zzso The zzso coli derived zzso G zzso zzso can catalyze the conversion of zzso G into zzso acid and zzso acid, the latter is used as the starting compound for the industrial formation of zzso zzso Apart from its industrial importance, the zzso PGA displays a number of interesting zzso zzso active zzso is localized in the zzso space of zzso coli cells and composed of two dissimilar zzso The two zzso are apparently produced from a precursor zzso via a processing zzso zzso unique in its features for a zzso zzso The studies on processing of the precursor and on the relationship between structure and function of the mature zzso are important zzso Previously we cloned a zzso zzso DNA zzso from a strain zzso coli AS zzso which displays PGA zzso In this paper, we report a zzso sequence of the zzso zzso DNA zzso containing PGA zzso After zzso of the DNA zzso into zzso I and zzso III sites in zzso 13, zzso 20 had been zzso We zzso the zzso III and zzso II treated zzso of zzso zzso in length from zzso 20 into zzso III and zzso I sites of zzso 13 to get a zzso zzso and zzso II and zzso I treated zzso of zzso zzso in length into zzso I and zzso I sites of zzso 13 to get a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which were zzso with appropriate restriction zzso were progressively shortened from both ends respectively by zzso with Bal 31 zzso followed by zzso of shortened target DNA off zzso DNA molecules with appropriate restriction zzso The series of the DNA fragments shortened from zzso I end were then cloned into zzso zzso 13 which had previously zzso with zzso III and zzso I zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso cloned in zzso 13 were directly zzso on the resulted plasmids by using primer I and primer zzso Thus we have obtained the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso contains an intact PGA gene which is zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
