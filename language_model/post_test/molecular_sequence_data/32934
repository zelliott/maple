DNA zzso signaling by the DNA mismatch repair zzso system is thought to mediate zzso of the zzso drug zzso through molecular mechanisms that could differ from those required for normal mismatch zzso The present study investigated whether zzso zzso properties of zzso coli zzso protein differ when the protein interacts with a DNA zzso containing a zzso mismatch versus a unique site specifically placed zzso compound zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso opposite the 3' zzso zzso zzso exhibited substantial affinity for this compound zzso in zzso and in zzso conditions of zzso contrasting with the normal zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso was also shown to stimulate poorly zzso zzso activity to approach the zzso rate induced by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso distinct zzso changes in the presence of the compound zzso and zzso under zzso conditions as shown by limited zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso compound zzso was shown to induce a 39 degrees rigid zzso of the DNA double zzso contrasting with an zzso state for DNA containing a zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso DNA zzso containing a zzso zzso mimicking a zzso zzso failed to form a persistent zzso complex with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso We propose that DNA zzso could play a role in zzso zzso zzso induced by a compound zzso and that zzso DNA damage signaling by the zzso system could be modulated in a direct zzso
