zzso incorporation of the unusual zzso acid zzso in zzso requires a coding region zzso zzso (which otherwise serves as a termination zzso a zzso zzso sequence zzso in the zzso region of the zzso and zzso The mechanisms involved in zzso recognition by the zzso zzso machinery remain zzso We report the detection of zzso proteins that specifically recognize the zzso from human cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel shift zzso showed three retarded bands after incubation with zzso whole cell zzso or zzso zzso fraction or with extracts from zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The specificity of the binding was demonstrated by competition by cold zzso zzso zzso and by lack of competition by other zzso species with similar zzso secondary structures, such as the human zzso virus zzso zzso region of zzso zzso element, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso revealed at least two zzso with estimated molecular masses of 55,000 and zzso zzso that bind to the zzso zzso of a series of zzso and deletion zzso zzso indicated recognition of the zzso primarily through the zzso stem region, although the upper zzso loop, and two of three short zzso sequences also appear to contribute to the affinity of the zzso
