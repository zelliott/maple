We cloned a approximately 70 zzso rat zzso outer membrane protein zzso with a sequence identity of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Even with this low sequence identity, however, the proteins share a remarkable structural zzso they have zzso zzso repeat motifs and are anchored to the outer membrane through the zzso zzso domain with the bulk portion located in the zzso zzso against zzso inhibited import of zzso such as the zzso carrier and zzso that use internal targeting signals but not the import of zzso zzso zzso Blue native gel zzso and zzso of zzso zzso outer zzso revealed that zzso was loosely associated with the approximately 400 zzso zzso complex of the zzso outer zzso which contains zzso and zzso A zzso zzso system demonstrated that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a functional zzso of zzso zzso and functions as a zzso of the zzso import machinery of the rat zzso outer zzso Furthermore, the zzso 66 zzso region of zzso which comprises a zzso 41 zzso zzso domain, a 22 zzso zzso domain and three zzso zzso is sufficient to act as a zzso zzso and the zzso cluster is crucial for this zzso
