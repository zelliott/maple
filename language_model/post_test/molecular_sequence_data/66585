zzso replication of the zzso human zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso has important implications in zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have been temporally classified as exhibiting zzso zzso early, and late expression zzso Though the regulation of zzso and early gene expression has been studied zzso very little is known regarding the regulation of late gene zzso Late zzso which primarily zzso zzso structural zzso require viral DNA replication for their zzso We have identified a zzso zzso 68 zzso early zzso zzso zzso essential for viral zzso zzso is zzso in both zzso and zzso By generating an zzso zzso virus, we characterized the stage of the virus zzso cascade that requires the function of zzso Gene expression profiling and zzso of viral DNA synthesis of the zzso virus revealed that the expression of early genes and viral DNA replication were not zzso however, the zzso of late genes was zzso zzso we have identified a zzso factor essential for the expression of late genes independently of viral DNA zzso
