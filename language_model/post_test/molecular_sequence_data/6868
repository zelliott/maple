zzso is a plasma protein from the zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso Most known zzso contain two binding sites for zzso one in each of two zzso zzso called the zzso and zzso However, native zzso does not bind zzso but zzso binds one zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso constant zzso of approximately zzso zzso To pursue structural analysis of the zzso binding sites, zzso zzso zzso was used to construct a zzso expression zzso that directs synthesis and zzso of a approximately zzso zzso zzso protein zzso in cultured insect zzso Culture medium harvested from infected cells contained zzso zzso of zzso binding zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso and pH dependence zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso are similar to native zzso zzso proper folding and functional zzso Another zzso expression zzso was constructed to zzso a deletion zzso of zzso consisting of the first 20 zzso zzso containing the zzso signal sequence spliced to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso This zzso directed the zzso of a approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso that was recognized by zzso zzso zzso also exhibited zzso binding activity with a lower affinity zzso of approximately zzso zzso a zzso faster zzso rate for zzso than native zzso and a pH dependence zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
