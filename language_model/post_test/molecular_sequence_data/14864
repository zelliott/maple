zzso are a class of small zzso zzso that function as key regulators of gene expression at the zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is frequently zzso in cervical cancer, and its expression reduces the zzso migration, and zzso of cervical cancer cells, whereas zzso its expression results in enhanced zzso migration, and zzso zzso binds to the zzso of zzso zzso 7 zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we are the first to show, using quantitative real-time zzso that zzso is frequently zzso in cervical zzso The zzso of zzso markedly zzso cervical cancer cell zzso migration, and invasion, whereas zzso expression of zzso significantly enhances these properties, indicating that zzso might function as an zzso in cervical zzso The restoration of zzso expression can counteract the effect of zzso on cell zzso migration, and zzso of cervical cancer zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso is a new regulator of zzso and both zzso and zzso play important roles in the zzso of cervical zzso
