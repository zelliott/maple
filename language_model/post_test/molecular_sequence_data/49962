zzso zzso zzso genes constitute the basis for the sense of smell and are zzso by the largest zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso In humans, zzso of these are zzso In contrast, the mouse OR repertoire, although of roughly equal size, contains only approximately zzso zzso We asked whether the high fraction of zzso OR genes is specific to humans or is a common feature of all zzso To this end, we have compared the sequences of 50 human OR coding regions, regardless of their functional zzso to those of their putative zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that humans have accumulated zzso that disrupt OR coding regions roughly zzso faster than any other species zzso As a consequence, the fraction of OR zzso in humans is almost twice as high as in the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso process of OR gene zzso likely due to a reduced zzso dependence relative to zzso
