We and others have recently cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso and zzso that shares both overall domain structure and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso We have studied the zzso zzso and potential function of these related zzso in zzso rat liver zzso cells that express zzso and zzso at roughly similar zzso zzso is nearly fully zzso in resting zzso zzso In contrast, while zzso is not zzso in zzso cells, zzso II increases zzso zzso by zzso With regard to zzso zzso zzso is correlated with stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways but not with the stimulation of zzso protein zzso or zzso In this report we assessed the contribution of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso of focal contact zzso In adherent zzso cells, the zzso activity of zzso was correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A rapid increase in the zzso zzso of each protein was detected after treatment with zzso II or other zzso that stimulate zzso the prolonged zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso was the most substantial zzso In the zzso cell line that expresses zzso less zzso than zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso is similarly zzso zzso of zzso from zzso cells revealed zzso zzso complexes that persisted in 500 zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The complexes were largely independent of the zzso zzso state of either zzso Surprisingly, we did not detect zzso complexes in zzso using either of two zzso zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso zzso in zzso cells, both zzso associated with zzso but the zzso of zzso appeared to be zzso In addition, in zzso zzso cells, complexes between zzso and another potential zzso zzso were zzso In zzso in zzso rat liver zzso cells stimulation of zzso was highly correlated with zzso zzso zzso in addition, zzso but not zzso was zzso to zzso at zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso changes in zzso cells might proceed, in part, by zzso zzso
