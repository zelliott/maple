The equilibrium zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied using zzso and circular zzso zzso The zzso unfolding of zzso at pH zzso can be described by a two-state unfolding mechanism based on the zzso of the CD and zzso unfolding zzso Assuming a two-state mechanism and a linear dependence of the free energy of unfolding on zzso zzso a value of zzso zzso was calculated for the free energy of unfolding in the absence of zzso zzso zzso However, when zzso was used as a zzso at pH zzso a zzso unfolding transition was zzso This unfolding transition has a distinct zzso occurring at zzso M zzso which is indicative of the formation of stable folding zzso Similar intermediate folded species were also observed at pH zzso when either zzso or zzso were used as zzso The intermediate folded states of zzso exhibited a tendency to aggregate, as judged by the concentration dependence of their zzso zzso The zzso zzso maximum of zzso at pH zzso in the presence of zzso M zzso for example, was zzso from zzso zzso at a protein concentration of 50 zzso to 336 zzso at 500 zzso Intermediate formation at pH zzso using 10 zzso sodium zzso buffer and zzso as the zzso was facilitated by the addition of zzso and zzso M salt, where the salt was either zzso or zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
