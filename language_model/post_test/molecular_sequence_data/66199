zzso zzso C2 toxin belongs to the family of zzso AB type toxins that are structurally organized into distinct zzso zzso zzso and binding zzso zzso zzso The zzso activated zzso zzso binding component is essential for zzso transport into target zzso It zzso into zzso and forms channels in zzso zzso zzso The zzso channel is zzso and can be blocked by zzso and related zzso zzso zzso of zzso contain a zzso pattern of alternating zzso and zzso zzso which has been implicated in the formation of two zzso zzso involved in membrane zzso and channel zzso In the present study, zzso zzso created by substitution of different zzso charged zzso acids by zzso zzso were analyzed in artificial zzso zzso zzso The results suggested that most of the zzso zzso formed zzso zzso zzso similar to wild zzso The zzso zzso charged zzso acids did not influence channel properties with the exception of zzso and zzso which are probably localized in the zzso near the channel zzso These zzso show a dramatic decrease in their affinity for binding of zzso and its zzso Similarly, zzso which represents the zzso in anthrax protective zzso was zzso in zzso in several other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso not only showed altered zzso binding but also had drastically changed single channel zzso The results suggest that zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso have a major impact on the function of zzso as a binding protein for zzso delivery into target zzso
