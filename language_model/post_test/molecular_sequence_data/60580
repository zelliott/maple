zzso muscular zzso zzso is linked to the zzso zzso locus on zzso zzso In zzso individuals, this locus comprises zzso tandem copies of members of the zzso dispersed repeat zzso zzso leaving zzso such repeats have been associated with zzso for which no candidate gene has been zzso We have determined the complete zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the only two zzso elements left in the affected zzso locus of a patient with zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the two zzso repeats were zzso They contain a putative promoter that was not previously zzso with a zzso instead of a zzso box, and a zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene fused to zzso of this promoter, demonstrated strong activity in zzso human zzso zzso cells that was affected by zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso In addition, these zzso repeats include an open reading frame zzso starting zzso downstream from the zzso box and zzso a 391 zzso protein with two zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in a rabbit zzso zzso yielded two zzso zzso zzso Met labeled products with apparent molecular weights of 38 and zzso on zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we propose that each of the zzso elements in the partially deleted zzso locus could include a zzso gene zzso a double zzso zzso
