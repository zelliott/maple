The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso protein interacts with DNA to regulate gene expression at numerous unrelated zzso in the zzso zzso By a combination of zzso zzso and internal zzso we have defined an internal 235 zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso protein that can bind efficiently to the zzso binding site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This domain spans zzso zzso to zzso of the full length protein and lacks any zzso to the DNA binding zzso zzso or zzso structural zzso All the zzso binding sites we have tested bind domain zzso arguing that zzso binds all its zzso sites via this zzso The domain could not be further reduced in size suggesting that it represents the minimal functional DNA binding zzso The relevance of potential regions of secondary structure within the minimal binding domain is zzso
