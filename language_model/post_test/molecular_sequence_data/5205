To characterize zzso and zzso mechanisms that regulate zzso class I zzso during development and in adult zzso we have used transgenic mice to study a series of human zzso zzso class I gene zzso Previous studies identified the zzso zzso to zzso region as sufficient to direct appropriate and efficient zzso levels of zzso zzso relative to zzso class zzso zzso here show that DNA zzso of zzso zzso is not required for any aspect of zzso As the expression level correlated with the zzso copy number, was comparable to zzso or a zzso copy basis and was independent of integration site, the zzso to zzso segment also functions as a locus control zzso With this region, sequences 3' of zzso zzso possibly at the promoter, appear to direct the appropriate tissue zzso Of zzso sequences in the zzso to zzso region, zzso B box is zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso implicated region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and alpha in class I regulation as they are zzso in a zzso pattern that zzso with zzso zzso of alpha leads to decreased expression and loss of occupancy not only at alpha but also at region zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, site alpha is an essential class I regulatory element, the dominant function of which is to mediate zzso occupancy at multiple adjacent zzso sites, possibly by zzso stable synergistic interactions between factors at these distinct zzso
