Broad applications of zinc finger zzso zzso zzso allows targeted zzso zzso research, medicine, and biotechnology are hampered by the lack of a convenient, zzso and publicly available method for the synthesis of functional zzso Here we describe an efficient and zzso zzso method using publicly available zinc fingers to make zzso that can modify the DNA sequences of predetermined zzso sites in human zzso We zzso and tested hundreds of zzso to target dozens of different sites in the human zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso found that many of these zzso induced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Because human cells that harbor zzso zzso zzso are functional and normal, these zzso might be used for zzso knocking out zzso to produce zzso that are resistant to zzso infection in AIDS patients or zzso inserting therapeutic genes at zzso zzso in gene therapy zzso
