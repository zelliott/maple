The architecture of zzso proteins controls fine-tuned zzso properties of this class of zzso Most zzso proteins are tandem modular in structure, consisting of many individually folded zzso of varying zzso Upon zzso these elements unfold zzso following a strict zzso pattern determined by their mechanical stability, where the weakest element unfolds first and the strongest unfolds zzso Although such a zzso architecture is zzso for biological functions of zzso zzso it may become incompatible with incorporating proteins of desirable functionality in order to construct zzso artificial zzso zzso as many of these desired proteins are not evolved for mechanical zzso Thus, exposure to a high stretching force will result in unraveling of these proteins and lead to a loss of their zzso To overcome this challenge, we combine protein engineering with single zzso force zzso to demonstrate that domain zzso is an effective strategy to control the mechanical unfolding hierarchy of zzso proteins and effectively protect mechanically zzso zzso As a zzso experiment, we spliced a mechanically zzso T4 zzso zzso into a flexible loop of a mechanically stronger host domain zzso to create a domain zzso zzso Using single zzso force zzso we showed that the mechanically zzso zzso domain unfolds only after the mechanically stronger host domain zzso has zzso Such a reverse mechanical unfolding hierarchy effectively protects the mechanically zzso zzso domain from applied stretching force and significantly increased the lifetime of zzso The approach demonstrated here opens the possibility to incorporate zzso proteins into zzso proteins for engineering novel zzso zzso zzso
