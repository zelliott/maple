In zzso zzso zzso detects the stalled DNA replication zzso This critical role of zzso is ascribed to its ability to bind to the 3' end of a nascent leading DNA strand in the stalled replication zzso The crystal structures in complexes with zzso and the combination of zzso correlation zzso and zzso reveal that the zzso domain of zzso possesses a binding pocket for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso The interaction with the zzso zzso is essential for the zzso zzso In contrast, the direct interaction with zzso zzso is unexpected, considering the same affinity for zzso carrying the four bases at the 3' zzso Thus, the zzso domain of zzso recognizes the zzso base in a zzso manner, in addition to the zzso and zzso zzso group, of the zzso zzso to acquire both sufficient affinity and zzso to find all of the stalled replication zzso generated during DNA zzso This unique feature is prerequisite for the proper positioning of the zzso domain of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso
