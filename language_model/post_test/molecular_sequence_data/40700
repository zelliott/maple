zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are two closely related zzso with very different host zzso This study was designed to examine the genetic and transcript level variations of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Thirty-one genes representing 10 gene families were selected for comparison and complete zzso and zzso sequences were zzso zzso analyses of the selected genes identified 104 zzso between the two zzso 37 of which are expected to zzso changes in their zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the differences in levels of transcript between zzso and TE grown over zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in transcript expression between zzso and TE were gene specific and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso across all genes ranged from zzso to zzso Despite their overall genetic zzso zzso and TE exhibit a moderate degree of zzso in the zzso zzso of their zzso zzso and the extent to which they are transcribed when grown in an zzso zzso zzso Such differences may contribute to how these genetically similar organisms have adapted to zzso divergent host zzso
