The group B zzso an important cause of invasive infections in the zzso is classified into four major zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso based on the structure of the zzso zzso Since the capsule is a known zzso factor, it has been extensively zzso in particular in type III zzso which cause the majority of invasive zzso Two cell surface zzso alpha and zzso have also been studied in detail since they zzso protective zzso but these proteins are usually not expressed by type III zzso We describe here a cell surface zzso designated protein zzso zzso to zzso zzso group B), that zzso protective immunity and is expressed by most strains of type zzso zzso zzso was first identified as a distinct zzso protein in extracts of a type III strain, and was zzso to zzso from that zzso zzso zzso to protein zzso was used to demonstrate that it is expressed on the cell surface of 31 out of 33 type III zzso but only on 1 out of 25 strains representing the other three zzso Mouse protection tests showed that zzso to protein zzso protects against lethal infection with three different strains expressing this zzso including a strain representing a recently identified high zzso type III zzso zzso zzso is zzso unrelated to the alpha and beta zzso but shares several features with the alpha zzso Most importantly, the zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso and alpha proteins are identical at 6 out of 12 zzso In addition, both protein zzso and the alpha protein are relatively resistant to zzso (and zzso is also resistant to zzso and both proteins vary greatly in size between different clinical zzso Finally, both protein zzso and the alpha protein exhibit a regular zzso pattern in zzso experiments, which may reflect a repetitive zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso and alpha proteins are members of a family of proteins with related structure and zzso Since protein zzso zzso protective zzso it may be valuable for the development of a protein vaccine against the group B zzso an zzso zzso
