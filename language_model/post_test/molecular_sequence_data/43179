The majority of patients with zzso syndrome zzso and zzso syndrome zzso have deletions of zzso region zzso The abnormalities observed in these patients include zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and characteristic facial zzso To understand the genetic basis of these disorders, we have characterized genes within the region that is most consistently deleted in patients with zzso the minimal zzso critical region zzso In this report, we present the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso in the zzso with zzso to the zzso family of zzso zzso Further, we provide evidence that this gene is expressed in a limited number of adult zzso as well as in early human zzso The identification of zzso required a zzso zzso approach because of its restricted expression and high zzso zzso The early zzso together with the known role of zzso proteins in development, make zzso an outstanding candidate for some of the abnormalities seen in zzso
