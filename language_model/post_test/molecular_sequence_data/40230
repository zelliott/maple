The metabolism of starch is of central importance for many aspects of plant growth and zzso Information on leaf starch metabolism other than in zzso zzso zzso is zzso Furthermore, its importance in several zzso important traits exemplified by zzso remains to be zzso To address this issue, we have provided detailed information on the genes involved in starch metabolism in zzso zzso and have characterized a comprehensive collection of forward and zzso (for zzso zzso Local zzso IN zzso reverse zzso zzso affecting five zzso of starch synthesis and two zzso of starch zzso The zzso provide new insights into the zzso relationships of zzso zzso and zzso water zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso indicate that the pathways of leaf starch metabolism in zzso zzso and zzso are largely zzso However, the importance of these pathways for plant growth and development differs substantially between the two zzso Whereas essentially zzso zzso plants lacking zzso zzso grow slowly relative to zzso plants, the equivalent zzso of zzso zzso grows normally even in a zzso zzso In contrast, the loss of zzso zzso zzso required for starch degradation, has a far greater effect on plant growth and fertility in zzso zzso than in zzso Moreover, we have also identified several zzso likely to be affected in new components or regulators of the pathways of starch zzso This suite of zzso provides a substantial new resource for further investigations of the zzso of carbon and its importance for symbiotic nitrogen zzso zzso seed development, and zzso and zzso zzso
