zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso gene family with zzso to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso receptors and is thought to form a complex with zzso and zzso This complex is also found at the zzso in zzso and defines the zzso component of the zzso protein zzso Previously we have cloned several zzso zzso from mouse brain and zzso Here we show that these transcripts are the products of a single gene located on zzso mouse zzso zzso To investigate the diversity of zzso transcripts we have determined that the mouse zzso gene is organized into 24 coding zzso that span between 130 and 170 zzso at the zzso zzso The gene encodes at least three distinct protein zzso that are expressed in a zzso zzso Interestingly, although there is only zzso zzso acid identity between the zzso regions of zzso and zzso the positions of 8 of the 15 zzso junctions are zzso
