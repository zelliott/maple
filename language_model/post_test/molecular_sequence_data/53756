We describe a new interface for a zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso that allows rapid switching between zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso modes of zzso zzso performance in both modes is comparable zzso resolution approximately 10,000 zzso mass accuracy zzso zzso sensitivity approximately 1 zzso because the zzso source is zzso from the zzso mass zzso by extensive gas zzso in the zzso stages of the zzso The capacity to obtain side-by-side high quality zzso and zzso mass zzso from a single zzso mixture greatly zzso the identification of proteins and zzso of their primary zzso zzso strategies for protein identification result from this ability to measure zzso using both zzso modes in the same instrument and to perform zzso on zzso charged as well as multiply charged zzso Examples are provided to demonstrate the utility and performance of the modified zzso
