The zzso family of plant proteins is of interest because of their unique zzso which combines a zzso zzso backbone with an embedded zzso zzso and because their remarkable chemical and biological properties make them ideal candidates as zzso templates for biologically active zzso zzso The present study describes the first steps towards exploiting the zzso framework by zzso and structurally characterizing two grafted zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The modified peptides have polar or charged zzso zzso for zzso that form part of a zzso zzso patch that plays a significant role in the folding and biological activity of zzso zzso Both zzso retain the native zzso fold, but lack the zzso zzso activity of their parent zzso zzso zzso This finding confirms the tolerance of the zzso framework to zzso zzso and opens up possibilities for the substitution of biologically active zzso zzso into the zzso
