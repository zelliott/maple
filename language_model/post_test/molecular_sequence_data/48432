zzso to zzso zzso and zzso B zzso antibiotics is mainly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and various mechanisms are involved in the zzso B zzso zzso of zzso resistance and its genetic mechanisms were analyzed for a total of 159 strains of zzso zzso isolated from clinical specimens in a university hospital in Japan from 1997 to zzso Resistance to zzso zzso and zzso was detected in zzso and zzso of all the strains zzso respectively, and expression of resistance was totally zzso Although none of the strain was resistant to zzso zzso 28 strains zzso showed intermediate resistance to zzso zzso 2 zzso The zzso gene was detected in 139 strains zzso and zzso was found in all the strains zzso whereas no other known zzso resistance genes were zzso The zzso regulator region zzso containing a coding region of the leader zzso was classified into 13 genetic variations zzso M, zzso D, and R zzso in 56 zzso However, no zzso was identified between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance, or reduced zzso to zzso although most of zzso strains were assigned to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains were classified into five zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso types, including four types of zzso complex zzso five sequence types zzso including four zzso of zzso and several resistance zzso factor zzso The present study revealed the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso which are composed of zzso strains in Japan, and more genetic diversity in the zzso zzso than those reported zzso
