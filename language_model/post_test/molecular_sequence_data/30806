The DNA replication requirement for zzso virus late gene expression was zzso by zzso a late zzso reporter gene into infected cells in the presence of a DNA synthesis zzso This late promoter zzso block was overcome by zzso either naked linear zzso zzso DNA or three cloned viral genes zzso zzso zzso of 17, 26, and 30 zzso These newly identified zzso genes were independently transcribed only from zzso or zzso zzso These data suggest a regulatory cascade in which the parental viral zzso serves as a template for the zzso zzso and early zzso zzso factors that are packaged in the infectious zzso the newly zzso DNA is accessible to zzso zzso intermediate zzso and late zzso zzso
