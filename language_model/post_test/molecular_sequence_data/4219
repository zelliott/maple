The zzso zzso channel zzso of neurotransmitter receptors are proteins responsible for rapid transmission of nerve impulses at the zzso and have, therefore, been the subject of intensive research for many zzso The zzso family, of which the zzso zzso is a member, includes the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A diverse range of zzso and artificial zzso activate these zzso but, zzso the family shares many similarities of structure and zzso Several important questions, however, still remain to be determined, including the mechanism of zzso recognition at the binding site, the nature of the connection between the zzso binding and channel zzso the structure of the zzso regions and the mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso This article reviews recent advances in the characterization of the molecular properties of the zzso zzso and their role in its function, and zzso its suitability as a model system for the study of the above zzso
