zzso zzso zzso are zzso involved in the zzso maturation of zzso zzso In the present work, a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso a major neuroendocrine zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid zzso exhibits highest sequence identity, especially in the zzso domain, with zzso from zzso and zzso and less with zzso and zzso zzso It was demonstrated by in zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso sections that zzso is expressed in a large number of zzso zzso including those producing the well known zzso zzso zzso
