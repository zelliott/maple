The formation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The active form of the barley zzso appears to be a zzso of identical zzso with a molecular mass of 46 zzso From the zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso ends of the mature protein as well as an internal zzso were zzso DNA zzso deduced from these zzso sequences were used to amplify with the zzso chain reaction a zzso sequence zzso part of the zzso zzso a zzso library with this DNA zzso identified a full-length clone zzso the zzso precursor of the zzso zzso The transit zzso for zzso import consists of 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso and a precursor form were expressed on a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both zzso gene products reacted with an zzso against the barley zzso zzso Active barley zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli was shown to be active in zzso of bacterial cell zzso As a gene symbol for barley zzso zzso zzso is zzso
