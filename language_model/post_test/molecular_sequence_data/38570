zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso The zzso exhibiting this activity was zzso to zzso and zzso It appears to be a typical zzso as it contains tightly bound zzso acting as zzso instead of zzso Other characteristics indicate that it is highly similar to the known zzso alcohol zzso zzso from zzso zzso it is a zzso of 150 zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing zzso zzso showed that zzso of these zzso acids are identical in the two zzso it has optimal activity at pH zzso it lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso it zzso the zzso of a broad range of zzso primary and secondary zzso either zzso or aromatic, and formaldehyde, with the zzso reduction of the artificial electron zzso zzso zzso could be replaced by an zzso but not formaldehyde, the zzso specificity of the zzso for the zzso reflecting that for the corresponding zzso The latter also applied to the low zzso zzso activity displayed by the zzso From this, together with the results of the induction studies, it is concluded that zzso functions as the main zzso zzso in the zzso of many, but not all, alcohols by zzso zzso and may also zzso zzso zzso of alcohols and zzso under certain zzso It is anticipated that the zzso may be of even wider significance since structural data indicate that zzso is also present in other zzso zzso
