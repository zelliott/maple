zzso zzso protein 4 zzso is a zzso and zzso protein and is recognized as the first zzso zzso zzso efforts to crystallize the complete zzso tail zzso which exhibits all the known biological functions, have been zzso and to date, the structure of only a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso has been zzso Recent studies indicate that the zzso domain zzso from zzso 135 to 141 as well as the extreme zzso are critical zzso of virus zzso and the zzso ability of the zzso Among the five zzso zzso identified, those belonging to zzso zzso B and C possess either a zzso at position 138 or a zzso at zzso while those of zzso D and E lack these zzso in the zzso suggesting zzso differences in this region among different zzso Here, we examined the zzso properties of several deletion zzso and report the structure of a zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso 94 and zzso 29 zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso and zzso A, zzso In spite of the high resolution of one of the structures, electron density for the zzso 9 zzso could not be seen for either of the zzso and the crystal packing resulted in the creation of a clear empty space for this zzso Extension of the zzso zzso beyond zzso 146 hindered zzso under the experimental zzso The present structure revealed significant differences from that of the synthetic zzso in the zzso of zzso acids at the end of the zzso as well as the crystal packing zzso to the additional space required to accommodate the zzso structured zzso zzso The crystal structure and secondary structure prediction of the zzso zzso from different zzso suggest that the region zzso to zzso 137 in all the zzso proteins is likely to be zzso and this might be of structural and biological functional zzso
