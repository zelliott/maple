zzso acid zzso zzso was extracted and zzso from cultured zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso C to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were determined by sequence analysis of 9 peptides derived from zzso zzso I zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso zzso library by zzso with synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to the partial zzso acid zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences of the clones revealed a zzso sequence with a zzso untranslated region of 41 zzso an open reading frame of zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso untranslated region of 62 zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso to that of zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso and 37% zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso The constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso had almost the same molecular activity as the native zzso against zzso zzso
