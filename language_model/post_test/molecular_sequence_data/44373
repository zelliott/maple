zzso of zzso factors in zzso zzso is controlled by a complex regulatory network, at the center of which is zzso a zzso family zzso zzso We report here that expression of zzso and production of zzso zzso factors are affected by products of the putative zzso zzso zzso is required for production of an zzso factor zzso tentatively identified as the fatty acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso but a zzso function for zzso could not be deduced from DNA sequence zzso The other genes in the putative zzso are predicted to zzso proteins zzso to members of zzso signal zzso zzso zzso has zzso acid similarity to zzso zzso sensors, whereas zzso and zzso are similar to response zzso zzso is quite unusual because its putative output domain strongly resembles the zzso zzso domain of a sensor zzso zzso of the zzso factors zzso I, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was reduced zzso to zzso only in zzso with a zzso zzso in zzso zzso express zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso expression of zzso was reduced zzso Both a zzso zzso and zzso expression were restored by addition of zzso zzso to growing zzso zzso with polar insertions in zzso or lacking the entire zzso region produced zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso The genetic data suggest that zzso and zzso function together to regulate expression of zzso but the zzso mechanism for this is zzso At low levels of the zzso it is likely that zzso zzso zzso and then zzso interacts either with zzso (which is required for full expression of zzso or an unknown component of the signal cascade to inhibit expression of zzso When the zzso reaches a threshold zzso we suggest that it reduces the ability of zzso to zzso zzso resulting in increased expression of zzso and production of zzso zzso
