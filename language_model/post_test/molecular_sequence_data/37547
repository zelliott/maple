The genes zzso aromatic zzso II zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso have been identified, expressed in zzso coli and the zzso proteins zzso The zzso II zzso was specific for the zzso reaction of the aromatic zzso zzso and uses zzso as the zzso zzso Like the previously characterized zzso I, zzso II has highest efficiency for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed that zzso I was mainly expressed when zzso was the primary carbon and energy zzso Although the expression was significantly lower, a similar trend was observed for zzso zzso These observations suggest that both zzso are involved in zzso acid zzso Although zzso exhibited highest activity with zzso and zzso zzso approximately 105 zzso it also showed significant activity with zzso zzso and the aromatic zzso zzso With zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso No activity was detected with either zzso zzso acids or zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso was expressed as a zzso message as part of the zzso zzso with expression observed only when the aromatic zzso acids were absent from the growth zzso indicating a role in the zzso of the aromatic zzso zzso
