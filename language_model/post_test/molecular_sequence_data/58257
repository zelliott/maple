The rat zzso zzso is one of the six members of the rat tissue zzso family isolated to zzso It is zzso identical to zzso zzso and both zzso are thought to have zzso zzso Recently we have shown that zzso and zzso have distinct zzso zzso and sensitivities to zzso despite their similar zzso Unlike all other zzso zzso zzso zzso is resistant to zzso by zzso We have developed a 3-D model of zzso based on the known X-ray structures of zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso to identify the structural features underlying this functional zzso The final zzso model is structurally similar to zzso but variable regions surrounding the active site differ quite markedly from the reference zzso The zzso loop, which differs from that in zzso zzso by a zzso zzso has been generated de zzso and subjected to simulated zzso to assess its influence on the restricted zzso specificity of these zzso The proposed zzso of the specificity pocket in zzso differs from that of other zzso zzso but it can still accommodate both aromatic and basic zzso acid side chains at the zzso zzso position, thus explaining the dual zzso and zzso activity of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were calculated using the finite difference zzso zzso They indicated a large positive region near the active site of zzso not found in related zzso because of positively charged zzso at positions 61 and 65 in zzso They generate a positive region, which zzso a positive region in zzso and may prevent zzso zzso A single zzso in zzso is suggested that might allow zzso zzso zzso by zzso This model contributes significantly to our understanding of the zzso relationships among zzso of the tissue zzso zzso
