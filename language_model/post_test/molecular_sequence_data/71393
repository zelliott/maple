Leaf zzso zzso zzso zzso was crossed to the susceptible zzso zzso to analyze the genetic basis for zzso Field scoring of zzso zzso progeny revealed that resistance was transmitted as a dominant zzso zzso By combining the random amplified zzso DNA zzso technique with zzso analysis, it was possible to identify zzso amplification products that zzso with disease zzso zzso zzso amplified a zzso band zzso that zzso with zzso zzso of longer zzso or zzso zzso characterized amplified zzso for zzso resulted in the amplification of a single major band of the predicted size from all the resistant zzso progeny and the resistant parent zzso but not from zzso or 24 of 29 susceptible zzso zzso The zzso zzso also amplified a single band with DNA from zzso the female parent in a cross with zzso that has been used to produce a zzso zzso population for zzso zzso An equivalent band was amplified from all 137 zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso DNA is the amplification target in this zzso
