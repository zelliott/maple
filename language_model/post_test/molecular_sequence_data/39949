In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso I) is zzso by two single genes and two zzso one of which contains the genes for five complex I zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a putative single zzso zzso zzso Here we report that the latter encodes indeed a functional zzso zzso which is able to zzso resistance to zzso but not to zzso to an zzso coli strain defective in zzso zzso In addition, an extensive zzso acid sequence comparison with several single zzso zzso zzso from different groups, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggests that this might be the first member of a new type of zzso zzso which we propose to call zzso
