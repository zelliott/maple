The complete zzso sequence of a mouse zzso is zzso The cloned element is composed of zzso base pairs zzso with long terminal repeats of zzso zzso separated by an internal region of zzso zzso The element did not appear to have any open reading frames that would be capable of zzso the functional proteins that are normally produced by zzso However, some regions of the zzso showed some zzso to zzso gag and pol open reading zzso There was no region in zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso This implies that zzso is related to zzso rather than to zzso The sequence also contained regions that were zzso to known reverse zzso zzso sites and viral packaging zzso These zzso combined with the known zzso capacity of the zzso promoter, suggest that zzso relies on protein functions of other zzso such as zzso leukemia virus, while maintaining highly zzso zzso promoter, packaging, and zzso sites necessary for its replication and zzso zzso
