zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is implicated in zzso zzso cell zzso and tumor zzso However, the mechanism regulating its zzso in zzso cells is zzso We used the enhanced green fluorescent protein reporter system to scan regulatory elements in the upstream region of zzso The results of zzso studies indicated that the zzso regulatory elements contributing to zzso of zzso in zzso cells were located in the region of the zzso promoter from zzso to zzso zzso According to the results of in zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found a novel negative regulatory element, the zzso zzso silence element zzso at zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso protein that was highly expressed in young cells may inhibit the expression of zzso by interacting with the zzso The activity of the zzso promoter increased significantly in young cells when the zzso was zzso The zzso region of the zzso promoter from zzso to zzso was a positive zzso regulatory zzso zzso of this region showed zzso loss of zzso promoter activity in zzso cells, and the promoter activity decreased by zzso in young cells zzso
