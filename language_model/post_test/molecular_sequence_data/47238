To further explore the evolution of receptors for zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso we searched for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso genes zzso this zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso and separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso based on these zzso led to two distinct DNA fragments zzso portions of genes zzso the zzso and the novel zzso zzso comparison of both full-length zzso receptors revealed zzso similarity zzso zzso but less zzso with zzso When compared with zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso similarity with zzso was only 59% for both zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, zzso bound zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a high apparent affinity zzso zzso zzso and was efficiently activated by all three peptides zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso showed higher affinity for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more efficiently zzso by zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso than by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso was observed with zzso but not zzso
