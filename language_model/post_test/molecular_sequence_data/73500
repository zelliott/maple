The zzso factor zzso is expressed during the early stages of zzso differentiation and influences the expression of several zzso zzso In addition to the existing zzso zzso which we have named zzso we have isolated three new zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso cell lines using library screenings and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and zzso have spliced out their second zzso resulting in proteins with only a partial zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have deleted the zzso which encodes the zzso domain, and replaced it with a novel zzso The existence of alternative zzso transcripts was confirmed using zzso protection zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso proteins were detected using Western zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and mature zzso lines, but not in two zzso zzso was shown to be present at low levels in mature zzso lines and, unexpectedly, in one plasma cell line, but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso shift zzso showed that in zzso translated zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso could interact with a zzso zzso zzso site on the zzso zzso Using this zzso we also showed that zzso was present in nuclear extracts of some (but not all) zzso lines and interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The pattern of differential expression of alternatively spliced zzso zzso suggests that they may be important regulators of zzso during zzso zzso
