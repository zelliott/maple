The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a nuclear gene product, has been previously shown to be imported into zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso were made in the transit zzso coding region of the zzso The zzso and deleted proteins were zzso produced by zzso and translation in zzso zzso zzso is zzso into isolated zzso zzso with an efficiency of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso are recovered from the zzso but not the zzso of zzso zzso These zzso are assembled into the zzso zzso The modified zzso precursors are imported into zzso at lower efficiencies than zzso zzso The relative import efficiency appears to be dependent upon the deletion zzso To our knowledge such analysis of a plant zzso precursor protein has not been reported zzso
