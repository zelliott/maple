zzso zzso often occur where zzso water containing zzso iron encounters zzso zzso zzso molecular analyses have revealed the presence of zzso zzso gene sequences related to diverse bacteria, including zzso iron zzso and zzso in zzso zzso however, the zzso functions of the microbial communities remain poorly zzso particularly regarding carbon zzso In the present study, we cultivated zzso bacteria zzso and performed clone library analyses of functional genes related to carbon fixation and methane zzso zzso and zzso respectively), in addition to bacterial and zzso zzso zzso zzso in freshwater zzso zzso at groundwater discharge zzso The analyses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes strongly suggested the coexistence of zzso iron zzso and zzso in the zzso Furthermore, a novel zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated and characterized zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences of zzso are related to those of other zzso zzso in the family zzso of the zzso isolated from freshwater environments at zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso will help zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Overall, this study demonstrates functional roles of zzso in iron zzso suggesting several possible linkages between zzso and C zzso
