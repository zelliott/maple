The zzso zzso zzso is a G zzso zzso that plays an essential role in regulating energy zzso zzso in zzso are the most common zzso form of zzso with about 170 distinct zzso identified in zzso In addition to the conventional zzso zzso zzso pathway, it has been recently demonstrated that zzso also activates zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso we investigated the potential of four zzso zzso that are inverse zzso at the zzso signaling pathway, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso in wild type and six naturally occurring zzso active zzso zzso zzso We showed that these four inverse zzso acted as zzso for the zzso signaling cascade in wild type and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso had significantly increased zzso level upon stimulation with all four inverse zzso with zzso induction ranging from zzso to zzso zzso had significantly increased zzso level upon stimulation with zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso were significantly increased only upon stimulation with zzso or zzso In zzso our studies demonstrated for the first time that zzso inverse zzso at the zzso zzso could serve as zzso in the zzso zzso These results suggested that there were multiple zzso states of zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso the zzso to distinct signaling zzso
