zzso plasmids carrying a humanized zzso zzso heavy chain gene zzso fused to a gene zzso the native B chain of zzso toxin zzso zzso or a sugar binding zzso of zzso zzso delta zzso were zzso In each case, the fused gene constructions were zzso in zzso myeloma cells zzso with the gene for humanized zzso zzso light chain to produce the zzso zzso products zzso and zzso delta zzso zzso When zzso by affinity zzso both the zzso and zzso delta zzso products were found to have an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso and to be composed of two zzso zzso heavy chains each fused to a full-length copy of zzso and two zzso zzso light zzso In each of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso retained the full binding affinity and specificity for its zzso zzso zzso Moreover, when zzso of zzso and native zzso A chain were incubated in the presence of the zzso target cell line zzso zzso zzso of zzso A chain zzso was zzso It has been demonstrated previously that zzso activity of the B chain is essential for A chain zzso and we conclude that the fused zzso B chain was properly folded and maintained zzso zzso These data demonstrate that feasibility of using zzso zzso B chain in an zzso and of using zzso cell culture for its zzso The use of zzso zzso fusion protein to evaluate the contribution of the zzso activity of zzso B chain in the penetration of cell zzso by zzso A chain is zzso
