That most major zzso actions of zzso hormones could be zzso via hormonal regulation of gene expression has been known for more than 25 zzso The zzso of zzso in the cell nucleus, first reported almost 20 years ago, confirmed this zzso But it is only since the cloning of the zzso gene and its identification as the zzso zzso accomplished 6 years ago, that we have begun to understand the details of the interaction between the hormone and its zzso and between the zzso and its target zzso Perhaps the most significant concept to emerge from the molecular studies is that the zzso belongs to the zzso of nuclear receptors for steroid hormones and zzso such as zzso It highlights the evolutionary conservation of a major network of cellular zzso and zzso regulatory pathways and which has helped bring us closer to a unified concept of the action of many growth and zzso zzso Several important questions to be solved in the future become obvious from this brief review of the role of zzso hormone in regulating zzso zzso Among these is the zzso for the high degree of tissue specificity of hormonal regulation of gene zzso The discovery of differential expression of the two major zzso genes and the generation of multiple zzso of the zzso by alternate zzso go some way to answering this question, but this is clearly not the sole factor determining tissue zzso It will be most important to find out more about the interaction between the zzso and other zzso factors or nuclear zzso some of which may be tissue specific and others expressed zzso The zzso of zzso during zzso zzso described above, emphasizes the intriguing question of how zzso genes are regulated during zzso We know little as yet about the promoters and regulatory factors involved in this zzso Finally, we have also described the recent recognition of genetic defects in zzso that zzso zzso hormone linked diseases in zzso Future studies on the molecular zzso of receptors will enhance the importance in clinical practice of zzso linked zzso
