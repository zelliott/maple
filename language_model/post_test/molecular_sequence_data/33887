The commitment of zzso zzso to invade red blood cells zzso is marked by the formation of a junction between the zzso and the zzso and the coordinated induction of the zzso zzso Despite its importance, the molecular events underlying the zzso commitment to invasion are not well zzso Here we show that the interaction of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso known to be critical for invasion, is essential to trigger junction zzso Using zzso zzso that bind near the zzso pocket of zzso and zzso zzso in the pocket, we identified zzso binding site on zzso zzso specific for the zzso pocket blocked junction formation and the induction of the zzso zzso We also identified the critical zzso in the zzso zzso zzso shown to bind zzso that are required for binding to the zzso pocket, zzso two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso blocked junction formation but, unlike the zzso zzso did not block formation of the zzso zzso indicating that formation of the junction and zzso zzso are zzso distinct steps in the invasion zzso zzso these results identify the binding of zzso to the zzso pocket of zzso as the step that commits zzso zzso to zzso invasion and point to zzso as a potential vaccine zzso
