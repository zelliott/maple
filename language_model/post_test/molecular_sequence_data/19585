zzso C virus zzso infection in Cameroon is characterized by widespread zzso and great virus genetic diversity (3 zzso and over 10 zzso A total of zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso long (95 type 1, 58 type 2, and 91 type 4) were zzso analyzed to estimate the history of the zzso epidemic in zzso The newly developed zzso zzso approach was used to zzso the history of each zzso zzso The estimated dates of the most recent common ancestors zzso for zzso 1 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso were in the same range, while the date for zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was slightly more zzso The mean genetic distance between zzso zzso 1 sequences was greater than that of zzso type 4 zzso itself greater than that of zzso type 2 zzso The initial infected populations of all three zzso did not grow until recently, when they grew zzso The growth rate has now begun to slow, with a less steep exponential growth zzso The period of exponential growth of all the three zzso was between 1920 and zzso These results zzso confirm that zzso zzso 1 and 4 have produced long-term zzso zzso suggest that zzso 2 was introduced into Cameroon more recently, and zzso indicate that the exponential spread of the three zzso between 1920 and 1960 coincided with the mass campaign against zzso and mass zzso in zzso
