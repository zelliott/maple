A zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso protein family has been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso The zzso I zzso proteins zzso D, zzso and I) possess zzso sequence at the zzso and zzso and central regions that differentiate the zzso These proteins may be important in the immune response during syphilis infection and in protective zzso Strong zzso responses have been observed toward some of the zzso I zzso proteins during infection with different syphilis zzso Some sequence variation has also been identified in one zzso I zzso member, zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined sequences in the remaining zzso I zzso proteins among zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While some zzso was identified in zzso We further examined the immune response and protective capacity of zzso protein in this zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso region of the zzso I zzso proteins elicits strong zzso and zzso responses during infection, and zzso with this region zzso zzso zzso development upon infectious zzso
