zzso vertical community composition and maximum rooting depth of the Edwards zzso of central Texas were determined by using DNA sequence variation to identify roots from caves zzso m zzso Roots from caves were identified by comparing their DNA sequences for the internal transcribed zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso DNA repeat against a reference ITS database developed for woody plants of the zzso zzso the ITS provides, to our knowledge, the first universal method for identifying plant zzso At least six tree species in the system grew roots deeper than 5 zzso but only the evergreen oak, zzso zzso was found below 10 zzso The maximum rooting depth for the zzso was approximately 25 zzso zzso zzso signatures for stem water of zzso zzso confirmed water zzso from 18 m zzso The availability of resources at depth, coupled with small surface pools of water and zzso may explain the occurrence of deep roots in this and other zzso
