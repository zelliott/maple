zzso is an important factor in the development of acute zzso failure related to infection and in acceleration of chronic zzso zzso zzso the major component of zzso is one of the most potent triggers for zzso cells to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso involved in immune cell recruitment into the zzso zzso in acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso about the zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells in response to zzso is zzso 

zzso regulation of zzso was investigated in rat zzso zzso cells zzso in primary culture and was exposed to zzso using zzso shift zzso and zzso analysis for nuclear zzso zzso and Western zzso for the zzso zzso protein zzso To prove the role for zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and deletion analysis was performed using a zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso region inserted into a zzso reporter construct zzso into zzso zzso cell line zzso 

zzso increased zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which paralleled that of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased within 30 minutes of zzso treatment, but returned to zzso levels by two zzso zzso levels were depressed within one hour and remained low throughout the culture period after zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene increased nearly zzso after zzso zzso zzso or deletion of zzso binding sites, located in the zzso region of the zzso region, resulted in a total loss of zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of putative zzso and zzso sites, located in the zzso promoter region of zzso reduced zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso 

These studies prove that zzso is critical for zzso zzso transcription, and zzso and zzso are essential for zzso expression of zzso in rat zzso zzso The zzso nature of zzso regulation of zzso has important implications for the zzso of treatment to prevent zzso zzso zzso
