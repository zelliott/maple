zzso drugs used in human infection treatment and animal zzso may select for drug-resistant bacterial zzso which are increasingly observed zzso We sought to examine the extent to which identical mobile drug resistance elements are shared across common pathogens isolated from human and animal zzso 

We compared the distribution of one class of mobile zzso and gene zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human zzso cases, and zzso coli and zzso zzso from nonhuman sources in the United zzso The sequences of the gene zzso were also compared with those deposited in zzso 

Class 1 zzso were detected in 68 zzso of 139 zzso zzso coli zzso 16 zzso of 22 human and animal zzso zzso and 120 zzso of zzso nonhuman zzso coli zzso The most prevalent zzso were those zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso from 35 urinary tract infection zzso coli zzso and of zzso and zzso gene zzso from 7 zzso zzso were zzso identical to the corresponding cassette sequences from food animal zzso coli zzso and those deposited in zzso from a wide variety of bacteria isolated from animal hosts from distinct regions of the zzso 

Common zzso human drug-resistant infections are caused by bacterial strains that harbor mobile drug resistance zzso of identical sequences that are found in diverse bacterial species from varied animal sources zzso
