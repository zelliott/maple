Unlike their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso require the assistance of zzso factors in order to transcribe zzso DNA zzso The zzso factor A family has been shown to be important for zzso of the human zzso DNA, with some of its regulatory activity located in its extended zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor B family often has functions not only in transcription, but also in zzso zzso zzso a hallmark of its zzso zzso We have identified and zzso a zzso zzso factor B zzso in the soil dwelling cellular slime zzso zzso zzso an zzso widely established as a model for studying zzso cell zzso Using in zzso functional zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso factor B zzso not only functions as a zzso zzso factor, but that it also has a role in zzso zzso Additionally, we show that the zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso protein are located in its extended zzso tail, a feature not seen before in the zzso zzso factor B family, but reminiscent of the human zzso zzso factor zzso This report contributes to our current understanding of the complexities of zzso transcription, and its evolution in zzso
