The zzso zzso located at zzso band zzso is involved in acute leukemia through a series of zzso zzso and fusion to a variety of zzso most frequently to A4 and zzso The fused genes zzso zzso proteins zzso Because the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a positive regulator of zzso genes and acts at the level of transcription, it is conceivable that zzso in zzso zzso activity may zzso its action in zzso zzso To begin studying this, we examined the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins for the presence of potential zzso regulatory zzso This was done by fusing regions of the proteins to the zzso zzso DNA binding domain and zzso their effect on zzso of a reporter zzso A domain of 55 zzso positioned at zzso acids zzso of zzso was identified as a very strong zzso Further analysis of this domain by in zzso zzso pointed to a core of zzso and zzso zzso as critical for the zzso An zzso domain that zzso zzso of the reporter gene coincided with the sequence zzso to a segment of DNA zzso An zzso zzso containing zzso zzso showed strong zzso zzso The zzso segment of zzso spanning zzso acids zzso zzso zzso of the reporter gene in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and probably zzso interact with the zzso machinery of the zzso
