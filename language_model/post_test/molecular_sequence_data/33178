zzso often constitute a large fraction of the zzso in freshwater zzso zzso methods have revealed that the so-called zzso lineage frequently represents the most numerous zzso among zzso of freshwater zzso and even among total freshwater zzso zzso affiliated with this zzso lineage have been detected in freshwater zzso located in various zzso and zzso zones but have never been found among zzso or offshore marine zzso So far, this ecologically important lineage of freshwater zzso is not represented by a recognized zzso In this study, we established a stable mixed culture containing a strain affiliated with the zzso lineage from a freshwater lake in zzso The proportion of the strain in the culture could be increased by manipulation of the medium composition by more than one order of zzso however all subsequent attempts to isolate this strain into pure culture were zzso Some of the zzso traits of this zzso strain were determined and its zzso position within the zzso was zzso zzso analysis of this zzso zzso zzso gene revealed a distant relationship with cultivated organisms and recognized species zzso % gene sequence similarity with the zzso Furthermore, this analysis did not support a clear assignment of the strain to any of the recognized families within the zzso zzso It is suggested that a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso is established to represent this zzso
