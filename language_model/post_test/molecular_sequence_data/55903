zzso zzso experiments have been carried out to determine the zzso relationship of human zzso By sequence comparison, the region in zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been identified to be zzso to zzso Eight zzso zzso with changes in this region, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been generated using a zzso cell zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso studies indicate that the region containing zzso to zzso is indeed a very important part of the active site of zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso have been examined in detail and are zzso Active zzso labeling is also an important approach to investigate the zzso relationship of zzso zzso zzso mass zzso is indicated as a useful technique for the characterization of active zzso zzso zzso The mass spectral analysis of zzso suggests that zzso is zzso
