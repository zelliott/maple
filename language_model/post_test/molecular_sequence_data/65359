zzso zzso zzso features in a series of 1967 zzso heavy chain gene zzso zzso obtained from patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso were examined and compared with zzso sequences from zzso B cells available in public zzso zzso analysis was performed for all zzso zzso sequences in this cohort with less than zzso identity to germ zzso At the cohort level, zzso patterns were typical of a zzso zzso zzso However, important differences emerged from the analysis of certain zzso of zzso sequences defined zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso presence of stereotyped heavy chain zzso region 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid changes occurred across the entire zzso region in zzso zzso carrying stereotyped zzso zzso especially those expressing the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are underrepresented among zzso sequences and thus can be considered as zzso Furthermore, it was shown that even a low level of zzso may be functionally relevant, given that stereotyped zzso acid changes can be found in zzso of minimally zzso zzso The precise targeting and distinctive features of zzso zzso zzso in selected zzso of zzso patients provide further evidence for selection by specific zzso zzso
