In fish sauce production, zzso are associated with the zzso process; however, the sequential changes in the bacterial communities have never been examined throughout the period of zzso In this study, we determined the bacterial zzso in a fish sauce mash over 8 months, using three different culture media and zzso zzso gene clone library zzso During the first 4 weeks, viable counts of zzso and zzso bacteria decreased and were dominated by zzso zzso Between 4 and 6 weeks, zzso and highly zzso bacterial counts markedly increased from zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso species changed to zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso was associated with an increase of zzso acid and a reduction of pH zzso In contrast, zzso bacterial counts decreased to zzso zzso by 6 weeks with zzso zzso as the dominant zzso zzso library analysis revealed that the dominant bacterial group also changed from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the changes were consistent with those of the zzso of zzso and highly zzso zzso This is the first report describing a combination approach of culture and clone library methods for the analysis of bacterial communities in fish sauce zzso
