To determine the complete primary structure, including zzso zzso of bovine lens major intrinsic protein zzso using a recently developed combination of liquid zzso and mass zzso 

The zzso was isolated from bovine zzso by zzso zzso zzso and was zzso with zzso zzso zzso A zzso liquid zzso system, developed for zzso protein analysis, was used to separate the zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso and zzso tandem mass zzso were employed to obtain molecular weight and sequence data from bovine zzso zzso fragments, directly or after subsequent zzso with zzso 

The complete sequence of bovine zzso was mapped by molecular weight zzso of zzso fragments, confirming the reported DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso to zzso was fully zzso and the major site of zzso was determined to be at zzso 235 rather than at the previously reported zzso zzso The level of zzso in the native protein was determined to be zzso No other zzso zzso were observed with the exception of the previously detected zzso of zzso zzso 

These results represent the first complete zzso sequence map at the zzso acid level and identify the single major zzso site at zzso zzso
