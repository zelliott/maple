The zzso zzso is the largest known zzso DNA virus, with a 400 zzso particle size, comparable to that of zzso The complete sequence of its zzso zzso zzso has recently been determined zzso et zzso (2004), Science, zzso zzso and revealed numerous genes that were not expected to be found in a virus, such as genes zzso translation zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso to various translation zzso zzso and termination zzso A comprehensive structural and functional study of these zzso gene products was zzso as they may hold important clues about the origin of DNA zzso Here, the first preliminary zzso and functional results obtained on one of these targets, zzso zzso are zzso zzso phasing was obtained using an original combination of zzso zzso and normal mode zzso Experimental evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene product does indeed activate zzso is also zzso
