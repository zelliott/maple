The zzso restriction zzso zzso and zzso cleave DNA at zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be inhibited by zzso in the sequences zzso or zzso We have now investigated the zzso sensitivity of zzso by testing its activity on zzso DNA zzso zzso with the zzso DNA zzso or on synthetic zzso repetitive zzso which have been partly or completely C zzso The data demonstrate that zzso cannot cleave at its recognition sequence when it is completely zzso zzso These zzso have proven to be useful in analyses of the zzso status in zzso repeats of the human zzso
