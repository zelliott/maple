The zzso zzso zzso gene is strongly expressed in the rat primarily in the zzso zzso low levels of expression are also found in the zzso zzso zzso the key regulatory step controlling rhythmic zzso zzso the zzso of zzso In the zzso the zzso gene is expressed at zzso This is controlled partly by zzso zzso zzso acting through a composite zzso zzso site located upstream of the zzso start zzso In the present study, we have extended our previous in zzso findings and found that additional elements in the zzso zzso region and first zzso play an important role in the regulation of the zzso zzso This led us to test the influence of an zzso zzso zzso segment on the expression of the bacterial zzso zzso gene in a rat transgenic zzso The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the segment of the zzso gene that encompasses the minimal promoter and the first zzso is able to zzso the highly specific zzso and zzso patterns of zzso gene zzso This advance also provides a tool that selectively targets genetic expression to zzso and retinal zzso providing new experimental opportunities to probe gene expression in these zzso
