The molecular identity of the zzso zzso zzso was determined by a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso cloning zzso zzso kidney zzso was amplified by zzso using zzso zzso based on regions of low zzso in the published canine cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso and the products were zzso and zzso A zzso clone zzso was identified, which shares zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the canine cardiac zzso suggesting that they are products of the same zzso zzso was zzso by Northern analysis, to zzso to an abundant major transcript of 7 zzso and a minor one of approximately 14 zzso both localized predominantly to kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was enriched in zzso convoluted zzso compared with other cortical zzso zzso Such a location is consistent with a zzso zzso corresponding to zzso playing a major role in active zzso zzso at this zzso
