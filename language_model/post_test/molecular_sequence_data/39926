We report here a sensitive and specific zzso chain reaction zzso detection zzso for the zzso zzso zzso based on the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences of the zzso unique zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, amplified predicted zzso and zzso fragments from zzso zzso zzso DNA but not from other selected zzso zzso or human zzso The zzso zzso control zzso exhibited positive zzso in all zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso strongly amplified zzso zzso and zzso zzso target zzso however, the zzso zzso also zzso amplified fragments from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both sets of zzso amplified target sequences from less than 10 zzso of serially diluted zzso zzso DNA, and the zzso specific zzso also detected DNA isolated from serially diluted 50 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso reported here are sufficiently sensitive and specific for the potential early detection of zzso infections with no possibility of false positive results from zzso with bacterial or human zzso
