The zzso zzso zzso model has the potential to be an invaluable tool for studying B cell populations during zzso infections, however, to date, there has been no definitive zzso of zzso and memory B cell populations in the zzso This has precluded a rigorous analysis of the generation, persistence and resolution of a zzso memory B cell zzso The present study zzso multiple analyses to demonstrate that zzso expression on B cells is consistent with a memory zzso Compared to zzso B cells, zzso B cells were larger in size, and zzso accumulated at zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso B cells had an increased frequency of point zzso that were consistent with zzso zzso and at a functional level, zzso zzso improved zzso but not zzso B cell survival in zzso These data provide definitive evidence that the zzso and memory B cell populations of the zzso can be differentiated using surface expression of zzso
