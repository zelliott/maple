zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso the transfer of a sulfur atom from zzso to zzso yielding zzso and zzso as zzso They display clear structural zzso with the protein fold observed in the zzso zzso family, composed of two structurally related zzso The role of zzso in zzso as well as their detailed molecular mechanisms of action have been little zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso a zzso from zzso coli, which is the first zzso three-dimensional structure disclosed to zzso zzso displays specific structural differences relative to zzso and zzso zzso In particular, zzso variation of the zzso active site loop, hosting the family zzso zzso zzso zzso may support a new sulfur transfer mechanism involving zzso as the zzso species and zzso zzso and zzso as zzso assisting zzso
