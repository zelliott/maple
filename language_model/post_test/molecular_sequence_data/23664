zzso is the zzso bacterial disease of humans and is the major cause of adult tooth zzso About half of the oral zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing techniques have demonstrated the high level of species richness of the oral zzso In the present study, a zzso primer set specific for the zzso zzso and zzso was designed and used to analyze the bacterial populations in zzso plaque samples from inflamed shallow and deep sites in subjects with zzso and shallow sites in zzso and zzso zzso A total of 308 clones were zzso and found to belong to one of six zzso or zzso species or zzso one of which, zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso was found in significantly higher proportions in patients than in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso appeared to be associated with shallow zzso zzso zzso molecular ecology studies have a valuable role to play in the identification of bacterial targets for further investigations of the zzso of bacterial zzso
