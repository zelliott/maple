zzso relationships among zzso fish were investigated by comparing zzso b gene sequences and restriction zzso zzso of 16 species from zzso DNA was prepared for sequencing by zzso No variation in sequences was detected among individuals within each zzso zzso estimates of zzso zzso b gene sequence divergence among 16 zzso fish were from zzso to zzso Different restriction patterns were found among 16 zzso fish with 10 restriction zzso whereas no variation in patterns was detected among individuals within each zzso The zzso obtained by zzso have provided a new set of genetic markers for the accurate identification of sibling zzso zzso It is the first zzso based study of zzso diversity and sheds light on the evolution and zzso of this major zzso fish zzso
