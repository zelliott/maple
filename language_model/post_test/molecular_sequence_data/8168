The zzso equilibrium of a zzso in solution can be modulated by a variety of zzso interactions that are not incorporated into the standard statistical mechanical models for prediction of zzso zzso zzso In this report, we describe a zzso zzso of the zzso model that zzso incorporation of specific zzso zzso interactions as well as zzso individual zzso capping zzso Application of this extended model to a series of zzso peptides indicates that the apparent delta G value for a zzso zzso interaction is dependent upon the spacing and orientation but not the sequential location of the participating zzso The apparent delta G values for such interactions are about zzso greater than the corresponding apparent delta delta G values obtained from difference zzso
