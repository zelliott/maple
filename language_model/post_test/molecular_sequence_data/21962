zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which belongs to the ABC zzso It consists of two zzso zzso and zzso that are necessary and sufficient for drug zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso in terms of the conservation of the functional motifs of the zzso zzso zzso Important zzso of the zzso site of zzso and the C loop of zzso are not zzso To investigate the functional importance of the zzso and zzso zzso the putative zzso base zzso adjacent to the Walker B motif of both zzso were zzso for the respective zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso of zzso is essential for both drug transport and zzso activity of the zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso of zzso has a less severe effect on the activity of the zzso zzso and/or functional asymmetry is further demonstrated by differential labeling of both zzso by zzso which, at 4 degrees C, occurs predominantly at zzso while zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at 30 degrees C results in an almost exclusive labeling of zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso contains two structurally and functionally distinct zzso
