To further improve the selectivity and zzso of zzso analysis for the samples from real-time cell zzso here we demonstrate a highly efficient method for zzso enrichment via newly zzso zzso zzso and the concurrent mass zzso zzso The zzso zzso show excellent magnetic zzso and zzso for a quick enrichment of those zzso in zzso The selectivity and sensitivity of zzso zzso in zzso enrichment are first evaluated by a known mixture containing both zzso and zzso zzso Compared with the titanium zzso magnetic beads commercially available, our zzso zzso show a better specificity toward zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso can be detected down to zzso zzso zzso whereas the recovery efficiency is approximately zzso for zzso This zzso zzso affinity technology with zzso enrichment conditions is then immediately applied to identify all possible zzso sites on a signal protein isolated in real time from a zzso zzso cell zzso A large fraction of peptides zzso from the magnetic particle enrichment step were identified and characterized as either zzso or zzso species by tandem mass zzso With their high efficiency and utility for zzso enrichment, the zzso zzso hold great potential in the zzso studies on real-time samples from cell zzso
