zzso zzso are ancillary proteins that zzso with zzso to zzso the gating zzso and enhance stability of zzso channel zzso Despite their functional importance, dysfunction of zzso zzso has not been associated with zzso Recent zzso studies suggest that zzso encodes zzso zzso that zzso with zzso zzso to form the slowly zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso cause zzso zzso in the long zzso syndrome zzso we hypothesized that zzso in zzso also cause this zzso Here, we define zzso zzso zzso in affected members of two zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso by shifting the zzso dependence of zzso and accelerating channel zzso zzso zzso also had a strong zzso zzso The functional consequences of these zzso would be delayed cardiac zzso and an increased risk of zzso This is the first description of zzso as an zzso gene and confirms that zzso is an integral protein of the zzso zzso
