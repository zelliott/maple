A zzso library derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso delivered into a previously isolated pressure-sensitive zzso zzso designated zzso zzso Chi and zzso zzso Bartlett, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were screened for the ability to grow at zzso zzso zzso Several clones were identified that had restored zzso zzso The zzso DNA was localized and in all cases found to possess strong zzso to zzso a DNA zzso and repair zzso zzso was found to be deficient in zzso stability, a zzso also seen in zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso in zzso was localized to a point zzso that created a stop zzso within the zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso were constructed by gene disruption and were both found to possess a pressure-sensitive growth zzso although the magnitude of the zzso depended on the extent of 3' zzso of the zzso coding zzso Surprisingly, the introduction of the zzso zzso gene into an zzso coli zzso zzso had two dramatic zzso At high pressure, zzso zzso enabled growth in the zzso coli zzso strain under conditions of zzso zzso resistance selection and prevented cell zzso Both of these effects were zzso to zzso zzso coli zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso gene plays an essential role in zzso growth at high pressure and that it may be possible to identify additional aspects of zzso function through the characterization of this zzso
