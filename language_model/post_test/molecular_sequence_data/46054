zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein zzso that promotes zzso zzso in both smooth muscle and zzso zzso A recent report attempted to clarify a debate over the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso loss of a key zzso site zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso seems to direct it to the nucleus, while the presence of the zzso site in human zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is immediately adjacent to a putative nuclear zzso sequence zzso and may mask its function when zzso therefore explaining the zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, despite the zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso that is critical for controlling human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that this zzso control locus is zzso in the zzso zzso A zzso active zzso promoted the zzso retention of a human zzso zzso that would otherwise zzso to the zzso zzso zzso showed sensitivity to the nuclear export inhibitor zzso B, suggesting a continuous shuttling between zzso and nucleus that is dependent upon zzso zzso Thus, the zzso domain of human and zzso zzso demonstrated quite divergent nuclear import and export zzso We conclude that in the case of zzso studies between the species may not be directly comparable to each other given the gross differences in zzso zzso and zzso
