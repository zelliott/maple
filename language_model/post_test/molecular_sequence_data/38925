The control of cell and organ growth is fundamental to the development of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso plays an essential role in the control of cell size, cell number, and organ zzso In mosaic animals, zzso cells zzso faster than their zzso siblings, show an autonomous increase in cell size, and form zzso of increased size, whereas zzso of zzso results in opposite zzso The zzso zzso of zzso are suppressed by zzso in the zzso target zzso and the zzso initiation factor zzso suggesting that zzso acts through the zzso signaling zzso to regulate zzso Although zzso of zzso and zzso has been reported to increase rates of cellular growth but not zzso loss of zzso stimulates both of these zzso suggesting that zzso regulates overall growth through zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso does not play a major role in cell survival during zzso zzso Our results provide a potential explanation for the high frequency of zzso zzso in human zzso
