zzso zzso and other similarity searching programs seek to identify zzso proteins and DNA sequences based on excess sequence zzso If two sequences share much more similarity than expected by chance, the simplest explanation for the excess similarity is common zzso The most effective similarity searches compare protein zzso rather than DNA zzso for sequences that zzso zzso and use expectation values, rather than percent identity, to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso packages of sequence comparison programs provide programs for comparing protein and DNA sequences to protein databases (the most sensitive zzso zzso and zzso comparisons to protein databases routinely allow evolutionary look back times from 1 to 2 billion years; zzso searches are zzso less zzso zzso and zzso can be run on popular web sites, but can also be downloaded and installed on local zzso With local installation, target databases can be customized for the sequence data being zzso With today's very large protein databases, search sensitivity can also be improved by searching smaller comprehensive databases, for example, a complete protein set from an zzso neighboring model zzso By default, zzso and zzso use scoring strategies target for distant evolutionary zzso for comparisons involving short zzso or queries, or searches that seek relatively close zzso zzso zzso zzso scoring zzso will be more zzso Both zzso and zzso provide very accurate statistical estimates, which can be used to reliably identify protein sequences that zzso more than 2 billion years zzso
