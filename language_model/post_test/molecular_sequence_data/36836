The effects of zzso and zzso on the activity zzso of zzso I) by zzso were investigated in zzso It was found that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited selectively when the partially zzso zzso fraction from EAT cells was incubated with zzso in the presence of 60 zzso zzso zzso the marked zzso was identified as a zzso zzso and zzso the activity of the zzso was zzso about zzso by 5 zzso zzso but it was inhibited at doses above 25 zzso The drug-induced zzso of zzso of zzso I by zzso may be implicated in the zzso effect of the zzso
