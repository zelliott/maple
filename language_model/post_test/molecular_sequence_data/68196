Using a functional zzso zzso zzso devoid of zzso zzso zzso zzso each zzso acid in putative zzso zzso zzso was individually replaced with zzso (from zzso to zzso Fifteen of the 20 zzso are highly functional and accumulate zzso to zzso zzso of the level achieved by zzso zzso and an additional three zzso all located at the zzso end of the zzso exhibit lower but significant zzso zzso zzso replacements for zzso or zzso result in virtually inactive zzso zzso however, is not essential for active zzso transport but plays a role in zzso folding or membrane zzso by interacting with zzso zzso reveal that all zzso proteins are present in the membrane in amounts comparable to zzso with the exception of zzso which is hardly zzso as zzso The results highlight zzso as a potentially important zzso for further zzso Finally, all active zzso were zzso after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso and results range from nearly complete zzso to almost zzso zzso zzso all of the strongly inhibited positions lie on one face of zzso zzso The implications of the findings for packing of zzso zzso in the zzso half of the zzso are zzso
