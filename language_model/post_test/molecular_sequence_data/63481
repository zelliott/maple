zzso of enveloped animal viruses into their host cells always depends on a step of membrane fusion triggered by zzso changes in viral envelope zzso zzso zzso virus zzso infection is zzso by virus spike zzso G, which zzso membrane fusion at the zzso environment of the zzso zzso In a previous work, we identified a specific sequence in the zzso G zzso zzso the zzso zzso directly involved in membrane interaction and zzso In the present work we studied the interaction of zzso with zzso using zzso to solve the structure of the zzso in two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso showed that the zzso has a tendency to form zzso and zzso zzso segments in the presence of zzso zzso Analysis of the chemical shift index indicated zzso equilibrium for the zzso zzso under all conditions zzso At pH zzso the zzso zzso also displayed a zzso equilibrium when zzso was free in solution or in the presence of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso the region of the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso presented a third zzso species that was in equilibrium with the zzso and random zzso The zzso zzso content decreases pH and the minor zzso zzso becomes more prevalent at the zzso zzso These data point to a zzso as the zzso active zzso is in agreement with the X-ray structure, which shows a zzso for the region corresponding to zzso
