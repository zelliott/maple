To investigate whether serum zzso can be used to indicate the responsiveness of acute zzso leukemia to zzso induction chemotherapy, we performed zzso protein profile analysis of patient zzso The resulting zzso revealed a protein (or zzso peak at zzso zzso that varied in zzso its intensity was much higher in samples from patients in complete zzso than in those from patients with resistant disease or in samples taken prior to treatment (at the time of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein molecular weight zzso we identified the zzso zzso protein as zzso zzso zzso This identification was confirmed by a magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso levels and zzso counts in patient zzso revealed a significant positive correlation between the two zzso This study demonstrates that zzso protein levels are a good indicator for the recovery of blood count in the complete zzso of acute zzso zzso The linear positive correlation curve indicates that blood count recovery of zzso to zzso is equivalent to a serum zzso recovery level of zzso zzso
