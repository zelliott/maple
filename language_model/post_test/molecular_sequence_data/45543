A heavy metal responsive gene zzso zzso zzso number zzso zzso an acid zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso bean zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso library by differential screening using zzso derived from treated and zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso long and has a zzso zzso frame with a zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso sequence contains two zzso repeats of the characteristic zzso K segment zzso preceded by an zzso zzso stretch, whereas the Y segment zzso zzso motif is zzso The deduced protein has a calculated molecular weight of 23 zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso similarity and comparative analysis showed that zzso shares 70 and zzso similarity with the zzso of zzso and pepper, zzso Southern zzso indicated that zzso was a low zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso was zzso detected in zzso zzso However, the gene expression was strongly zzso by heavy metals, such as mercury, cadmium, zzso and copper, whereas virus infection and salt had little effect on zzso In contrast, zzso was not responsive to drought or zzso acid zzso and was zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso by the zzso signaling zzso including salicylic acid zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso is extremely related to heavy metal stress, and might play an important role in metal zzso and resistance to the damage caused by heavy zzso
