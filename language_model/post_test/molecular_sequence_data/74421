zzso mouse prone 8 zzso is considered as a useful animal model for age-related learning and memory zzso zzso a critical brain region associated with cognitive decline during normal aging and various neurodegenerative diseases, appeared a series of abnormalities in zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying age-related cognitive disorders, we used zzso coupled with zzso zzso zzso to analyze the differential protein expression of the zzso of zzso at zzso compared with the zzso zzso 1 zzso which shows normal aging zzso Two proteins were found to be markedly changed in zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implicating in zzso zzso of zzso damaged zzso was zzso while zzso a vital protein for normal zzso function, exhibited four zzso with a consistent basic shift of zzso point among the soluble zzso proteins in zzso compared with zzso The zzso were confirmed by Western zzso zzso The analysis of their expression changes may shed light on the mechanisms of learning and memory deficits and zzso dysfunction as observed in zzso
