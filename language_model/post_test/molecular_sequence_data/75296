zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso from zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from zzso libraries established with zzso zzso from peanut zzso zzso cell cultures specifically induced for zzso These zzso were used to identify two zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso analysis shows that the two clones overlap in a large stretch of nearly identical zzso and that zzso contains the zzso and zzso the 3' end of zzso zzso The sequences reveal a single zzso and the size of the predicted protein is zzso zzso in close agreement with that observed in zzso gels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso zzso zzso the same zzso as zzso but the product is different zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso consensus sequences shows that the two genes are zzso zzso extends throughout the coding region, and the zzso in zzso is at the same position as a zzso zzso in zzso However, zzso reveals a substantial number of zzso acid differences to zzso in positions highly zzso in all zzso zzso It is proposed that the two proteins possess a common scaffold necessary for binding of the zzso and the type of zzso reaction, and that the differences are responsible for the formation of different zzso
