The zzso human zzso virus type 2 zzso has adopted a unique mechanism to zzso integrate its zzso into the human zzso zzso which is embedded in zzso on zzso zzso The fact that zzso has evolved to integrate into this zzso transcribed region and that the zzso motifs required for integration are located a few zzso upstream of the translation initiation start zzso of zzso suggests that the zzso activity of zzso might influence zzso integration and thus might be involved in the evolution of this zzso In order to begin addressing this question, we initiated the characterization of the human zzso promoter region and compared its zzso activity to that of the zzso zzso zzso Our results clearly indicate that zzso is defined by a complex zzso environment and that the zzso promoter shares key regulatory elements with the viral zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence for zzso zzso promoter activity and demonstrate that the minimal motifs required for zzso zzso integration are present in the zzso untranslated region of the gene and play a zzso role in the regulation of zzso zzso These findings should provide a framework to further zzso the complex interactions between the virus and its cellular host in this unique zzso to zzso
