zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso thereby zzso removing the zzso base from the pool of zzso zzso We have identified five zzso at the mouse zzso zzso locus by zzso zzso These zzso were defined by zzso zzso at a total of 19 zzso For each zzso the representative strains are as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The only zzso change resulting in an zzso acid substitution was found at zzso zzso where zzso was replaced by zzso in zzso zzso resulting in the deduced substitution of zzso by zzso The zzso difference between the a and b zzso was also typed by zzso zzso amplification for 17 common strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso By typing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain sets, zzso was mapped to mouse zzso 19, a region zzso with human zzso zzso
