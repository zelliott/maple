zzso zzso exhibits extreme resistance to DNA damage and is one of only few bacteria that zzso two zzso zzso protection during zzso zzso zzso was shown previously to bind DNA with high affinity and to zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A unique feature of zzso is its predicted signal zzso In the present paper, we report that zzso assembly into a zzso requires the zzso extension and, whereas zzso binds DNA with low zzso it protects against degradation by zzso oxygen zzso zzso with a role for zzso zzso stress responses, the zzso promoter is zzso by zzso stress, whereas the zzso promoter is zzso Although zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso shows that zzso can compact zzso DNA, such zzso zzso is absent from cells expressing zzso A fusion of zzso zzso green fluorescent zzso to the zzso signal zzso results in green zzso at the perimeter of zzso zzso zzso The differential response of the zzso and zzso promoters to zzso stress, the distinct cellular zzso of the proteins and the differential ability of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso radical production suggest distinct functional zzso whereas zzso may function in DNA zzso zzso may protect against zzso derived zzso oxygen zzso
