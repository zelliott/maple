Many zzso that bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Gal beta zzso zzso have been raised in zzso mice, and we are studying the structure and regulation of these zzso In this report, we present the first information about their zzso acid sequences and the zzso gene segments used to zzso zzso V regions of the H and L chains of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso acid zzso The L chain sequences of zzso and zzso zzso indicate that their zzso and zzso regions are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso acid sequences of the H chains suggest that the three zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso gene segment of the zzso zzso family, and this conclusion was supported by Southern filter zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso has at least 11 zzso acid zzso which is an unusually large amount of zzso zzso for an zzso zzso Previous analyses of zzso zzso libraries with zzso and zzso zzso make it unlikely that this zzso family contains additional zzso zzso but this possibility cannot be zzso All three zzso use the zzso and zzso gene zzso The single zzso and zzso gene segments used to zzso the zzso zzso is in contrast to the multiple zzso and zzso segments used by zzso against other zzso zzso such as alpha zzso zzso and group A zzso zzso zzso also encodes the zzso regions of zzso against zzso and zzso zzso 2-6 zzso The similarities among zzso segments of zzso against zzso zzso and zzso and the striking differences in their zzso zzso suggest that zzso plays an important role in the formation of the zzso binding zzso The use of a single zzso segment from the smallest zzso gene family by zzso against at least three different zzso zzso is zzso It raises the possibility that the zzso acid sequence zzso by zzso has some general structural features that make it particularly well adapted for binding to zzso zzso
