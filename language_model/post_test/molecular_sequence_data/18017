The zzso zzso containing the genes for the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for the zzso factors G zzso and Tu zzso has been characterized for some zzso and zzso from algae and higher zzso In the case of zzso a zzso reduction by one and two zzso respectively, has been observed due to gene transfer to the nuclear zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso from zzso zzso was determined as a first example for a zzso zzso zzso It comprises zzso zzso and zzso which are closely linked and not interrupted by zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of the two zzso protein genes whereas zzso gave rise to a zzso zzso zzso studies using these three different traits allowed an assessment of the position of zzso zzso among zzso zzso
