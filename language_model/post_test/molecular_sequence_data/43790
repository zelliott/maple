To develop a model system for studies of zzso zzso in plants, transgenic zzso zzso and zzso zzso lines were generated zzso a single target zzso containing the negative selective zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso the target lines were transformed with a zzso zzso zzso in which the CD gene and the zzso promoter had been replaced with a zzso zzso For both zzso species zzso lines were selected which had lost the CD gene and the zzso zzso One tobacco line was the result of a precise gene targeting zzso However, most other lines were selected due to a zzso deletion of the target zzso The deletion frequency of the target locus varied between target lines, and could be present in up to zzso of the zzso which were grown from leaf zzso zzso transfer was not required for induction of the zzso indicating that the target zzso were zzso A few lines were obtained in which the target locus had been deleted zzso zzso analysis of the junctions revealed deletion of DNA sequences between zzso We conclude that zzso which are stable during plant development as well as in transmission to the zzso may become unstable during propagation in callus zzso The relationships between callus culture, genetic instability and the process of zzso integration and deletion in the plant zzso are zzso
