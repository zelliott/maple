The zzso zzso zzso gene consists of 20 zzso divided over zzso zzso Parts of bovine zzso zzso 4 (79 zzso zzso 11 (95 zzso and zzso 20 zzso zzso of 20 cows zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso in an attempt to find zzso In zzso 4 and 11 no zzso were zzso In zzso 20, a T to C zzso zzso was found at zzso zzso which causes an zzso acid substitution at zzso 945 zzso zzso for zzso C and T were zzso and zzso respectively, in a population of 323 zzso cows and zzso animals were not zzso Using zzso of these cows an association study was performed for zzso zzso during late pregnancy and zzso zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed an association with circulating zzso zzso only during late pregnancy zzso zzso zzso but not during zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso had higher zzso than the CT zzso during this zzso A combined effect with previously described zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso was observed, with one zzso combination having significantly lower levels of zzso up to 50 days, but interaction effects were not zzso The zzso zzso may have induced a structural change in the zzso domain of the zzso which may have influenced the signal zzso zzso However, the effect was found only for the zzso zzso because the zzso zzso was not detected in this population of 323 zzso zzso
