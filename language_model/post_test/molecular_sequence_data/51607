We have used a probe specific for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to examine the zzso and spatial expression pattern of the gene during zzso zzso zzso is expressed from just before the onset of zzso through to zzso zzso In the early zzso it is expressed around the zzso zzso This is maintained in the zzso third of the prospective zzso and zzso in the zzso A second expression domain in the anterior third of the zzso alone appears in the late zzso which later resolves into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso junction zzso Further zzso of expression arise in zzso to zzso zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso It is zzso by treatment of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso that zzso can be expressed in response to zzso zzso By zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso neural plate, we have also demonstrated that zzso can be expressed in response to neural zzso These results suggest that zzso has multiple functions in development, including an early role in patterning of the zzso body axis and a later role in the development of the tail, zzso structures and other zzso
