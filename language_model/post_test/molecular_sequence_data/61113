The zzso zzso gene is important for germ layer formation in zzso To investigate the role of this gene at the protein level, as opposed to the zzso level, we have generated affinity zzso zzso zzso to zzso and for comparison, to the other early zzso proteins zzso and zzso An zzso zzso reveals that there are two protein zzso in zzso one that we refer to as zzso and a smaller molecular weight zzso that we refer to as zzso These zzso have different zzso zzso resulting from zzso regulated alternative zzso of a primary transcript arising from a single zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso Its translation is blocked during zzso but the protein is present from the egg until zzso in the zzso zzso There is no evidence for zzso expression of this zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso is expressed only after the onset of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso We conclude that the zzso role of zzso is zzso by two different zzso with entirely different patterns of expression and response to growth zzso
