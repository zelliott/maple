zzso zzso in the zzso system zzso may modify zzso responses to injury and disease zzso We examined whether zzso zzso affect severity of zzso zzso These genetic zzso include zzso I converting zzso deletion zzso in zzso 16 zzso zzso a point zzso in the zzso zzso gene resulting in a zzso to zzso substitution at zzso 235 zzso and an zzso zzso type I zzso A to C transition at zzso zzso (A zzso zzso A total of 53 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 80 normal control subjects were recruited for zzso These patients were classified into two groups according to serum zzso at zzso zzso Group 1 patients zzso zzso 40) had normal zzso function, serum zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and group 2 patients zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso with serum zzso zzso zzso zzso The blood pressure and urinary protein of group 2 patients were higher than group 1 zzso zzso zzso The mean scores of zzso parameters including zzso zzso zzso sclerosis zzso and zzso the zzso zzso and zzso formation in group 2 patients were significantly higher than in group 1 patients zzso zzso zzso The most frequent zzso in zzso patients was ID zzso zzso followed by II zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The mean serum zzso activity in the zzso group was significantly higher than in the II group zzso zzso zzso but was not significantly different from that of the ID zzso No statistically significant differences were found with respect to zzso zzso between zzso group 1, group 2, or between controls and all zzso zzso Furthermore, no significant difference in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected between groups of zzso patients, although a trend for a higher frequency of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were noted in zzso group zzso The combined analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso did not show any genetic influence on the risk of the disease zzso To resolve the true role of zzso zzso and any dependent effect on zzso larger collaborative studies are zzso
