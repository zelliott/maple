Our previous zzso analysis based on zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso of the red zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso and green plants are sister groups with respect to zzso and zzso and zzso at about the same time or somewhat later than animals and zzso Here we characterize the zzso sequences of genes zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with respect to zzso structures, zzso organization, zzso complexity, G + C content, zzso suppression and their transcript levels in zzso and zzso zzso To our knowledge this is the first report on nuclear protein genes of red zzso The zzso gene is G + zzso contains no zzso and displays a number of classic sequence motifs within its zzso region, such as zzso zzso zzso boxes and several elements resembling the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene has a moderate zzso content, a single zzso box motif in its zzso region and a single zzso of 115 zzso near its zzso zzso This zzso occupies a zzso position corresponding to that of zzso 1 in the transit zzso region of zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso of higher zzso It has consensus sequences similar to those of zzso zzso and folds into a conspicuous secondary structure of zzso zzso zzso profiles of genes zzso and zzso and their zzso sequences show no significant zzso depletion suggesting that these zzso sequences are not zzso zzso Southern blots zzso with generic and gene specific zzso indicate that both genes are zzso by single zzso composed of multiple zzso zzso Northern zzso demonstrate that both genes are expressed in zzso but not in zzso where appreciable amounts of transcripts can only be detected for zzso
