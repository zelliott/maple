zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein with potent zzso and zzso zzso To further investigate the biological significance of zzso in infection and zzso a zzso in zzso rabbit model of bacterial zzso was selected to study its contribution to host zzso 

One hundred zzso units of log phase zzso zzso was injected zzso zzso were zzso at 5 to 25 hours after infection and zzso detected by zzso To identify the mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso studies using immortalized human zzso zzso cells zzso were undertaken to determine whether zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso induce zzso Because zzso of zzso is important in zzso zzso the effect of zzso on expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso was determined by flow zzso 

Strong zzso for zzso was demonstrated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related zzso zzso vascular zzso and zzso zzso in rabbits injected with zzso zzso The most dramatic expression of zzso aside from that in the zzso occurred in the zzso zzso The in zzso studies suggest that zzso induction is regulated by zzso and zzso In addition, zzso expression on zzso was increased in response to zzso zzso cloning of zzso zzso zzso indicated strong sequence identity with an extensive region of zzso 

The findings in this study describe the zzso expression of zzso in response to infection and suggest a role for zzso in host defense against infection in the zzso
