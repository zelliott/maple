zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is involved zzso in cancer, zzso zzso and zzso arthritis, and as such represents an important therapeutic zzso Three classes of zzso peptides that antagonize binding of the zzso zzso to its zzso zzso and zzso were identified previously using zzso display zzso zzso studies of a representative zzso from the most potent class of these zzso antagonists, zzso zzso were undertaken to characterize its interactions with zzso zzso has no defined structure free in solution, but binding to zzso zzso folding of the zzso The solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso complex was determined using zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso distance and zzso (238 per zzso zzso zzso angle restraints derived from zzso data obtained using samples containing either zzso protein plus excess zzso zzso or zzso zzso plus excess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restraints supplemented the structure determination of the complex and were found to increase significantly both the global precision of zzso in the complex and the agreement with available crystal structures of zzso The calculated ensemble of structures is of high precision and is in excellent agreement with the experimental zzso zzso has a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to one face of the zzso and polar or charged zzso at the other zzso Contacts between two zzso peptides and the zzso zzso are zzso by primarily zzso zzso zzso The zzso site on zzso zzso partially with the binding site of zzso and is similar to that for domain 2 of zzso The structure of the zzso complex provides new insight into how binding to zzso can be achieved that may be useful for the design of small zzso zzso
