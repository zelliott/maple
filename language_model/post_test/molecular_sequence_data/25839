The complete zzso sequence of barley yellow mosaic virus zzso zzso 1 was obtained by analysis of overlapping zzso clones and by direct zzso zzso The sequence is zzso zzso in zzso excluding a 3' zzso zzso The first zzso zzso at zzso zzso appeared to be the zzso for a single long open reading frame zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with an Mr of zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons revealed that the zzso zzso protein contains three regions upstream of the zzso zzso protein which share significant zzso with the zzso inclusion and two nuclear inclusion proteins of zzso thus indicating their similarities in genetic zzso However, the apparent low levels of zzso in the corresponding proteins of zzso and zzso are in contrast with the high conservation among zzso Moreover, our data indicate that zzso zzso 1 has no counterpart to the two zzso located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso Although the data suggest a close evolutionary relationship between zzso and zzso the striking differences set zzso apart from zzso
