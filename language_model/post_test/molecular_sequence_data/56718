Eleven zzso acid positions in the zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso by using a zzso method in which zzso is zzso at each position with a probability of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins in the resulting zzso library are active, including some zzso with as many as seven zzso zzso The frequency of zzso zzso in the set of active zzso is a measure of the importance of the zzso zzso at each zzso position, and comparison of the zzso of zzso zzso with those expected based upon the zzso zzso allows the zzso of zzso effects to be zzso For the positions examined here, we find that the effects of multiple zzso are largely additive and are able to predict the activity class of the zzso zzso with zzso accuracy by using a model that simply sums penalty scores derived from the zzso substitution zzso We also find, however, that several zzso pairs, including some that are distant in the three-dimensional structure, do display zzso effects that appear to be statistically zzso
