zzso factor zzso bound to its zzso tissue factor is the zzso zzso of blood zzso The interaction between factor zzso and tissue factor involves all four of the structural zzso found in factor zzso with the most significant contribution coming from the first zzso zzso In this study, the synthesis and biological activity of several zzso derived from the first zzso domain of zzso zzso the sequence zzso are reported zzso The six zzso zzso found in the native protein were replaced by zzso The peptides were isolated from a zzso mixture following standard zzso solid phase zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso product showed that zzso formation was a major zzso occurring predominantly at the zzso and zzso zzso Although relatively common in zzso zzso the extent to which this zzso had taken place was considered zzso zzso zzso are the zzso methods used to isolate and zzso several of the modified zzso Also, the zzso effect of these peptides on the formation and zzso activity of the factor zzso factor complex have been zzso Surprisingly, the zzso containing an zzso zzso at position 57 possessed zzso higher zzso activity compared with the original target zzso A possible explanation for this increase in observed activity is zzso
