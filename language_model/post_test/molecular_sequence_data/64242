zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from different host species and geographical locations in Mainland China were zzso zzso The second internal transcribed zzso zzso of nuclear zzso DNA zzso was amplified from individual zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and the representative zzso were cloned and zzso The length of the zzso sequences was zzso for all Chinese zzso specimens zzso While there was no variation in length or composition of the zzso sequences among multiple specimens from France, zzso and zzso sequence difference of zzso zzso was detected between specimens from France and zzso and those from zzso Based on zzso sequence data, it was concluded that the zzso from zzso represented zzso zzso the one from zzso represented zzso zzso and the one from sheep from zzso may represent an zzso zzso as its zzso sequences were unique in that two different zzso sequences exist in the zzso array within a single zzso zzso One of the sequences is identical to that of zzso zzso and the other is almost identical to that of zzso zzso in that zzso at five of the six zzso positions represent zzso zzso This zzso is possibly due to sequence zzso among copies of the zzso array within the same zzso Based on the sequence differences, a zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso was established for the unequivocal zzso of the zzso zzso from Mainland China using restriction zzso zzso or zzso This zzso should provide a valuable tool for the molecular identification and for studying the ecology and population genetic structures of zzso zzso from Mainland China and zzso
