zzso of zzso zzso undergo mating and zzso when starved for a nitrogen zzso In this process a P and and M cell first mate to generate a zzso zzso which subsequently enters zzso and zzso The P mating type is controlled by the zzso gene at the mating type zzso together with a gene called zzso We show that these two functions are required for expression of the zzso gene zzso We have cloned the zzso gene and show that it encodes a putative zzso containing zzso factor related to zzso zzso Response Factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein contains a motif characteristic for proteins that interact with zzso factors, suggesting that zzso and zzso may form a zzso that activates the zzso zzso zzso
