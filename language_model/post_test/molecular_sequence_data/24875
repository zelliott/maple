Several zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were previously shown to be zzso organisms based on the incorporation of zzso into cellular zzso The key zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso for zzso component proteins as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso for synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso have now been identified in zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso The organization of these genes is similar to the distinctive pattern that was first observed in zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso genes fused into the zzso gene and with the zzso gene split into the zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding zzso genes of these three zzso species are highly related to each zzso However, in the two zzso zzso the zzso and zzso genes are zzso by two zzso zzso which are absent in the corresponding region in zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso are zzso by the putative zzso and zzso genes (for zzso zzso which are absent in the corresponding region in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso grew well under zzso conditions, and the zzso activity of zzso was measured in the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso production occurred in zzso cultures, but the peak of zzso activity preceded the active zzso zzso
