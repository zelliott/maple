Three zzso zzso strains were isolated from the zzso of zzso plants grown in a zzso zzso zzso The strains showed biological control activity towards the zzso plant pathogen zzso zzso and were characterized to determine their zzso zzso zzso of the strains were zzso zzso and the strains were zzso and zzso and unable to zzso most zzso zzso The three strains showed differences in growth temperature range, optimal growth temperature and some zzso zzso The majority of the fatty acids were zzso and large amounts of 15 : 0 iso and 17 : 1 iso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence zzso zzso of strain zzso showed the highest level of similarity zzso zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain no longer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Less than 90 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity was observed for other members of the zzso The mean zzso zzso value for the three strains was 100 % and was 25 % when the strains were compared with DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso The strains had a mean DNA zzso content of zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso zzso and zzso properties, the three strains represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
