zzso zzso factor zzso zzso was detected in a wide range of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso expression zzso increased the number and size of colonies formed in soft zzso by zzso cell lines that were already zzso but did not induce transformation in zzso zzso To identify mechanisms that might lead to zzso expression of zzso the regulation of the zzso 2 promoter of the zzso which zzso the zzso start sites in zzso was zzso In transient and stable zzso this promoter was as active in zzso zzso cell lines as it was in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso lines was zzso and was activated further in lines zzso zzso with zzso zzso elements required for zzso activity lay outside the 300 zzso zzso promoter that was sufficient for zzso activity in zzso zzso but the zzso elements were retained in the zzso zzso zzso 2 promoter activity was selectively suppressed in zzso lines by inclusion of zzso 2, which has been implicated in zzso zzso Lewis lung zzso cells were able to partly bypass this block and expressed zzso zzso when grown in limiting zzso The finding that zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso levels are responsive to growth factor zzso pathways provides an insight into mechanisms that may lead to zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso
