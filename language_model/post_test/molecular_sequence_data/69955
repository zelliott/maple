zzso zzso zzso II initiation factor zzso zzso of human zzso is a protein zzso capable of zzso the zzso repeat domain of the zzso it possesses a zzso zzso activity as zzso The 85 zzso and 50 zzso zzso of factor b are now identified as zzso and zzso zzso zzso both are known to be involved in DNA zzso Factor b interacts specifically with another DNA repair zzso zzso The zzso activity of factor b may be due entirely to that associated with a zzso function of zzso Factor b zzso activity was zzso however, by zzso acid substitution at a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain, suggesting that the zzso function is not required for zzso These results identify factor b as a core zzso which may be responsible for the preferential repair of actively transcribed genes in zzso
