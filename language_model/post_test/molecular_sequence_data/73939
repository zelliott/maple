We constructed zzso clones zzso fragments of band 3 in which the membrane domain was truncated from either the N or the C zzso within each of the first four zzso zzso The zzso containing the C zzso of the protein were fused with the zzso zzso signal sequence of zzso A to facilitate the correct orientation of the most zzso band 3 membrane zzso zzso of the zzso A signal sequence was observed, except when the zzso was in the first zzso loop where the signal zzso zzso site was probably too close to the zzso The zzso transport activity of zzso complementary pairs of zzso which together contained the entire band 3 membrane domain was zzso The pairs of fragments divided in the third and fourth zzso zzso yielded transport activity, but the pair separated within the second zzso loop was not zzso We conclude that the integrity of the second zzso loop, but not the third and fourth zzso zzso is necessary for transport zzso The unusually stable association between the fragments divided in the second zzso loop suggests that interactions may occur between polar surfaces on zzso portions of the third and fifth zzso zzso
