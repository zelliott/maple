A novel zzso zzso of human zzso named zzso was isolated through the large-scale sequencing analysis of a human fetal brain zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso missed 22 zzso that existed in zzso leading to a different putative zzso The deduced proteins were 145 zzso acids zzso as zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso in zzso sharing the zzso 145 zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that human zzso were expressed in several human adult zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso were relatively high in brain and zzso In contrast, low levels of expression were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso
