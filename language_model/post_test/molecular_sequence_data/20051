Cell proliferation and cell fate decisions are strictly coupled processes during plant zzso and zzso In the zzso zzso root zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene determines zzso cell zzso This requires zzso of zzso information from the underlying cortical layer, complex zzso regulation and a change in zzso zzso However, the molecular connections among these factors and with cell division are not zzso Here we have identified a zzso zzso zzso as an zzso of zzso a DNA replication zzso zzso also interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein involved in zzso cell fate decision, and zzso both cell division and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso status of root patterning zzso providing a link between cell division, fate and differentiation during zzso root zzso
