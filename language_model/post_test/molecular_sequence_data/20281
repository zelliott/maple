Genes of the zzso cluster zzso for zzso regulators that show zzso expression along the zzso (AP) body axis in all bilateral zzso However, it is still unclear when in the evolutionary history of zzso the zzso system first zzso zzso identity along the zzso Recent molecular zzso have convincingly shown that the zzso zzso traditionally classified within the zzso are the sister group of the remaining zzso branching out before the common zzso of zzso and zzso (the so-called zzso This key zzso position offers the opportunity to search for the presence and early role of zzso cluster genes to pattern the zzso axis in zzso Here, we report on the zzso zzso arrangement, and expression zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso Three zzso genes were zzso one from each of the major groups of zzso zzso which are zzso central, and zzso In bacterial artificial zzso zzso sequencing, and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso genes were not observed as being clustered in a unique zzso zzso Nevertheless, despite its zzso within the zzso zzso genes are expressed in zzso zzso along the zzso axis in the juvenile zzso The basic set of zzso genes in zzso and their coarse zzso spatial deployment might be the first indicators of the role of zzso genes in the evolution of bilateral symmetry and zzso zzso identity from a hypothetical zzso zzso
