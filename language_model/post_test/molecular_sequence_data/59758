We recently isolated and zzso a 69 zzso protein zzso found associated with zzso small nuclear zzso zzso Here, we report the molecular cloning of a zzso zzso this zzso its zzso acid binding properties and its zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso shares structural similarity with the human zzso binding proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso identity, respectively), the products of two genes frequently targeted by zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso contains a consensus zzso binding domain zzso and three zzso zzso binding zzso structural features typical of many zzso binding zzso in particular of zzso zzso and zzso that zzso contains a single putative zzso zinc finger domain, a characteristic of many zzso zzso zzso with its possession of these zzso zzso display a general zzso acid binding activity, with a strong preference for zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as for zzso and zzso zzso The functional significance of this affinity for zzso acids remains zzso However, based on the established association of zzso with the zzso core domain of zzso in zzso these motifs might help mediate zzso binding to zzso or be involved in some, as yet, unknown aspect of zzso zzso zzso with both possibilities, zzso is detected within typical zzso containing zzso structures referred to as zzso and is also more widely distributed throughout the zzso as observed for many zzso zzso
