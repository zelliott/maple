Plant leaves, simple or compound, initiate as zzso structures from the peripheral zone of the shoot zzso zzso which requires class I zzso zzso zzso zzso factors to maintain its zzso The zzso domain protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with other factors, excludes zzso gene expression from zzso leaf zzso to initiate leaves and specify leaf zzso zzso However, the regulatory relationship between zzso and zzso is more complex in zzso zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso genes in compound leaf development in zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited severe compound leaf zzso including zzso and deep zzso of leaf margins, shortened zzso increased zzso zzso acquiring motor organ zzso and zzso development of zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit visible compound leaf zzso Our analyses show that the altered zzso development requires zzso expression of zzso zzso which encodes a lateral organ boundary domain zzso and that the zzso margin zzso requires the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
