The two replication origins of zzso zzso have been zzso The site of initiation of DNA replication at the plus origin was mapped to within an zzso zzso DNA synthesis initiated at the origin was made to terminate zzso in an inserted sequence of 18 base pairs that is zzso to a sequence in the zzso This suggests that zzso replicates as a rolling zzso The minus origin of zzso zzso has been zzso and the minimal sequence required for function has been zzso As with other minus origins, activity is orientation specific with respect to the direction of zzso Its activity is sensitive to zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Unlike all other plasmids of zzso bacteria thus far zzso the zzso minus origin is functional in more than one zzso
