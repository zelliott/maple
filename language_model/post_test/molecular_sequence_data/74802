A zzso clone was isolated from tree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library of burst buds and characterized with regard to its zzso expression in response to chilling treatment during the release of bud zzso and its function in transgenic zzso zzso The zzso designated as zzso contains zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence shows high zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso from various zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in tree zzso was strongly induced by chilling treatment during the release of bud zzso When the treated plants were transferred to normal growth conditions, the level of zzso transcripts induced by sufficient chilling could be maintained high, whereas that induced by insufficient chilling decreased zzso The transgenic zzso plants that zzso zzso showed rapid growth and earlier flowering than zzso zzso zzso contents in the transgenic plants were much higher than that in zzso plants through various zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that the product of zzso is a zzso and might play an important role during the release of bud dormancy in tree zzso
