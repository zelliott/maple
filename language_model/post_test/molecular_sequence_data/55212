zzso zzso zzso and fragmented zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties of the zzso did not depend on the zzso structure but could result from the compositions of zzso acid zzso and structures present in their primary zzso Furthermore, thirteen zzso active peptides were obtained by zzso zzso corresponding to fragments in the zzso chain and the zzso chain which are mostly located at the zzso and zzso zzso These active peptides operate on the bacterial cell zzso The zzso chains of zzso zzso showed similar zzso acids to the sequences of zzso zzso The novel zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso are not associated with the zzso binding site or the zzso zzso binding site, but could be important through their interactions with zzso of zzso
