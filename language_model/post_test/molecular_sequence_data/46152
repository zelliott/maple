zzso zzso is characterized by the zzso deposition as zzso of zzso light chains zzso zzso Jones proteins zzso in particular zzso and zzso This phenomenon has been attributed to the presence in zzso proteins of particular zzso acids that cause these molecules to become zzso as well as zzso modifications and, in regard to the latter, we have investigated the effect of zzso of zzso zzso on cell zzso We zzso an experimental system designed to test if zzso obtained from patients with zzso zzso or, as a control, multiple myeloma zzso bound human zzso and zzso zzso zzso As documented by zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso bound zzso and this zzso increased significantly after chemical modification of their zzso zzso with zzso Further, based on zzso zzso and circular zzso data, it was apparent that their zzso was altered, which we zzso exposed a binding site not accessible on the native zzso The results of our studies indicate that zzso structural modifications of zzso light chains can enhance their capacity for cellular interaction and thus may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso and multiple zzso
