Sexual development of zzso zzso is a unique and useful system for the study of sexual zzso We have been studying molecular mechanisms of sexual cell fusion in zzso zzso and have identified several relevant zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso was identified as a target zzso for zzso zzso and two genes for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The participation of zzso in the sexual cell fusion was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso but it is unclear which of the genes encodes zzso Moreover, the presence of a third gene for zzso was indicated by gene zzso In the present study, we generated strains of zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso to investigate the products of these zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with molecular masses of 135 and 130 zzso zzso Although their molecular masses were different from that of zzso the results of zzso mapping and zzso acid sequencing showed that they are related to zzso suggesting that the proteins zzso by zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso zzso
