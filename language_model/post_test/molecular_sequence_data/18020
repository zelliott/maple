The functional properties of the zzso responsive element zzso of the zzso zzso gene have been zzso using a transient expression zzso in zzso zzso zzso The ARE functions in both zzso although inversion of the ARE sequence relative to the zzso box element produces slightly weaker promoter activity under zzso conditions and elevated expression under zzso zzso zzso activity under zzso conditions is zzso to the number of complete ARE sequences in the zzso zzso The ARE contains two zzso and zzso of zzso II are as efficient as the zzso sequence in zzso gene expression under zzso zzso However, zzso I zzso do not appear capable of inducing gene expression in response to zzso zzso We conclude that zzso II is essential for zzso induction of gene zzso zzso gene expression remains constant when the spacing between zzso of the ARE is increased up to at least 64 zzso but increased spacing of 136 zzso or greater zzso expression in both zzso and zzso conditions, indicating that a close association of the two zzso is required both for zzso responsiveness and for zzso levels of zzso gene zzso When the ARE is placed upstream of position zzso of the zzso zzso promoter, the ARE produces a high level of expression in both zzso and zzso zzso The general enhancement of gene expression driven by the hybrid zzso promoter in zzso conditions requires an intact zzso II motif since zzso or deletion of zzso II from the hybrid promoter reduces the level of expression to that observed for the truncated zzso promoter zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso I sequences in the zzso hybrid promoter does not significantly reduce expression in zzso conditions, relative to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso I does not contribute to this general zzso zzso
