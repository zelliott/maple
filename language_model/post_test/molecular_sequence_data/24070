The influence of neutral zzso pressure versus selection on base composition evolution is a subject of considerable zzso Yet the present study represents the first explicit population genetic analysis of this issue in zzso the group in which base composition variation is most zzso Here, we explore the impact of zzso and selection on the dynamics of synonymous changes in zzso zzso the zzso bacterial zzso of zzso Specifically, we evaluated three forms of zzso zzso We compared the zzso of directional base changes zzso zzso zzso at synonymous sites within and between zzso species, to test for selective preference versus effective neutrality of these zzso zzso zzso zzso changes across a robust zzso zzso showed a nearly zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of base composition among zzso species indicated equal rates of zzso and zzso zzso The similarity of these patterns within and between species supported the neutral zzso zzso We observed an zzso of relative zzso AT zzso rate and current AT content at synonymous sites, indicating that base composition is at zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated statistically greater equality in the frequency of zzso categories in zzso than in parallel zzso studies that documented selection on synonymous zzso Our results indicate that effectively neutral zzso pressure, rather than selection, represents the major force driving base composition evolution in zzso Thus they further corroborate recent evidence for the critical role of reduced zzso in the molecular evolution of bacterial zzso
