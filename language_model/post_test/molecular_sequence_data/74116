zzso have been recently advocated as useful proxies for zzso a complex evolutionary history of a zzso In the present study, two species of feather zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for zzso variation and compared to zzso and nuclear variation in their host, the Australian magpie zzso zzso zzso constructed using maximum likelihood methods revealed geographic structuring for both species of feather zzso and zzso Our genetic analysis shows zzso of zzso structure between host and zzso zzso indicating that it is an zzso proxy for host zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso also suggested cryptic structuring within the eastern magpie population that had not been previously realized through genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso however, did not show zzso zzso structuring with the zzso Rather than showing an zzso split between zzso the zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso geographic zzso It is zzso that this zzso may be due to ecological habitat differences and/or the zzso ability of zzso zzso
