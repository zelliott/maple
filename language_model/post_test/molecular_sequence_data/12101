We report the characterization of the zzso region of the gene coding for the 2 alpha zzso collagen chain of the sea zzso zzso zzso This sequence analysis identified the zzso organization of the region of the gene coding for the signal zzso the zzso domain and the 12 repeats of the zzso module of the unusually long zzso This still unknown zzso motif is generally zzso by one zzso which confirms that the distinct zzso structures of the zzso zzso arise from the zzso of several zzso zzso Moreover, zzso analysis of the sea zzso zzso and sequencing of selected zzso clones allowed us to demonstrate that several sea zzso genes could potentially code for the zzso zzso zzso one of these genes lacks the zzso coding for four repeats of this motif while, in another zzso the same zzso are submitted to an alternative zzso zzso
