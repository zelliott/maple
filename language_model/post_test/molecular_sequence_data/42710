zzso of zzso class II genes is regulated by a complex series of zzso interactions which lead to the initiation of zzso Although the different zzso class II zzso are generally zzso zzso important differences in expression can be seen among zzso and among individual zzso The major sites of zzso control in the human zzso consist of several highly zzso zzso sequence elements located upstream of each zzso class II zzso We have analyzed the zzso and zzso variation in one of these key regulatory regions of the zzso promoter, the X box, and identified several sites of zzso zzso Two zzso complexes were found which differ between the zzso and DR zzso as well as two distinct complexes which differed between zzso zzso These nuclear zzso box interactions are likely to influence the differential expression of the zzso class II zzso and zzso in zzso or zzso regulated zzso
