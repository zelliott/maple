We previously demonstrated that the rat zzso zzso gene has three upstream enhancers that stimulate the zzso promoter zzso in zzso cells zzso In this paper, deletion analysis demonstrated that a zzso segment from zzso to zzso was required for full activity when the enhancers were distant from the promoter, even at less than their normal zzso zzso but zzso when the enhancers were moved close to the zzso This zzso zzso appears to interact simultaneously with all three zzso zzso analysis also localized a zzso zzso and a negative region in the zzso Though these latter regions controlled the strength of the isolated promoter, they did not affect zzso to the distant zzso and zzso stimulation by these zzso promoter elements was small compared to the distant zzso Overall, the distant zzso acting through the zzso element, accounted for zzso of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso nuclear extracts demonstrated protein binding at two sites near the zzso zzso The data indicate a positive zzso control mechanism by which distant enhancers stimulate the zzso promoter through a specific zzso zzso
