zzso zzso such as zzso zzso live in zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso which they grow with harvested leaf zzso The symbiotic zzso in turn, serve as a major food source for the zzso This zzso relation is disturbed by the specialized zzso fungus zzso zzso which can overcome zzso zzso and thus destroy the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been suggested to protect the fungus garden against zzso by producing zzso compounds zzso zzso Scott zzso zzso zzso zzso D (1999) zzso zzso use zzso bacteria to control garden zzso Nature zzso To date, however, the chemical nature of these compounds has remained zzso We characterized 19 zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso 1 zzso and 13 zzso from 3 zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso Because the strain zzso zzso zzso proved highly active against the pathogen zzso we identified the molecular basis of its zzso zzso Using zzso zzso high-resolution zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso and comparing the results with an authentic standard, we were able identify zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly active against zzso but do not significantly affect the growth of the symbiotic zzso At least one of the microbial zzso from each of the 3 zzso zzso species analyzed produced zzso zzso This suggests that zzso play an important role in protecting the fungus gardens of zzso zzso against zzso zzso
