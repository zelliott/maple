zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to different acute dose challenges zzso zzso or 1 zzso of the toxic metal zzso zzso were characterized with zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed and compared on both zzso zzso traps as well as linear zzso zzso mass zzso We have found that the zzso of zzso liquid zzso zzso with the rapid zzso high zzso linear zzso zzso platform resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of measured peptides and, thus, the number of identified zzso A total of zzso functionally diverse, zzso proteins were identified in this study, representing a relatively deep zzso coverage for this zzso The core molecular response to zzso challenge under all three zzso consisted predominantly of proteins with zzso functions in transport and binding zzso components of the zzso iron transport system, zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as a functionally undefined zzso response regulator zzso that might play a role in zzso metal stress zzso In addition, proteins zzso as a zzso zzso a putative zzso and various proteins involved in general stress protection were zzso at the higher zzso doses zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to metal treatment were distributed across diverse functional categories, with energy metabolism proteins zzso The results presented in this work demonstrate the dynamic dosage response of zzso zzso to zzso levels of zzso
