We describe a comparative protein zzso method designed to find the most probable structure for a sequence given its alignment with related zzso The three-dimensional zzso model is obtained by zzso satisfying spatial restraints derived from the alignment and expressed as probability density functions zzso for the features zzso For example, the probabilities for zzso zzso of a zzso zzso may be restrained by its zzso type, zzso zzso of an equivalent zzso in a related zzso and the local similarity between the two zzso Several such zzso are obtained from the correlations between structural features in 17 families of zzso proteins which have been aligned on the basis of their zzso zzso The zzso restrain C zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A smoothing procedure is used in the derivation of these relationships to minimize the problem of a sparse zzso The zzso model of a protein is obtained by zzso of the molecular zzso such that the model violates the input restraints as little as zzso The molecular zzso is derived as a combination of zzso restraining individual spatial features of the whole zzso The zzso procedure is a variable target function method that applies the zzso zzso zzso to positions of all zzso zzso The method is automated and is illustrated by the zzso of zzso from two other zzso zzso
