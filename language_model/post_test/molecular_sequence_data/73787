The zzso position of the zzso within the zzso tree is examined using two independent sets of molecular characters, the evolution of zzso zzso zzso sequences and the diversity of the genes belonging to the zzso zzso Among the various hypotheses that have been considered by zzso a position of the zzso within the zzso related to the zzso with typical spiral zzso appears to be zzso when taking into account all separate lines of zzso It is in conflict with the traditional hypothesis of an early emergence at the base of the zzso symmetrical zzso This relatively late emergence is compatible with the old idea that zzso are derived from a zzso zzso New evidence from the sequences of zzso genes suggests that the duplicated genes zzso constitute a genetic zzso of the whole zzso zzso
