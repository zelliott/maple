The reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso is a technique for the study of gene expression that requires far less zzso for analysis than Northern zzso The inclusion of zzso standards in the initial reverse zzso step is a way to control for the zzso variation often inherent in the technique and to permit zzso of the starting amount of the native zzso being zzso We describe a method using overlapping zzso to produce templates for the production of zzso standards for up to three different zzso zzso The first step is the synthesis of a pair of overlapping zzso each of which zzso respectively, sequences analogous to either sense or zzso zzso for the zzso amplification of up to three different zzso These zzso are designed to have complementary 3' ends which permit spontaneous zzso and allow subsequent mutually zzso extension of the zzso zzso portion by zzso DNA zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso promoters are then added to the ends of the template using standard zzso zzso Once the template is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are used to produce copious quantities of zzso standards and zzso This technique can be used to construct multiple zzso standards for essentially any messages of zzso zzso of zzso by a single zzso zzso zzso reaction yields standards sufficient for several thousand separate reverse zzso
