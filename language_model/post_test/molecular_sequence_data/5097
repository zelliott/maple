In the majority of cases of zzso zzso zzso in Australia, no known zzso agent can be zzso We have examined the possible role of the recently discovered zzso G virus zzso in such zzso 

An zzso specific reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed on zzso and zzso transplant serum from 14 patients who were referred for transplantation at our unit between 1989 and 1995 for unexplained zzso zzso zzso Eleven patients successfully underwent transplantation and three died while waiting for a suitable donor zzso zzso viruses zzso were excluded by standard zzso and zzso based zzso zzso zzso was also performed on 21 other, randomly selected, liver transplant recipients zzso 

The 14 zzso cases were zzso zzso negative prior to transplantation while five of 21 controls were zzso zzso eight of the 11 zzso patients were found to be zzso zzso positive and the same five controls remained zzso zzso zzso In three of the eight zzso patients the zzso infection zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso infection is unlikely to be responsible for zzso zzso and that it is probably acquired from blood and/or blood products during the transplantation zzso Furthermore, long-term carriage of zzso zzso is not associated with clinically apparent liver zzso
