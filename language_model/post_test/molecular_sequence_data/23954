Usher syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso disorder characterized by deafness and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the genetic cause of zzso in a four generation Indian zzso 

zzso blood samples were collected from individuals for zzso DNA zzso To determine the linkage of this family to known zzso zzso zzso markers were selected from the candidate regions of known zzso and used to zzso the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso for the zzso gene were used to amplify DNA samples from one affected individual from the zzso zzso products were subsequently zzso to detect zzso zzso analysis was used to determine if the zzso zzso with the disease in the family and was not present in 50 control zzso 

All affected individuals had a classic zzso type I zzso zzso which included deafness, zzso dysfunction and zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested an zzso zzso mode of inheritance of zzso in the zzso zzso analysis suggested linkage of this family to the zzso locus on zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding region of the zzso gene showed a novel zzso zzso zzso in a zzso state in all affected individuals, resulting in zzso of zzso zzso 

This is the first study from India which reports a novel zzso zzso zzso in a four generation zzso zzso The zzso is predicted to produce a truncated zzso zzso With the novel zzso reported here, the total number of zzso causing zzso in the zzso gene described to date reaches to zzso
