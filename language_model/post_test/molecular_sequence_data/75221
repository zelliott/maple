The major zzso on the surface of zzso zzso zzso are derived from a single high molecular weight zzso The precursor to the major zzso surface zzso zzso has zzso and variable zzso zzso and varies in size in different zzso Since the protein is a candidate for a malaria zzso it is important to understand the molecular basis of this zzso We present the complete sequence of the zzso of the zzso New zzso isolate zzso and the partial sequence of the West African isolate zzso The gene consists of blocks of sequence which are either zzso or variable between different zzso zzso sequences fall into two distinct types, indicating that the zzso is zzso by zzso zzso that undergo zzso within zzso blocks at the zzso end of the zzso zzso exchange is not apparent within the other two-thirds of the gene in 12 zzso suggesting strong selection against such zzso The most variable block located near the zzso end contains repeats that are different in independent cloned zzso This variation presumably accounts for much of the size and zzso zzso
