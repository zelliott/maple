The interaction of viruses and their zzso hosts shaped the evolution of bacterial and zzso zzso zzso developed several strategies to evade viral attacks that include restriction zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso These zzso immune systems found in many zzso and most zzso consist of clustered regularly zzso short zzso repeat zzso sequences and a number of zzso associated zzso genes zzso 1) zzso Different sets of zzso proteins and repeats define at least three major divergent types of zzso systems zzso The universal proteins zzso and zzso are proposed to be involved in the zzso of viral DNA that will generate a new zzso element between two repeats at the zzso zzso of an extending zzso cluster zzso The entire cluster is transcribed into a zzso containing all zzso and repeat sequences and is subsequently processed by an zzso of the diverse zzso family into smaller zzso zzso These zzso consist of the zzso sequence flanked by a zzso terminal (8 zzso and a 3' terminal tag derived from the repeat sequence zzso A repeated infection of the virus can now be blocked as the new zzso will be directed by a zzso protein complex zzso to the viral DNA and identify it as such via base zzso Finally, for zzso type 1 systems, the zzso zzso will destroy the detected zzso DNA zzso zzso These processes define zzso as an zzso immune system of zzso and opened a fascinating research field for the study of the involved zzso zzso The function of many zzso proteins is still elusive and the causes for the apparent diversity of the zzso systems remain to be zzso Potential activities of most zzso proteins were predicted via detailed zzso zzso A major fraction of zzso proteins are either shown or proposed to function as zzso zzso Here, we present methods to generate zzso and zzso for the study of zzso zzso Different zzso zzso require either short repeat sequences that can directly be zzso as zzso zzso or longer zzso and zzso sequences that are generated via in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This methodology allows the incorporation of radioactive zzso for the generation of internally labeled zzso zzso and the creation of synthetic or zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso to mature zzso into zzso with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso
