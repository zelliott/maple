Members of the zzso family play important roles in the formation of tight junctions in the zzso liver and zzso zzso zzso a newly identified member of this family, is highly expressed in the kidney of the zzso To have a better understanding on mouse zzso gene zzso a zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso region of the zzso gene was zzso DNA sequence comparison between the mouse and human zzso promoter regions exhibited little zzso One zzso initiation site was located at 104 zzso upstream of the start zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The mouse zzso promoter lacked typical zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso were generated and fused to a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso studies using various kidney cell lines zzso zzso and zzso revealed that the minimal promoter zzso resided in the zzso to zzso region, which contained a number of binding sites for zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso using specific zzso zzso confirmed that zzso was crucial for zzso zzso in the three cell lines zzso zzso shift zzso confirmed that the nuclear extracts of these cells bound to the zzso zzso derived from zzso promoter, but not to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso complex would be recognized by zzso zzso indicating specific zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso binds to the zzso promoter region and is responsible for its expression in the kidney cell lines in zzso
