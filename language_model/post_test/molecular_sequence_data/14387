The zzso family has undergone a significant expansion during the evolution of zzso resulting in varied functions that have yet to be discerned or fully zzso Likewise, members of the zzso a related zzso zzso are found throughout the cell with little known about their functions outside the zzso zzso While the zzso zzso knockout mouse resulted in skin zzso we find larger, including lethal effects following its depletion in zzso zzso unlike some other characterized zzso in zzso does not have significant maternal deposits of zzso However, during zzso two zzso protein products whose zzso expression is partially complimentary become zzso Only the smaller of these products is found in adult zzso zzso with an expression pattern exhibiting distinctions as well as zzso with those observed in zzso zzso We determined that zzso zzso depletion causes a skin fragility zzso in keeping with the mouse zzso but more novel, zzso zzso zzso are zzso to touch even in zzso lacking outward zzso zzso and we additionally resolved disruptions in certain peripheral neural structures, altered establishment and migration of neural zzso and defects in zzso zzso zzso The use of two distinct zzso as well as rescue approaches, indicated the specificity of these zzso Our results point to the requirement of zzso in zzso zzso with functional roles in a number of tissue zzso
