The zzso zzso gene encodes zzso IV of the zzso zzso complex and is required for zzso electron zzso We have created zzso strains in which the initiation zzso of the zzso gene has been changed to zzso or zzso These zzso can grow zzso at room temperature, but not at 35 degrees zzso The zzso of zzso IV during zzso or zzso growth at room temperature is reduced to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso abundance is reduced to approximately 50% of the zzso zzso Pulse labeling experiments indicate that at room temperature, zzso IV translation proceeds at zzso of the zzso zzso zzso grown zzso at 35 degrees C accumulate zzso zzso as much zzso IV as zzso cells grown under the same conditions, and zzso zzso as much zzso IV as zzso cells grown at room zzso We conclude that translation initiation in these zzso is inefficient, leading to decreased translation and zzso of zzso zzso At 35 degrees C, zzso inefficiency leads directly or indirectly to insufficient zzso of zzso IV to support zzso zzso
