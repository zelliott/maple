We have previously characterized a family of zzso isolated from bovine zzso zzso that are related to zzso zzso and are distinct from zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a zzso gene that zzso to one of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and sequence analysis of this gene reveal that it is distributed among five zzso spanning approximately zzso zzso The site of zzso initiation was determined and repetitive sequences were localized in the first two zzso The zzso sequence of the coding region is zzso zzso to the zzso gene and zzso zzso to the bovine growth hormone zzso zzso The zzso region shows no zzso zzso to that of zzso or zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that this gene is a member of a family of zzso zzso
