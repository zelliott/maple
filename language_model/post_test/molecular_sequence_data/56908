Two zzso elements from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso were used as zzso in a gel shift zzso to investigate the interactions of the zzso zzso zzso with its zzso DNA response zzso The source of zzso was a nuclear extract from the late zzso zzso fat zzso The zzso and D zzso share a sequence similarity at 12 positions over a zzso region including an imperfect zzso structure consisting of two zzso zzso separated by a single intervening zzso We have shown that a short zzso containing this zzso imperfect zzso of the zzso zzso and three zzso zzso on each side is an efficient zzso binding zzso zzso analysis confirms that the integrity of both these zzso as well as their zzso spacing are critical for binding of the zzso zzso The D zzso behaved as a much weaker zzso binding site than the zzso zzso but a single zzso substitution was sufficient to zzso upon it a binding capacity equivalent to that of the zzso zzso These results have led us to propose the sequence zzso as a revised version of a previously proposed zzso consensus zzso
