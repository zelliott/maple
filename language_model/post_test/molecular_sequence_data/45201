zzso adaptation zzso in zzso has provided a model system for the study of the environmental control of zzso for several zzso All forms of CA that have been examined so far zzso II and zzso involve changes in the relative contents of zzso zzso and/or zzso when cells are shifted from red to green light and vice zzso However, the zzso compositions of these zzso are not zzso Some marine zzso species zzso which possess two zzso forms zzso and zzso carry out another type of CA zzso zzso occurring during shifts from blue to green or white zzso Two zzso adapting strains of marine zzso recently isolated from the Gulf of Mexico were zzso to zzso the mechanism of type IV zzso During this process, no change in the relative contents of zzso and zzso was zzso Instead, the ratio of the two zzso bound to zzso zzso and zzso is high under blue light and low under white zzso Mass zzso analyses of isolated zzso zzso and zzso show that there is a single zzso protein type under all light zzso The CA process seems to specifically affect the zzso of the zzso (and possibly zzso alpha zzso We propose a likely process for type IV CA, which involves the zzso activity of one or several zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso controlled by the ambient light zzso zzso analyses based on the zzso zzso gene confirm that type IV CA is not limited to a single zzso of marine zzso
