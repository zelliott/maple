Recent advances in the evolutionary zzso of sex determination indicate that the only molecular similarity in sex determination found so far among zzso is between the fly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 1) zzso zzso Each of these factors encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into the evolution and functions of human zzso gene could reveal evolutionary mechanisms of sexual zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of multiple zzso of human zzso in the zzso These transcripts zzso predicted proteins with zzso 275 and 175 zzso acids and they were generated by alternative zzso at 3' zzso zzso level of zzso is higher than those of both zzso and zzso and the zzso expression was the lowest in zzso based on comparisons of mean values from real-time fluorescent quantitative zzso zzso Both zzso and c result from zzso of zzso zzso including the zzso of an zzso zzso A further search for zzso elements within the zzso gene demonstrated that all 99 zzso elements are zzso distributed among the zzso regions on both zzso These new characteristics of zzso would have an important impact on the evolution of sexual development zzso
