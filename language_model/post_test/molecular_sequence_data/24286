The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family of proteins has been implicated in both signal zzso and zzso We have previously identified human zzso zzso and mouse zzso Here, we report the cloning of mouse zzso the discovery of two alternatively spliced zzso of zzso and human zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso which map to zzso and zzso zzso We mapped the zzso interactive region of the zzso zzso and show that both zzso and zzso use an zzso zzso domain for zzso binding rather than several available zzso zzso motifs found in members of the zzso Furthermore, we have characterized the protein expression of both zzso and zzso in adult mouse zzso and show them to be both tissue and zzso zzso
