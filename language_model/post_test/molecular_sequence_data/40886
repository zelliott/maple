zzso is the blue respiratory protein of many zzso zzso While its structure, evolution, and zzso function have been studied in detail in zzso there is little information on zzso from other zzso zzso Here, we have investigated the zzso of the zzso zzso shrimp zzso zzso which belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso (2 zzso zzso which is composed of at least four distinct zzso zzso We obtained the full-length zzso sequences of three zzso zzso while a fourth zzso was incomplete at its zzso zzso The complete full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso translate into zzso of zzso zzso zzso which include signal peptides of 16 or 17 zzso zzso The predicted molecular masses of zzso zzso zzso well with the main zzso proteins detected by zzso and Western zzso using various zzso zzso zzso analyses show that zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which zzso from the other zzso before the radiation of the zzso zzso around 520 million years zzso zzso clock analysis revealed an ancient and complex pattern of zzso zzso evolution in zzso and also allowed dating divergence times of zzso zzso
