The zzso zzso system zzso is applied to studies of zzso zzso interactions under in zzso conditions detected by reporter gene zzso By use of a zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso as a reporter, the new zzso generation represents a zzso and zzso alternative to the established zzso zzso However, zzso a positive control proving the functionality of the system has been zzso We designed a corresponding control zzso combination by zzso mouse zzso zzso and its binding sequence and, to get the system working, modified the distance between cloning site and reporter gene promoter in the reporter zzso by zzso zzso This provides, for the first time, a positive control zzso combination for the zzso zzso crucial for its employment in any zzso interaction zzso
