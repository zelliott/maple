New methods that allow, for the first time, genetic analysis in zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso First, several autonomously replicating zzso shuttle zzso have been constructed based on the naturally occurring zzso zzso from zzso zzso These zzso replicate in 9 of 11 zzso strains tested and in zzso zzso Second, a highly efficient transformation system based upon introduction of DNA by zzso has been zzso This method allows transformation zzso of as high as 2 zzso zzso zzso per zzso of DNA per zzso cells or approximately zzso of the recipient zzso During the course of this work, the complete zzso DNA sequence of zzso was zzso The implications of these findings for the future of zzso research are also zzso
