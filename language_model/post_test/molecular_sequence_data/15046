The trace zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso relationship studies on 1 and related zzso showed that the rat and mouse species of zzso zzso structural modifications and functional groups on the zzso portion and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso However, the two receptors clearly exhibited zzso zzso zzso preferences despite being remarkably similar with zzso sequence zzso In this study, we generated single and double zzso of rat and mouse zzso to probe the molecular recognition of zzso and the underlying basis for the zzso selectivity of rat and mouse zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso in zzso zzso 4 and 7 within the zzso binding site appear to be the primary source of a number of the observed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 7 dictated the preference for a zzso ring, while zzso zzso in zzso 4 was partially responsible for the lower potency of 1 and zzso for the mouse zzso Additionally, 1 and zzso were found to have the same binding mode in rat zzso despite zzso relationship data suggesting the possibility of each zzso having different binding zzso These findings provide valuable insights into the critical binding site zzso involved in the zzso interaction that can influence compound selectivity and functional activity of zzso zzso
