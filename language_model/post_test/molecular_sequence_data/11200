zzso play an essential role in the control of the cell zzso In this study the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso structure, and zzso zzso were zzso Genes with high zzso to zzso zzso zzso were detected in various zzso including human, zzso zzso dog, zzso and zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed in all zzso zzso zzso with the highest levels in cardiac and skeletal zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso encompassing the promoter region and the zzso region of the gene was cloned and zzso Three putative binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors were zzso Furthermore, an upstream zzso site was localized to zzso zzso to zzso and a new putative zzso site was identified in the first zzso region at zzso 275 to zzso By zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene was mapped to mouse zzso zzso This region is zzso with human zzso zzso consistent with the recent mapping of the human zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso will facilitate determination of gene linkage and the identification of zzso groups in zzso and of DNA elements in or near this gene that mediate its tissue expression or zzso pattern of zzso
