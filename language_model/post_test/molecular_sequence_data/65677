zzso zzso is commonly used after proteins are resolved by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso It can also be used on its own in conjunction with tandem mass zzso zzso for the direct analysis of complex zzso Here, we describe a strategy combining isolation of zzso plasma zzso efficient zzso of plasma membrane proteins in zzso zzso and zzso analysis by advanced mass zzso to create a new rapid and zzso zzso The plasma membrane protein mixture is directly incorporated into a zzso gel zzso After formation of the zzso proteins in the gel section are zzso with zzso and the resulting peptides are subjected to zzso zzso liquid zzso followed by zzso zzso tandem mass zzso Using this zzso strategy, we have identified zzso rat liver membrane zzso of which zzso had a gene zzso zzso zzso indicating a cellular zzso and zzso zzso of the latter were known integral membrane proteins or membrane zzso In total, zzso proteins are predicted by the zzso zzso zzso to have zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso proteins to contain zzso zzso The identified membrane proteins provide a broad representation of the rat plasma membrane zzso with little bias evident due to protein p I and molecular weight zzso Also, membrane proteins with a high GRAVY score zzso average zzso zzso were identified, and basic and zzso membrane proteins were evenly zzso This study not only offered an efficient and powerful method in shotgun zzso for the identification of proteins of complex plasma membrane samples but also allowed in-depth study of liver membrane zzso such as of rat models of zzso zzso This work represents one of the most comprehensive zzso analyses of the membrane zzso of rat liver plasma membrane in zzso
