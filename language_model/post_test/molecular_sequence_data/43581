zzso of membrane proteins between compartments of the zzso zzso is zzso in part by their zzso zzso zzso In animal cells, zzso length is a major factor in zzso zzso In zzso the role of zzso signals is less clear; it has been proposed that membrane proteins travel by default to the zzso and are prevented from doing so by zzso zzso We have investigated the targeting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso is important for both function and zzso zzso and that the requirements for each are zzso zzso is independent of zzso the only candidate sorting zzso for zzso sequences currently zzso zzso the zzso zzso allows transport along the zzso zzso to the zzso or plasma zzso The choice between these destinations is determined by the length and composition of the zzso but not by its precise zzso A longer zzso is required to reach the plasma membrane in zzso than in animal cells, and shorter zzso direct proteins to the zzso zzso sorting is therefore a general feature of the zzso zzso pathway, but occurs by different mechanisms at different zzso
