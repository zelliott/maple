Using zzso zzso we have found that two highly zzso fragments of heat shock protein 70 reduce zzso zzso The fragments are zzso and zzso zzso was more potent than zzso at low zzso zzso At high zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso was more potent than zzso Reduction of zzso by zzso was reversed by zzso c zzso These findings show that heat shock protein 70 and/or small zzso peptides could carry electrons to zzso
