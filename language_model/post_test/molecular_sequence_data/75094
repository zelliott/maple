A zzso zzso zzso zzso the light zzso of smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso was isolated from a rabbit zzso zzso library constructed in zzso zzso zzso This smooth muscle zzso zzso demonstrates significant zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso with known zzso zzso genes from zzso rat zzso and zzso body wall myosin, and even with zzso zzso gene from a slime mold zzso zzso suggesting that smooth muscle, zzso muscle, and zzso zzso genes zzso from a common zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the smooth muscle light zzso show very similar periodic zzso of zzso and charged zzso as found for the light zzso of zzso muscle zzso together with a high potential for zzso formation, indicating an zzso zzso structure for the smooth muscle light zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mapping has revealed that this smooth muscle zzso gene for zzso is specifically expressed in smooth muscles of vascular and zzso types but not in the zzso muscles or zzso zzso
