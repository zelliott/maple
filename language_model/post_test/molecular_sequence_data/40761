zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize zzso integral and five peripheral zzso of the zzso zzso II complex from the zzso red zzso zzso zzso The primary separation used zzso zzso with zzso fraction collection zzso yielding around 40 intact mass tags at 100 zzso mass accuracy on a zzso zzso mass zzso whose retention and mass were used to guide subsequent high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso experiments zzso Both zzso activated and electron capture zzso were used to confirm the presence of zzso small zzso to mass accuracy within 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso showed zzso modifications that fall into three classes including retention of initiating zzso removal of zzso at the zzso with or without zzso and removal of a longer zzso zzso zzso zzso identified by zzso analysis included zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso high-resolution zzso provides the necessary precision, typically less than 5 zzso for identification and characterization of zzso composition of these important membrane protein zzso
