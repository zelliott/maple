zzso between vascular cell zzso zzso 1 zzso which appears on the surface of zzso cells in response to zzso and its zzso counter zzso alpha 4 beta 1, on immune cells is responsible for targeting these immune cells to zzso zzso In addition to its role in the immune system, zzso is also expressed in a zzso specific pattern on zzso skeletal muscle, where it mediates zzso interactions important for zzso through interaction with alpha 4 beta zzso In contrast to zzso there is high zzso expression of zzso in skeletal muscle cells and the expression is not zzso Here, we examine the molecular basis for these contrasting patterns of expression in muscle and zzso using zzso promoter zzso in a series of zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso binding sites act as zzso that prevent zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha overcomes the negative effects of these zzso and activates the promoter through two adjacent zzso B binding zzso In muscle cells, a zzso zzso located between zzso zzso and -5 zzso the effect of other promoter zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso A nuclear protein binds the zzso zzso in muscle but not zzso zzso thus the pattern of expression of this protein could control zzso zzso
