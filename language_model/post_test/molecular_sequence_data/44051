A new generation of tests to control live attenuated zzso vaccines are under development based on major advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of zzso and zzso to zzso of zzso These include an alternative in zzso zzso test in transgenic mice that express the human zzso zzso and a new in zzso test, the zzso zzso analysis by zzso chain reaction and restriction zzso zzso zzso that zzso consistency of production at a molecular zzso Excellent progress is being made with both methods but neither is sufficiently developed yet for regulatory zzso Critical review of existing control tests shows that the WHO zzso test is well standardized and contributes significantly to the assessment of each zzso On the other hand, the current zzso test is neither standardized nor particularly zzso though improvements could be made in both zzso The continued relevance of other marker tests such as the d or zzso marker is zzso zzso identity and zzso stability tests are crucial for control of the final zzso zzso
