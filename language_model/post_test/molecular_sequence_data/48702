zzso zzso provides a unique system to assess the impact of zzso zzso on plant diversification and zzso The zzso exhibits remarkable zzso variation but very little zzso zzso Basic numbers of zzso 5, 6 and 7, extensive zzso and numerous zzso zzso zzso were zzso but only three species are commonly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the latter zzso four zzso zzso The relationship between evolutionary patterns and zzso variation in zzso the basic zzso of the extensive zzso diversity, is zzso 

zzso zzso were derived from zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso size zzso and zzso analyses of internal transcribed zzso zzso of zzso zzso of 49 zzso in the three species and all zzso of zzso zzso zzso All species and zzso possess a single zzso zzso zzso zzso except in zzso zzso where it is zzso and one or two zzso zzso zzso zzso a third in zzso zzso at fixed zzso The zzso of the two zzso types is unique for each species and zzso zzso data in the zzso zzso complex enable tracing of the evolution of zzso zzso zzso size, and direction of zzso zzso mixed descending zzso of zzso to zzso and independently to zzso rather than successive descending zzso is zzso 

All zzso zzso are recovered as zzso evolutionary zzso The zzso and zzso approaches have provided excellent zzso markers to zzso the direction of zzso change in zzso Evolution in zzso especially in the zzso zzso complex, has been driven by differentiation of an ancestral zzso largely unaccompanied by zzso zzso These new results provide a framework for detailed analyses of various types of zzso zzso and zzso variation in zzso
