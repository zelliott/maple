zzso is a component of the zzso a coat complex required to transport the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso network to the plasma zzso The zzso zzso region exhibits zzso type III zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in proteins that mediate zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso are involved in DNA zzso Several zzso zzso zzso which has no zzso amounts of zzso proteins similar to zzso Here we show that the zzso and zzso motifs in zzso behave as a module that is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso and for cargo zzso The zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are interchangeable in terms of zzso zzso but not in terms of zzso zzso showing that the zzso function of this module is protein retention in this zzso and that the interaction between the zzso components is zzso
