The zzso zzso protein is a key regulator involved in the zzso shift from early to late pattern of zzso expression from the zzso major late zzso zzso zzso is a zzso alternative zzso factor, which enhances processing of 3' zzso sites with a weak sequence zzso Here we show that zzso expressed from a zzso is localized at the nuclear margin of zzso zzso During an infection zzso is zzso to the periphery of zzso containing viral replication zzso We also show that zzso 192 in the tiny zzso repeat of the zzso zzso of zzso which is critical for the zzso zzso function of zzso is necessary for the nuclear zzso and zzso of the protein to viral replication zzso zzso our results show a good correlation between the activity of zzso as a zzso zzso protein and its zzso to the periphery of viral replication zzso
