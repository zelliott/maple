The zzso of lake trout zzso zzso contain a considerable amount of zzso located at the zzso and/or zzso of several zzso including a zzso block located zzso on the X zzso In order to investigate further the repetitive zzso of lake trout, zzso DNA from a female was size zzso zzso zzso with the restriction zzso zzso and fragments were cloned into the zzso zzso A total of 42 clones were zzso Relative copy number of individual zzso within the lake trout zzso was estimated by Southern zzso Twelve clones were determined to be highly repetitive and were chosen for further zzso zzso of these clones contained sequences similar to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso families reported from Arctic zzso zzso zzso The zzso location of several of these fragments was determined in lake trout by zzso in zzso zzso zzso Two related zzso sequences zzso A, approximately 140 zzso and Type zzso 120 zzso showed differential zzso Type A zzso to the zzso of all zzso as well as several zzso zzso Type B zzso to the zzso of most zzso zzso A sequence with zzso to the zzso family zzso to the zzso of several zzso zzso zzso with partial similarity to the zzso family zzso to the major zzso sites zzso organizer regions, zzso and several minor zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of lake trout, including that of the X zzso appears to comprise sequences belonging to the zzso zzso
