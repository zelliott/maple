Two plasmids were isolated containing zzso oriented zzso insertions between the zzso zzso initiation site of the zzso zzso and the zzso coding zzso The zzso promoter of zzso pneumoniae, similar to other nitrogen fixation zzso zzso normally requires the products of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso that allowed zzso expression of the zzso zzso were searched for by transforming a zzso containing the regulatory region of this zzso followed by an zzso zzso fusion, into a zzso zzso coli strain (which contains no zzso and screening for zzso zzso The plasmids described here were isolated from such derivatives and directed the zzso expression of zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso promoters other than those zzso zzso and zzso were involved in this zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed zzso zzso initiation sites in both the gamma end and the delta end of the zzso Most interestingly, one initiation site on each end was located in corresponding positions within the terminal zzso zzso The sites were in the center of the longest zzso of 12 zzso zzso zzso between the terminal zzso repeats of zzso and the related zzso zzso In zzso and zzso this sequence has been recently implicated in zzso zzso These results suggest a possible zzso between zzso from the zzso promoters and zzso
