zzso d of zzso zzso from rat liver zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso by zzso high performance liquid zzso The partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso was determined by automated zzso degradation of the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso d of rat liver zzso zzso was determined from a zzso zzso clone isolated by screening a rat zzso cell line zzso zzso library with a probe zzso The sequence was composed of zzso zzso including a coding region for the import precursor of zzso d and zzso regions on the zzso and zzso zzso The possible precursor of zzso d and its mature zzso deduced from the open reading frame consisted of 161 and 160 zzso acid zzso with molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso zzso d is a zzso protein with an zzso point of zzso The sequence of the rat zzso d is highly zzso with that of zzso d of bovine heart and slightly similar to that of the zzso d of the zzso zzso However, it had no zzso with the sequence of any of the zzso of bacterial or zzso zzso zzso
