zzso zzso is a typical member of the family of plant zzso zzso zzso which have a central zzso group zzso zzso domain that is flanked by a basic zzso region and a highly zzso zzso zzso The basic zzso domain positively influences various DNA interactions of the zzso while the zzso zzso domain has the opposite zzso Using zzso binding and zzso mobility shift zzso we demonstrate that the zzso basic domain binds DNA by itself, consistent with its positive effects on the DNA interactions of zzso To examine whether the negative effect of the zzso zzso domain is brought about by interactions with the basic part of zzso zzso region, zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso acid zzso of the protein was zzso These experiments revealed that the zzso zzso domain interacts with the basic zzso zzso The zzso interaction between the two zzso charged zzso of the protein is enhanced when zzso zzso in the zzso tail of zzso are zzso by protein zzso zzso which can explain the negative effect of the zzso on certain DNA zzso In line with that, zzso zzso of the two terminal zzso resulted in a reduced affinity of zzso for linear zzso zzso to the finding with zzso zzso the basic zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso indicating that these zzso zzso which can zzso zzso protein function, generally occur in plant zzso zzso
