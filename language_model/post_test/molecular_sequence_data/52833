To study the nature of genes that are induced during the zzso death of zzso precursor cells, we performed zzso difference analysis zzso using zzso zzso cells that were deprived of zzso for zzso We have isolated a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein that is expressed in the zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso derived from zzso cells that have been grown in the absence of zzso demonstrates that the zzso message is zzso in these cells following the removal of zzso suggesting that this gene may regulate growth factor zzso zzso of zzso precursor zzso
