zzso coli DNA zzso mediates zzso of zzso zzso occurring in zzso zzso The zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To define the roles of the two zzso in the zzso zzso resulting in DNA repair and the effect of DNA structure on the zzso step, we determined the absolute action zzso of the zzso containing only zzso zzso or both zzso zzso with double- and zzso zzso and with zzso of different sequences in the immediate vicinity of the zzso zzso We found that the shape of the action spectrum of zzso matches that of the zzso spectrum with a quantum yield zzso zzso zzso zzso The action spectrum of zzso is also in a fairly good agreement with the zzso spectrum with zzso zzso zzso zzso From these values and from the previously established properties of the two zzso we propose that zzso transfers energy to zzso with a quantum yield of zzso zzso T zzso zzso and that zzso zzso transfers an electron to or from the zzso with a quantum yield zzso zzso zzso zzso The chemical nature of the zzso did not change after several zzso zzso The zzso repaired a zzso zzso in five different sequence contexts with the same zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso zzso were repaired with the same overall quantum zzso
