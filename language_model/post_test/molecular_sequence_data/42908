The zzso zzso zzso of three zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso experiments using several zzso coli zzso zzso The three strains of zzso bacteria tested were able to convert zzso acid to zzso through a zzso synthetic zzso identical to that from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was cloned by zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso gene was located on a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso sequence analysis of this zzso revealed that the zzso gene of zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso open reading zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence is zzso and zzso identical to that of the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso gene products, zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by in zzso disruption of the zzso gene lost their ability to grow on minimal medium containing zzso indicating that the zzso gene product is necessary for the conversion of zzso to zzso
