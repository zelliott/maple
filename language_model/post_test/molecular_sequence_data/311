The cell surface of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, is covered by a dense layer of zzso zzso zzso These molecules are involved in a variety of interactions between this zzso and its zzso and insect zzso Here, using the neutral zzso zzso zzso we obtained zzso rich in zzso and other membrane proteins from insect zzso stages of zzso zzso These zzso were analyzed by two-dimensional liquid zzso coupled to tandem mass zzso zzso resulting in the identification of 98 proteins of zzso zzso and 280 of zzso Of those, approximately zzso zzso had predicted zzso zzso modification sites zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso that could explain their zzso in zzso zzso The identification of some of these modified proteins was also validated by zzso We also present evidence that, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso forms, the zzso zzso zzso zzso forms express a large repertoire of surface zzso such as zzso and zzso which are involved in zzso and invasion of host zzso Taken together, our results unequivocally show zzso protein profiles that appear to be related to the biology of each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
