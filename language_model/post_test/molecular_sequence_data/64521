zzso zzso is a tightly regulated zzso One of the crucial factors determining the swimming of the zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso pH zzso The possibility that its zzso zzso zzso channel zzso is modulated directly by pH is addressed zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso 518 from the zzso connecting the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso binding domain is responsible for the pH zzso of current zzso and zzso dependence of zzso The effect of mutating zzso 518 to zzso zzso on the time constant of zzso was zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but only zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso 518 accounted for zzso of the shift in the zzso of half zzso ( zzso in zzso following a pH change from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso also shifted zzso by 19 zzso at pH zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso This indicates that zzso 518 couples zzso sensing to zzso The zzso and zzso channels had a different affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Changes in zzso also modulated channel zzso
