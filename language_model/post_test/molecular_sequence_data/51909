A method for the zzso zzso of zzso DNA without the necessity for zzso selection is zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso by zzso to and zzso from zzso have zzso regions where zzso can zzso and serve as templates for a zzso DNA zzso synthesis of complementary zzso DNA zzso When this procedure was carried out such that the original zzso strand contained zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso of between zzso and zzso were zzso The technique has been used to generate zzso genes in plasmids of a wide variety of zzso The largest zzso manipulated and successfully zzso was 22 zzso The method is rapid and efficient and is not dependent upon either zzso zzso zzso or the presence of restriction sites in the vicinity of the sequence targeted for zzso
