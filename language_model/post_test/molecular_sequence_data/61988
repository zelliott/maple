The majority of bacterial zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso b zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso during zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso b zzso zzso that carries the zzso reduction zzso Using the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso as a model, the zzso protein was modified to examine zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes were produced in zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso were identified that are essential for growth with zzso as electron donor and for zzso reduction by zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso II enabled zzso zzso of the zzso complex by zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso separated from zzso by zzso zzso was shown to contain zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso both zzso b zzso The four zzso zzso predicted as zzso zzso b zzso were individually replaced by zzso in zzso zzso Replacement of either zzso zzso of the zzso b group zzso to zzso led to zzso preparations that contained only one zzso b zzso This remaining zzso b could be completely reduced by zzso supporting the view that the zzso reduction site is located near the zzso zzso b zzso The results indicate that both zzso b groups are involved in electron transport and that the architecture of the zzso reduction site near the zzso side of the membrane is similar to that proposed for zzso coli zzso
