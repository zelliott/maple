zzso are small, widely expressed zzso binding zzso thought to be key regulators of zzso dynamics in living zzso So far, three zzso have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso and the recently identified zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso organization of the genes zzso human and mouse zzso Both are single zzso genes and lie in close vicinity to the zzso zzso transport gene 2 zzso zzso which is highly expressed in zzso Northern zzso to rat zzso has previously demonstrated expression of an approximately zzso zzso long zzso zzso transcript in kidney and a zzso transcript of approximately 1 zzso in length in zzso Here we show that mouse zzso expression is restricted to zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso in kidney is the result of a zzso transcript which includes the zzso zzso open reading frame in its zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate by in zzso zzso that zzso zzso is localized to cells in the late stage of zzso
