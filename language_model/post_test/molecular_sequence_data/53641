The human zzso zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso regulated genes that are highly expressed in the nervous zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene lead to worms with abnormal zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso acid protein with zzso zzso to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso counterparts zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was isolated from a human zzso zzso It contains 15 zzso including an zzso defined by an zzso zzso expressed sequence tag, and spans at least zzso zzso zzso lacks sequences corresponding to the first six zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso to 1 and 2, VIII to zzso IX to zzso and X to 13 and zzso Using the zzso clone 1 zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso signal zzso to human zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences delineated the sequences sufficient to express a reporter gene in both zzso cells and zzso A consensus zzso binding site is located in a region of the downstream promoter that is nearly identical to its mouse zzso zzso shows that this zzso zzso site is necessary for full promoter activity in both zzso and zzso zzso
