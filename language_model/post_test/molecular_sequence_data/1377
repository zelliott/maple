Several zzso of zzso coli produce protein toxins closely related to zzso toxin zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso coli cause outbreaks of zzso colitis and zzso zzso syndrome in humans, with the latter being more likely if the zzso coli produce zzso than if they only produce zzso To investigate the differences among the zzso which are all zzso zzso the crystal structure of zzso from zzso coli zzso was determined at zzso resolution and compared with the known structure of zzso Our major finding was that, in contrast to zzso the active site of the zzso of zzso is accessible in the zzso and a zzso of zzso acid and a water zzso mimic the binding of the zzso base of the zzso Further, the zzso adopts a different orientation with respect to the zzso in zzso than in zzso due to interactions between the zzso zzso of the zzso and neighboring regions of the zzso Of the three types of zzso sites in the zzso one has a different zzso in zzso than in zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso binds at zzso Any of these structural differences might result in different mechanisms of action of the two toxins and the development of zzso zzso syndrome upon exposure to zzso
