There is considerable evidence that germ cells, mainly zzso and zzso contribute to the regulation of zzso cell zzso We developed an in zzso system to investigate the genes involved in zzso zzso cell interaction in the mouse by using the differential zzso display zzso One of the isolated zzso expressed zzso named zzso belongs to the family of zzso zzso proteins and shows a decreased expression in zzso zzso cell zzso compared to cultured zzso cells zzso zzso is expressed in all adult zzso zzso including zzso and zzso however, a high zzso level for zzso in mouse zzso is maintained until day 15 of zzso development and then declines dramatically, whereas the expression pattern in the zzso remains constantly zzso Furthermore, Northern zzso studies on zzso zzso from different mouse zzso with defects in zzso revealed that high levels of zzso transcripts can only be detected in zzso of mouse zzso with either no germ cells or primary zzso but only weak signals for zzso are observed in zzso of zzso containing zzso In addition, using both zzso analysis and zzso in zzso zzso on dissected zzso it was demonstrated that mouse zzso expression starts at zzso zzso in the prenatal male zzso and at zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene was localized on mouse zzso 5, region zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso expression could be zzso by factors originated from zzso zzso and/or zzso
