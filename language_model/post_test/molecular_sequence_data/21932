The zzso signal recognition particle zzso and its zzso zzso allow targeting of proteins into or across the plasma zzso The targeting process is zzso dependent and the two proteins constitute a distinct zzso zzso The zzso zzso is composed of A and zzso zzso where the zzso zzso domain plays a critical role in the targeting zzso In this study, we describe two X-ray structures determined independently of each other of the zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso zzso The two structures are markedly different in three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso making only one of the structures compatible with zzso zzso Interestingly, the two distinct zzso of the zzso segments of zzso are similar to the zzso and zzso forms of certain zzso The structure of the extended interface between the A and zzso zzso of zzso provides new insights into the role of the A domain for zzso zzso
