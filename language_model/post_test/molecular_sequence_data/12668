zzso factor zzso belongs to a family of zinc finger proteins involved in lineage zzso zzso is first expressed in zzso zzso zzso of the developing mouse and later in cardiac zzso gut zzso and zzso To delineate the role of this zzso factor in differentiation and early development, we studied zzso bodies derived from mouse embryonic stem zzso cells in which both copies of the zzso gene were zzso Light and electron zzso demonstrated that zzso bodies formed from zzso and zzso deficient zzso cells were covered with a layer of visceral zzso zzso zzso whereas no zzso zzso zzso was evident on the surface of the zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso selected zzso deficient cell lines displayed this distinctive zzso suggesting that it was not an artifact of zzso zzso zzso markers of visceral zzso formation, such as zzso zzso nuclear zzso and binding sites for zzso zzso zzso were absent from the zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso of other differentiation markers in the zzso zzso bodies, studies of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso cells have the capacity to differentiate along other zzso We conclude that, under in zzso conditions, disruption of the zzso gene results in a specific block in visceral zzso zzso These zzso deficient cells should yield insights into the regulation of zzso zzso zzso development and the factors expressed by visceral zzso that influence differentiation of adjoining zzso
