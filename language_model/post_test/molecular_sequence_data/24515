Transit peptides are zzso extensions that facilitate the targeting and zzso of zzso zzso precursors into zzso via a zzso zzso With the complete zzso zzso in hand, it is now evident that transit peptides direct more than zzso different proteins into the zzso during the life of a typical zzso Deciphering a common mechanism for how this multitude of targeting sequences function has been hampered by the realization that at a primary sequence level, transit peptides are highly divergent in zzso zzso and zzso This review addresses recent findings on several of the diverse functions that transit peptides must perform, including direct interaction with envelope zzso association with a zzso guidance complex, recognition by envelope zzso zzso into the zzso zzso interaction with molecular motors, and finally, zzso by the zzso processing zzso In addition to higher plants, transit peptides also direct the import of proteins into complex zzso derived from secondary zzso An emerging concept suggests that transit peptides contain multiple zzso that provide either distinct or possibly overlapping zzso Although still poorly zzso evolutionary processes could yield transit peptides with alternative domain zzso
