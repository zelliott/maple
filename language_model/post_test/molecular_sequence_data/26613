zzso viability might become compromised by the loss of genetic diversity and the zzso of zzso resulting from population decline and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a zzso example of a species at the verge of zzso and because of the well-documented and different demographic histories of the two remaining populations zzso and zzso it provides the opportunity to evaluate the performance of zzso methods commonly applied to recently declined zzso We used zzso sequences and 36 zzso markers to evaluate the current genetic status of the species and to assess the genetic signatures of its past zzso zzso diversity was extremely low with only two zzso alternatively fixed in each zzso Both remnant populations have low levels of genetic diversity at zzso zzso particularly the population from zzso and genetic differentiation between the two populations is zzso zzso zzso methods suggest an earlier decline starting hundreds of years ago, while zzso excess and zzso tests did not provide conclusive and consistent evidence for recent zzso Also, a model of gene flow received overwhelming support over a model of pure zzso zzso that are in conflict with the known recent demography of the species call for caution in the use of these methods, especially when no information on previous demographic history is zzso Overall, our results suggest that current genetic patterns in the zzso zzso are mainly the result of its recent decline and fragmentation and alerts on possible genetic risks for its zzso Conservation strategies should explicitly consider this threat and incorporate an integrated genetic management of wild, captive and zzso zzso including genetic restoration through zzso
