Previous zzso clone analysis of the zzso zzso monkey zzso have shown an unusual genetic structure in some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules from zzso zzso zzso monkeys were characterized here; ten putative zzso zzso were found, some of which zzso zzso proteins such as zzso and transcripts predicted to zzso a zzso zzso zzso which appear to be unique in the zzso zzso Furthermore, alternative zzso was found as a likely mechanism for producing zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from New World monkeys may be split into three new lineages according to domain by domain zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso family displayed a high divergence among zzso zzso individual zzso were limited in their genetic zzso zzso analysis showed that both constrained and rapid evolution may operate within the zzso zzso The frequent alternative zzso (as a likely mechanism generating zzso zzso the presence of zzso and zzso zzso molecules and other data reported here suggest that the zzso family in zzso has had a rapid evolution, independent from its zzso zzso
