The zzso zzso gene family is related to zzso a gene contributing to head development in zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso have already been isolated and zzso Here the zzso zzso expression and functions of the additional zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso This latter gene shows a greater degree of zzso to zzso than zzso and zzso zzso was initially expressed in zzso organizer and later in the anterior zzso zzso expression of zzso had similar effects to other zzso genes in zzso trunk and tail development, and especially similar effects to zzso in causing secondary cement zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso stimulates the formation of the anterior regions and zzso the formation of zzso structures similar to zzso
