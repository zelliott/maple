zzso is one of the envelope zzso of zzso including classical zzso fever virus zzso and bovine viral zzso virus zzso zzso is involved in several critical functions, including virus entry into target cells, induction of a protective immune response and zzso in zzso However, there is no information regarding any host binding partners for the zzso zzso Here, we zzso the zzso zzso system and identified zzso host proteins as positive binding partners which bound zzso from both zzso and zzso with the exception of two proteins that were found to be positive for binding only to zzso zzso zzso scanning of zzso zzso demonstrated that the binding sites for these cellular proteins on zzso are likely zzso binding zzso The possible roles of the identified host proteins are discussed as the results presented here will be important for future studies to zzso mechanisms of host zzso interactions during zzso zzso However, due to the limitations of the zzso two hybrid system, the proteins identified is not exhaustive and each interaction identified needs to be confirmed by independent experimental approaches in the context of zzso cells before any definitive conclusion can be drawn on relevance for the virus life zzso
