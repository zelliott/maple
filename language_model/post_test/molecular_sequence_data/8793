The present study demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso gene zzso in human fetal zzso zzso zzso fetal bone zzso zzso highly zzso sorted surface zzso zzso zzso zzso immature B zzso and s zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells derived from human fetal bone zzso Similar to observations in normal adult B cells, zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis in fetal zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso and zzso had enhancing effects, suggesting that the general mechanisms regulating zzso zzso zzso in adult B cells and zzso cells are zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso zzso synthesis in s zzso zzso zzso immature B cells, but the level of zzso induced by zzso was significantly less than that induced by zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso with both zzso and zzso in inducing zzso zzso zzso synthesis by fetal immature B zzso Interestingly, zzso failed to induce zzso zzso zzso synthesis in s zzso zzso cells even in the presence of zzso zzso These distinct effects of zzso and zzso suggest that functional zzso are expressed at a later stage of B cell zzso than zzso and that zzso in contrast to zzso does not regulate zzso cell zzso Given the fact that zzso production appears to be enhanced in zzso individuals, the capacity of zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso in human fetal immature B cells and zzso cells suggests that commitment of B cell precursors to zzso cells may occur during zzso life and may explain the increased zzso production in zzso with a family history of zzso
