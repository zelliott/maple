The zzso ends of five full-length zzso zzso repeats from the rabbit zzso zzso were mapped and their zzso sequences zzso zzso alignments showed that these five zzso repeats can be divided into zzso each of which has a characteristic sequence upstream of the first open reading frame zzso These five zzso range in size from zzso to zzso zzso with zzso ends located 76 to zzso zzso upstream of zzso Two of these zzso appear to have zzso from a common zzso at least 66 million years zzso Comparisons of the zzso ends of zzso from zzso human, zzso and rat show no common sequence zzso to zzso except for a zzso sequence that is found near the beginning of all characterized full-length zzso from rabbit and zzso A statistical analysis indicates that this zzso aligned block is highly zzso Part of this zzso sequence matches the zzso binding site in zzso gene zzso This strong conservation suggests that the zzso binding site may be part of a zzso regulatory element at the zzso ends of rabbit and human zzso zzso
