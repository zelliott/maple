The molecular diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of sunflower stem zzso was studied in 16 zzso of different geographic origin using nuclear and zzso zzso zzso products corresponding to the internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso gene were zzso The zzso and zzso sequences were compared with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso obtained from zzso The diversity in the region surrounding the zzso gene was also studied by restriction analysis using four zzso The analyses revealed a marked diversity within the zzso zzso which appear to belong to zzso unrelated zzso zzso all the zzso collected in France and in the former zzso where severe zzso of sunflower stem zzso are frequently reported, showed high similarity to each other forming a zzso which clearly differentiated from all other ones within the zzso zzso zzso all the zzso collected in Italy, where, despite zzso environmental conditions, the zzso of the disease is low, were only zzso related to the former group and showed sequence similarity with other previously established zzso zzso within the zzso zzso
