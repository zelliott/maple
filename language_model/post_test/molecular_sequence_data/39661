zzso that act by zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely used to control weeds in a variety of zzso The first weed to evolve resistance to zzso zzso was zzso zzso a problematic weed in the zzso United States that previously had evolved multiple zzso to zzso zzso two other target zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that resistance was a zzso dominant trait zzso by a single, nuclear zzso Three genes predicted to zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso One gene from the resistant zzso designated zzso contained a zzso deletion that was shown to zzso resistance by zzso of a zzso zzso strain of zzso coli grown in the presence and absence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is predicted to zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowing a zzso in a single gene to zzso resistance to two zzso target zzso zzso aspects of the resistance mechanism include an zzso acid zzso rather than a zzso and the zzso nature of the zzso which may explain why resistance to zzso zzso has been zzso
