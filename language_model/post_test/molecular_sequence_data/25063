zzso disruptions of the mouse genes for zzso zzso zzso or components of zzso signaling zzso convincingly revealed the important roles of these molecules in zzso zzso zzso are used at present as drugs to fight chronic microbial infections and cancer in humans, and they are being evaluated as immune response zzso to improve zzso Until recently, only a few avian zzso have been zzso and potential applications thus have remained limited to zzso Classic approaches to identify zzso genes in birds proved difficult because sequence conservation is generally zzso As new technology and high zzso sequencing became available, this situation changed zzso We review here recent work that led to the identification of genes for the avian zzso of zzso zzso and zzso various zzso zzso and several zzso From the initial data on the zzso properties of these zzso a picture is emerging that shows that avian and zzso zzso may perform similar tasks, although their primary structures in most cases are remarkably zzso
