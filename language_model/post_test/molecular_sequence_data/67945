zzso zzso is a zzso protein formed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso can zzso in the absence and presence of zzso To monitor structural zzso associated with binding of zzso to the zzso we analyzed the zzso and zzso structure by electron zzso resonance zzso Spin labeling of zzso acids located close to the zzso binding domain of the zzso revealed that the structure of the zzso binding domain is zzso in the absence of zzso zzso binding restricts the zzso dynamics of the zzso binding domain, resulting in the structurally more zzso zzso zzso
