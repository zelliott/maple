zzso zzso peptides zzso are widespread in nature, as they are zzso by zzso as well as by zzso organisms from both the vegetal and the animal zzso These naturally occurring zzso form a first line of host defense against pathogens and are involved in innate zzso Depending on their tissue distribution, zzso ensure either a systemic or a local protection of the zzso against environmental zzso They are classified into three major groups: zzso peptides with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and open-ended zzso peptides with pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides with an zzso of some zzso acids zzso rich, zzso rich, zzso Most zzso display zzso and zzso properties, have a molecular mass below zzso zzso and adopt an zzso structure zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso mixed zzso that is believed to be essential to their zzso zzso Interestingly, in recent years, a series of novel zzso have been discovered as processed forms of large zzso Despite the extreme diversity in their primary and secondary structures, all natural zzso have the in zzso zzso to affect a large number of zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso with identical or complementary activity zzso This review focuses on zzso forming zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso mixed structures from zzso and zzso zzso These molecules show some promise for therapeutic zzso
