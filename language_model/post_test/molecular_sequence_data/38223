zzso evidence is lacking to show whether the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is the signaling form of the zzso In this study, we tested whether zzso or zzso zzso when zzso with truncated receptors or zzso zzso zzso zzso could form functional zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding zzso domain of zzso or the zzso portion of zzso zzso the zzso segments and zzso zzso with zzso could not zzso functional zzso We next examined whether zzso which forms zzso and is structurally related to zzso could act as a surrogate zzso for zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso led to the expression of zzso zzso on cell surface zzso as determined by zzso analysis and flow zzso However, zzso zzso were not formed, and zzso zzso zzso were not functionally coupled to zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso cells or activated inwardly zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso of zzso and zzso led to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling events resulted only after the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Taken together with the truncated zzso studies, the data suggest that a high degree of structural specificity is required to form the functional zzso zzso that is a zzso zzso
