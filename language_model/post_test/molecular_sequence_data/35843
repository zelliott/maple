A technique is described for the isolation and zzso of intact, zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso and zzso as respiratory zzso indicating the presence of zzso zzso and an zzso zzso located on the outer surface of the inner zzso zzso display good respiratory control with an zzso ratio of zzso zzso Respiratory activity is zzso dependent upon the zzso poise of the zzso pool, suggesting the presence of an zzso respiratory zzso to molecular zzso zzso zzso using zzso raised against zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso from three different species, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and the plant zzso zzso respectively, has been used to investigate the presence and zzso of the zzso isolated by this zzso The zzso was carried out using cells containing zzso levels of zzso protein and cells zzso the zzso These results also demonstrate the capacity of zzso to import increased levels of protein in zzso In zzso import experiments using zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso can efficiently import this zzso and that protein zzso is dependent upon an zzso zzso and a membrane zzso
