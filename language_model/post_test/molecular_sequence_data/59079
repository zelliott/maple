We have recently characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso Here we have isolated its corresponding zzso and a zzso zzso gene from a zzso library of zzso zzso Both zzso genes are efficiently transcribed in zzso cell nuclear extract and yield mature zzso zzso zzso analysis of the upstream region of the zzso zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso revealed a cluster of three zzso genes which have the same polarity and comprise highly similar zzso zzso Of the three zzso zzso genes only one zzso zzso appears to code for a functional gene which exhibits an almost identical zzso sequence to zzso These are the first zzso nuclear zzso of plant zzso
