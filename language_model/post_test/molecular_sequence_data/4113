The zzso zzso b sequences zzso zzso were analyzed in 10 individuals from 8 different families of zzso in zzso The zzso sequences were zzso the used frequency of zzso was calculated and the molecular zzso tree constructed by zzso method using zzso zzso as zzso The confidence of zzso in the trees was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso These sequences were the middle part of zzso b zzso and in the obtained zzso zzso + zzso was about zzso and zzso + zzso only zzso The sequence data revealed considerable variation in 177 zzso sites (about zzso among the analyzed individuals from 8 different zzso From every zzso acid zzso zzso + zzso in the third site was higher zzso than the other two sites and lower than other insects in the corresponding zzso The NJ tree suggested that 11 individuals from the 8 families clustered in 4 groups, among which zzso and zzso zzso clustered and then together with zzso and zzso to form group zzso zzso II was made of three species from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed group III and zzso single as cluster IV, zzso The zzso relationships of the 8 families was: zzso and zzso and zzso which is little different from the zzso zzso
