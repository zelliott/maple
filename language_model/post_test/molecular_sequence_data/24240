A genetic basis for the zzso assembly of the zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was determined by structural analysis of zzso derived from zzso zzso We have previously shown that the parent strain zzso zzso a population of zzso molecules made up of a series of related zzso differing in the degree of zzso chain extension from the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso element, zzso The fully extended zzso zzso expresses the zzso structure, zzso A zzso strategy was employed to establish the structure of zzso from strains zzso in putative zzso genes compared to the parent zzso This involved zzso and linkage analysis on intact zzso samples and analysis of zzso zzso samples by zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were required for sequential addition of the zzso to the terminal zzso zzso to give the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to zzso zzso by zzso zzso with synthetic zzso zzso This is the first genetic blueprint determined for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identifying genes involved in the addition of each zzso zzso
