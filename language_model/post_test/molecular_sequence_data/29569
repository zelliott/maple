A protein zzso zzso zzso coding sequence was cloned from a zzso library derived from carrot zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in length and encodes for a protein of zzso zzso acids and molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso structure analysis of the deduced protein revealed two zzso active sites and an zzso zzso signal at its zzso which is also found in zzso in plants and zzso Although between the carrot protein and other plant zzso there is only about zzso identity, the active site regions are almost zzso The corresponding zzso was found in varying zzso in all zzso zzso A zzso protein expressed from the carrot zzso clone effectively zzso both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the protein coded for by the carrot gene is a novel member of the zzso family in zzso We therefore designated this novel carrot gene zzso The protein expressed by the zzso zzso sequence had a highly zzso stretch at its zzso region (no such domain exists in known plant zzso and was located far from known plant zzso on a maximum likelihood zzso The zzso zzso together with zzso genes identified in zzso and tomato, was suggested to belong to a novel zzso of zzso
