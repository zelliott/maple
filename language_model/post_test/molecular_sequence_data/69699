A method is described for defining zzso local dynamics in zzso by solid-state zzso To avoid zzso zzso introduced by large zzso ice zzso in low temperature hydrated samples, a zzso technique is used for sample zzso For a demonstration of this approach, the backbone zzso motions of the zzso A channel zzso are studied in hydrated zzso zzso The zzso zzso chemical shift zzso is characterized at 123 K for the zzso zzso The temperature dependence of this zzso yields a determination of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso sampled zzso This zzso represents the sum of zzso and zzso zzso motions, both of which have a significant zzso
