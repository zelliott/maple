A zzso protein zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso that has similarity to other zzso and to the zzso zzso proteins zzso of zzso plants and green zzso The putative transit sequence has characteristics that resemble a signal zzso The zzso zzso genes are part of a large zzso family which includes members zzso at least two significantly different zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences to the recently determined three-dimensional structure of the pea zzso II complex indicates that many of the key zzso acids thought to participate in the binding of zzso and the formation of zzso zzso interactions are well zzso zzso analyses of sequences of zzso proteins shows that the zzso of several zzso zzso form a natural group separate from the zzso zzso proteins zzso of the zzso Although the zzso and zzso genes shared a common zzso these lineages zzso from each other prior to the separation of the zzso zzso I and zzso II sequences in the green algae and zzso zzso
