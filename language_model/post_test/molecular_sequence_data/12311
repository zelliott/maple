The origin recognition complex zzso a zzso protein identified in zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and is required for the initiation of cellular DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins related to the two largest zzso of zzso were cloned from various zzso The zzso zzso proteins related to zzso zzso zzso were cloned from the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso These proteins show similarity to regulators of the S and M zzso of the cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso from zzso zzso reveals that it is essential for cell zzso The zzso zzso proteins related to zzso zzso zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso The human zzso proteins interact in zzso to form a zzso These studies studies suggest that zzso zzso are zzso and that the role of zzso is a general feature of zzso DNA zzso
