zzso zzso responsible for zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso and zzso The aim was to evaluate zzso zzso that occur at three locations on the zzso surface of zzso zzso near the zzso border of zzso A, the zzso zzso to zzso in the first zzso loop, and zzso at the zzso border of zzso zzso It was hypothesized that zzso acid changes at these sites would result in zzso zzso with normal spectral properties but defects in their ability to interact with the rod outer segment G zzso zzso A set of 12 zzso zzso genes was zzso Four of the zzso were known to cause zzso zzso replaced by zzso a zzso acid deletion zzso zzso replaced by zzso and zzso replaced by zzso Eight additional zzso were prepared to provide complementary zzso zzso The zzso acid deletion zzso failed to bind zzso However, each of the zzso and zzso zzso bound zzso to form a zzso with a visible zzso maximum zzso zzso of 500 zzso Upon zzso each zzso was converted to a zzso zzso spectral form zzso max zzso 380 zzso However, each of these zzso normal zzso zzso was defective in zzso zzso zzso exchange by zzso These results identify a zzso in the signal zzso zzso in zzso normal zzso zzso that cause zzso
