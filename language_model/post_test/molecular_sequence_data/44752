During infection with zzso virus zzso the envelope proteins are highly zzso and zzso E zzso is one of the most abundant and zzso We have previously identified the zzso regions of zzso and mapped the zzso zzso In this study, we have evaluated the zzso of zzso hybrid zzso particles zzso carrying zzso acids zzso or zzso of zzso which contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso in zzso from mice and guinea pigs zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso The dominant zzso zzso mapped by zzso analysis of the zzso were found in peptides spanning zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso also showed zzso activity against zzso in zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso were mapped to both zzso sequences zzso zzso recognizing zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso recognizing zzso acids zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso were detected in four different mouse strains zzso with either zzso or zzso in zzso All mouse strains zzso with zzso recognized zzso in zzso acids zzso and zzso and all those zzso with zzso recognized zzso in zzso acids zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso carrying these zzso sequences can prime potent zzso and cellular zzso responses in small animals and warrant further investigation as potential vaccine candidates against zzso zzso
