Although zzso zzso have been widely used to inhibit gene zzso their mechanism of entry into cells and their site of action are still in some zzso In this report, we describe a novel technique for zzso analyzing zzso association with living cells as well as zzso zzso The technique zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso groups were zzso to this zzso added to zzso cells in culture, and zzso to associated zzso which were analyzed zzso We find that several proteins are labeled, predominantly a 75 zzso one that appears to be zzso Our results suggest that the majority of zzso zzso is associated in zzso with the same protein to which it bound on the cell surface, but only a small percentage of zzso zzso zzso can be zzso Additionally, zzso are readily accumulated by zzso and by treating whole zzso a unique set of nuclear binding proteins is zzso
