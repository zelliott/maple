The zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso displays a zzso lethal zzso termed zzso zzso Six zzso catastrophe zzso zzso genes were identified in a genetic screen designed to identify regulators of zzso zzso in zzso suppress the zzso zzso zzso growth zzso Here, the cloning of zzso is zzso The zzso gene product displays significant sequence zzso to members of the zzso system response regulator protein zzso zzso carrying the zzso and zzso zzso display a synthetic zzso lethal zzso along with an inability to grow on minimal synthetic zzso These zzso are suppressed by a zzso in zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was identified as a dosage zzso in this zzso These findings link the zzso signal zzso system to stress response and cell cycle control in zzso zzso
