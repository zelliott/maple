The Root effect is a widespread property among fish zzso whose structural basis remains largely zzso Here we report a zzso and zzso characterization of the zzso zzso isolated from the Antarctic fish zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The crystal structure unveils that the T state of this zzso is stabilized by a strong zzso between the side chains of zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso This unexpected finding undermines the accepted paradigm that zzso the presence of this unusual zzso with the occurrence of the Root zzso Surprisingly, the T state is characterized by an zzso flexibility of two zzso chains within the zzso Indeed, regions such as the zzso corner and the zzso pocket, which are normally well ordered in the T state of zzso zzso display high zzso and zzso electron zzso This flexibility also leads to unusual distances between the zzso iron and the zzso and zzso His zzso These observations are in line with zzso zzso studies carried out both in solution and in the crystal zzso The findings here presented suggest that in fish zzso the Root effect may be switched off through a significant zzso of the T state regardless of the presence of the zzso zzso Similar mechanisms may also operate for other zzso effect zzso The implications of the flexibility of the zzso corner for the mechanism of the zzso transition in zzso zzso are also zzso
