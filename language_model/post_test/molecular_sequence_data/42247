zzso designed zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the human T cell zzso virus type I zzso zzso gene were zzso using an automated DNA zzso Previously known zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were used as positive controls and zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as negative zzso zzso blood zzso cells from 17 patients with zzso zzso and 10 healthy individuals without zzso zzso were studied by zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso and zzso All DNA samples from zzso cell lines and 17 patients with zzso zzso showed positive signals of the zzso zzso zzso None of the DNA samples from zzso cell lines or 10 healthy individuals showed positive zzso When serially diluted DNA of zzso cells were amplified by 35 cycles of zzso the detection limit of the zzso gene by using the primer pairs was DNA from about zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso capacity of primer pairs, zzso and zzso were confirmed to be enough to use for the diagnosis of zzso zzso
