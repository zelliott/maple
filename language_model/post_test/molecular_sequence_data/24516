Secondary zzso describes the origin of zzso in several major zzso groups such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso An integral part of secondary zzso has been the transfer of genes for zzso proteins from the zzso to the host zzso zzso of the zzso proteins back to the zzso from their new site of synthesis in the host involves targeting across the multiple zzso surrounding these complex zzso Although this process shows many overall similarities in the different zzso groups, it is emerging that differences exist in the mechanisms zzso
