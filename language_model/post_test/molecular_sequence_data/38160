Brain zzso carrier zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso carrier, has been shown to be expressed predominantly in the brain of the mice and zzso We cloned rat zzso zzso and investigated its zzso level during zzso development and under various zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso revealed that rat zzso protein was composed of zzso zzso acid zzso and was 99 and zzso identical to the mouse and human proteins and 29, 33 and zzso identical to rat zzso protein zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso The molecular weight was predicted to be zzso Da and the protein of this size was zzso when the zzso was expressed in zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, the corresponding zzso approximately zzso in size, was found expressed predominantly in the zzso zzso and zzso A unique zzso pattern was identified in the brain, where zzso expression was low in their fetal life, but significantly elevated in the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was maintained to be gradually zzso In zzso zzso or zzso zzso rats, zzso zzso expression in the zzso slightly, but significantly, decreased compared with that in their appropriate zzso The present results indicate that zzso may be involved in zzso of zzso dysfunction in zzso induced by aging or neurodegenerative disorders, and perhaps in energy balance in the zzso
