zzso family sequences are middle repetitive short zzso elements zzso dispersed throughout zzso zzso that can zzso gene zzso The human zzso zzso locus contains 44 complete and four partial zzso zzso An zzso zzso repeat lies in close proximity to the zzso and zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso repeat in reporter zzso containing zzso zzso sequences increased reporter activity in zzso zzso zzso cells, suggesting this region contained a zzso zzso Analysis of multiple deletion fragments from the zzso region of the zzso gene revealed a strong zzso and zzso zzso activity mapping between zzso zzso and zzso encompassing the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that the zzso was a complex element zzso four discrete entities, including a core zzso domain zzso an zzso domain zzso that contains elements zzso the zzso zzso activity, and two zzso zzso the zzso that zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso The upstream zzso domain is also required for zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA fragments representing all of the zzso zzso yielded a complex pattern of zzso interactions indicating that numerous zzso cell nuclear proteins bind specifically to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso is zzso promoter dependent and, in turn, its presence decreases the rate of zzso zzso zzso resulting in a significant decrease of zzso zzso II recruitment to the zzso The zzso may provide for complex regulatory control of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
