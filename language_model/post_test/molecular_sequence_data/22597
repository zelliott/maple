Contributions of the alternative zzso factor zzso to zzso zzso infection were investigated using strains bearing zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso or in selected zzso or zzso promoter zzso The zzso strain, which has a deletion in the zzso zzso promoter, and the zzso strain had significantly reduced invasion efficiencies relative to that of the zzso strain in the zzso human zzso zzso cell line, while the invasion efficiency of a strain bearing a deletion in the partially zzso dependent zzso promoter region did not differ from that of the wild zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso strains was attenuated in zzso zzso guinea zzso with the zzso strain showing greater zzso while the zzso capacity of the zzso strain was similar to that of the zzso strain, suggesting that zzso of zzso due to the zzso zzso does not result from loss of zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso of zzso is important for cell invasion and gastrointestinal infection and suggest that zzso genes in addition to zzso appear to contribute to gastrointestinal zzso Interestingly, the zzso of the zzso strain was not attenuated in zzso infected guinea zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in invasion of human host cells, zzso zzso contributions to invasion are, in part, due to direct effects on zzso zzso but not on zzso transcription, and zzso zzso plays a critical role during the gastrointestinal stage of zzso in the guinea pig but is not important for systemic spread of the zzso
