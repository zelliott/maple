zzso receptors require both zzso and the zzso zzso for efficient channel zzso The zzso binding site of these zzso zzso proteins is formed by regions of the zzso zzso zzso that display sequence similarity to bacterial zzso acid binding zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso binding site is located on the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso domain and the loop region between membrane segments zzso and zzso significantly reduced the efficacy of zzso but not zzso in channel zzso Some of the zzso also decreased zzso by the zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso zzso molecular modeling of the zzso and zzso binding zzso indicates that the zzso and zzso zzso use similar zzso to zzso the zzso zzso acid groups, whereas differences in side chain interactions and size of aromatic zzso determine zzso zzso
