Plant zzso contain a circular zzso of approximately 150 zzso organized into approximately 35 zzso zzso The zzso zzso is organized into zzso and attached to zzso zzso This relatively small zzso is transcribed by at least two different zzso zzso one being of the zzso type and zzso zzso the other one being of the zzso and zzso zzso The presumed zzso of a second zzso zzso zzso in zzso is still zzso There is strong evidence for a sequential action of zzso and zzso zzso during plant development zzso a prevailing role of zzso during early plant and zzso development, although zzso is present in mature zzso In the present paper, we have zzso two different zzso zzso from spinach with respect to zzso and zzso zzso in mature zzso with the help of specific zzso zzso show the presence of the two different zzso zzso in mature zzso Both zzso are entirely membrane bound but, unlike previously thought, this membrane binding is not zzso via zzso This finding indicates that zzso zzso are not found as zzso zzso complexes on the template DNA in mature zzso and raises the question of their function in mature zzso
