We describe a novel approach to characterize the functional zzso of a protein in zzso This involves the use of a zzso zzso zzso that causes the expression of a target gene as two zzso zzso When used as a genetic screen to dissect the budding zzso zzso zzso this showed that zzso protein could be dissected into three distinct pairs of functional zzso Thus, four functional zzso can be defined in the zzso zzso zzso with boundaries in the regions of zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso The central region of the protein was resistant to dissection by this approach, suggesting that it represents one large functional zzso The dissected zzso allowed investigation of factors that associate strongly with the zzso or the zzso zzso protein zzso Thus, the zzso zzso protein zzso associates with zzso in the region zzso whereas zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso its association with zzso
