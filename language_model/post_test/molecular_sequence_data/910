Long zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso cardiac disease zzso by prolonged zzso zzso and sudden cardiac zzso zzso is caused by zzso in genes coding for zzso channels involved in the action zzso zzso codes for a novel zzso of the zzso channel conducting the delayed zzso zzso current zzso As zzso is expressed in the human heart and suppresses the zzso current in zzso systems, it is a candidate gene that may be zzso in zzso families where no zzso zzso in known zzso associated genes have been zzso We examined whether this was the zzso 

zzso DNA from zzso patients zzso and normal controls zzso was screened for zzso in zzso by zzso single strand zzso zzso analysis zzso and DNA sequencing of zzso zzso zzso in other zzso associated zzso channels were excluded by zzso 

No zzso were found in the coding region of the zzso gene in zzso zzso One zzso a zzso transition at zzso 97, causing an zzso acid zzso zzso was present in 16 zzso nine zzso and seven zzso The zzso frequency was zzso in zzso patients and zzso in zzso
