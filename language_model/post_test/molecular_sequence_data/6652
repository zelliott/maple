zzso salt stress of the ice plant zzso zzso initially results in zzso but full zzso is restored within approximately 2 zzso We are interested in a zzso explanation for this behavior and, as a requisite for in-depth zzso studies, have begun to analyze gene expression changes in roots zzso with the onset of zzso zzso that suggested changes in zzso amount under stress were zzso their deduced zzso acid sequences share zzso with proteins of the zzso zzso intrinsic zzso gene family and potentially zzso zzso One transcript, zzso was found only in root zzso whereas two other zzso zzso and zzso were detected in roots and zzso zzso levels of zzso were of low zzso All transcripts declined initially during salt stress but later recovered to at least zzso zzso The most drastic decline was in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution in roots detected by in zzso zzso indicated that the transcript was present in all cells in the root zzso In the expansion zone of the root where vascular zzso zzso zzso transcript amounts were most abundant in the zzso In older roots, which had undergone secondary growth, zzso was highly expressed in cell layers surrounding individual zzso zzso zzso was also localized in leaf vascular tissue and, in lower zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso seemed to be present exclusively in the tip of the zzso in a zone before and possibly zzso with the development of a vascular zzso zzso and zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso led to increased water zzso zzso fluctuations of the most highly expressed zzso and zzso coincided with zzso changes in leaves under zzso As the leaves regained zzso transcript levels of these water channel proteins zzso
