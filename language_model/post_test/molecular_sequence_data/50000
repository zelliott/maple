zzso zzso is a zzso zzso infecting zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso producing zzso gum and causing black rot in zzso A zzso resistant to zzso zzso was isolated by zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the gene responsible for the zzso is zzso zzso an inner membrane protein previously shown to be required for iron zzso and zzso This gene is clustered with three other zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA and protein sequence zzso zzso sensitivity tests, zzso tests, zzso tests, and zzso zzso zzso together with the cellular location of the proteins indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are essential for penetration of zzso zzso zzso The zzso organization, structural features of the zzso region, and zzso analyses including Northern zzso reporter zzso and primer extension together indicate that the four genes are organized into an zzso
