The zzso protein complexes play important roles in zzso zzso The function of the zzso complex remains zzso though it is involved in resolution of different DNA structures by zzso We have now identified and characterized the four zzso components of the human complex and in particular demonstrated that the zzso protein is part of this zzso zzso proteins play important but as yet undefined roles in zzso zzso and brain zzso We show that, with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso depletion of any of the components results in degradation of all the other zzso zzso also zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso Several of the components are modified by zzso and zzso
