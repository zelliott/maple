Previous studies established the critical roles of zzso and zzso zzso in positive regulation of zzso zzso zzso and transport genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to complement the zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso differences in zzso zzso requirements for zzso of zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein retained strong zzso dependence when produced from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partially suppressed the zzso requirement for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso produced by zzso domain swapping and zzso zzso zzso zzso determined that the zzso difference in zzso zzso dependence was due to a single zzso acid difference within the proposed zzso and zzso domain of zzso zzso predictions guided the design of a zzso zzso protein with a single zzso acid substitution at this critical position, zzso that was fully zzso not only when produced from zzso plasmids but also at a zzso gene zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso 103 affects a critical zzso of zzso zzso dependence of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso zzso
