The zzso zzso has been reported to specifically repress the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso This led to the hypothesis that zzso zzso of plant origin, may act as signal zzso preventing the expression of zzso genes if zzso zzso is living in its natural habitat zzso In three other laboratory strains zzso zzso and zzso however, the effect of zzso was not unique, and all zzso carbohydrates zzso zzso This suggested that the zzso of zzso genes by zzso is not a specific phenomenon but, rather, an aspect of a global regulatory mechanism of zzso repression zzso We assessed the effect of carbohydrates on zzso gene expression in a panel of zzso zzso of zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso C gene zzso as a zzso zzso of any zzso sugar caused zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso However, an zzso zzso was identified in which, as in zzso zzso zzso was only zzso by zzso Thus, the regulation of zzso zzso zzso genes by zzso appears to be zzso by two separate mechanisms, one presumably involving a zzso zzso and another specifically responding to zzso We have identified in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso family zzso a zzso zzso II zzso component of the zzso zzso system zzso and a putative zzso zzso zzso Southern blots showed that this locus is absent from other zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced by zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by replacing part of zzso with an zzso abolished the repression by zzso and zzso but not that by zzso Our data indicate that the zzso locus encodes a zzso sensor that mediates zzso gene repression upon detection of zzso and zzso zzso is the first sensory system found in zzso zzso that is involved in environmental regulation of zzso zzso
