zzso zzso which is composed of a binding zzso B, and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the zzso responsible for the zzso food poisoning syndrome caused by strains of zzso zzso To further characterize the zzso we sought to clone and sequence the genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso library was screened with zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso proteins to identify zzso clones containing the zzso Five clones reacted with the zzso to zzso but none reacted with the zzso to zzso Southern zzso analysis with zzso zzso designed from the zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso and zzso sequence analysis, revealed that the zzso zzso from one of the clones contained two zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two genes are arranged in tandem and are separated by only 37 zzso The gene which encodes the B component of zzso zzso zzso is located immediately downstream from the gene zzso the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso transcript which zzso with DNA fragments internal to, or including a portion of, the coding sequences of the B, zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the clustered genes which zzso the components of zzso zzso are zzso and constitute an zzso
