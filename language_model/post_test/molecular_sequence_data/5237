We previously zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene which encodes the human zzso of the zzso of the zzso protein complex, involved in zzso protein zzso Within the 3' untranslated region at zzso zzso was observed an zzso repeat containing zzso A and B block zzso and showing high zzso to the human zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso of the zzso repeat were noted a zzso box, a zzso motif and two zzso zzso factor zzso binding sites, which represent putative regulatory elements directing zzso zzso In addition, the 25 and 35 zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso and its bovine zzso were identical to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a gastrointestinal hormone that stimulates zzso pancreatic zzso This zzso is related to zzso zzso and zzso N which are zzso peptides derived from larger precursors via zzso zzso by zzso E at processing sites determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Given the conformity of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and of its zzso zzso zzso zzso it is proposed that these peptides are generated by a similar mechanism of zzso modification involving a parent precursor represented by the zzso of zzso
