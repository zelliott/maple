zzso zzso is an excellent model to observe cell movements and shape changes during the zzso of the zzso zzso into an zzso zzso zzso Although much is known about the structural zzso involved in zzso zzso relatively little is known about the zzso and zzso regulatory networks zzso Here, we describe the identification and functional characterization of the novel nuclear protein zzso which belongs to a zzso protein family found in all zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso closure and zzso of the zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is required for the formation of proper cell contacts between zzso pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso rescue experiments reveal a function of zzso in zzso zzso that control the zzso of the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we provide evidence suggesting a role of zzso in zzso gene zzso We thus propose that zzso regulates the expression of multiple zzso guidance cues in zzso zzso that direct the migration of the zzso zzso zzso Members of the zzso family may perform similar functions during zzso in other zzso
