zzso and zzso are believed to have a common zzso The zzso structure has probably evolved from zzso peptides at a stage later than the zzso To trace the evolution of zzso and zzso we have determined their structures in an Australian zzso the Eastern Grey zzso The brain zzso was identical to zzso of most zzso The larger form of zzso zzso was a zzso with the sequence zzso The 11 zzso zzso indicate differences from human zzso zzso and zzso comprised about zzso of the total zzso and resulted from zzso after the second and third zzso respectively, of the unusual zzso zzso zzso The smaller forms of zzso zzso differ from most other zzso zzso in that the zzso are not blocked with a zzso zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso is more than zzso zzso The present study indicates that the zzso structure, as defined by having a zzso at position 6 from the zzso evolved before the zzso zzso from the other zzso 130 million years zzso
