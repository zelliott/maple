The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso activates zzso by binding a DNA operator just upstream of the promoter and interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain 4 zzso We determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex at zzso A zzso There are no zzso changes in either zzso which interact through an extremely small interface involving at most 6 zzso acid zzso The interactions of the two proteins stabilize the binding of each protein to the zzso The results provide insight into how zzso can operate through a simple cooperative binding mechanism but affect different steps of the zzso initiation zzso
