zzso of zzso is intimately associated with zzso zzso This protein appears to be zzso by a zzso zzso Thus, differential expression of different members of this family may contribute to the complexity of the zzso resistance zzso Three zzso zzso clones isolated from a zzso zzso library represent different members of the zzso zzso gene zzso Using a highly zzso zzso probe, we found that the zzso zzso gene family consists of three zzso We also found that the zzso gene family consists of three genes in mice but has only two genes in humans and zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes have similar zzso organizations within the 3' region zzso the zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso gene family arose from gene zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes appear to be more closely related to each other than either gene is to the zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso and zzso genes arose from a recent gene zzso event and that primates did not undergo this zzso and therefore contain only two zzso zzso
