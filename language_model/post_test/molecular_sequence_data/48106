By using zzso zzso based on the sequence zzso between known zzso zzso three zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso families, as defined in zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences for two of these genes zzso and zzso were also isolated and determined, whereas the zzso sequence of zzso was obtained through the zzso sequencing project, as was the sequence of a second, distinct zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso here) and the previously described zzso Columbia zzso revealed several zzso including the presence of a small, zzso element in the 3' zzso region of the former zzso zzso is the first zzso to show such divergence of two zzso zzso the divergence is strongly supported by sequence data and zzso zzso Southern analysis revealed that the three genes we have isolated exist as single copies, and genetic mapping indicated that zzso and zzso both reside on zzso zzso Finally, expression of these three genes could only be observed in suspensions of zzso zzso zzso Such a cell suspension divides actively after zzso and the zzso genes are most strongly expressed at this zzso
