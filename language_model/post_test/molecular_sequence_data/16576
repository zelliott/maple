In plants, the last step in the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso of folate remains to be zzso In zzso coli, this step is zzso by the zzso zzso a zzso that converts zzso zzso reaction product of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso So far, the only known plant zzso involved in zzso synthesis is zzso zzso which has fused zzso zzso to zzso coli zzso and zzso and is located in zzso zzso zzso has no zzso activity, zzso that plants have a separate zzso zzso No such zzso is known in any zzso zzso and zzso approaches identified zzso and tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso with putative zzso zzso These zzso were shown to zzso functional zzso by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso and by demonstrating that the partially zzso zzso proteins convert zzso to zzso Plant zzso zzso is active as zzso and is not feedback inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso its zzso zzso or zzso The full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into isolated pea zzso and, when fused to green fluorescent zzso directed the passenger protein to zzso zzso in transient expression zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso like zzso zzso is present in zzso As shown previously for the zzso zzso transcript, the level of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of tomato fruit falls sharply as zzso advances, suggesting that the expression of these two zzso is zzso
