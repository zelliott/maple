zzso zzso zzso contraction of zzso were investigated in the human zzso zzso and zzso (10 zzso to zzso zzso caused zzso contraction of zzso zzso zzso was approximately ten times more potent than zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, two zzso zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (up to zzso zzso did not induce contraction of human zzso The zzso ETA zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso competitively antagonized the zzso contraction, with a zzso value of zzso whereas another zzso ETA zzso blocking drug, zzso 123 zzso behaved as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso strips with an zzso zzso zzso selective zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso induced by zzso All these data indicate that only zzso ETA receptors mediate zzso zzso of human zzso
