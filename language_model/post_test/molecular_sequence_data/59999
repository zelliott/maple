zzso of the zzso mechanisms between proteins and zzso acids is generalized to informational symmetry breaking between a genetic zzso and an zzso zzso so as not to depend on particular chemical zzso In a genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso any sequence can form a closed zzso structure with a specific partner zzso On the other hand, in an zzso zzso zzso zzso a chain could fold to an open zzso structure and reinterpretation of the genetic information through slides or shifts between stacked strands could be induced by external zzso The possibility of the informational symmetry breaking by zzso organization of a single chemical species, zzso zzso as a genetic zzso and zzso acids as an zzso zzso is zzso The informational functions of genetic zzso and zzso zzso in a complex mixture of zzso are zzso
