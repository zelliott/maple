This study was aimed to investigate the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in patients with zzso zzso The gene expressions of zzso in zzso cells of bone zzso from 7 cases of zzso anemia and 12 normal controls were detected by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The expressions of zzso in bone zzso from 20 cases of zzso anemia and 20 normal controls were also determined by zzso zzso The results showed that expression of zzso zzso was found in 2 out of 7 zzso bone zzso of patients and in 10 out of 12 zzso bone zzso of normal zzso The zzso zzso in patients with zzso anemia was significantly lower than that in normal controls zzso zzso zzso No patients with zzso anemia showed zzso zzso of zzso in bone zzso while 5 out of 20 zzso normal controls exhibited zzso positive zzso Bone zzso of zzso anemia patients contained less zzso than that of normal persons zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, when compared with normal controls, zzso expression decreased significantly in patients with zzso anemia at gene zzso level and protein translation level, it may be related to the zzso of zzso and thus zzso in bone zzso of patients with zzso zzso
