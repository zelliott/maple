The zzso rust resistance gene from zzso was cloned after tagging with the zzso zzso element zzso The gene is predicted to zzso two products of zzso and zzso zzso acids that result from alternatively spliced zzso The longer product is similar to the products of two other plant disease resistance zzso the tobacco mosaic virus resistance gene N of tobacco and the bacterial resistance gene zzso of zzso The similarity involves the presence of a zzso zzso binding site and several other zzso acid motifs of unknown function in the zzso half of the zzso and a zzso region in the zzso zzso The truncated product of zzso which lacks most of the zzso zzso region, is similar to the truncated product that is predicted from an alternative transcript of the N zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso which control resistance to three widely different pathogen types, are the foundation of a class of plant disease resistance genes that can be referred to as zzso binding zzso repeat resistance zzso
