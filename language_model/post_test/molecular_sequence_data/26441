A procedure is described for the large-scale zzso of synthetic zzso using a polystyrene zzso Hamilton zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso column with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are obtained with a three-step procedure that involves only one column zzso zzso The zzso group is left on the zzso for the zzso zzso The use of the zzso polystyrene column with a zzso zzso system provides excellent separation of the desired zzso zzso from failure zzso The zzso group is removed by treatment with zzso acid and the zzso is zzso on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso obtained are shown to be essentially pure by zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso This procedure is especially useful for the large-scale zzso of zzso required for zzso zzso The zzso column and the zzso zzso system is useful for zzso modified zzso containing zzso groups such as the zzso zzso
