We have performed molecular dynamics simulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with explicit water molecules zzso The simulation was carried out in periodic boundary conditions and conducted for zzso 2 zzso in order to determine the concerted protein dynamics and to examine how well the essential motions are preserved along the zzso zzso motions are extracted by means of the essential dynamics analysis method for different lengths of the zzso zzso described by zzso 1 zzso after approximately 200 zzso and only small changes are observed with increasing simulation zzso zzso dynamics along zzso with larger zzso however, change with simulation time and generally, with increasing zzso index, longer simulation times are required for observing similar protein motions (along a particular zzso Several regions in the protein show relatively large fluctuations and in particular motions in the active site lid and the segments zzso and the active site hinge region zzso are seen along several zzso These motions are generally associated with zzso zzso while no direct correlations are observed between these fluctuations and the positioning of zzso in the protein zzso The partial zzso of the lid is an example of induced fit mechanisms seen in other zzso and could be a general mechanism for the zzso of zzso
