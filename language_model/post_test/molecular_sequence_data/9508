To zzso the origin and genetic structure of the zzso duck in zzso and North America, we zzso 114 duck zzso sequences and retrieved 489 zzso sequences from zzso In total, zzso ducks including 50 duck zzso from eight countries zzso France, Russia, India, Kazakhstan, zzso Thailand and zzso were used in this zzso One hundred and zzso zzso and 81 variable sites were zzso zzso was the zzso zzso which was considered to be the same dominant zzso found in the previous studies, and was found in 309 zzso The smallest values for both genetic differentiation index zzso zzso and the number of the net zzso zzso between two populations zzso zzso were observed between zzso domestic ducks and zzso zzso No geography, breed or population clusters were observed in the zzso domestic ducks and zzso Five zzso were shared by USA zzso and zzso domestic zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso was shared by zzso domestic ducks and China zzso zzso By combining zzso zzso zzso network profile, genetic distances and shared zzso we can draw two major zzso zzso zzso and North American zzso show a clear geographic distribution zzso zzso zzso domestic ducks are derived from the zzso zzso not from the zzso zzso
