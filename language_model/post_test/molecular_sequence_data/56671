A zzso zzso construct of the zzso zzso zzso has been made and expressed in zzso coli as bacterial inclusion zzso After zzso in 6 M zzso zzso and formation of mixed zzso with zzso the protein was zzso by diluting out the zzso and allowing zzso zzso bridges to form by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein was obtained from 1 liter of bacterial culture, an appreciable fraction of which was zzso in zzso zzso This protein bound to three zzso zzso specific for zzso or zzso zzso on the native zzso variable region but did not bind several other zzso zzso zzso that lacked such zzso These experiments show that zzso variable regions, like the V regions of zzso can form a zzso zzso zzso zzso and provide large amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that can be used to study zzso zzso
