zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that regulates zzso zzso and is the only known zzso zzso that is also a zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso domain within its zzso regulatory region, and zzso has been shown to zzso the zzso zzso protein 1) zzso factor protein zzso but the mechanism by which zzso interacts with zzso to induce zzso has not been zzso zzso to the zzso domain is a zzso zzso and zzso domain of zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain, but not the zzso domain, directly associates with the zzso zzso domain, and that the zzso domain is required for zzso zzso zzso We further show that this zzso zzso interaction is specific, as zzso zzso from other proteins failed to bind zzso We reveal that, although the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso the zzso zzso domain does not bind zzso Finally, we identify the sequence unique to zzso proteins required for specific interaction with the zzso zzso zzso Therefore we propose that the zzso zzso domain represents a novel zzso domain necessary for direct interaction between zzso and zzso that promotes zzso zzso zzso
