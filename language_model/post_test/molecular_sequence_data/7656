A detailed study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene from the eastern part of the Czech Republic zzso is zzso A total of 190 zzso zzso from 95 zzso zzso families were analyzed for 21 prevalent Caucasian zzso and restriction zzso length zzso number of tandem repeats zzso zzso Eighty per cent of all zzso zzso were found to carry 11 zzso The most common molecular zzso was the zzso zzso zzso with a very high degree of zzso zzso Each of four other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accounted for more than zzso of zzso zzso Rarely present were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that have been predominantly described in southern Europe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso A total of 14 different zzso zzso were zzso Three unusual zzso associations were identified zzso on zzso zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso zzso There was a strong association between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The molecular basis of zzso in the zzso area appears to be relatively homogeneous in comparison with other southern and western European zzso thus providing a good starting point for prenatal diagnosis and early clinical zzso
