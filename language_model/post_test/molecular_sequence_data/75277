A survey of zzso in Northern zzso allowed the identification of two subjects zzso for a new type of G gamma zzso persistence of fetal zzso zzso The G zzso gene from the zzso zzso shows the presence of a zzso substitution 175 zzso upstream of the zzso site, adding a new example of zzso zzso occurring in the promoter region of the zzso genes and linked to zzso zzso In this case the zzso affects the 3' end zzso of a zzso zzso sequence known to be present in other regulatory elements of several zzso
