We have isolated zzso clones from a mouse embryonic head zzso library that zzso one member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the 10 zzso two showed full-length type zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two of them were modified just after the zzso domain and stop zzso appeared before completing the zzso zzso This truncated form also had a deletion of five zzso acids at the zzso domain, indicating that it is a novel zzso of zzso zzso protection zzso showed that this truncated deleted type, named zzso is present in the head of zzso although the amount is less compared to that of the full-length type having a deletion of four zzso zzso Considering the source and expression of zzso zzso they may have an important role, accompanied with a possible regulatory role of the truncated zzso during neural development and/or in zzso
