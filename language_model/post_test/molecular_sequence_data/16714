The authors investigated whether the presence of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and surrounding tissue might help to predict patient zzso 

zzso samples from 101 patients with zzso zzso cell zzso were stained with zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso zzso but not in normal zzso In contrast, zzso was detected mainly in normal zzso tissue adjacent to zzso zzso but it was detected also in zzso zzso in some zzso zzso findings demonstrated that the intensity of zzso zzso in normal tissue was associated positively with the depth of tumor zzso and the stage of disease, whereas zzso zzso in zzso tissue was associated positively with vascular and zzso vessel invasion as well as with immature differentiation of cancer zzso Using a zzso hazard model, including information on zzso zzso patterns within zzso zzso along with clinical cancer staging, improved the accuracy of predicting patient zzso 

These results suggested that measurement of zzso and zzso expression with simple zzso zzso may enhance further the understanding of the zzso of invading tumor cells and, when used in combination with cancer staging, may increase the ability of investigators to predict prognosis in patients with zzso zzso cell zzso
