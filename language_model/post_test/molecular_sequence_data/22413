zzso precursor zzso of zzso peptides containing a zzso zzso have been subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso at a wavelength of 220 zzso and to zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso As expected, neutral loss of the zzso group is one of the zzso fragmentation channels during zzso together with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso leads mainly to the zzso zzso of the zzso side chain and a restrained loss of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the intensity of the zzso zzso zzso is greatly minimized when zzso is carried out next on the radical precursor zzso of the zzso and doubly charged zzso
