The zzso zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso containing one or two zzso zzso were separated by zzso zone zzso zzso in zzso buffer at low temperatures down to zzso degrees zzso At temperatures near zzso the relaxation time of the zzso zzso is on the zzso of minutes for the zzso and thus commensurate with the migration times in zzso under usual operating zzso The zzso of both zzso could be separated with baseline resolution below 10 degrees C in neat zzso 100 zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso on the zzso were identified by using authentic samples of the zzso and trans forms of zzso and zzso that were obtained by zzso zzso at 0 degree C, validated by zzso zzso and stored in liquid zzso The interplay of the zzso migration and zzso zzso reaction in zzso of zzso under various conditions was analyzed in the light of the zzso number zzso The results showed that besides employing low temperature increasing the zzso and/or decreasing the zzso length also reduce the magnitude of Da to bring about the separation of zzso zzso In this work the use of low temperature in this work was preferred due to the experimental zzso The separation of zzso zzso of two zzso zzso was carried out by zzso at zzso temperatures with zzso sodium zzso containing zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso as measured with a glass zzso The two zzso of zzso were baseline separated at zzso degrees C and the four zzso of zzso due to the presence of two zzso bonds in the zzso were also resolved at zzso degrees zzso From the zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In both cases, the trans zzso had zzso times greater zzso zzso than the zzso zzso This agrees with the observed migration order and molecular modeling zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were smaller than those of the zzso zzso despite the lower molecular mass of the zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is suitable for measuring certain molecular properties and suggest that the methods introduced here are zzso to the study of other systems of zzso zzso
