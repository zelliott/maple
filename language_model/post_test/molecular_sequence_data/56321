An element within the zzso A zzso promoter is highly zzso to an element from the rat type II Na channel zzso This Na Channel element has been previously proposed to be common to a number of zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso element binds a sequence specific DNA binding zzso The protein binds to only one strand of the zzso element and has little or no specificity for the double stranded DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the protein is found in both rat zzso tissue and adult zzso root zzso zzso in culture but not in established tissue culture cell zzso Using the zzso element linked to magnetic beads we have been able to demonstrate the enrichment of a protein with a molecular weight of zzso with that of the binding zzso A mechanism for protein binding to the DNA is proposed based on the fact that the region binding the protein is the loop of a larger zzso structure in the zzso
