We propose through a sequence and zzso analysis that a protein domain of undefined function zzso by the enveloped zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso related to the cellular zzso zzso A further zzso is emphasized with the group of zzso zzso viral zzso zzso by zzso zzso viruses of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso modeling of the putative zzso zzso domain suggests zzso acids that are crucial for zzso activity and zzso zzso
