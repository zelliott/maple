The zzso gene zzso zzso located at zzso on zzso 3) is expressed for a short period at zzso in all zzso derived zzso except the nervous zzso During this stage the zzso involved form zzso structures by a process of zzso followed by cell zzso Here we report the sequence of the zzso protein as deduced from the longest zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso The principal molecular features of the zzso protein are: 1) a consensus leader sequence for targeting to the rough zzso 2) a central domain containing a remarkably high density of zzso zzso arranged in large clusters separated by smaller clusters of zzso zzso 3) a consensus zzso sequence near the zzso 4) a single zzso zzso located at a potential zzso zzso The zzso zzso pattern of the zzso protein zzso to the in zzso zzso pattern of the zzso A possible role for the zzso protein in the complex process of zzso formation that occurs in embryonic zzso zzso is zzso
