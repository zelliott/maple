In order to address the possibility that the zzso gene located 47 zzso upstream from zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we have investigated zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso in Caucasian patients with zzso The zzso zzso consisting of 4 repetitions of zzso was present at significantly higher frequency in the patient group zzso than in the ethnically matched control zzso However, the frequency of the zzso zzso was significantly low in the zzso patients than in the zzso healthy controls zzso These observations suggest that zzso itself remains the primary genetic marker for zzso although the significantly dissimilar zzso frequency of the zzso zzso in zzso patients and healthy individuals may reflect the existence of other genetic zzso in the zzso zzso involved in the development of zzso
