The expression of a number of genes zzso products involved in copper zzso zzso in zzso is specifically inhibited by copper zzso We show here that copper zzso occurs through zzso repression of the zzso activity of zzso A segment of the zzso zzso factor zzso was identified that activated zzso in zzso in a zzso system using fusion zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso hybrid exhibits zzso activity that is zzso in cells cultured in the presence of copper zzso and zzso in cells with reduced copper zzso The repressive effect is specific for copper zzso The concentration dependency of the zzso of zzso is similar to that of zzso of zzso zzso a known zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso of gene expression is not observed with a zzso zzso containing the zzso substitution within the zzso zzso zzso harboring the zzso zzso fail to zzso zzso and zzso expression in a zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso exist within the first of two zzso sequence motifs adjacent to the His zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso function arises from a novel zzso repression of the zzso domain zzso Models for the mechanism of zzso of zzso function will be zzso
