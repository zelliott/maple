The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for increased zzso formation in inflammatory states and is the major target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is tightly zzso however, zzso zzso plays a key role in colon zzso To understand the mechanisms controlling zzso zzso we examined the ability of the zzso region of the zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso When fused to a reporter zzso the zzso region zzso rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso which was comparable to zzso zzso zzso turnover in zzso zzso treated with zzso D or zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso sequence element zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, this region inhibited protein synthesis approximately zzso However, this zzso did not occur through changes in zzso stability since zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated a complex of zzso proteins that bound specifically to the zzso and zzso zzso studies identified proteins ranging from 90 to 35 zzso zzso of the zzso showed differential association of zzso proteins to zzso and zzso zzso We propose that these factors influence expression at a zzso step and, if zzso may increase zzso protein as detected in colon zzso
