The complex zzso zzso constitutes a major part of the zzso region of zzso It can have different types of zzso zzso attached to the zzso zzso in the backbone of alternating zzso and zzso acid zzso the zzso acid zzso can be zzso or zzso zzso zzso produces zzso that are able to perform a synergistic degradation of zzso The zzso of the backbone by zzso zzso zzso is an essential prerequisite for the subsequent action of the zzso that cleave the zzso zzso 

The structure of zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso zzso folds into an zzso zzso The active site of zzso is an open zzso containing a zzso acid zzso zzso The position of the three zzso relative to the central parallel beta sheet and the lack of the zzso elbow motif found in structures possessing the zzso zzso fold show that zzso does not belong to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and sequence comparisons have revealed that, despite very low sequence similarities, zzso is related to seven other zzso They are all members of a new zzso family, the zzso family, which includes the zzso zzso family 12 as a distinct zzso The zzso family is zzso by having four zzso blocks of zzso each with one completely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of the four zzso plays a role in the zzso zzso
