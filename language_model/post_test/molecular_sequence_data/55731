We have identified a zzso activity that is specific for zzso zzso zzso This activity, found in a partially zzso fraction for a zzso zzso zzso binds to DNA molecules with zzso zzso structure, regardless of their zzso zzso and zzso the DNA in a neighboring zzso region zzso to the zzso zzso Competition with various zzso molecules zzso the zzso reaction, suggesting that this zzso activity is specific for zzso zzso zzso The existence of this zzso activity that zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso or zzso duplex zzso suggests that zzso DNA may have a distinct biological function in zzso
