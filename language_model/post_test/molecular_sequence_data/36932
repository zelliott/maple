The zzso zzso is a membrane protein mainly involved in the development of the zzso zzso and in zzso in zzso We used specific zzso zzso and the zzso expression system and produced independently and in large amounts several zzso forms of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso the full-length zzso zzso zzso a truncated membrane form zzso a zzso form of the zzso domain zzso and two forms of the zzso domain zzso zzso Of these forms, the zzso and zzso are associated with the membrane zzso the E is predominantly zzso into the medium and the zzso and zzso are expressed as soluble proteins and surprisingly, a great portion accumulates in the culture zzso The molecular mass zzso zzso of the expressed full-length zzso zzso to the translation product of the entire zzso coding zzso The zzso zzso identified in the rabbit zzso zzso is however much zzso Thus, in the zzso zzso the zzso presumably zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms zzso zzso and S bind zzso with specificity and affinity similar to those reported for the native zzso They also interact with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific for the native zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso forms do not bind zzso whereas the E form zzso Thus, the hormone binding site is located in the zzso domain which can function autonomously as a zzso soluble zzso However, the E form binds zzso with a higher affinity than the native zzso and it does not bind one of the two zzso zzso zzso known to be hormone zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of the native zzso and that of the E form zzso
