zzso stimulate zzso zzso gene expression in zzso cells, but the molecular mechanisms of these effects are not zzso While zzso receptors stimulate the protein zzso A zzso system, the zzso promoter does not have classical zzso elements zzso zzso we investigated the induction of the zzso zzso previously shown to increase zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this zzso cell line, we show that zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso a transient rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with a labeled zzso consensus sequence zzso showed induction of specific binding activity after zzso zzso zzso experiments with dominant zzso zzso zzso and reporter genes containing zzso promoter sequences showed that zzso induction by zzso is entirely dependent on a functional zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso induction of zzso in zzso is zzso by at least two distinct zzso zzso zzso regulatory element binding zzso induction is observed on the zzso located at zzso zzso on the zzso zzso A region located in the vicinity of the zzso zzso element zzso is also found to mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by this site, although sensitive to zzso zzso is not blocked by zzso zzso
