Combined zzso hormone zzso zzso has been linked with rare abnormalities in genes zzso zzso factors necessary for zzso zzso We have isolated zzso a gene involved in a new syndrome, using a zzso approach developed on the basis of documented zzso abnormalities of a zzso lethal zzso in mice generated by targeted disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso class of zzso zzso consists of at least six zzso located at zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso in patients of two unrelated zzso families displaying a complete deficit in all but one zzso anterior zzso hormone and a rigid cervical spine leading to limited head zzso Two of these patients also displayed a severe zzso zzso whereas one patient presented zzso with an enlarged anterior zzso These zzso zzso consist of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain at a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso deletion predicting a severely truncated protein lacking the entire zzso These data are consistent with function of zzso in the proper development of all anterior zzso cell types, except zzso and zzso zzso
