The structure of the zzso of the zzso major outer membrane component of zzso zzso and its role in defining zzso of the zzso were zzso The zzso were released from the zzso by zzso zzso coupled to a zzso zzso and subjected to two-dimensional sugar mapping zzso The major zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso having terminal zzso were detected as minor zzso These zzso were zzso and contained no zzso zzso This structural profile is consistent with our previous characterization based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso specificity of identified zzso zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso from zzso and structurally defined zzso from other zzso The zzso fraction having zzso type zzso as compared to those having complex or zzso showed a stronger zzso effect on attachment and zzso of zzso organisms to zzso zzso Among zzso type zzso the strongest zzso was observed with zzso 8 as compared with zzso 6, 7, or zzso These results indicate that a specific zzso type zzso linked to the major outer membrane protein of zzso zzso mediates attachment and zzso of the zzso to zzso zzso
