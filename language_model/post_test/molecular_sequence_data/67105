zzso is a zzso zzso factor composed of a large zzso and a small zzso zzso In humans, alternative zzso generates two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we used zzso interference to specifically zzso the expression of each zzso in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso of the major zzso zzso reduced cell viability and impaired zzso zzso leading to zzso of cells in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso affected the expression level of approximately 500 zzso from which zzso were underrepresented relative to the zzso Among zzso underrepresented in zzso cells we identified an essential cell cycle zzso zzso for which there was an increase in the ratio between zzso and spliced zzso and a significant reduction in protein zzso Furthermore, we show that depletion of either zzso or zzso altered the ratios of alternatively spliced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Taken together our results demonstrate that zzso is essential for zzso cell division and suggest a novel role for both zzso protein zzso as regulators of alternative zzso of a specific subset of zzso
