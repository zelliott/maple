zzso zzso catalyze zzso that are of interest for zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is the only protein showing remarkable zzso While related zzso often present a broad zzso zzso zzso accepts only a limited number of zzso Due to the absence of a zzso in the zzso crystal structure of zzso the zzso binding site of this protein has not yet been zzso In this study, a structural model of zzso zzso which acts on a broad range of compounds, has been prepared and compared with the structure of zzso This revealed 15 zzso acid positions in the active site of zzso that may account for its relatively narrow zzso zzso We designed and analyzed 30 single and multiple zzso in order to verify the role of these zzso zzso zzso screening revealed several zzso that displayed increased activity and altered zzso or zzso in zzso reactions and zzso Further zzso profiling resulted in the identification of zzso with improved zzso properties toward zzso attractive zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso was not compromised in comparison to that of the zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the positions identified within the active site of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contribute to the zzso specificity of this zzso These findings will aid in more dedicated and effective redesign of zzso and related zzso toward an expanded zzso zzso
