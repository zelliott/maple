The genes of the zzso zzso and zzso are localized in opposite orientation on zzso 11 in close vicinity, separated from each other by a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso The zzso of their expression has been studied in zzso experiments in zzso zzso zzso An expression zzso harboring the zzso region with zzso as reporter gene and likewise zzso 19 derivatives with the putative zzso were zzso zzso of gene expression by zzso elements of the zzso zzso and zzso gene was zzso Four proteins have been identified in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso cells that bind to several sequences of the zzso domain but not to the zzso regions of zzso zzso or zzso zzso These proteins might be responsible for the zzso zzso The zzso of the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso expression derived from the experiments described here is supported by zzso in the zzso region, leading to the zzso of zzso and the zzso effect of cholesterol on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
