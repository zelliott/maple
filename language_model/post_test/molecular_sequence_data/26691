Two hundred and zzso ticks zzso 185 larvae, 72 zzso and 34 zzso were removed from 153 small zzso zzso six species collected in zzso Forest, zzso Forest, and Marble Canyon within zzso National Park, British Columbia, zzso zzso examination and molecular analyses zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the ticks revealed that most individuals were zzso zzso zzso All life cycle stages of zzso zzso were found primarily on southern zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso females were also found on these small zzso The results of the molecular analyses also revealed that there were three zzso zzso of zzso zzso and two zzso zzso of zzso zzso A comparison of available sequence data suggests genetic divergence between zzso zzso near the western and eastern limits of the species zzso range in North zzso Additional studies are needed to determine whether there are genetic differences between zzso zzso from North America, Japan, and Russia, and whether there is geographical variation in the ability of ticks to transmit pathogens to their zzso zzso
