zzso within the zzso zzso zzso appear to account for significant zzso zzso metabolism of some drugs in the zzso To identify which of the known zzso genes are expressed in zzso zzso zzso was zzso on Northern blots with synthetic zzso complementary to zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected only with the zzso zzso The identity of the zzso zzso was confirmed to be zzso by direct sequencing of a DNA zzso amplified from zzso zzso by the zzso chain zzso To determine if zzso zzso is zzso zzso of small zzso zzso were obtained from five volunteers before and after they received zzso of treatment with zzso a known zzso of zzso in zzso zzso treatment resulted in a five- or zzso mean increase zzso zzso zzso in the biopsy concentration of zzso zzso when zzso for content of zzso zzso or zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso protein in zzso in each of the subjects, as judged by zzso and resulted in a zzso increase in zzso zzso activity zzso zzso in the one patient zzso Our identification of zzso zzso in zzso may in part account for drug interactions characteristic of zzso zzso and suggests a strategy for controlling entry into the body of a major class of zzso
