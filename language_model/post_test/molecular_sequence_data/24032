zzso and other zzso are produced by two alternative pathways in zzso One zzso starts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the other with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso zzso zzso zzso using gas zzso coupled to mass zzso revealed a two- to zzso increase in zzso levels in mature zzso compared with other zzso Genes involved in zzso zzso in L zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso of the public expressed sequence tag databases revealed the presence of a second gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis showed that zzso and zzso were expressed throughout the plant, while zzso transcripts were detected only in zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene expression during zzso development preceded symbiotic nitrogen zzso zzso zzso was zzso at 10 days zzso when a zzso increase in the transcript levels of zzso was observed in comparison with the zzso roots, while a twofold increase in the transcript levels of zzso and zzso was zzso At later stages of zzso development, transcripts for zzso drastically declined, while in the case of zzso transcript zzso was higher than that in roots until after 21 days zzso The expression profile of genes involved in zzso zzso correlated well with the expression patterns of genes involved in cell division and expansion, including a zzso zzso zzso D3 and an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene transcripts in developing zzso revealed that both transcripts were expressed in zzso inner cortical cells and in the central zzso High levels of zzso transcripts were also observed in both zzso and connecting root vascular zzso suggesting that zzso and other zzso may be subject to long-distance zzso Our results indicate that zzso are primarily involved in zzso and cellular processes involved in zzso development, rather than in processes that support directly symbiotic nitrogen fixation and zzso
