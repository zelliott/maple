zzso in the Shaker zzso locus of zzso zzso have differing effects on action potential duration and zzso in zzso as well as on zzso zzso channels zzso in zzso The molecular basis of three exemplary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso They are point zzso in the zzso zzso unit expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso have been introduced by in zzso zzso into zzso zzso The expression of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso reproduced the specific zzso traits of each zzso zzso The lack of zzso in zzso is due to a zzso zzso within a sequence motif occurring in all zzso characterized zzso zzso channel forming zzso The reduction of zzso in zzso is due to a zzso in an AG zzso zzso The intervening sequence between zzso 19 and 20 is not spliced in zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso flies do not contain the full complement of zzso zzso forming zzso Finally, the zzso zzso leads to an altered zzso dependence of zzso channel zzso and zzso as well as to an accelerated rate of recovery from zzso This is due to a zzso zzso altering the zzso acid sequence of the proposed zzso segment zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located zzso to the presumed zzso sensor of zzso zzso zzso The results explain the altered properties of excitable cells in zzso zzso and provide a general model for the possible role of zzso zzso channels in modulating action potential zzso
