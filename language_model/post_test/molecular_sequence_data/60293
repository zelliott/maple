zzso zzso a zzso minimal core zzso zzso by the zzso zzso gene zzso fails to initiate zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso when mice are administered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires T helper effects, such as those zzso by zzso with zzso zzso peptides or by the use of zzso zzso zzso Although zzso does possess zzso zzso they are likely zzso resulting in poor affinity and/or stability of zzso complexes and inadequate zzso of the zzso cell function of zzso zzso The present study has examined a series of longer, zzso peptides zzso zzso acids in zzso all zzso for their ability to initiate zzso and zzso zzso responses to the zzso in zzso their ability to bind class II zzso in zzso and their ability to assemble class II molecules zzso By means of a zzso skin test zzso in mice receiving zzso zzso cells, we found that a zzso and a zzso effectively zzso against the core zzso zzso and that this correlated with zzso production in zzso by zzso cells in response to the zzso In zzso studies, involving zzso class II zzso showed that the capacity to assemble class II molecules zzso more than the affinity for class II zzso correlated with the ability of the different zzso peptides to prime the host to the core zzso seen by the T zzso
