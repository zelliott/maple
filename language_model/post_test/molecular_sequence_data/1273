Previously, it has been demonstrated that the membrane fatty acid composition of zzso zzso is affected by growth pH zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Marquis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Specifically, the proportion of zzso fatty acids increases when the zzso is grown in zzso zzso if the shift to increased zzso fatty acids is blocked by the addition of a fatty acid zzso zzso the zzso is rendered more acid sensitive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, work with zzso zzso has identified a novel zzso zzso responsible for the production of zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso zzso Choi, and zzso zzso Rock, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the published zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso was identified in the zzso zzso strain zzso We generated a zzso strain that does not produce zzso fatty acids as determined by gas zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso The zzso strain was extremely sensitive to low pH in comparison to the wild type; however, the zzso zzso was relieved by growth in the presence of zzso zzso fatty acids or through genetic zzso The strain exhibited reduced zzso capability and altered zzso zzso In addition, the altered membrane composition was more zzso to zzso and did not maintain a normal zzso The results suggest that altered membrane composition can significantly affect the acid survival capabilities, as well as several zzso activities, of zzso zzso
