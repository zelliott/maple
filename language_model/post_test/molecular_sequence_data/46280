zzso zzso zzso are key zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains at least 50 zzso zzso however, only three zzso zzso and zzso are responsible for approximately zzso of the zzso zzso activity in this zzso zzso are expressed as inactive zzso Because the processed zzso are potentially zzso zzso zzso have developed mechanisms to regulate their zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor family zzso family zzso were recently identified in bacteria and zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso genes of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso to the zzso whereas zzso is targeted to zzso zzso we report two crystal structures of zzso The overall structure of zzso consists of eight zzso and closely resembles the zzso zzso A comparison between the two crystal forms of zzso indicates that the zzso zzso DE and zzso zzso form a flexible wedge that may block the active site of zzso The positively charged surface of the zzso zzso in zzso contrasts with the neutral surface of the zzso zzso in zzso We zzso that the flexibility and positive charge observed in the DE and zzso zzso of zzso may be important to facilitate the initial binding of this inhibitor to the battery of zzso present in zzso zzso
