It is well known that advanced zzso end products zzso are formed in zzso zzso proteins such as zzso and that their formation is related to skin zzso To examine the distribution of zzso in skin zzso we performed zzso studies on the human skin using an zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso signals were observed not only in the zzso but also in the zzso The objectives of this study were to confirm the presence of zzso zzso zzso an zzso structure, in the zzso and to characterize the zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the stratum zzso zzso was examined using liquid zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso between the retention times of a compound in the SC hydrolysate and authentic zzso as well as with the specific mass transition of zzso was zzso This result showed that zzso is present in the zzso In order to characterize the zzso proteins in the zzso protein samples extracted from the SC were analyzed using two-dimensional zzso followed by an zzso acid sequence zzso The clarified zzso sequences covered approximately zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso 10 zzso In the zzso experiment following the two-dimensional zzso where protein samples extracted from whole zzso were used, the position of the major zzso spots corresponded to those of zzso Taken together these results showed that zzso is present in the human zzso and suggest that zzso is one of the target molecules for zzso modification in the zzso
