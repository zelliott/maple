A zzso zzso zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using overlap extension zzso and transformed into zzso coli for zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed an optimum pH and temperature of zzso and 45 degrees C, respectively, and the zzso maintained high activity at pH zzso and 60 degrees zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso has a zzso higher zzso efficiency zzso for zzso than for zzso indicating zzso as the preferred zzso The maximum conversion rate of zzso into zzso by the zzso was independent of the zzso zzso tended to increase at lower temperatures, and reached approximately zzso at 20 degrees zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso Five zzso acid zzso that are important for zzso family zzso zzso were shown to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and required for its activity, suggesting this zzso might employ a similar zzso zzso
