The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso is likely important for primary zzso of progeny zzso since it zzso to the nuclear envelope of infected cells and largely determines the zzso state and zzso of the necessary primary zzso factor, the zzso zzso In zzso cells, the production of infectious zzso zzso progeny is delayed and decreased relative to that of the parental strain, zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso affects the zzso of primary zzso such that in its absence, zzso zzso enveloped zzso accumulate within zzso zzso These zzso are most often found along the interior periphery of the nucleus and may be derived from the inner nuclear zzso Since the zzso and zzso proteins comprise a zzso pair, a reasonable hypothesis is that the zzso zzso influences these replication parameters by direct zzso of the zzso zzso For this report, zzso viruses were constructed to determine the significance of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso activity on zzso protein zzso zzso growth, and zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The data presented suggest that the significance of zzso zzso is cell type dependent and that efficient viral zzso requires zzso zzso of an infected cell protein other than zzso
