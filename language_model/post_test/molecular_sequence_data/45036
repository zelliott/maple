zzso zzso zzso is the most common primary cancer of the zzso Thus there is great interest to identify novel zzso diagnostic markers for early detection of the disease and zzso specific associated proteins as potential therapeutic targets in the treatment of zzso Currently, we are screening for early zzso as well as studying the development of zzso by identifying the zzso expressed proteins of zzso zzso during different stages of disease zzso We have isolated, by reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso a zzso zzso zzso a protein that is zzso expressed in zzso This novel protein was initially identified by zzso analysis and we designate it as zzso The protein is zzso in zzso zzso but unchanged in zzso zzso The full-length transcript encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that has three zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso retention signal motif zzso Fluorescence zzso tagging to this protein confirmed that it is localized predominantly to the zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso alignment analysis shows that it is a zzso of the zzso zzso and the human zzso found in zzso all show close similarity in protein zzso zzso it exhibits the anticipated zzso activity in the insulin zzso reduction zzso but its other biological role in cell function remains to be zzso This work demonstrates that an integrated zzso and zzso approach can be a very powerful means of discovering potential diagnostic and therapeutic protein targets for cancer zzso
