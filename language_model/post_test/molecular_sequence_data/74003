Complex zzso as zzso part of zzso such as zzso zzso hormones, antibiotics and other secondary zzso play an active role in zzso and zzso zzso The aim of zzso as an upcoming interdisciplinary research field is to develop highly efficient synthesis strategies, including in zzso and in zzso approaches, in order to bring such complex molecules into zzso and therapeutic zzso The zzso synthesis of zzso bonds by zzso is an efficient strategy for obtaining zzso with absolute zzso and zzso in high yields and under mild zzso There are, however, two obstacles hindering the realization of this process on a zzso scale, namely the production of zzso zzso and the availability of zzso for the synthesis of zzso zzso (the zzso donor zzso The present review surveys some synthetic targets which have attracted the interest of zzso as well as zzso expression systems which give zzso activities in the zzso and U zzso The main part summarizes publications concerned with the complex pathways of primary and secondary zzso zzso and the availability and use of these zzso for synthesis zzso In this context, a survey of our work will demonstrate how zzso from different sources and pathways can be combined for the synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso
