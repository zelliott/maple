This study was conducted to demonstrate that zzso played a role in the zzso transport of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso across the rabbit zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Over the 1 to 5 zzso concentration range, zzso transport was 25 to 180 times greater from the zzso than from the opposite zzso This asymmetry in transport was consistent with the ability of zzso to lower the zzso electrical resistance of zzso cell zzso only from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso access to the zzso located zzso zzso channel in the lower zzso segments by zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso or removal of zzso zzso in the zzso fluid dramatically reduced zzso transport to zzso of the zzso Moreover, zzso transport across zzso cell zzso could be zzso against zzso zzso zzso There was a small zzso zzso drag effect induced by zzso zzso flux zzso by zzso in the zzso contributing in part to enhanced zzso zzso zzso Overall, the above findings are consistent with a scenario zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso flux across the zzso segments at the level of the zzso zzso channel, thereby triggering yet to be identified zzso zzso changes that ultimately result in tight zzso opening and enhanced zzso zzso zzso
