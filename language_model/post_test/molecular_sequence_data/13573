Discovery of a second, zzso zzso zzso provides explanations for many previously puzzling zzso but also raises new questions about zzso zzso A zzso sequence closely related to the zzso zzso response element has been shown to play a role in both zzso and induced zzso zzso 2 gene zzso Aspirin and other currently available zzso zzso drugs that inhibit zzso zzso activity do not effectively discriminate between the zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Identification of a second zzso zzso induced by inflammatory zzso initiated a search for zzso zzso Use of zzso zzso 2 specific zzso and zzso zzso has led to the suggestion that specific zzso activate alternative pathways of zzso production, using one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanisms by which these pathways are activated in response to alternative stimuli should provide additional routes of intervention in zzso zzso
