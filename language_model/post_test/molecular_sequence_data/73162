The basis of protein stability has been investigated by the structural comparison of zzso zzso with their zzso zzso A number of characteristics have been found that can contribute to the stabilization of zzso zzso but no one is uniquely capable of zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso have been determined by the method of molecular replacement using the known structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso coli zzso was refined at a resolution of zzso A to an zzso of zzso that of the zzso zzso zzso at zzso A resolution to an zzso of zzso The three structures were compared to zzso the basis of the higher zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso that created a cavity in the zzso core of the zzso zzso was designed to investigate the importance of packing density for zzso The structure of this zzso was zzso The main stabilizing features in the zzso zzso are an increased number of salt bridges, additional hydrogen bonds, a zzso larger and more zzso zzso zzso shortened N and C zzso and a larger number of zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso core of zzso zzso zzso resulted in a cavity of 32 A3, but no significant effect on the activity and zzso of the zzso was zzso
