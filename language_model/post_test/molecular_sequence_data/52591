zzso virus zzso was recently isolated in Peru from the Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso particles are zzso zzso and about 30 zzso in zzso The virus has a zzso zzso zzso and a single major zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso features that support its zzso as a zzso As such, zzso is the first zzso to have been isolated from outside zzso Here we report that zzso replicates in wax zzso larvae and that zzso zzso zzso replicate when zzso into cultured baby zzso kidney zzso The complete zzso sequences of both segments of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso The larger zzso segment, zzso is zzso zzso long and contains a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso protein A, the viral contribution to the zzso zzso During zzso a zzso long zzso zzso zzso is zzso which is zzso with the 3' end of zzso zzso contains a small zzso which could zzso a protein of 90 zzso acids similar to the B2 protein of other zzso zzso contains zzso zzso and encodes the 401 zzso acids of the zzso protein precursor zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso share 41 and zzso identity with zzso proteins of zzso house virus, the best characterized of the zzso These and other sequence comparisons indicate that zzso is zzso the most distant of the zzso described to date, consistent with its novel geographic zzso Although the zzso zzso precursor is zzso into the two mature zzso proteins beta and zzso the zzso acid sequence at the zzso site, which is zzso in all other zzso is zzso in zzso To facilitate the investigation of zzso replication in cultured cells, we constructed plasmids that transcribed full-length zzso zzso with authentic zzso and 3' zzso zzso of these plasmids in cells recreated the replication of zzso zzso and zzso synthesis of zzso zzso and translation of viral proteins A and zzso
