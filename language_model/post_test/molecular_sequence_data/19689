zzso zzso protein 2) was originally described as a novel gene involved in the zzso zzso In this study, we cloned a potential zzso zzso zzso The consensus open reading frame zzso zzso encodes a zzso of 550 zzso acids which shares 37% identity with the human zzso zzso analysis reveals a small pattern zzso zzso zzso zzso which seems to be of particular interest in the light of its strong conservation between zzso and the recently discovered zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso analysis in adult zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso has a broad zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso transcripts are zzso derived and becomes strongly localized in the central nervous system at early zzso zzso From 5 zzso zzso expression becomes zzso in the gut and zzso duct zzso suggesting a wide tissue function during zzso zzso
