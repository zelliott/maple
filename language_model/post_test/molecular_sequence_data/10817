The zzso protein of the zzso C virus zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso De zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is assumed to be required for replication of the viral zzso To further study the zzso and structural properties of this zzso an zzso fusion protein was expressed with zzso zzso in insect cells and zzso to near zzso The zzso was found to have a zzso zzso activity that was able to copy a complete in zzso zzso zzso in the absence of additional viral or cellular zzso zzso binding zzso and competition experiments showed that the zzso zzso binds zzso with no clear preference for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was also zzso and the following order of specificity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An inverse order was found for the zzso activity, which used zzso most efficiently as a template but was inactive on zzso and zzso suggesting that a high binding affinity between zzso and template interferes with zzso By using a zzso analysis, four zzso acid sequence motifs crucial for zzso activity were zzso While most zzso of zzso zzso within these motifs severely reduced the zzso activities, a single substitution in motif D which enhanced the zzso activity by about 50% was zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso acid zzso at the very zzso in particular the zzso zzso are important for zzso activity but not for zzso zzso Finally, we found a terminal zzso activity associated with the zzso zzso However, this activity was also detected with zzso proteins with an inactive zzso with an zzso protein zzso in the same way, and with zzso zzso suggesting that it is not an inherent activity of zzso
