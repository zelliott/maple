zzso zzso potential zzso 1 zzso channels mediate several types of zzso zzso Despite the importance of these channels in pain detection and zzso little is known about how their structural components convert different types of stimuli into channel zzso To zzso the zzso gate of these channels, we inserted zzso along the zzso segment of zzso zzso channels and assessed their accessibility to zzso zzso We show that access to the pore of zzso is gated by zzso in response to both zzso binding and increases in temperature, that the zzso zzso segments are zzso structures and that two zzso are present in the zzso one that zzso the access of large molecules and the other that zzso the access of smaller zzso and constitutes an zzso gate of these zzso
