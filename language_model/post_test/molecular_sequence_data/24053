To understand the origin and evolution of common zzso zzso zzso and nuclear DNA variations were studied in five zzso and three zzso wheat zzso Based on zzso simple sequence repeats at 24 zzso they were classified into two major zzso zzso I consisted of 11 zzso including the major zzso zzso that occurred at the highest frequency zzso in common zzso zzso II consisted of five zzso and occurred in eight out of 27 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso of zzso zzso As for nuclear DNA variations, zzso data using 10 primer sets revealed two major zzso of a zzso tree constructed by zzso zzso zzso method with zzso zzso one consisting of common wheat and the other of zzso zzso The zzso of common wheat was further divided into two major and six minor zzso One of the major zzso consisted only of zzso zzso zzso zzso which were grouped into two zzso one consisting only of zzso with zzso I zzso and the other with both zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso common zzso formed the other zzso Taken together, our data indicate the existence of at least two maternal lineages in common wheat and support the hypothesis that European zzso wheat originated in Europe separately from other groups of common zzso
