The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is comprised of a zzso direct zzso each of which contains multiple binding sites for zzso zzso The occupancy of these sites determines the tissue specificity of expression and disease zzso of the zzso The identification of proteins that bind to this zzso is therefore required in order to understand the molecular basis of this zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso has identified 4 potential binding sites for the zzso factor zzso Evidence is presented using zzso I protection analysis that zzso binds to these 4 sites within the zzso The potential role of zzso binding in tissue specific expression of zzso is zzso
