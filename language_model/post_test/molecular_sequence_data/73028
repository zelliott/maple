zzso liver zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso upon treatment with the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso gives nearly complete protection against zzso and prevents zzso indicating that these zzso form part of or reside close to the active zzso zzso analysis of peptides from zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso 107 and zzso 67 as the sites of zzso A set of zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso 107 was exchanged for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited an activity and zzso profile similar to that of the wild type zzso but displayed a decreased zzso Thus, zzso 107 does not appear to participate in zzso or zzso zzso instead, an important structural role is suggested for this zzso zzso 67 was zzso to zzso and zzso with no effect on zzso All three zzso were replaced by zzso and the resulting zzso proteins had activities comparable with that of the wild zzso It can thus be concluded that the chemical modification experiments indicating that zzso zzso zzso 67, and one of the zzso partake in zzso can be zzso However, protection from modification by a competitive inhibitor indicates that these zzso could be close to the zzso binding zzso All zzso to zzso zzso resulted in zzso with activities similar to that of the wild zzso Interestingly, the exchange of zzso 137 appears to result in zzso of the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso must display an alternate stabilization of the zzso zzso of zzso other than through interaction with the zzso zzso group of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso 49 with zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso with zzso properties partly resembling the activated form of zzso zzso zzso The function of this zzso was not altered upon reaction with zzso and zzso 49 is thus demonstrated as the site of modification that results in zzso of zzso zzso zzso
