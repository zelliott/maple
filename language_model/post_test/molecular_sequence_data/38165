The rat zzso zzso zzso shares considerable zzso with the rat zzso zzso zzso yet binds human zzso zzso with high zzso suggesting that the binding zzso zzso by the zzso gene shares no zzso with the analogous zzso primary zzso thereby zzso specificity of zzso zzso Two such regions of primary sequence have been previously identified and studied by zzso challenge tests and zzso zzso We therefore implemented zzso zzso to delete the regions zzso and zzso of the mature zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in insect zzso The large deletion zzso and a smaller zzso zzso did not bind zzso However, zzso and zzso bound zzso with an affinity indistinguishable from zzso zzso The deletion zzso zzso zzso or zzso were not zzso on the cell surface by flow zzso unless cells were zzso Although zzso binding to zzso was normal, this form of the zzso was defective for signal zzso whereas zzso was zzso Furthermore, neither region seems to be a specificity zzso since their removal did not result in zzso binding of zzso to zzso
