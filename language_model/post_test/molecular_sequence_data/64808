zzso zzso are zzso regulators of zzso interactions and cell zzso The most highly zzso region of all zzso are the zzso type 3 zzso repeats and the zzso zzso domain zzso The crystal structure of a zzso zzso fragment, spanning three zzso repeats and the zzso reveals a compact zzso The zzso repeats lack secondary structure and are zzso around a core of calcium zzso two zzso motifs per repeat each zzso two calcium zzso in a novel zzso The zzso forms a zzso zzso and contains four strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso of the hairpin structure of zzso repeats 6 and 7 decreases protein zzso and zzso The availability for cell attachment of an zzso motif in zzso repeat 7 is modulated by calcium zzso The central architectural role of calcium explains how it is critical for the functions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso repeats of zzso which cause two human skeletal disorders, are predicted to disrupt the zzso structure of the zzso zzso
