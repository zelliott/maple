zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as a sole source of zzso zzso and zzso In order to identify the genes involved in this zzso we cloned and zzso a zzso zzso containing a zzso region of zzso zzso zzso Of the products of the 13 open reading frames deduced from this fragment, zzso shares zzso identity to the large component of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso U and zzso is zzso identical to an zzso zzso from zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso as zzso zzso and they were considered to be a zzso and a zzso respectively, as determined by gel zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso the reduction of zzso to zzso zzso could enhance zzso activity, and genetic analyses indicated that both zzso and zzso play essential roles in zzso zzso in strain zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene cluster next to zzso shares significant similarities with and has the same organization as a gene cluster responsible for zzso degradation zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the genes involved in zzso degradation are physically zzso
