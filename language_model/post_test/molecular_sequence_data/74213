The detection of zzso in human peripheral blood is one of the most important measures in a malaria zzso We attempted to detect zzso of zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso of dried blood on filter zzso On field samples analysis, the specific zzso products for region 3 of zzso zzso were observed in 67 of 131 zzso malaria zzso The minimum detection level of zzso samples was zzso zzso on quantitative real-time zzso zzso positive rate was not dependent on sex or zzso A higher frequency of zzso was found in single zzso zzso infection than in mixed species infection zzso In this study, 47 of the 131 patients were zzso zzso of these 47 patients showed zzso zzso zzso Moreover, four zzso of region 3 of zzso were detected in zzso zzso patients and 13 of 67 zzso zzso patients carried more than one zzso zzso These results suggest that dried blood on filter paper is a useful for a molecular zzso study of malaria transmission and zzso zzso
