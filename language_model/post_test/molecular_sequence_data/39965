A partial gene for zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso has been cloned and an zzso primary culture derived from zzso zzso established to study regulation of the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso medium containing zzso fetal calf serum zzso and zzso zzso medium for zzso short-term experiments, zzso zzso were separately treated with zzso zzso zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso which have been demonstrated to stimulate zzso zzso A zzso followed by zzso of the zzso zzso levels by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Our results show that: zzso the deduced zzso zzso protein zzso by the cloned gene is about 130 zzso acids in zzso and is closely related to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso primary culture containing mainly (over zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression levels of the zzso zzso transcript were increased by zzso zzso and zzso treatments in a zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that an zzso partial zzso gene has been cloned and its regulation of expression in zzso zzso zzso cell culture is similar to that in higher zzso
