The zzso closed state zzso zzso of the zzso 3 segment zzso of the zzso E1 channel domain was investigated by zzso zzso labeling using a zzso probe zzso to a single zzso zzso of each zzso zzso A number of zzso properties of the zzso zzso probe were measured for the soluble channel zzso proteins as well as for the zzso zzso A new method called zzso zzso surface analysis was employed to fit the zzso data to a harmonic wave function using four different statistical zzso The fit of the various data sets to a harmonic wave function indicated that the zzso of zzso 3 in the zzso state is typical for an zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso per turn and an angular frequency between 90 and 97 zzso zzso upon membrane zzso zzso 3 zzso from 15 zzso zzso zzso to 20 zzso by a three- and zzso extension at the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed that zzso 3 is zzso to the surface of the membrane with its zzso more deeply buried within the zzso region of the zzso than its zzso Finally, contrary to a previous report, our data show that zzso 3 and 4 remain separate and independent zzso upon membrane association in the absence of a membrane zzso
