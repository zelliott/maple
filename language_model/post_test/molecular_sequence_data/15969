A complementary DNA clone corresponding to the 70 zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat lung has been zzso The primary structure of the zzso consisted of zzso zzso including a zzso coding region for 619 zzso zzso and the calculated molecular weight was zzso zzso zzso of total zzso from rat zzso detected a zzso of about zzso zzso The amount of zzso was abundant in zzso zzso and zzso moderate in heart and zzso and low in liver and zzso Southern zzso analysis of high molecular weight zzso DNA from rat liver indicated the presence of one gene in the rat zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the 70 zzso zzso has partial zzso with particulate zzso zzso from zzso zzso and protein zzso inhibitor zzso
