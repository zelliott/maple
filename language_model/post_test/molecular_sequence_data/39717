zzso of big zzso (Big zzso a zzso zzso consisting of zzso A zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso on memory function, anxiety, and locomotor activity were studied in mice and compared to those of zzso A and zzso zzso All peptides administered zzso increased zzso zzso in the passive avoidance test with the maximum effective doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of Big zzso were inhibited by zzso 801 zzso zzso an zzso zzso blocker whereas those of zzso A and B were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso (6 zzso Big zzso zzso zzso enhanced locomotor activity in the open field test and induced zzso behavior both effects blocked by zzso zzso No changes in locomotor activity and no signs of zzso behavior were produced by zzso A and zzso Big zzso zzso zzso increased time spent in the open branches of the elevated plus maze apparatus with no changes in general zzso Whereas zzso A and B zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso produced analgesia in the zzso test Big zzso did zzso Thus, Big zzso differs from its fragments zzso A and B in its unique pattern of memory zzso zzso and zzso effects that are sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso The findings suggest that Big zzso has its own function in the brain different from those of the zzso peptides acting through zzso zzso
