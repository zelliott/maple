Human zzso zzso zzso is a hormone zzso with insulin by pancreatic zzso For reasons not clearly zzso zzso zzso in type II diabetics to form zzso that interfere with zzso function, eventually leading to the loss of insulin zzso The cellular membrane zzso the formation of zzso deposits and is a target of zzso toxicity through disruption of the zzso structural zzso zzso there is considerable current interest in solving the zzso structure of this zzso in a membrane zzso zzso experiments could not be directly zzso in zzso zzso due to the rapid zzso of the zzso To overcome this difficulty, we have solved the structure of the naturally occurring zzso in zzso zzso at a neutral zzso The structure has an overall zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso In addition, the angle between the zzso and zzso zzso is constrained to zzso The greater zzso content of human zzso in the zzso versus free acid form is likely to play a role in its zzso and membrane disruptive zzso
