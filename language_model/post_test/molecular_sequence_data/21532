The zzso of budding zzso are zzso zzso in size and contain three functional zzso an zzso region flanked by binding sites for zzso and zzso A specialized zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso is formed at the zzso Our zzso zzso sequencing of zzso DNA reveals that the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso kernel of zzso zzso depending on the zzso and is therefore significantly shorter than the zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso the zzso zzso is essentially perfectly zzso The entire zzso is included, together with at least 1 zzso of DNA upstream of the zzso site and at least 4 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso The fact that the binding sites for zzso and zzso are included within the zzso zzso has important implications for models of the zzso zzso and for zzso zzso
