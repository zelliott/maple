zzso D zzso of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso when it was incubated with the zzso and the reaction followed by zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso activity were not zzso under the same conditions, indicating that zzso of the zzso occurred as the result of its zzso zzso This confirmed that the zzso protein was the zzso zzso zzso zzso contain two copies of the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two protein fragments were separately prepared with zzso strains of zzso zzso One of the fragments was the zzso half of the intact zzso containing one zzso zzso and the other was the zzso half with the other zzso An active zzso was reconstructed from these two fragments, and therefore designated zzso zzso zzso When zzso was subjected to the zzso experiment, only the zzso half was zzso zzso it was concluded that the zzso zzso that bound directly to the zzso group of the zzso was located on the zzso half of zzso and that the zzso half did not contain such a zzso
