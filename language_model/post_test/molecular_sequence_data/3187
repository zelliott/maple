The regulation of zzso and of the genes expressed as markers of zzso differentiation is poorly zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an essential and specific component of cartilage, but the zzso zzso promoter is expressed in an zzso fashion in zzso DNA zzso the rat zzso gene zzso zzso including the zzso first zzso was surveyed for active zzso which would impart selective expression to the zzso promoter in zzso zzso in zzso A zzso DNA zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity was discovered approximately 12 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso this active DNA zzso is zzso and zzso and strongly stimulates zzso promoter expression in zzso while zzso suppressing zzso in zzso Most of this activity has been localized to zzso a zzso internal zzso of zzso Another zzso element zzso which is not zzso was discovered about 70 zzso downstream of the zzso start zzso Several lines of transgenic mice were created using combinations of these DNA elements to drive the zzso reporter zzso Neither a short zzso zzso nor a long zzso zzso promoter alone showed zzso expression in zzso zzso whereas placing the zzso zzso zzso together with zzso gave strong expression restricted to embryonic cartilage of transgenic zzso The zzso downstream zzso in conjunction with zzso did not zzso zzso This is the first report of a gene control region which zzso authentic zzso regulation of zzso in zzso or in zzso and should greatly facilitate understanding the coordinate regulation of zzso zzso
