An zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso protein import was isolated and the zzso zzso zzso identified by zzso zzso zzso is a zzso integral membrane protein in the zzso inner envelope membrane with four predicted zzso zzso similar to another potential zzso inner membrane zzso channel, At zzso and the zzso inner membrane counterparts zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and accumulated zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso were normal in targeting and binding of precursors to the zzso surface but were defective in protein zzso across the inner envelope zzso zzso levels of zzso were comparable to those of major zzso zzso such as At zzso and At zzso except during zzso at which stage At zzso was expressed at its highest zzso A double zzso of zzso At zzso had the same zzso as the At zzso single zzso suggesting that zzso and At zzso function similarly in zzso zzso with At zzso functioning earlier in zzso We renamed zzso as zzso zzso (At zzso and propose that it functions as part of the inner membrane zzso channel and may be more important for later stages of leaf zzso
