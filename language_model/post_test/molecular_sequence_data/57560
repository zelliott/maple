During studies of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso extracts of zzso zzso and eggs, we found that a zzso expressed fusion protein between the zzso coli zzso protein and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso activated a 42 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso on addition of zzso was consistent, whereas the zzso of zzso was variable and failed to occur in some zzso extracts in which zzso A or zzso acid activated both zzso and zzso zzso In cases when zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso activity declined after zzso activity was lost, and zzso zzso but not zzso could be maintained at a high level by the presence of zzso When intact zzso were treated with zzso however, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso occurred zzso in contrast to the zzso of zzso These observations suggest that one role of zzso may be to maintain high zzso zzso activity in zzso They also imply that the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso are zzso events that normally rely on an agent that has still to be zzso
