zzso have developed cellulose zzso capabilities that allow them to obtain energy and nutrition from nutritionally poor food sources, such as zzso plant material and zzso derived from it zzso wood and zzso Lower termites, which are equipped with both zzso zzso of zzso zzso and symbiotic zzso feed primarily on wood and zzso zzso This study investigated zzso gene diversity, structure, and activity in the lower zzso zzso zzso zzso We initially used a zzso approach to identify four genes zzso one zzso and three symbiotic zzso which we refer to as zzso zzso zzso and zzso These four genes zzso proteins that share significant sequence similarity with known zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses further supported these zzso relationships by showing that each of the four zzso proteins clusters tightly with respective zzso zzso or zzso zzso Gene structure studies revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso while zzso contains the first zzso sequence to be identified from a zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso gene is expressed exclusively in the zzso zzso whereas symbiotic zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed in the zzso (where zzso zzso are zzso zzso activity zzso mapped the distribution pattern of zzso zzso and zzso activity throughout the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression correlated well with the specific types of zzso activities observed in each gut region zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest the presence of a single unified cellulose zzso system, zzso zzso and symbiotic zzso work zzso and zzso across the entire zzso tract of zzso zzso
