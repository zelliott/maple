We generated zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso by introducing a single zzso substitution in zzso V of the zzso domain and then examined the zzso of these zzso to zzso derivatives originally designed as zzso zzso Substituting smaller zzso acids zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso V drastically increased the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso at zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso Other derivatives of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not significantly inhibit zzso and its various zzso In addition, these zzso zzso were activated by zzso when they were expressed in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso V is important in determining the zzso of zzso to zzso without significant changes in their zzso zzso
