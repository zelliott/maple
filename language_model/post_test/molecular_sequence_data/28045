zzso zzso possess a highly zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to function in the repair or metabolism of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso of the general sequence zzso in which zzso represents an zzso zzso and X represents zzso zzso or Ala, are zzso with the same order of preference following their zzso into zzso as in a zzso system containing bovine brain protein zzso zzso and zzso The affinities of the zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the peptides in zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the sequence zzso is a higher affinity zzso for the zzso in zzso characterized by a zzso of zzso zzso but it is modified to a lesser extent in zzso partially because of its reduced stability in zzso The zzso zzso which contains an zzso zzso in the usual zzso is not zzso either in zzso or in intact zzso zzso of any of the four zzso peptides greatly stimulates total zzso zzso in zzso with rate increases ranging from zzso to zzso after the injection of 30 zzso of zzso The protein zzso is also modified following its zzso into zzso to near its calculated zzso zzso Each of the zzso peptides can act as a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the peptides parallel their specific zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso may be a useful model for studying the significance of protein zzso zzso because of the large functional excess of zzso capacity and the zzso of the reactions compared to those observed in zzso zzso This excess capability may have zzso significance when structurally abnormal proteins accumulate as a result of cellular stress and or zzso
