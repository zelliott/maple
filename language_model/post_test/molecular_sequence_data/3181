zzso of zzso genes in zzso is induced by both zzso zzso and sugar zzso In a transient expression zzso a zzso sugar response sequence zzso in the promoter of a sugar zzso highly zzso rice zzso zzso zzso was shown previously to zzso sugar response and to enhance the activity of the rice zzso promoter in rice zzso A zzso zzso sequence was also found in the promoter of another sugar zzso highly zzso rice zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso response sequence and was designated as zzso zzso In the present study, a transgenic approach was employed to characterize the function of the zzso gene zzso in zzso We found that the zzso zzso significantly enhances the zzso expression pattern of the zzso promoter in various rice zzso throughout their zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso significantly enhances zzso promoter activity only in zzso and zzso of zzso rice zzso A minimal promoter fused to the zzso zzso is specifically active in rice zzso and zzso and is subject to sugar repression and zzso induction in rice zzso This sugar repression was found to override zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that the zzso zzso enhancers contain zzso elements capable of enhancing zzso expression patterns or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of promoters in transgenic zzso These enhancers may facilitate the design of highly active and tightly regulated composite promoters for zzso transformation and gene zzso Our study also reveals the existence of zzso between the sugar and zzso signaling pathways in zzso and provides a system for analyzing the underlying molecular mechanisms zzso
