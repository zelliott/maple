zzso are known to exhibit both zzso and zzso features in their zzso with the ability to express their genes and even replicate in bacterial zzso We have demonstrated previously the existence of zzso zzso circular zzso of zzso yellow vein virus zzso a species in the zzso zzso family zzso in zzso coli cells, which prompted our search for unknown zzso functions in the zzso zzso By using a promoter zzso strategy, we identified a novel zzso promoter, designated zzso promoter, in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso promoter is strong, zzso and zzso with an zzso downstream zzso binding site and a zzso short open reading frame of eight zzso zzso zzso analyses suggested that the zzso promoter might be a remnant of zzso ancestors that could be related to certain promoters of bacteria from marine or freshwater zzso The discovery of the zzso zzso promoter provided further evidence for the zzso origin in the evolutionary history of zzso
