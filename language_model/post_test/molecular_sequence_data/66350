Nine strains of a new zzso species were isolated from natural samples collected in Japan and Thailand including one strain obtained from a leaf of zzso zzso zzso zzso one strain from soil zzso zzso six strains from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one strain from zzso in zzso forest zzso On the basis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the sequence analyses of the zzso domain of the large zzso zzso zzso gene and the internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region, the nine strains were found to represent a single novel species of the zzso zzso which were named zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso trees based on the sequences of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a close relationship with the five recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from the five recognized species of the zzso zzso by six to 12 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso gene and by zzso zzso zzso in the ITS zzso zzso zzso zzso
