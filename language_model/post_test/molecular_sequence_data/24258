zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in Type 2 diseases and is commonly described as being zzso regulated with other Type 2 zzso such as zzso and zzso Considering the unique control of zzso by zzso such coordinate regulation would be zzso In fact, the biological specificity of zzso and its control by zzso suggests a unique and independent control of zzso zzso In this report we show the binding of zzso to three sites in the human zzso promoter in the human zzso line zzso The previously identified zzso site and another site at position zzso are shown to positively regulate zzso zzso More importantly, the site located at zzso acts as a powerful zzso of zzso zzso with zzso of this site allowing a high level expression of zzso without the zzso of other factors normally required for zzso zzso Whereas zzso has been proposed to be involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso we show here that it has another function in controlling zzso zzso that supports the observed unique biological function of this zzso
