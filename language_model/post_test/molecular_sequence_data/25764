The ultimate goal of protein engineering is to create novel proteins which will adopt predetermined structures, bind specified zzso and catalyze new zzso Here we describe the successful introduction of zzso activity into a model four zzso bundle zzso The designed binding site is zzso and is formed by two zzso and two His zzso on adjacent zzso We have introduced this site into the protein and characterized the binding zzso Using zzso we have shown that the protein binds zzso that the zzso are essential for zzso and that binding occurs to the protein zzso The designed protein binds metals with high zzso we estimate the zzso zzso as zzso X zzso M for zzso and zzso X zzso M for zzso The characteristic zzso spectrum of the zzso protein fully supports the model of a zzso binding site comprised of two zzso and two His zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that no significant changes in secondary structure occur between the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso However, the zzso form is substantially stabilized toward zzso by zzso compared to the zzso zzso
