The zzso DNA inversion system zzso zzso by the zzso zzso consists of a zzso two zzso zzso sites and a zzso zzso The latter approximately 75 zzso long genetic element is zzso due to its location within the zzso part of the zzso gene zzso the zzso In order to determine the essential zzso for each of its two biological functions we randomly zzso the zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso both functions of the zzso zzso Three distinct regions of this sequence were found to be important for the zzso zzso One of them occupies the middle third of the zzso sequence and it can suffer a number of functionally neutral base zzso while others are zzso The other two regions occupy the two zzso thirds of the zzso They coincide with binding sites of the zzso protein zzso zzso for zzso zzso needed for efficient DNA inversion in zzso These sequences appear to be highly evolved allowing only a few zzso without affecting either of the biological zzso Taking the effect of zzso within these zzso binding sites into account a consensus sequence for the interaction with zzso was zzso This zzso consensus implies a zzso structure for the zzso zzso This is in line with the orientation independence of zzso action with respect to the zzso zzso
