zzso is a major integral membrane protein of human zzso the absence of which is associated with a form of zzso anemia known as zzso zzso It is reported that zzso regulates the gating of zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso However, the function of zzso is not fully zzso In the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the putative zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso and its partner zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and specifically zzso the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso We have determined the first crystal structure of the core domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso This review focuses on the three-dimensional structure of zzso and discusses the function of zzso and its specific zzso zzso zzso forms a novel zzso zzso Three zzso zzso form a triangle of about 50 zzso on each side, and three zzso segments about 60 zzso in length extend from the zzso of the zzso The zzso domain of zzso is partly similar in structure to the zzso domain of mouse zzso While the zzso domain is relatively zzso the zzso segment shows a zzso flexibility, adapting to the neighboring zzso One zzso segment forms an zzso zzso with another zzso segment from a zzso zzso The zzso segment shows a zzso repeat pattern, and mainly zzso zzso form a zzso zzso The zzso fold observed in the crystal probably contributes to the zzso
