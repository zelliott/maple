zzso acid sequence alignments of zzso zzso proteins found in zzso zzso and zzso display, relative to one another, an unusual segment or block structure, with major evolutionary zzso Within each of the zzso zzso the sequences exhibit substantial zzso but zzso alignments break up into zzso universal blocks zzso in both zzso zzso bacterial blocks zzso with any zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocks zzso with any bacterial zzso zzso of those zzso zzso zzso that have zzso in both zzso and zzso exclusively match the zzso block zzso The distinct blocks do not correlate consistently with any identifiable functional or structural feature including zzso and protein zzso This zzso block pattern also exists in a number of other proteins associated with protein zzso but not among zzso of zzso zzso While the universal blocks imply that modern zzso and zzso (as defined by their zzso zzso clearly have had a common zzso the zzso blocks imply that these two groups derive from single, zzso types that came into existence at some point long after that common zzso The simplest explanation for this pattern would be a major evolutionary zzso or other scenario that drastically limited the zzso of modern zzso diversity at a time considerably after the evolution of a fully functional translation zzso The vast range of zzso and zzso that zzso occupy today would thus reflect divergent evolution after such a restricting zzso Interestingly, zzso analysis places the origin of zzso at about the same time and shows a closer relationship of the zzso zzso proteins to zzso rather than zzso zzso
