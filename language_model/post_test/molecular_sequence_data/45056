zzso anemia zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso cancer zzso and cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso Eight of the 11 cloned zzso anemia gene products zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso nuclear complex zzso core zzso required for zzso of a downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso which possesses three zzso repeats and a plant zzso zzso is the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso repeats of zzso are required for interaction with other zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso is zzso for this interaction, although it is required for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso also shares sequence similarity to the zzso zzso finger of zzso including a zzso zzso required for zzso binding by zzso zzso of this zzso in the zzso zzso significantly zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and in zzso zzso activity, and partially zzso restoration of zzso C zzso We propose a model in which zzso via its zzso region, binds the zzso complex and, via its zzso recruits an zzso zzso for zzso of zzso
