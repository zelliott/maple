A gene coding for potato zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso which is found in zzso was isolated and zzso The deduced zzso product of this zzso sequence is 757 zzso acids long and has a molecular mass of zzso zzso It consists exclusively of eight closely related zzso with zzso identity of zzso Each repeated unit is zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso To date, no other member of this family has been found to contain so many inhibitor zzso in one zzso Eight zzso are proposed in the zzso zzso of zzso DNA coding for zzso one in each zzso zzso There is a family of 4 to 6 such large genes in zzso while in pea and zzso the zzso are much smaller, and probably code for zzso zzso zzso transcripts are abundant in zzso but scarce in undamaged leaves or stems of zzso zzso The zzso messages are derived from at least four genes (including the cloned zzso The pattern of gene zzso as well as the properties of the zzso suggest that zzso has a role in the plant's defense zzso
