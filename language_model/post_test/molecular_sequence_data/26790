zzso expressed human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the metabolism of approximately zzso of drugs in common clinical zzso It is widely accepted that zzso is localized in the zzso zzso of zzso however, we have identified this zzso in the zzso of human liver samples and found that extensive zzso zzso exists with respect to the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso show that the human liver zzso zzso is capable of zzso this zzso and that the zzso activity is supported by zzso electron transfer zzso In the present study, we show that zzso contains an zzso zzso signal that mediates its zzso targeting to the zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso import studies using both zzso deletions and point zzso suggest that the zzso targeting signal is localized between zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso at positions 24, 25, 26, 28 and 32 are required for zzso zzso The importance of the zzso zzso was confirmed by transient zzso of a zzso zzso targeting signal zzso in zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso from a zzso stable expression cell line contain the zzso and both zzso exhibit zzso zzso activity, which is completely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that the targeting of zzso to zzso could be an important zzso process that has significance in zzso zzso
