A new zzso of zzso zzso genetic elements is described with an estimated 40,000 to 100,000 members in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso known before as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are shown to represent zzso zzso the long terminal repeats of zzso elements related to zzso in zzso These zzso have structural similarities to zzso However, the putative product of a zzso base pair open reading frame detected in the consensus internal sequence of zzso does not resemble zzso zzso The elements are named zzso apparent zzso zzso The internal sequence is usually found to be zzso Their presence in zzso zzso zzso and zzso the divergence of the individual elements from their consensus, and the existence of a probably zzso element in mouse and man suggest that the first zzso were distributed before the radiation of zzso zzso zzso million years zzso zzso may prove to be very helpful in determining the evolutionary branching pattern of zzso orders and zzso
