zzso predisposition to multiple zzso is a genetically zzso zzso Recently, we have reported the identification of the zzso gene on human zzso zzso We have now isolated a zzso clone from a human adult lung zzso library and have determined the zzso organization and promoter structure of the zzso zzso The gene is composed of 11 zzso ranging from 90 to zzso zzso and spans approximately 350 zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the promoter region revealed the presence of a zzso island containing zzso and zzso boxes, but no zzso zzso Such a promoter is characteristic for zzso zzso This finding is in good agreement with the ubiquitous expression of the zzso zzso
