In chronic zzso C, relapses of liver disease occur in as many as 50% of patients responding to zzso zzso zzso Although the presence of serum zzso C virus zzso zzso at the end of therapy predicts a zzso its absence is not a reliable indicator of zzso In this study we have determined whether zzso to zzso zzso of liver chemistry and clearance of serum zzso zzso zzso in the liver and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and whether finding the zzso at these sites has zzso zzso 

After the conclusion of therapy, we tested for zzso in the liver of all the patients zzso 16 complete zzso with zzso of liver chemistry and clearance of serum zzso and five zzso In 13 of the 16 complete zzso we also tested for zzso in zzso Patients were followed up for 9 zzso 

Liver zzso was detected in each of the five zzso and in four of the 16 complete zzso zzso The viral zzso was detected in the zzso of six complete zzso zzso During follow-up a zzso of zzso C occurred in the 10 complete zzso with liver or zzso zzso but in only one zzso of the six complete zzso without zzso in liver or zzso 

Reliable information on the prognosis of chronic zzso C zzso can only be obtained by testing for zzso in serum, liver and zzso at the end of zzso Patients with zzso at any of these sites stand a high risk of disease zzso The risk is low but not abolished in patients without zzso zzso
