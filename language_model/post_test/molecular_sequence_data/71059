The zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso essential for resistance to the zzso zzso zzso While this zzso activity has been typically associated with zzso and zzso zzso we now report the identification of a zzso zzso in the zzso species zzso zzso The zzso zzso is only zzso identical to zzso but exhibits a similar zzso zzso it zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso designated zzso appears to have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer because zzso sequences were not detected in related bacterial species and the zzso content of the zzso region zzso is much lower than the overall zzso content of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso a zzso zzso was unable to use zzso as a sole carbon zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso activity upon zzso coli K-12 but did not allow growth on zzso The zzso protein zzso to the zzso space of zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso in zzso zzso
