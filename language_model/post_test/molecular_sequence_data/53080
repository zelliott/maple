A zzso zzso zzso sequence was determined for the zzso end of the zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso a yellow zzso virus infecting zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated from a approximately 22 zzso zzso zzso from zzso organ total zzso of zzso zzso The region contains a single gene zzso two long overlapping open reading zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso are structurally related to the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The 99 zzso overlap between zzso and zzso contains a putative zzso zzso sequence associated with zzso zzso zzso A 131 zzso zzso with the potential to form a complex zzso resides 3 zzso downstream of this zzso Although different to the zzso zzso sites and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso element also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso As in zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso domain located between two zzso zzso However, its sequence suggests some structural relationship to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso encodes zzso of the zzso zzso which among zzso viruses is unique to zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso intermediate and zzso and zzso zzso translated by zzso zzso suggests that zzso represents the first zzso member of the Order zzso
