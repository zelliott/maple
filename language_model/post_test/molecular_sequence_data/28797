The zzso protein zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso contains two highly zzso zzso zinc fingers and is involved in many crucial steps of the virus zzso A large number of zzso zzso of zzso involve its binding to zzso zzso acid zzso Several solution structures of zzso and its complex with zzso zzso or DNA have been zzso We have investigated the changes in the dynamic zzso experienced by the zzso zzso upon DNA binding using zzso zzso relaxation zzso at zzso K and 308 K, and zzso zzso The relaxation data were interpreted using the reduced spectral density approach, which allowed the zzso motion, overall tumbling rates and the zzso exchange contributions to be characterized for various states of the zzso without using a specific zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso correlation times derived from both zzso and zzso data indicated a zzso change of the molecular shape of zzso zzso around zzso K, leading to an increased zzso radius at higher zzso The binding of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso DNA led to a reduction of the zzso flexibility that characterized the zzso zzso zzso diffusion experiments as well as zzso correlation times indicated that the zzso complex tumbles as a rigid zzso The zzso of zzso motions were restrained in the complex and the occurrence of zzso exchange was displaced from the second zinc finger to the zzso zzso zzso
