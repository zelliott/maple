A synthetic gene for human zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso The protein has been zzso and zzso and has the same activity as natural human zzso using the zzso cell proliferation zzso The protein zzso specific zzso by a zzso zzso yielding two new zzso at zzso and zzso The truncated proteins retain full biological zzso The degradation results in the loss of sharp zzso zzso in the zzso spectrum, and little change to the ultraviolet CD zzso Several zzso acid type assignments could be made for these sharp zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso 15 zzso acids exist as a flexible, random zzso attached to a central zzso
