zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso of various peptides to produce zzso and zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and cardiovascular disease, and its proliferation depends on zzso of zzso We have expressed two zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, a truncated form with a zzso acid zzso deletion and the full-length form of zzso as predicted from the DNA zzso Both forms contain a zzso tag and zzso zzso at the zzso to aid in detection and zzso The activities and zzso of these two forms have been zzso zzso is cold zzso it zzso within 30 zzso at 4 degrees C, and optimal storage conditions are at 25 degrees C in the presence of a reducing zzso zzso is not a zzso and does not need a zzso for zzso or zzso Multiple zzso zzso various zzso zzso and free zzso were used to evaluate zzso specificity and determine kinetic zzso
