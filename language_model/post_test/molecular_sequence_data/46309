to better understand the zzso properties of zzso we have searched for small zzso active carbohydrates derived from intact zzso zzso 

using solid phase extraction coupled with zzso and mass zzso methods, we have characterized a low molecular weight zzso fraction associated with zzso zzso We have also tested the zzso of selected authentic zzso found in the zzso zzso 

the most abundant components of the low molecular weight zzso fraction were zzso and zzso with zzso amounts of zzso When authentic zzso were tested using zzso zzso zzso was zzso This activity was dependent upon the number of zzso zzso zzso and zzso To further test zzso properties, zzso was attached to glass cover zzso Although spontaneous zzso zzso was observed on unmodified and control surfaces, it was inhibited on zzso zzso 

zzso are associated with the zzso surface where they may exhibit zzso zzso
