zzso zzso were raised against a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso the segment zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and truncated zzso of zzso led us to identify the functional zzso reacting with zzso within the zzso portion zzso of zzso zzso studies combining secondary structure predictions, CD and zzso zzso together with zzso zzso showed that the greater is the propensity of the zzso for zzso formation the higher is the recognition by zzso Both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activities against zzso In contrast, neither zzso a zzso analog of zzso that presents a zzso around zzso but with intact zzso zzso nor the truncated zzso encompassing the zzso were zzso of zzso While the activity of zzso is restricted to recognition of the sole zzso portion, that of the zzso zzso likely requires interactions of the zzso with the whole zzso segment in the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Actually, of all tested peptides only zzso was found to fulfill condition of minimal number of zzso zzso to achieve the formation of a stable zzso structure with the IN zzso zzso The binding of zzso and of the zzso zzso to this segment of IN zzso the binding of IN to its DNA zzso in zzso zzso This appears to be the main effect leading to zzso of zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso indicates that two zzso molecules react with IN zzso that the zzso is zzso within these experimental zzso Together, present data provide an insight into the zzso relationship for the zzso zzso domain of the zzso They also strongly suggest that the functional zzso is zzso zzso could help to assess models for binding of zzso fragments to IN and to develop stronger zzso Moreover, zzso zzso when expressed in zzso might exhibit useful zzso zzso
