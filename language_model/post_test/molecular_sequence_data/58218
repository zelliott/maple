The zzso class II zzso * zzso zzso is present at a higher frequency in patients with zzso melanoma than in Caucasian zzso Furthermore, zzso * zzso identifies a group of melanoma patients presenting with relatively advanced disease, and independently identifies a group of melanoma patients more likely to have disease zzso A rapid screening test for zzso * zzso may be useful in clinical research involving melanoma zzso Standard molecular zzso for zzso class II zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso specific zzso zzso method is relatively expensive, zzso and involves the use of zzso We therefore developed an zzso zzso zzso method using zzso zzso peripheral whole blood as the zzso and strictly defined reaction conditions in a zzso zzso to allow determination of the presence or absence of zzso zzso * zzso zzso of the zzso zzso method with standard zzso zzso on 63 blinded samples from Caucasian melanoma patients demonstrated complete agreement between the two methods in the detection of zzso * zzso zzso testing in 456 additional cancer patients and healthy controls showed a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso zzso zzso is accurate, zzso zzso and does not require zzso These advantages make it the procedure of choice for screening melanoma patients and others for the presence of the zzso * zzso zzso
