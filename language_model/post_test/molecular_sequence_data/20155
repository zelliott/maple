We describe an efficient method for generating new zzso insertions in the zzso of zzso hybrid zzso zzso derived from crosses between transgenic helper and donor zzso zzso strains carried single zzso elements zzso zzso zzso The donor strain carried a single zzso element inserted into an zzso zzso expanding the zzso zzso zzso green fluorescent zzso reporter expression domain to include zzso zzso of the donor element is accompanied by loss of muscle zzso but retention of eye zzso In a pilot screen, the zzso donor was zzso in zzso of the hybrid zzso generating hundreds of new zzso zzso zzso and other zzso The zzso system described zzso makes zzso zzso zzso zzso a realistic goal in this zzso zzso
