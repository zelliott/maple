Severe structural constraints in the zzso A virus zzso zzso have been suggested as the reason for the lack of emergence of new zzso in spite of the occurrence of complex zzso of zzso or zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso under immune pressure by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso has revealed different evolutionary zzso zzso composed of complex ensembles of zzso with very low fitness or single dominant zzso with high fitness permit the acquisition of resistance to each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected as components of the zzso zzso up to 61 zzso with an average of 19, and up to 83 zzso with an average of 45, in zzso and zzso zzso zzso A clear negative selection of those replacements affecting the zzso zzso by rare zzso of the zzso surface has been detected through the present zzso analysis, confirming a certain beneficial role of such zzso Since these clusters are located near or at the zzso regions, the need to maintain such clusters might prevent the emergence of new zzso
