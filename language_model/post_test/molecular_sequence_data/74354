This study reports the zzso gene presence and zzso in members of the zzso tuberculosis complex, and zzso the zzso zzso putative membrane protein in zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso derived peptides were zzso and their zzso and zzso cell binding ability was tested, finding five high activity binding peptides zzso for zzso and five for zzso Only two zzso zzso and zzso were shared by both cell lines, both of which affected zzso zzso invading ability to target cells, thus indicating an important role for these sequences in zzso tuberculosis entry to zzso zzso zzso cells and supporting their inclusion in further studies on the development of a zzso zzso chemically zzso zzso zzso
