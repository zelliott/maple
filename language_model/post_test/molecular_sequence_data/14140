zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso episodes zzso and zzso zzso with red ragged fibers zzso are associated with distinct zzso point zzso (for review see zzso zzso for example, is related to at least 14 zzso point zzso within different zzso zzso respiratory zzso zzso In addition, the number of newly found zzso zzso is zzso In the light of the large number and the dispersed distribution of these point zzso throughout the zzso zzso screening for these by sequencing all of suspected zzso is zzso and zzso In order to facilitate a rapid screening for zzso point zzso we have evaluated the use of zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso zzso for the analysis of the human zzso zzso 

In a first evaluation step we created a variety of zzso clones derived from zzso control region zzso with defined sequence differences and zzso These clones were used as standard material for an zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was then applied to large zzso of patients with known, zzso zzso zzso point zzso and to healthy controls in order to evaluate its zzso 

The most common zzso zzso point zzso at zzso positions zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected by zzso analysis, as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso associated point zzso Several new zzso and point zzso were zzso A sensitivity, zzso the ability to detect defined point zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was achieved when comparing zzso and direct sequencing zzso 

The zzso approach using a zzso silver zzso method is suited for the detection of human zzso point zzso as well as a helpful screening tool for novel zzso DNA zzso
