Type IX collagen in cartilage consists of molecules composed of three genetically distinct zzso zzso One of the zzso alpha zzso contains a zzso attached zzso side chain whereas a second zzso alpha zzso contains a large zzso zzso domain called zzso In this report, we describe for the first time the complete primary structure of this zzso domain, based on cloning and sequencing of zzso and zzso DNA as well as zzso acid sequencing of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso clones has also allowed determination of the zzso structure of zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain of alpha zzso chains contains zzso zzso acid zzso (including the signal zzso with 5 zzso zzso forming two zzso zzso The domain is basic with an estimated zzso of zzso thus supporting the idea that it may participate in zzso interactions with zzso zzso in zzso Both the sequence and zzso structure of the zzso domain is unique among zzso and there is no obvious zzso with the zzso zzso of other types of zzso including the zzso of zzso zzso
