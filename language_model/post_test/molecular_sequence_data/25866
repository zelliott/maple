Using a probe derived from the human zzso zzso gene zzso a strongly zzso clone was identified from a rat zzso DNA zzso This clone zzso had an overall deduced zzso acid sequence that was zzso zzso with that of the human zzso zzso There was only an zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso with the rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso appears to be an excellent candidate for the rat zzso zzso zzso As this manuscript was being prepared a report by Albert et zzso zzso was published in which a probe to the zzso beta zzso zzso was used to identify a rat zzso zzso zzso that demonstrated a sequence that was similar to zzso
