zzso is zzso zzso zzso in size and bordered by 22 zzso imperfect zzso repeats zzso A zzso target sequence is duplicated upon zzso zzso The DNA strand that zzso encodes the zzso zzso carries three open reading frames zzso designated zzso to 3, which specify putative proteins of zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso According to its structural zzso zzso belongs to the recently proposed zzso family of IS zzso The zzso to 3 zzso putative proteins displayed significant similarities to zzso of the previously zzso IS element zzso which is inserted adjacent to the locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso island of zzso coli zzso zzso of the distribution of zzso in a natural zzso zzso population showed its widespread occurrence in zzso of the strains tested with a copy number ranging from 1 to zzso
