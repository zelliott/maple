Previously, we described a zzso zzso heavy chain variable zzso gene restriction in zzso zzso The zzso protein (a component of the zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso target in certain systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso Here we examined the effect of zzso zzso acids in the heavy chain zzso determining region 3 zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on binding to the zzso zzso A zzso display library was constructed using the zzso zzso domain with four zzso zzso zzso and our results showed that a high frequency zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso library were able to bind the zzso zzso This corroborates our previous finding that this zzso domain provides an appropriate structure for zzso zzso although the nature of the zzso zzso appears crucial in determining whether or not this zzso domain binds zzso After two rounds of selection zzso zzso show a consensus sequence in their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which X is an zzso zzso This consensus is partially present in an zzso which was derived from an zzso patient indicating that this consensus, to some extent, is also followed in zzso zzso which match the consensus sequence obtained up to zzso higher affinities compared with the original zzso illustrating the importance of the zzso zzso zzso in determining the affinity of these zzso
