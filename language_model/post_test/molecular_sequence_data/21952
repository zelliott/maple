zzso infectious anemia virus zzso envelope variation produces newly dominant zzso with each sequential disease zzso new populations zzso and previous plasma zzso including the original zzso become zzso The question remains whether these ancestral zzso exist in tissue reservoirs or if the immune system eliminates zzso from persistent zzso To examine this, an zzso long-term zzso carrier was immune suppressed with zzso zzso suppression resulted in increased plasma viral loads by approximately zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suppression populations demonstrated continual envelope evolution and revealed novel zzso distinct from defined populations from previous disease zzso Analysis of the tissue and plasma populations zzso suppression indicated the original infectious zzso and early populations were zzso zzso the host immune system apparently eliminated a diverse array of zzso zzso but viral persistence was maintained by relentless evolution of new envelope populations from tissue reservoirs in response to ongoing immune zzso
