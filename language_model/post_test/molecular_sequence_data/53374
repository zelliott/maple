The zzso zzso zzso zzso several cell cycle zzso zzso the entry of zzso cells into S zzso This activity is zzso in part by association of zzso with the pocket proteins and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso protein is able to promote zzso In this study we demonstrate that the ability to induce zzso is a common property of zzso belonging to both benign and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso whilst zzso of the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso is not sufficient to trigger zzso Moreover, we show that certain point zzso in the zzso region 1 zzso of zzso zzso abolish the induction of zzso without altering the ability to stimulate S zzso Thus, these two zzso cellular events, zzso and S phase entry, can be separated in immortalized zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is not required for its ability to drive zzso cells into S phase and to induce zzso Finally, expression of zzso proteins in zzso which lack a functional zzso does not lead to zzso zzso indicating that the zzso impacts upon additional cellular pathways to promote zzso
