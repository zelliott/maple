In the Ewing family of tumors zzso the zzso gene is rearranged with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso locations is the source of significant zzso in fusion product zzso As a consequence of zzso included zzso sequences from the two partner zzso a variable amount of additional zzso sequence is inserted in between the minimal transforming zzso Some of this molecular diversity has recently been correlated with disparate clinical zzso Here we report on cryptic zzso found in the zzso zzso of three zzso with different zzso zzso In two tumors, the emergence of a cryptic zzso from zzso zzso 5 in the zzso zzso was apparently unrelated to the zzso zzso that occurred in zzso zzso 4 and 5, zzso In one case, a novel zzso was generated through the creation of an artificial zzso zzso site in zzso zzso 6 by the zzso zzso that occurred in zzso zzso zzso These results further extend the spectrum of molecular diversity in zzso
