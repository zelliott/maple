The inability of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso den zzso zzso Cool, zzso zzso Horn, zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso 15, zzso prompted us to study possible fundamental differences in the way zzso interacts with zzso compared with the interaction of Ras with the zzso domain of the mouse Ras zzso zzso exchange factor zzso A variety of zzso in both Ras and zzso were zzso and both the zzso and zzso zzso release of zzso zzso from these zzso was zzso In addition, we could identify regions in zzso that are responsible for the lack of recognition by zzso and induce high zzso activity by replacement of these zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso The different Ras and zzso zzso showed that many zzso were equally important for both zzso and zzso suggesting that they interact similarly with their zzso However, several zzso were also identified to be important for the exchange reaction with only zzso zzso or only zzso zzso and zzso These results are discussed in the light of the structure of the zzso complex and suggest that some important differences in the interaction of zzso with zzso and Ras with zzso indeed exist and that marker zzso have been identified for the different structural zzso
