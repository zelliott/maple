zzso fertility and associated nitrogen zzso status was a key zzso attribute, and surveys of zzso zzso zzso communities via zzso zzso bodies could provide an effective zzso indicator of forest soil zzso We explored the utility of zzso zzso communities in this regard by surveying zzso over a zzso period from contrasting plant associations of southern zzso zzso forests of British Columbia zzso zzso richness ranged from 39 to 89 zzso species per plot zzso zzso and followed a skewed zzso correlation with zzso N zzso and soil N zzso zzso species composition was consistently distinct in zzso and strongly correlated to the increasing rates of N zzso aligned with soil zzso zzso 40 zzso species were specialists, as they collectively indicated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while the remaining species were zzso as broadly tolerant zzso over zzso of the N zzso partially intolerant zzso zzso or satellites zzso The functional organization of zzso communities reflected by distribution classes could help define the ecological integrity of forests, which was characterized in this zzso landscape by an average zzso of 20 broadly tolerant, 25 partially zzso 15 zzso and ten satellite species per zzso zzso zzso bodies provided a disparate yet complementary view to the zzso assessment of zzso communities that was valuable in identifying indicators for zzso zzso
