A zzso carrying a zzso zzso of DNA from zzso zzso strain zzso has been isolated which was able to increase the zzso resistance of zzso coli zzso The increase in resistance was dependent on the presence of a zzso protein with a molecular weight of approximately zzso the product of a zzso fusion between a gene on the zzso zzso and the insert zzso An overlapping region of the zzso zzso carrying the entire gene zzso zzso was zzso and a zzso zzso carrying the gene was also able to increase zzso resistance in zzso zzso A protein with a molecular weight of approximately 40,000 was zzso by the zzso DNA contained in zzso This zzso was not able to complement a zzso in the gene for zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, and modification of zzso by zzso coli cells containing the zzso could not be zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso DNA contained an open reading frame able to zzso a protein with a calculated molecular weight of zzso
