zzso zzso of proteins of unknown function most zzso assists with assignment of zzso activity when the new structure resembles that of proteins whose functions are zzso When a new fold is revealed, the universe of known folds is zzso and once the function is determined by other means, novel zzso relationships are zzso The previously zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso provides a hybrid example of these two zzso It is a member of a microbial protein family, labeled in zzso as zzso and zzso The crystal structure at zzso A resolution reported here reveals a fold that is only remotely related to the zzso fold, in particular to zzso and thus is not sufficiently similar to imply that zzso proteins are zzso binding zzso However, a zzso that may accommodate a small zzso is zzso The putative binding site contains only one zzso zzso zzso which carries a functional group that could play a role in zzso indicating that zzso is probably not an zzso zzso sequence analysis, including a number of newly zzso microbial organisms, highlights sequence zzso to an zzso domain in zzso zzso zzso from zzso a domain whose function is zzso A zzso model of the zzso domain shows that it should also contain the putative binding zzso Being part of a zzso zzso the zzso domain is likely to be involved in zzso zzso with possible roles in zzso or editing of zzso By zzso zzso may also play a role in zzso or zzso zzso the nature of which is yet to be zzso
