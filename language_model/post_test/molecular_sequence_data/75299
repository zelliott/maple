The zzso acid sequence of alcohol zzso of class III from rat liver (the zzso zzso has been zzso This type of structure is quite different from those of both the class I and the class II alcohol zzso The rat class III structure differs from the rat and human class I structures by zzso zzso zzso value depending on species and zzso zzso and from that of human class II by 132 zzso In contrast, the zzso species difference within the class III zzso is only 21 zzso The protein was zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by exclusion zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso were analyzed by degradation with a zzso zzso and with the manual zzso zzso zzso The protein chain has zzso zzso with a blocked N zzso No evidence was obtained for zzso The rat zzso zzso of class III contains an zzso of zzso at position 60 in relation to the class I zzso while the latter alcohol zzso in rat zzso has another zzso zzso (at position zzso relative to zzso The structure deduced explains the characteristic differences of the class III alcohol zzso in relation to the other classes of alcohol zzso including a high zzso an zzso zzso mobility and special kinetic zzso The main zzso acid zzso are found in the zzso domain and in the zzso interacting segments of the zzso domain, the latter explaining the lack of hybrid zzso between zzso of different zzso Several zzso provide an enlarged and more zzso zzso pocket, which appears compatible with a higher water content in the pocket and hence could possibly explain the higher zzso for all zzso as compared with the corresponding values for the class I zzso Finally the class III structure supports evolutionary relationships suggesting that the three classes constitute clearly separate zzso within the group of zzso zzso alcohol zzso
