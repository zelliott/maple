De zzso sequencing of a full-length zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso is zzso Using a combination of overlapping complementary zzso and chemical zzso with analysis by mass zzso and zzso degradation, both the heavy and light chains were fully zzso zzso attention was paid to those modifications that could be susceptible to degradation in the zzso determining region and zzso zzso An overview of the protocol is zzso and suggestions for improvements to aid in such sequencing projects in the future are zzso
