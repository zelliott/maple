zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed at high levels in the adrenal cortex, where it is required for the synthesis of zzso and zzso In this study, we have investigated the regulatory elements in the zzso promoter region which contribute to the expression of this gene in zzso zzso zzso Eight potential regulatory elements in the zzso region of the zzso gene were identified by zzso I zzso and gel mobility shift zzso Some of these zzso were produced by nuclear extracts from many cell lines, whereas other interactions were seen only when using nuclear extracts from zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso of most of the elements markedly decreased the expression of a zzso gene zzso into zzso cells, thus documenting their functional importance for zzso Moreover, zzso containing the sequences of two related elements at zzso and zzso which share the zzso zzso increased the activity of a zzso promoter in a zzso zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells requires interactions among multiple zzso elements and regulatory zzso
