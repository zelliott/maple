zzso have attracted enormous attention because of their potent zzso effects and dynamic evolution, including the zzso recruitment of zzso genes for zzso zzso Here we provide novel evidence for the recruitment of genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Ion Transport zzso zzso zzso for zzso expression in black widow zzso We characterized zzso peptides from zzso zzso zzso from the Western black widow zzso zzso zzso the brown widow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of these sequences with zzso from other spider, scorpion and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso show zzso as derived members of the zzso zzso These analyses suggest that zzso zzso are more widespread in zzso zzso and were recruited for zzso expression in two additional zzso zzso We also found that the zzso 2 gene and nearly all zzso genes include a phase 2 zzso in the same position, supporting zzso placement within the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso suggest episodes of positive selection along some sequence zzso and positive and zzso selection on specific zzso supporting its functional importance in widow zzso We consider how this improved understanding of zzso evolution informs functional hypotheses regarding its role in black widow zzso as well as its potential zzso recruitment for zzso expression across zzso
