zzso controls germ cell fates in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is a zzso zzso element binding zzso zzso similar proteins from other species have been shown to bind zzso zzso and regulate their zzso Our analyses of zzso zzso indicate that each of the three zzso zzso of zzso is essential for zzso In addition, zzso tests show that zzso is capable of binding zzso sequences in the zzso region of its own zzso Finally, genetic zzso reveal that zzso functions zzso that the small zzso transcript has no zzso function, and that zzso zzso in zzso cause a dominant negative zzso This last observation suggests that zzso acts in a complex, or as a zzso to regulate zzso On the basis of these data, we propose that zzso binds zzso to regulate germ cell fates and that it does so by controlling the translation of its zzso One of these targets might be the zzso transcript zzso
