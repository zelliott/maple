An zzso zzso library was used to determine the zzso parameters that define zzso zzso zzso zzso interact with zzso by binding zzso zzso The zzso used in this study, zzso is derived from the zzso zzso which is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the variations in specificity and affinity that drive molecular zzso zzso and salt concentration dependence studies demonstrate that the zzso effect is the primary driving force, consistent with zzso zzso being required for zzso An zzso effect was observed in only two complexes where the zzso was adjacent to an zzso The large change in heat capacity determined for the specific complex suggests that the dehydrated zzso interface forms a tightly bound, zzso complex with the target zzso These explorations into the zzso driving forces that zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions improve our understanding of how individual zzso work in zzso Furthermore, this work will permit the development of hypotheses regarding how the native zzso and the broader class of zzso zzso directs zzso zzso zzso complexes to specific zzso sites in zzso
