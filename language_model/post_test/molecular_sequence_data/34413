The zzso regulates expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso by binding to zzso and thereby promoting zzso zzso We characterized the structure of the zzso zzso domain by zzso zzso and compared the zzso to the zzso domain of the closely related zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso the extra zzso unit of the zzso by forming a more relaxed binding pocket than these found in the zzso zzso zzso structures of the zzso bound to zzso and of the zzso bound to zzso exhibit very similar features, although the sequence of the zzso contains several zzso compared to the zzso consensus zzso These zzso include the zzso of a hairpin loop which is crucial for complex formation in all zzso zzso characterized to zzso We further defined structural features and zzso binding requirements of the free zzso and found that the presence of zzso is not essential for complex formation, but zzso zzso binding by promoting zzso of key structural motifs in the free zzso
