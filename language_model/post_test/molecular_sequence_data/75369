A zzso zzso zzso sequence complementary to zzso zzso zzso tumor virus zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared using zzso zzso produced by the zzso cell line, which had been established from a spontaneous zzso tumor of zzso zzso It was found, by using this zzso in Southern zzso experiments, that zzso was zzso to this animal and that some 50 copies of zzso zzso were present per zzso cellular zzso In addition, a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso long zzso was cloned from a zzso cell zzso library, and its long terminal repeat was found to be zzso base pairs zzso long, with the zzso and zzso regions zzso and 146 zzso long, zzso The boundary between zzso and R was not determined with zzso though in the zzso the zzso and R regions were zzso and 105 zzso long, zzso The overall zzso between the zzso regions in the zzso and zzso was zzso These two zzso differed in such zzso regulatory signals as zzso and zzso the first being missing from the zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso zzso showed that the long terminal repeats of the zzso and the zzso were zzso active but not steroid hormone zzso Like zzso monkey virus, zzso used zzso as a primer for reverse zzso In addition, the zzso zzso sequence common to many zzso was found in the zzso region of zzso In these two points, zzso differed from mouse zzso
