A new zzso zzso from the new zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso and its zzso acid sequence from zzso A to G was determined using zzso zzso Two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso loop segment, a series of six zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso segment and most of the zzso near the Schiff base of the retinal were found to be zzso in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso This result strongly suggests that these zzso are essential for zzso pumping function in zzso The zzso zzso zzso have shown that the selectivity of zzso transport between zzso and nitrate in zzso zzso is lower than that of zzso zzso but higher than that of zzso zzso The number of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso loop segments is different in each zzso and it zzso with their zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the length of the zzso segment affects the selectivity of zzso transport in zzso
