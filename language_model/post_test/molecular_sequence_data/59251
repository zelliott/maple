zzso zzso zzso that were unable to zzso zzso zzso for zzso synthesis were zzso Two of them carried zzso zzso zzso in a same gene and were defective in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso In an zzso zzso that also carried the zzso zzso zzso accounted for less than zzso of total zzso suggesting the importance of zzso in zzso zzso By screening a zzso library on a low copy number zzso three complementary clones of different size were zzso A zzso common DNA region carried an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso in zzso of which a truncated from failed to complement the zzso zzso This zzso was identical to the previously isolated zzso gene of unknown zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence had significant similarity to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The entire ORF, when combined with the zzso zzso gene and expressed in zzso coli, exhibited zzso zzso These results indicate that the cloned gene encodes a zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso
