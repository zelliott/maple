zzso is a key zzso in the last step of the zzso zzso zzso Loss of function of zzso can often result in complete yellow or zzso zzso in many zzso Here, we report the characterization of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso showing zzso zzso striped leaves in young zzso The yellow bands of the zzso have decreased levels of zzso and zzso with delayed zzso zzso Low temperature suppressed zzso zzso while alternate zzso cycle or high temperature enlarged the yellow zzso zzso cloning demonstrated that zzso encodes the zzso protein with a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso resulted in complete zzso zzso that are aborted in a few weeks, confirming that zzso is important in the early stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed and its expression subject to a zzso zzso dark cycle zzso Our results suggest that the less effective or unstable zzso in zzso zzso together with its zzso zzso are mechanistically accounted for the zebra zzso The increased zzso zzso in the leaves of zzso at the late development stage may explain the restoration of zzso zzso in mature zzso
