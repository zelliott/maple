An in zzso zzso zzso has been used to define twelve high occupancy zzso zzso sites in 260 zzso of zzso DNA on three zzso DNA zzso zzso proceeded to immediately upstream of zzso sequences in nine of these sites, and this defines the most preferred zzso site as zzso In almost all cases, this sequence was flanked by T on the zzso zzso The consensus sequence for the highest affinity zzso site is therefore zzso with some evidence for preference of AT base pairs zzso both ends of this zzso zzso zzso In contrast, lower occupancy zzso sites were flanked on the zzso end by a zzso base pair, with a preference for up to three zzso base pairs on the 3' zzso The low affinity consensus sequence is therefore zzso
