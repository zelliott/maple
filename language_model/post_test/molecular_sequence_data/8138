The zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso zzso by genes residing on human and mouse zzso 21 and 10 zzso zzso DNA regions upstream of the zzso zzso spanning zzso and zzso of human and mouse zzso zzso gene were zzso and zzso The zzso zzso region of both genes featured a zzso island containing zzso zzso zzso The first 120 zzso preceding the zzso are highly zzso displaying zzso of sequence similarity between human and mouse zzso While this region lacks zzso and zzso boxes it contains four zzso binding sites and was capable of promoting a non regulated expression of the reporter gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additional zzso elements were found further upstream at the zzso of both the human and mouse zzso They consisted of two zzso repeats and several sequence motifs known to serve as zzso factors binding zzso
