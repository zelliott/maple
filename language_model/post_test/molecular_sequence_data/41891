zzso The zzso approach, based on the expression of selected zzso zzso by cells of the nervous system, has recently been described zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In order to apply this experimental strategy to study the role of nerve growth factor zzso in the central nervous system zzso we exploited the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso which zzso very efficiently the biological activity of zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso The alpha zzso zzso chains were cloned and expressed in zzso cells as zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso was shown to display all the properties of the parental alpha zzso zzso including its ability to neutralize zzso biological zzso zzso This will allow us to engineer the expression of zzso alpha zzso zzso in the zzso to study the role of zzso in the developing and adult nervous zzso This approach can be extended to other zzso factors for which zzso zzso zzso are zzso
