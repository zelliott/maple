The zzso stabilizing factor zzso is involved in the zzso regulation of many zzso including that coding for zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso interference technology and zzso D experiments, we demonstrate that in human zzso cells zzso the amplification of zzso zzso by zzso II zzso occurs via a zzso increase of zzso zzso Using zzso promoter zzso with different portions of the 3' untranslated region of zzso we found that the increase in zzso zzso stability is attributable to a zzso class III type of zzso element zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso binding of zzso to this zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso assembly with zzso zzso is found in free and zzso zzso indicative of an active zzso zzso zzso the increased zzso binding to zzso by zzso is accompanied by increased zzso zzso shuttling and depends on protein zzso zzso zzso which physically interacts with nuclear zzso thereby promoting its zzso zzso of zzso sites identified zzso 221 and zzso as critical target sites for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso export to the zzso zzso modification of zzso by zzso represents an important novel mode of zzso zzso implied in zzso zzso zzso
