The zzso zzso zzso termed cell zzso element zzso cycle regulatory element zzso cycle zzso region zzso control the zzso zzso of the zzso A, zzso zzso zzso Here, we have identified a functional element displaying the signature of the zzso in the promoter of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein family zzso protein zzso This element locates close to the major zzso start site where it makes major groove contacts with proteins that can be detected in a cellular context using in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso or zzso sequence strongly zzso the zzso promoter activity in zzso growing cells, a situation where zzso zzso gene expression is almost zzso zzso mobility shift zzso suggest that two different protein complexes bind independently to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that the zzso bound to the zzso might be related to those bound on zzso A and zzso zzso
