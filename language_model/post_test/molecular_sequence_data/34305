zzso is a critical regulator of multiple signaling zzso including those activated by zzso that regulate zzso H chain class switching to zzso Analysis of mice with zzso in the zzso gene demonstrated that zzso levels increase with loss of zzso zzso This suggested that overall zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso expression in zzso A genetic association study was performed in zzso children enrolled in the Tucson Children's Respiratory Study to determine if genetic variation in the zzso locus zzso with altered levels of zzso zzso of the zzso for a novel, 3' zzso single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to have significantly lower levels of serum zzso compared with those of zzso for the zzso Analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso C zzso was in complete linkage zzso with an zzso at position zzso zzso T zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at the zzso zzso T were also found to be associated with the decreased zzso The promoter zzso increased zzso activity of the zzso promoter in reporter zzso and human B zzso zzso with this zzso the presence of this zzso within the promoter abolished binding of zzso zzso which is identified as a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that genetic variation in the zzso promoter may affect zzso zzso
