The identity and zzso of a group of zzso zzso zzso rods attached to zzso bacteria in activated sludge from zzso removal plants were investigated by using the zzso zzso approach combined with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso group consists of three closely related zzso each containing 11 to 16 zzso The closest related cultured isolate is the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the family zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at different zzso levels were designed for each cluster and used for zzso zzso All three clusters behaved similarly in their physiology and were specialized in protein zzso and used zzso acids as energy and carbon zzso They were not involved in zzso No storage of zzso and zzso was zzso They all zzso zzso zzso bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso zzso and candidate zzso zzso with the exception of cluster 1, which did not colonize zzso zzso The three zzso clusters were all widespread in domestic and industrial wastewater treatment plants with or without biological zzso zzso zzso in total, up to zzso of the bacterial zzso A new zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this zzso group in zzso treatment plants, where it presumably plays an important role in protein zzso
