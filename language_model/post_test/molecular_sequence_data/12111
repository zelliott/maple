zzso protein beta and gamma zzso belong to large protein families encompassing at least five and ten members, respectively, from zzso zzso The formation of stable beta gamma zzso is a selective process determined by the primary sequences of both the beta and gamma zzso For example, gamma 2 zzso with both beta 1 and beta 2, gamma 1 with beta 1, but not with beta zzso To identify the structural elements of gamma zzso relevant to the selectivity of beta gamma zzso we have used the zzso zzso system to produce zzso beta and gamma zzso and have studied their zzso using an zzso based on the ability of zzso gamma zzso zzso to draw beta zzso into the zzso and including zzso density zzso analysis of soluble zzso beta gamma zzso The results show that replacement of three consecutive zzso of gamma 1, zzso by the corresponding zzso of gamma 2, zzso zzso to render the zzso gamma 1 zzso capable of forming zzso with beta zzso The ability of zzso gamma 1 zzso to zzso with beta 2 does not correlate with the probability of the zzso region to participate in zzso zzso The zzso region identified here as a critical zzso of the selectivity of beta gamma zzso formation is distinct from, but partially zzso with, the region reported by Lee et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this study, therefore, not only extend the region of gamma 1 selecting between beta 1 and beta 2 to the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso but also argue against the notion that the zzso terminal zzso of this motif represents the key zzso of selective beta gamma zzso
