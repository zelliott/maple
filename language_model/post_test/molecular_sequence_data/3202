The zzso intermediate of zzso from the human zzso virus zzso is the target for two classes of fusion zzso that bind to the zzso region or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby preventing formation of the zzso zzso of zzso Using rational design, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were derived from the parent zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso and CD, and assessed for their ability to inhibit zzso fusion using a quantitative zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso contains nine zzso acid zzso designed to disrupt interactions with the zzso region of zzso while preserving contacts governing the formation of the zzso zzso zzso contains nine zzso designed to block formation of the zzso zzso but retains zzso that interact with the zzso region of zzso zzso is zzso is largely random zzso does not interact with the zzso zzso derived from the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso and does not inhibit zzso The zzso zzso structure is therefore a prerequisite for interaction with the zzso region of zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso zzso in solution, does not interact with zzso and yet zzso fusion about zzso more effectively than the parent zzso zzso zzso approximately 308 zzso versus approximately 16 zzso These results indicate that zzso acts by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso intermediate to form zzso Thus zzso represents a novel third class of zzso zzso fusion zzso A quantitative model describing the interaction of zzso with the zzso intermediate is zzso
