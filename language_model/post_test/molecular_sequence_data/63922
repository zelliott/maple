A zzso zzso DNA sequence coding for zzso disease virus zzso zzso protein complex zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso was genetically fused to the zzso end of a zzso zzso zzso toxin B zzso zzso gene with the similar synonymous zzso preferred by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The fusion gene was zzso based on a zzso chain reaction zzso and subsequently zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein was successfully zzso into the culture medium (up to zzso and retained the zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso The zzso after zzso through zzso zzso column bound specifically to zzso zzso zzso and thus retained the biological activity of zzso This study has important implications in the construction of zzso zzso for zzso vaccines against zzso
