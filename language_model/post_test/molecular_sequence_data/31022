A zzso form of zzso zzso which has three of its four zzso essential zzso zzso replaced by zzso zzso zzso has been constructed and used for zzso zzso With disruption of the zzso binding site, the zzso zzso is devoid of zzso zzso zzso However, it appears to fold properly since it binds zzso normally and exhibits very tight binding of zzso zzso as is seen with the zzso zzso This zzso zzso allows quantitative zzso of two species thought to function as zzso in the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso reduces the zzso in this zzso and a stabilized zzso form zzso The second intermediate is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso accumulated by reaction of oxidized zzso zzso with zzso The conversion of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso and the elevated zzso of zzso zzso vs zzso in wild zzso have permitted detection of these zzso at low pH zzso The rates of formation of zzso and the breakdown of the zzso zzso zzso have been measured and indicate that both zzso are zzso competent for both the reductive zzso and turnover by zzso zzso These results validate the general proposal that electrons flow from zzso to zzso to zzso zzso to the zzso form that accumulates as the zzso form in the reductive zzso for this class of zzso
