We have generated zzso zzso zzso mice expressing the genes for human zzso 3, zzso stimulating factor, and stem cell zzso We have compared zzso and differentiation of human zzso cells in transgenic zzso mice with two strains of zzso zzso zzso Human bone zzso cells carrying the zzso zzso or human zzso zzso blood were injected into zzso zzso zzso Human DNA was detected by zzso chain reaction in peripheral blood and bone zzso of 14 of 28 transgenic zzso mice after zzso but in only 2 of 15 zzso zzso zzso at a zzso lower zzso Bone zzso cultures 8 zzso after transplantation of zzso blood gave rise to human zzso unit zzso zzso unit zzso or zzso zzso zzso was observed for up to 6 zzso in transgenic zzso mice, twice as long as zzso zzso or previous studies in which transplanted zzso mice were given daily injections of growth zzso We conclude that the level and duration of zzso of human cells in zzso mice can be improved by expression of human zzso zzso and that transgenic zzso mice are an efficient model system for the study of human zzso
