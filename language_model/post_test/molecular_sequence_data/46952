zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso signaling factor that mediates various signals, zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso is activated through zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso the extent of the involvement of zzso in various aspects of animal development, we searched for a zzso zzso which responds to elevated zzso activity and zzso identified a lace zzso zzso with mild lace zzso grow to become adults with multiple zzso zzso in the zzso compound eye, and zzso These aberrations were suppressed by elevated zzso zzso zzso and transgenic analyses of the lace zzso have revealed that the lace gene product is a membrane protein similar to the zzso protein zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso which zzso the first step of zzso zzso In fact, zzso activity in the fly expressing zzso zzso was absorbed by zzso zzso The number of dead cells in various zzso discs of a lace zzso was considerably increased, thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso These results account for the adult zzso of the lace zzso and suppression of the zzso by elevated zzso activity: we zzso that zzso of lace causes decreased de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso some of which are signaling zzso and one or more of these changes activates zzso to elicit zzso The zzso zzso may be zzso to the zzso zzso in the control of cell zzso
