Acute zzso zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso generates a zzso alpha zzso gene which is transcribed as a fusion zzso alpha zzso To clarify the zzso role of zzso alpha in zzso patients, we examined the expression of zzso alpha in zzso colonies in five patients with zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso By the zzso zzso method, we demonstrated that zzso alpha positive clones were present in zzso cells including both zzso and zzso in two zzso This result suggests that the zzso of zzso alpha occurred in a zzso stem cell in some zzso zzso In four patients we detected two amplified zzso fragments of zzso and 640 zzso which presumably arose by alternative zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, of zzso and zzso colonies examined in four patients, there were three different types of zzso those expressing only the zzso zzso fragment, those expressing only the 640 zzso fragment, and those expressing both zzso This suggests that alternative zzso was zzso determined in each zzso We describe a useful zzso technique for the study of gene expression in a limited number of zzso precursor zzso
