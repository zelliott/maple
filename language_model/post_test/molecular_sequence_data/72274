With the use of the principal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso that specifically bound synthetic peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso were studied in 350 serum specimens from Japanese with zzso A who had been injected with known unheated factor VIII concentrates until 1985 and had been infected with zzso zzso zzso These zzso were not found in any of the zzso zzso of zzso patients with zzso diseases, or normal healthy zzso Further, all zzso rapidly progressing to AIDS and death among the 95 zzso in a restricted zzso area had zzso zzso of less than 20 and their low levels preceded the rapid progression to the disease zzso In contrast, slowly progressing zzso maintained an zzso zzso of more than 100 from the initial stages of viral infection and remained zzso zzso analysis of the zzso regions of zzso indicated that the zzso who maintained a high zzso zzso level showed a zzso MN zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso showed sequence changes in the zzso zzso of zzso The dynamic of the serum zzso zzso zzso appear to be a characteristic indicator of the progression of the zzso status in Japanese zzso zzso for zzso
