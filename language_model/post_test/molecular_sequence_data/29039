zzso tomato zzso zzso a zzso species, evolved from zzso zzso species in the zzso zzso following a breakdown of the zzso zzso In order to zzso the molecular basis of this breakdown in zzso zzso we first zzso the zzso proteins with an zzso zzso for zzso activity and zzso No zzso protein or its activity was detected in the style of zzso zzso We then introduced the zzso gene from an zzso relative, zzso zzso into zzso zzso However, the styles of transgenic plants expressing zzso at levels comparable to those found in the zzso zzso style were unable to reject zzso and zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso This indicated that zzso in the zzso expression was not the sole reason for the loss of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso zzso originally identified from the style of zzso zzso is the other zzso factor involved in zzso zzso We cloned and zzso two distinct genes zzso zzso and zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso A frame shift zzso in the coding sequence of zzso and a stop zzso in the zzso of zzso were found, and no zzso transcript was detected in the style of zzso zzso The results suggest that the breakdown of zzso in cultivated tomato is associated with zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso
