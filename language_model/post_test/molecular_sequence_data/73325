The zzso form of zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disease of zzso zzso characterized by deficiencies in several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In cultured zzso from patients with this disorder, both the zzso targeting and zzso removal of the zzso type 2 zzso targeting sequence zzso of zzso are zzso whereas the zzso of proteins targeted by zzso type 1 zzso targeting sequences zzso is zzso We have previously isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso which demonstrates a striking similarity to the cellular zzso of zzso zzso in that zzso targeting is functional, but the zzso packaging of zzso targeted zzso is zzso zzso of this zzso has led to the identification of the protein zzso a zzso zzso In this paper we report cloning of the human zzso of zzso and demonstrate that this is the defective gene in zzso We show that expression of human zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso targeting and restores some activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and we identify the zzso responsible for loss of function of zzso in a compound zzso zzso zzso These results imply that several zzso proteins are targeted by zzso signals and that the various zzso and clinical defects in zzso result from a zzso in the zzso for this class of zzso
