Recent studies of the zzso of several groups of native Hawaiian vascular plants have led to significant insights into the origin and evolution of important elements of the Hawaiian zzso No groups of Hawaiian zzso have been subjected previously to rigorous zzso zzso We conducted a molecular zzso analysis of the endemic Hawaiian zzso zzso zzso employing DNA sequence variation from three zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso analyses we employed maximum zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often provided stronger support for hypothetical relationships than did zzso zzso zzso Although zzso analyses of individual DNA fragments resulted in different patterns of relationships among species and varying levels of support for various zzso a combined analysis of all three sets of sequences produced one, strongly supported zzso zzso The primary features of that hypothesis are: zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso the enigmatic endemic Hawaiian species zzso zzso is strongly supported as the sister zzso to zzso zzso highly divided leaf zzso are zzso derived in the group and simple leaves are zzso and, zzso the zzso origin of the common zzso of the zzso zzso zzso remains zzso although a zzso origin seems most zzso
