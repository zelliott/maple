zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso requires reverse zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso through a complex mechanism utilizing both zzso and DNA zzso We have examined DNA synthesis by zzso zzso on zzso and DNA templates derived from the zzso zzso using a primer extension zzso in zzso Analysis of zzso products on sequencing gels revealed strong pauses in zzso on both zzso and DNA templates, in zzso zzso runs, and at regions of predicted secondary zzso zzso pauses occurred in runs of template zzso zzso or zzso 4 zzso and zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso during zzso synthesis on zzso templates, and in most runs zzso or zzso 4 zzso of template zzso and zzso during zzso synthesis on DNA zzso zzso also occurred on both templates within the first few zzso of the predicted hairpin structures of the Rev response zzso The locations of pauses were dependent on template sequence and were unaffected by primer zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed similar pausing zzso DNA products that accumulated at zzso zzso pause sites on zzso templates were extended by continued incubation with excess zzso from zzso zzso leukemia virus, showing that the zzso templates were not broken or otherwise unable to support zzso zzso conducted in the presence of a zzso zzso trap showed that pausing results from two zzso 1) zzso remaining bound to the zzso and zzso at a greatly reduced rate, or 2) zzso zzso from the zzso These results demonstrate that specific zzso zzso and DNA template sequences are capable of interrupting zzso DNA synthesis by zzso zzso in zzso zzso may serve specific functions in zzso replication and zzso Moreover, these data suggest that one or more accessory factors are required to complete zzso DNA synthesis in zzso and that efficient zzso DNA synthesis may require multiple zzso
