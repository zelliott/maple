We investigated the mechanism of zzso action of a zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso killed completely zzso zzso within 30 zzso but zzso killed only zzso of zzso zzso even after 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso cell selectivity of zzso is closely correlated with a selective interaction with the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso which mimic the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso was able to induce almost zzso zzso leakage from zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso ratio of zzso whereas zzso caused only zzso dye leakage even at a zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso penetrated the cell wall and cell membrane and accumulated inside the cells, whereas zzso zzso did not penetrate but associated with the zzso zzso our results demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso W and zzso may be due to the zzso zzso formation or zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso functions, zzso Finally, zzso with potent zzso activity but no zzso activity may be potentially a useful lead compound for the development of novel zzso zzso
