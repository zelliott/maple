A zzso moderately zzso zzso strain, designated zzso was isolated from zzso soil collected at zzso India, and subjected to a zzso characterization with an insight into their zzso zzso Growth characteristics and zzso zzso producing capabilities of zzso zzso zzso were observed on various International zzso Project zzso media and production zzso zzso growth was observed on modified zzso 4 medium supplemented with zzso zzso zzso at 29 zzso incubated for 7 zzso zzso zzso compound production with good zzso growth was observed on zzso zzso medium prepared with seawater zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene based zzso affiliation was determined by using various zzso tools and the strain was identified as zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso of zzso compound derived from zzso zzso zzso against a set of bacteria and a zzso strain revealed zzso activity with significant minimal zzso zzso The potential zzso compound produced by zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso Cloning and sequence analysis of zzso zzso of zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso has the zzso gene with zzso sequence similarity to the type II zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso
