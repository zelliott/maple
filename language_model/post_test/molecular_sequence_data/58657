The zzso zzso is a widely occurring DNA binding zzso usually present as tandem zzso The majority of zzso zzso proteins that have been studied are derived from zzso Here, we characterize a member of a distinct class of plant zzso zzso proteins in zzso A zzso clone zzso a DNA binding protein from zzso was isolated by zzso zzso The zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single copy zzso which is expressed to similar levels in root and zzso to a somewhat lower level in stem and to low levels in leaf and zzso The optimal binding site was determined by random binding site selection, and the consensus sequence found is zzso The zzso between zzso and other DNA binding proteins is restricted to a repeated region of a stretch of 24 highly zzso zzso acids followed by a zzso motif zzso The zzso zzso region is essential for DNA zzso whereas deletion of the zzso one resulted in zzso reduced binding zzso zzso of zzso to DNA was abolished by zzso zzso The zzso domain as determined in zzso is adjacent to and possibly overlapping with the DNA binding zzso zzso zzso experiments with plant cells showed that zzso increases expression of a zzso reporter gene that is under control of zzso binding zzso We conclude that zzso is a plant zzso zzso with a zzso zzso DNA binding zzso
