We report here the zzso zzso and zzso cloning of a novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso protein bands on zzso possibly corresponding to a zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, on zzso native PAGE the zzso showed at least nine protein bands, among which zzso containing six to nine zzso had potent zzso activity for sheep zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was specifically inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and blood group A zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso or blood group B zzso The specificity of the zzso was further examined using various zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was found to bind to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso indicating that the zzso specifically binds to the terminal zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was completely abolished by zzso with zzso or zzso and completely restored by the addition of zzso zzso cloning of the zzso showed that the protein is composed of zzso zzso zzso including a signal sequence of 18 zzso and possesses the typical zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the protein is a zzso zzso The zzso zzso produced in a soluble form by zzso coli, showed binding activity for zzso in the presence of zzso but no zzso
