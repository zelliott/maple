The authors isolated a product of zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso which is formed on the surface of human zzso during incubation with zzso and which was previously described as the 66 zzso zzso membrane zzso This component migrated with an apparent Mr zzso in a zzso system of sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso In a reduced system it yielded two major zzso zzso with apparent Mr zzso and zzso The zzso weight component began with the zzso sequence of zzso zzso and the larger component with zzso 348 of zzso zzso as deduced from a zzso clone of this zzso The two zzso appeared to be linked by one or more zzso bridges supporting the contention that zzso is a highly folded zzso on the zzso zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not bind to zzso to zzso nor to zzso zzso zzso recognizing the zzso zzso The exposure of zzso receptors during the course of incubation of zzso with zzso preceded the formation of the zzso zzso zzso characterized in this zzso An intermediate product of zzso zzso zzso with an apparent Mr zzso in a zzso system and Mr zzso in a reduced system was identified as a precursor of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not retained on zzso or on zzso but it was retained on zzso zzso recognizing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso pancreatic zzso or human zzso zzso resulted in the formation of similar zzso degradation zzso
