zzso function is required for nuclear fusion, zzso zzso and nuclear segregation during zzso The zzso protein zzso with zzso to the zzso pole body and zzso zzso zzso zzso observed in double zzso strains containing a zzso in the zzso gene and in the gene for zzso or zzso is consistent with a physical interaction between zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso or zzso of zzso causes zzso zzso assembly and function, zzso zzso zzso are viable but contain very short or zzso zzso zzso zzso formation often occurs strictly within the mother cell, probably accounting for the many zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso loss in zzso cells are indicative of defective zzso zzso Nuclear fusion is blocked in zzso zzso zzso zzso which have truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso initially have zzso short or nonexistent zzso zzso and long zzso zzso zzso cells lose all zzso structures, zzso with the arrest of zzso Based on these results, we propose that zzso is required zzso for the formation or stabilization of zzso during zzso and for zzso pole body fusion during zzso
