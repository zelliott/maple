We have isolated and zzso three barley zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso may represent a zzso form of zzso The structure of the zzso zzso domain is typical for a zzso transit zzso A potential zzso targeting sequence occurs near the zzso of zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were increased in leaves undergoing zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso showed a negative response to zzso Our data indicate that the barley zzso bears a small gene family zzso zzso zzso differing in their function and cellular zzso
