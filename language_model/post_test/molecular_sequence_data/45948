zzso zzso such as DNA containing zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso zzso elicit the cell surface expression of zzso class II zzso through zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso and zzso induce expression of the zzso in the human B cell line, zzso zzso zzso expression of the dominant negative zzso of zzso and zzso interference targeting the zzso gene indicate that zzso zzso is not enough for the zzso zzso expression induced by zzso and zzso Additionally, nuclear factor zzso zzso is required for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso expression depends on zzso rather than on zzso Comprehensive zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveal that the functional interaction of zzso with the promoter element is necessary for the zzso zzso induction by zzso and zzso This novel mechanism provides the regulation of zzso gene expression with complexity and functional zzso
