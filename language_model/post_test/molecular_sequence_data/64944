The zzso like other zzso zzso of the zzso system, provides a potential environment for bacterial zzso but little is known about the presence of a bacterial zzso or its zzso By using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined from the normal esophagus of four human zzso The 900 zzso products cloned represented zzso unique sequences belonging to 41 zzso or 95 zzso operational zzso units zzso 59 zzso were zzso with zzso bacterial species, 34 with zzso zzso zzso and two were not zzso with any known bacterial zzso zzso Members of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso A large majority of clones belong to 13 of the 41 zzso zzso zzso or 14 zzso zzso zzso that were shared by all four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were most zzso The present study identified approximately zzso of zzso in this bacterial zzso Most zzso of zzso zzso are similar or identical to residents of the upstream oral zzso but the major distinction is that a large majority zzso of the zzso bacteria are known and zzso These findings provide evidence for a complex but zzso bacterial population in the normal zzso zzso
