zzso recent interest has focused on the stabilization and zzso of zzso protein in human and animal tumors and the corresponding zzso of downstream zzso target zzso However, there is only sparse information on the regulation of zzso expression at the zzso level and its possible involvement in zzso and zzso zzso We report here the cloning and characterization of a zzso promoter zzso from the rat zzso zzso zzso and its comparison with corresponding promoters from the mouse and human zzso zzso and zzso Several zzso binding sites were confirmed in the promoters of all three species using mobility shift and reporter zzso and one putative zzso site also was observed in the promoter of zzso zzso zzso array analyses identified numerous other zzso factors through their zzso binding to the zzso promoter, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The strong binding of zzso and zzso is especially zzso because the former zzso factor is regulated by zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso zzso whereas the latter zzso factor has been implicated in zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso signaling zzso These results are discussed in terms of their implications for human cancer development and specifically the various tumors in which zzso zzso is zzso as well as for embryonic development, when zzso changes in zzso expression occur in response to zzso zzso zzso The findings reported here should provide important avenues for further research focused on the regulation of zzso activity, including the ability of zzso downstream targets to zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso
