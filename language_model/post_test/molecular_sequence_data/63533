A clear understanding of the zzso effects of zzso T cells in the context of chronic human zzso virus zzso infection is critical for the development of zzso vaccines and zzso designed to support zzso zzso However, defining the potential zzso of effective zzso zzso immunity has proven difficult; notably, comprehensive analyses have demonstrated that the size and shape of the zzso zzso response are not necessarily indicative of efficacy determined by measures of plasma viral zzso Here, we conducted a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of zzso zzso responses to zzso virus in a cohort of six zzso individuals with a history of structured interruption of zzso therapy zzso zzso The magnitude and breadth of the zzso response did not, by themselves, explain the changes observed in plasma virus levels after the zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso escape from targeted zzso could not account for the differential zzso outcomes in this zzso However, the functionality of zzso zzso zzso populations upon zzso encounter, determined by the simultaneous and independent measurement of five zzso zzso functions zzso and gamma zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso reflected the emergent level of plasma virus, with multiple functions being zzso in those individuals with lower levels of zzso after zzso These data show that the quality of the zzso zzso zzso response, rather than the zzso is associated with the dynamics of viral replication in the absence of ART and suggest that the effects of zzso can be assessed by measuring the functional profile of zzso zzso T zzso
