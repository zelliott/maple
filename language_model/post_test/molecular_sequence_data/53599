zzso a zzso protein associated with a zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the regulation of a zzso zzso current zzso associated with zzso cell zzso We have determined the zzso acid sequences of zzso from human zzso zzso zzso and myeloma zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso acid sequences are highly zzso zzso to each other but less zzso to zzso protein from other zzso Using the zzso patch clamp technique, we examined the effect of zzso protein expression levels on zzso properties during a zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso cells results in a more than zzso increase in the rate of zzso zzso over control values, while having no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein in zzso cells using zzso zzso results in a more than zzso decrease in zzso zzso rate as compared to control zzso These results indicate that zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso but not zzso
