During sex determination, the zzso zzso gene functions as one of four zzso zzso elements that set the alternative male or female regulatory states of the switch gene zzso In zzso cells, zzso functions specifically in sex determination, but its expression pattern also hints at a role in the zzso cell, a zzso structure believed to provide energy and nutrients to the developing zzso Previous studies of zzso have been limited by the lack of a zzso zzso leaving open the possibility that zzso has additional zzso Here we report the isolation and molecular characterization of four new zzso zzso including two zzso zzso Our findings highlight key aspects of zzso zzso and reveal important qualitative differences between the effects of zzso and the other strong zzso zzso element, zzso on zzso zzso We use zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses to demonstrate that zzso has an essential function in the zzso zzso of both zzso In the absence of zzso zzso migration and zzso formation are zzso suggesting that the zzso cell may have a direct role in zzso gut zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of a requirement for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
