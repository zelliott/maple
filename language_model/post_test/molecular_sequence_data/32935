Human zzso zzso 1 zzso and structurally related zzso from other organisms catalyze the initial zzso step in the zzso salvage zzso Though zzso is known to be the preferred zzso donor for zzso zzso its exact binding mode and effect on the zzso state has not been zzso Here we report the structures of zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso structure reveals that the zzso zzso of zzso binds at the zzso interface of the zzso zzso and that the majority of the zzso interactions occur between the zzso groups and the zzso In the zzso structure the zzso group of zzso exhibited no electron zzso This difference between zzso and zzso is rationalized by a difference in the zzso of their zzso zzso A more open zzso as seen in the zzso complex structure, is required to provide space for the zzso zzso Our analysis supports the formation of an analogous open zzso in zzso upon zzso zzso
