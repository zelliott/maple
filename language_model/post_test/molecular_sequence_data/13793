The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of zzso zzso in European zzso 

DNA extracts from 20 zzso tumor samples were zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso chain zzso of the zzso domain zzso 5-8 was performed in order to detect zzso distribution of zzso zzso cells within the zzso In a screening procedure four clones of each zzso 5-8 were zzso To confirm the observed zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso was zzso 

zzso analysis confirmed a zzso in only two cases zzso One at zzso 220 zzso 6) was a homogeneous transition in nearly all clones from zzso to zzso The other zzso was a transition from zzso to zzso at the known hot spot zzso 248 zzso zzso It was found in zzso of the zzso We conclude that the other zzso from the first step were zzso due to the zzso of the zzso All tumors had wild type sequence at the reported hot spot zzso zzso The minor importance of zzso gene zzso in European zzso was further confirmed at the protein level by zzso Only the tumors with the zzso zzso zzso at zzso 248 showed a zzso zzso in nearly zzso of the zzso None of the other tumors showed higher levels of zzso zzso 

We therefore conclude that the zzso of zzso zzso in European zzso zzso is very zzso Generally there may be no zzso distribution of zzso zzso cells within a zzso The contribution of this genetic zzso to zzso in Europe seems of little zzso
