The human type 1 zzso of zzso zzso is a member of zzso zzso family that zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso To compare the molecular events underlying zzso specificity in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations of fully zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex are zzso zzso modeling methods are applied to construct three-dimensional models of zzso complexes based on zzso zzso zzso zzso crystal structure from zzso zzso The binding mode and binding energy analysis between four different complexes indicate that zzso and zzso are key zzso for the zzso specificity of zzso which is in agreement with zzso studies results obtained by Thomas et zzso The MD results also display that the zzso zzso may be another important zzso except zzso and zzso for the zzso specificity and that this result needs further zzso experiment for zzso
