A zzso zzso zzso with activity toward 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of 27 zzso each) zzso the zzso zzso ring opening of various zzso At 5 zzso zzso the zzso followed zzso zzso for zzso monoxide and zzso zzso with zzso values of 66 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso monoxide and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso with the zzso concentration up to 25 zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso showed that the product of zzso zzso to zzso monoxide was zzso zzso Thus, zzso attack of zzso occurred on the zzso carbon atom of the zzso zzso zzso was further converted by an zzso zzso and this zzso was also zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of 25 zzso each) showed a high activity for zzso whereas simple primary and secondary alcohols were not zzso The zzso zzso the sequential zzso of the alcohol function to the corresponding zzso and zzso acid and followed zzso zzso with respect to zzso and zzso The results suggest that the initial steps in zzso metabolism are a zzso conversion to zzso zzso a zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso
