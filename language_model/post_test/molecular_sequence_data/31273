A gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso 126 zzso has been mapped to the viral zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene maps to zzso fragments zzso and M, zzso with the gene from zzso disease virus zzso strain zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were compared to the zzso strain zzso zzso gene that we zzso zzso Overall, the two sequences are zzso zzso with greater similarity in the 3' zzso two thirds of the zzso zzso zzso gene sequences have a slightly higher overall zzso plus zzso zzso + zzso content than zzso zzso gene sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso A single, long open reading frame capable of zzso 523 zzso acids was identified within the zzso zzso gene zzso The predicted precursor zzso derived from this open reading frame would have a calculated molecular weight of zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso acid sequences contain six potential zzso zzso sites zzso Five of these six potential zzso zzso sites are zzso between the zzso and zzso predicted zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of the predicted zzso zzso zzso acid sequences indicate the presence of an zzso zzso zzso which may function as a signal zzso and a zzso zzso terminal zzso which may function as a membrane anchor zzso Overall, zzso zzso and zzso zzso precursor zzso sequences are zzso zzso and share many potential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein sequences are similar to those of zzso zzso virus zzso C zzso and zzso proteins from other zzso zzso are scattered throughout the zzso with a primary concentration near the zzso half of the zzso One stretch of 60 zzso acids zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso are relatively well zzso among zzso proteins from six zzso The possible implications of these zzso and the potential roles of zzso proteins in virus infection, growth, and replication are zzso
