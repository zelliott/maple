We discovered that after deregulation of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso and the zzso properties of this zzso acid in zzso used for zzso production were zzso In this study we describe the cloning and molecular identification of zzso which encodes the zzso specifically exporting zzso from the zzso The zzso gene product does not display zzso to any known zzso It is only 236 zzso acids in size, with the potential to span the membrane six zzso The zzso protein was zzso to confirm its deduced zzso of zzso zzso A probable regulatory zzso zzso is localized immediately adjacent to zzso and displays all the typical structural features of an zzso zzso regulator of the zzso zzso zzso export is correlated with zzso zzso A zzso zzso is unable to zzso zzso whereas with zzso zzso zzso is exported at a rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso dry weight, which is five times the rate that was obtained with the wild zzso A deletion zzso was constructed to search for a natural function of this unique zzso Surprisingly, growth of this zzso is abolished on a salt medium in the presence of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that, in response to zzso addition, there was an zzso of the exceptionally high concentration of more than zzso zzso zzso These results distinguish zzso as an zzso zzso zzso structurally represents a new type of zzso zzso demonstrates that exporters are also present for primary zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso serves in one zzso function to link import with export zzso
