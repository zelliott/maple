zzso zzso is the zzso protein of zzso zzso It is essentially zzso in the liver, but lower amounts are also produced in other zzso such as zzso and zzso A number of studies have been done to characterize the zzso elements implicated in the regulation of zzso gene expression in different zzso The results of these studies support the hypothesis that the zzso gene makes use of different combinations of nuclear proteins in different zzso of cells to achieve zzso zzso It is interesting to point out that this occurs in zzso arising from different zzso zzso
