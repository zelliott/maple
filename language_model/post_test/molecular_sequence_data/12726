The zzso activity of various zzso derivatives has been identified by several zzso We have previously hypothesized that the zzso activity of these compounds stems from the absence of a zzso group at the 19 position, as various zzso that have a zzso group at this position are not zzso To test this hypothesis more directly, we now compare the zzso zzso zzso against its zzso analogue zzso zzso We also compare these compounds to known zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as compounds known to be devoid of zzso activity at zzso as high as zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In growth zzso using the zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell lines, we find that only zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso and this effect can be blocked by the pure zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in transient zzso studies using a zzso reporter construct containing three tandem copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso response element, zzso zzso and zzso can stimulate transcription, while none of the other compounds act as zzso zzso stimulation by the zzso compounds can be blocked by zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that the lack of a zzso is not the major zzso for zzso activity in zzso We suggest that the zzso group more accurately defines zzso zzso
