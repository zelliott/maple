Most patients with chronic immune zzso zzso zzso have zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have used a zzso zzso library that displays random linear zzso to identify zzso sequences recognized by these zzso Plasma zzso zzso from two patients were used to select for zzso displaying zzso zzso From patient zzso zzso to have two distinct zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patient zzso bound zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso Each zzso showed zzso zzso binding to immobilized zzso and binding could be blocked with zzso zzso Patient zzso zzso recognition of zzso zzso zzso could be blocked with a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso was zzso Using sequential overlapping peptides from the zzso zzso region, an zzso for zzso was localized to the sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using synthetic peptides showed that zzso zzso and zzso were recognized by distinct zzso from patient zzso To determine whether individual patients with zzso possessed zzso that recognize similar zzso zzso on zzso the three zzso were tested for binding to five other zzso patient zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso was found to bind zzso and one other patient zzso This result suggests that zzso patients recognize a limited number of shared zzso
