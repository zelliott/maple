zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, represent a major threat to agriculture zzso They are transmitted in a persistent, zzso manner by zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins are in direct contact with hosts and are presumably involved in determining zzso zzso Such a role has been proposed for zzso zzso proteins zzso by circular zzso zzso at least one of which is a zzso Little is known about the interactions between major zzso zzso membrane protein zzso and insect zzso zzso The aims of our work were to identify zzso proteins interacting with zzso and to investigate their role in transmission zzso In controlled transmission experiments, four zzso species were identified as zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, and three others as zzso zzso between a zzso zzso zzso zzso and insect proteins were zzso by far Western blots and affinity zzso zzso zzso specifically with a few proteins from zzso species zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso and both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified by mass zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western blots of plasma membrane and zzso zzso confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso generally known as a zzso zzso in plasma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction between zzso zzso and insect zzso zzso is demonstrated for the first time, and this work also supports the hypothesis that host zzso is involved in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso within their zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to play a crucial role in insect transmission zzso
