zzso reduced zzso of zzso zzso have been described from zzso bacterial zzso of several insect lineages zzso Some host insects have formed stable associations with pairs of bacterial zzso that live in specialized cells and provide them with essential zzso zzso data from these systems have revealed remarkable levels of zzso zzso between the zzso pairs zzso 4, 6, zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains dual bacterial zzso existing with an unprecedented zzso an unnamed zzso for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso lives inside the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the complete zzso and zzso contributions of these unusual zzso zzso We show that whereas there is little overlap in retained genes involved in zzso production between zzso several essential zzso acid pathways in the zzso zzso require a patchwork of zzso gene products from zzso zzso and possibly zzso Furthermore, although zzso has the smallest cellular zzso yet zzso it contains a zzso inversion present in both zzso in individual insects, starkly contrasting with the extreme structural stability typical of highly reduced bacterial zzso zzso 9, zzso
