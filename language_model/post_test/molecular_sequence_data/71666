zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso in the Calvin cycle and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso from potato zzso was expressed in zzso coli, isolated and zzso The crystal structure was zzso by multiple zzso replacement and refined at zzso A zzso The zzso is a zzso with D3 zzso The zzso chain fold is a zzso zzso A sequence comparison with zzso zzso outlined the active center and indicated that all members of this family are likely to share the same zzso zzso The zzso could be modeled by putting its zzso onto the observed zzso position and its zzso zzso atom between two zzso that participate in an extensive hydrogen bonding zzso A zzso confirmed the crucial role of one of these zzso The geometry together with the conservation pattern suggests that the negative charge of the putative zzso intermediate is stabilized by the transient induced zzso of a zzso sulfur zzso which is zzso and therefore prevents zzso instead of zzso
