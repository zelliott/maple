zzso zzso produces as zzso zzso containing one zzso or two zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso using as precursors zzso and zzso acids zzso produced by zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso and zzso as zzso The Las and zzso zzso systems zzso regulate the production of these zzso as well as that of other zzso involved in bacterial zzso at the zzso level in a cell zzso zzso In this work we study the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso involved in the production of zzso the zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso and also a component of zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso possesses three zzso One of these zzso start sites zzso is responsible for most of its expression and is dependent on the stationary phase zzso factor zzso and on zzso through its binding to an zzso zzso zzso
