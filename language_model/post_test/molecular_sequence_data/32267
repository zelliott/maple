zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of proteins which are characterized by the presence of a V domain zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the growth and zzso zzso of zzso strain without correcting the zzso patch polarization zzso The V domain of zzso is critical for suppression of the growth zzso of zzso strain but not for zzso to cortical zzso zzso zzso in the zzso binding motif alone did not abolish the activity of zzso but the zzso in combination with deletion of zzso zzso rich motif abolished the ability of zzso to suppress the growth zzso This suggests that the V domain of zzso has two functionally redundant motifs and either one of these motifs is sufficient for suppressing the growth zzso of zzso zzso This is in contrast to the observation that both zzso and zzso require the zzso binding motif for their zzso
