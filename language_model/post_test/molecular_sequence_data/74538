zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso potato stems and zzso zzso analysis was used to identify genes that were zzso expressed when host extracts were added to the growth zzso zzso extracts zzso the expression of zzso genes and genes related to zzso and metabolism of zzso and zzso genes needed for nitrate or zzso zzso Some of the observed changes in gene expression in zzso cultures are similar to those during attachment of the zzso to host zzso Other responses indicated zzso against toxic zzso in the zzso zzso extract induced a large gene cluster having zzso to type VI zzso genes shown to be zzso zzso in many, but not all, animal and human zzso Two of the genes in the type VI cluster were found to be expressed during infection in potato zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso of the corresponding genes had increased zzso on zzso One of the type VI zzso zzso was further characterized and found to grow to higher cell density in culture in the presence of host extract and to produce slightly more zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso proteins showed that this type VI zzso was affected in the production of zzso proteins zzso which have been suggested to be zzso by the type VI zzso in other zzso The results suggest that the type VI zzso system of zzso zzso is needed for zzso of zzso but not for zzso on its host plant, zzso
