zzso are known for their important role within the functioning of an ecosystem, and their diversity can be used as an indicator of zzso zzso To date, earthworm diversity has been investigated through conventional extraction methods such as zzso soil washing or the application of a mustard zzso Such techniques are time consuming and often difficult to zzso We showed that combining DNA zzso and next-generation sequencing zzso the identification of earthworm species from soil zzso The first step of our experiments was to create a reference database of zzso DNA zzso zzso gene for 14 earthworm species found in the French zzso Using this database, we designed two new primer pairs targeting very short and zzso DNA sequences (about 30 and 70 zzso that allow zzso species zzso Finally, we zzso zzso DNA taken from soil samples in two localities zzso plots per locality and eight samples per zzso The two short zzso regions led to the identification of a total of eight earthworm zzso The earthworm communities identified by the zzso approach appeared to be well differentiated between the two localities and are consistent with results derived from inventories collected using the zzso zzso The possibility of assessing earthworm communities from hundreds or even thousands of localities through the use of zzso soil DNA will undoubtedly stimulate further ecological research on these zzso Using the same DNA zzso our study also illustrates the potential of environmental DNA as a tool to assess the diversity of other zzso animal zzso
