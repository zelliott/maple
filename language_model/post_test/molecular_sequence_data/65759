zzso zzso has been suggested as a potential zzso for zzso but little is known about its zzso variation in sensitivity, especially at molecular zzso The effects of ozone zzso zzso 5 zzso on sensitive and resistant lines of zzso have been investigated at the end of zzso Sensitive plants showed characteristic symptoms of injury in the form of diffuse zzso zzso on zzso A zzso approach was used to identify and isolate a zzso zzso coding for PAL and zzso zzso The northern analysis of PAL showed zzso of transcript in both lines correlated with a typical increase of PAL activity zzso and zzso in resistant and sensitive material, respectively, compared to zzso On the contrary, the transcripts of zzso in resistant and sensitive plants, did not change after zzso Total zzso were not affected by zzso while zzso were quickly zzso by resistant clone as zzso zzso
