Identification of the putative zzso alpha zzso in zzso coli cells prompted the search for a zzso zzso gene in the zzso coli zzso A set of zzso DNA segments was identified, which match various parts of the human zzso alpha zzso Their location in the zzso coli zzso and high degree of similarity with the appropriate regions of the human zzso alpha gene suggest that some kind of zzso should exist in zzso coli, which could be responsible for bringing these putative bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso
