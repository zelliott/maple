A new zzso strain designated zzso producing zzso activity against zzso bacteria and zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemical studies indicated that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence of strain zzso showed a similarity level ranging between zzso and zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparison of its zzso characteristics showed significant differences with the nearest zzso Combined analysis of the 16 S zzso gene sequences zzso fatty acids profile, and results of zzso and zzso tests indicated that there were zzso and zzso zzso of that isolate from other zzso species zzso These date strongly suggest that strain zzso represents a novel species with the type strain zzso zzso zzso Experimental validation by zzso zzso would be required for conclusive zzso Four active products zzso were isolated from the culture broth of zzso zzso using various separation and zzso steps and zzso 1: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The chemical structure of these four active compounds was established on the basis of zzso studies zzso and by comparing with data from the zzso According to our biological studies, we showed in this work that the pure compounds zzso possess zzso and zzso zzso
