The human zzso zzso different and distinct zzso and zzso during the different zzso of the zzso zzso We aimed to determine which candidate genes demonstrate differential expression patterns in the zzso during different zzso of the zzso zzso 

Using differential display reverse zzso zzso chain reaction to compare day 5 and day 18 human zzso zzso obtained by laser capture zzso we identified a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X motif zzso zzso is known to function as a highly specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been mapped to zzso zzso It gives rise to two alternatively spliced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso protein and produced an zzso which we then used for zzso zzso 

Using this zzso zzso we successfully demonstrated that zzso protein was zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells at different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was also found to be expressed more prominently in the zzso zzso component than in the zzso component of human zzso zzso 

We suggest that zzso may be involved in the regulation of the zzso cycle and may be related to the proliferation of zzso cells in the human zzso
