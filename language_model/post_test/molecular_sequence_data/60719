A broad spectrum of cardiovascular diseases is studied in canine animal models, in which dysfunction or zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is of pivotal zzso zzso To provide the tools for subsequent molecular analyses of zzso structure or function and to identify putative regulatory factors we isolated and characterized the canine heart zzso zzso and putative regulatory zzso zzso The complete coding zzso zzso plus part of zzso regions zzso of zzso zzso and part of the zzso sequence zzso promoter zzso were identified by zzso zzso cloning using canine heart total zzso or zzso zzso zzso sequences were derived from zzso zzso zzso or zzso An zzso sequence zzso of zzso zzso length was established containing an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso acids predicting a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences zzso putative promoter zzso zzso to human, zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequences at the zzso or zzso acid level yielded between 86 and zzso or 83 and zzso zzso zzso The canine zzso zzso sequence zzso promoter zzso revealed stretches of zzso up to zzso as compared to the human sequence containing a cluster of binding sites for several regulatory zzso The zzso zzso cloning strategy is presented as an alternative to common library cloning zzso The obtained canine zzso sequence might serve to further analyze the structure, regulated function zzso region consensus zzso and expression of zzso in different zzso conditions and in other species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
