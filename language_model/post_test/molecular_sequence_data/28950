zzso zzso present on the surface of the zzso blood fluke zzso has been implicated in the regulation of zzso scavenging from the host zzso zzso of the molecular structure and functional characteristics of this zzso is a crucial first step in understanding the novel function for zzso and in evaluating the potential of zzso zzso as a target of new zzso control zzso We have determined the primary structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that the zzso was present on the zzso surface as well as in the zzso The derived zzso acid sequence possesses features common to zzso the zzso zzso six zzso that form three zzso zzso bonds, and aromatic zzso lining the zzso zzso An unusual feature is that the fully processed native zzso exists as a zzso zzso zzso zzso but the sequence of the zzso does not conform to the current consensus for zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso zzso showed conventional zzso specificity and sensitivity to established zzso of zzso although it is relatively insensitive to the peripheral site inhibitor zzso zzso zzso between host and zzso zzso will allow the rational design of zzso drugs and zzso
