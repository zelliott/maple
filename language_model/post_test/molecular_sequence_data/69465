alpha 1, beta 1, and gamma zzso zzso acid zzso type A zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cell lines of mouse zzso zzso which possessed different levels of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso These cell lines included zzso zzso levels of zzso C alpha 12 zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso currents revealed that, compared with expression in zzso and zzso cells, expression of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma zzso zzso in C alpha 12 cells produced a selective enhancement of single zzso current zzso No other pharmacological properties zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the expressed alpha 1 beta 1 gamma zzso zzso were zzso The zzso current enhancement in C alpha 12 cells was blocked by substitution of a beta 1 zzso zzso at the zzso consensus zzso site, zzso zzso zzso for the zzso beta zzso Interestingly, enhancement was specific for zzso containing all three zzso because it was not seen after expression of alpha 1 beta 1 or alpha 1 beta 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gating properties were not different for alpha 1 beta 1 gamma zzso or alpha 1 beta 1 zzso gamma zzso zzso expressed in each cell line, suggesting that zzso did not enhance zzso currents by altering these properties of zzso These results suggested that unlike acute application of zzso which has been shown to produce a decrease in zzso zzso chronic zzso of zzso activity can result in enhancement of zzso zzso More importantly, this effect occurred only with zzso composed of alpha 1 beta 1 gamma zzso zzso and not alpha 1 beta 1 zzso and was zzso by a single zzso acid zzso zzso of the beta 1 zzso
