The zzso for rat liver zzso zzso was isolated by screening a rat liver zzso library constructed in zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso in length and zzso a protein of 703 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the rat liver and the human muscle sequences show that the zzso and zzso regions are quite divergent as compared to the internal sequences which show an zzso zzso The rat liver zzso region is truncated by 33 zzso and has only zzso identity with the muscle sequence but retains the common feature of a low content of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso which are the primary targets for zzso by zzso protein zzso are absent in the liver zzso The presence of these zzso structurally anomalous zzso regions in liver and muscle zzso zzso suggests the absence of the requirement that they possess a zzso structure that is integral to that of the protein zzso A model is proposed in which this region interacts with a zzso core to maintain the I state, and in which zzso serves to zzso this zzso
