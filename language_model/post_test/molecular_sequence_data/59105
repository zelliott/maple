zzso is a plant short zzso element zzso whose amplification probably involves the reverse zzso of an zzso zzso In this report, we identified and characterized zzso transcripts from different zzso zzso zzso Despite the presence of a consensus internal zzso III promoter in a large number of zzso zzso zzso we observed that zzso transcripts are rare in zzso zzso zzso The use of two very sensitive methods zzso and zzso zzso allowed the characterization of 102 independent zzso zzso clones from three different zzso zzso root and zzso From this analysis, we conclude that the majority of zzso transcripts probably result from a small number of zzso events where an zzso element is transcribed due to its presence in a zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso initiating at the first zzso zzso of the DNA element, are also present in the tested zzso and possibly result from the zzso activity of as few as three zzso zzso Two of these transcripts could represent master transcripts responsible for the amplification of zzso zzso We also observed that the population of specific zzso III transcripts varies among the three tested zzso and that some transcripts appear completely zzso
