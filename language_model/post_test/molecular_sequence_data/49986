zzso cells are involved in the immune response against viral and microbial infections and zzso In contrast to B and T cells, zzso cells employ various modes of immune zzso An important mode of immune recognition employed by zzso cells is zzso self zzso exemplified by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed by zzso cells, and by activated zzso T cells and zzso recognizes one of several cell surface zzso that are zzso related to zzso class I molecules zzso zzso and zzso proteins in mice, and zzso class I zzso proteins and zzso proteins in zzso These zzso are not expressed abundantly by most normal cells but are zzso on cells exposed to various forms of cellular zzso Here we report the cloning of another zzso for zzso transcripts of this zzso are found in a wide variety of zzso and in various tumor zzso zzso of zzso with the novel zzso zzso activated zzso cells and zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso were efficiently rejected by zzso mice, and induced strong protective immunity to the zzso zzso tumor zzso
