zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso that regulate a number of different cellular activities including cell zzso zzso survival and even zzso The pathogen zzso zzso possess a single zzso of a typical zzso gene zzso whose identification was previously reported by us but its functional implications remained zzso zzso the only zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso motif was zzso expressed in zzso coli and functionally characterized under different stress zzso The expression profile of zzso at the protein and zzso level remained similar among zzso heat shocked and hydrogen zzso samples in all cases of dose and zzso But a significant difference was obtained in the zzso status of the protein in response to different zzso Heat shock at zzso or zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced the zzso status of zzso and zzso the zzso activity of the protein whereas zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso of zzso and loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso viability significantly but heat shock and zzso zzso zzso treatment failed to adversely affect zzso zzso zzso zzso a distinct possibility that zzso of zzso is associated with stress survival in zzso zzso is zzso Our study also gives a glimpse of the regulatory mechanism of the protein under in zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso lacks any typical zzso of zzso zzso the dual specificity zzso which are the upstream zzso of zzso indications of the existence of some alternate regulatory mechanisms of the zzso activity is zzso These may include the zzso activity of the protein itself in combination with some upstream zzso which are not yet zzso
