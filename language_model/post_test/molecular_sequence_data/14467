A novel zzso zzso zzso strain, designated zzso was isolated from a salt pond in zzso zzso zzso growth occurred at 37 zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formed pale yellow to deep yellow zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso white aerial zzso differentiated into long chains of spores and the spores were zzso with smooth zzso zzso zzso contained zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid of the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso The zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the novel strain was most closely related to zzso within the family zzso but formed a separate zzso The highest sequence similarities were to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso represents a new zzso and novel species in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
