zzso DNA sequence variation in zzso of the zzso zzso c zzso I zzso known as the DNA zzso of European zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by analyzing zzso individuals representing 16 populations from the Black Sea, through the zzso Sea and the Aegean Sea to the Mediterranean zzso A total of 19 zzso variable sites were found among individuals, and these defined 10 genetically zzso populations with an overall mean distance of zzso The highest zzso divergence was found between samples of eastern Mediterranean and northern Aegean zzso zzso history analysis among 16 populations clustered the Mediterranean Sea zzso in one main branch and the other zzso in another zzso zzso pattern of the European zzso populations correlated with geographic zzso supports the genetic structuring through the Black zzso zzso zzso Sea zzso
