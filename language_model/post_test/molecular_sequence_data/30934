Complete zzso acid sequences are presented for zzso c from camel and goat zzso and compared to sequences of other zzso zzso Tree analysis suggests that the rate of zzso acid replacement went up as soon as zzso was recruited for the stomach function in early zzso The two zzso from goat stomach are the products of a gene zzso that probably took place before the divergence of zzso zzso and deer about 25 million years zzso zzso sequences of three zzso from goat tears indicated that zzso the goat tear family of zzso may have zzso from the stomach zzso family by an ancient zzso and zzso later zzso are probably responsible for the multiple forms of tear and milk zzso in zzso
