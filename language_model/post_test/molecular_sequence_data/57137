A specific zzso against the human zzso zzso zzso was made by zzso a zzso region of the third zzso loop of the zzso zzso into a bacterial expression zzso that produced a fusion protein with zzso zzso In zzso studies this zzso identified the human zzso expressed in zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso as a diffuse band at approximately zzso zzso In zzso labeling of the zzso pool in zzso cells with zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso existed in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso increased the zzso state of the zzso dramatically, primarily at zzso The time course for zzso zzso was very rapid occurring within seconds of zzso addition and was maintained for at least 30 zzso The zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso Neither zzso (10 zzso nor the calcium zzso zzso (1 zzso had any effect on the state of zzso of the zzso eliminating a role for zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso 4 zzso 12 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso did increase zzso zzso an effect that was inhibited by the selective protein zzso C inhibitor zzso (10 zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso indicating that protein zzso C was not involved in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion the zzso of zzso in zzso was increased following the application of zzso zzso or zzso The response to zzso was zzso via a zzso distinct from protein zzso C, protein zzso A and zzso dependent protein zzso whereas the effect of 4 zzso 12 zzso 13 zzso was zzso by protein zzso zzso
