Novel zzso bacterial zzso made up of units of zzso zzso are accumulated zzso by zzso zzso U due to the existence in this zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso that activates the zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso a zzso system zzso in the zzso zzso integrated by two zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso The complete zzso of these compounds requires two additional routes that specifically zzso the zzso or the zzso generated from these zzso through zzso zzso studies have allowed the zzso sequencing, and disruption of the genes included in the zzso locus zzso zzso and zzso as well as those related to the zzso of precursors zzso or to the zzso of their derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additional experiments showed that the blockade of either zzso or zzso hindered the synthesis and zzso of plastic zzso zzso of zzso reduced the quantity of stored zzso by zzso The blockade of zzso hampered the zzso of the zzso and decreased its zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso did not affect the synthesis or zzso of zzso containing either zzso acids or zzso acids with an odd number of carbon atoms as zzso whereas the production of zzso containing units of zzso acids with an even number of carbon atoms was greatly reduced in these zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso defective in the zzso acid cycle zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso zzso stored a higher amount of plastic zzso zzso and zzso respectively), suggesting that genetic manipulation of these pathways could be useful for zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the organization and function of the zzso locus and its relationship with the core of the zzso zzso is reported and zzso
