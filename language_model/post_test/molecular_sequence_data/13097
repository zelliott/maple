To investigate whether the zzso zzso expressed only by a minority of T and B cells, defines a zzso of T helper cells, zzso zzso zzso T cell clones were assessed for zzso protein and gene zzso The clones were defined as zzso zzso and zzso according to their zzso zzso profile detected by reverse zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression after zzso zzso stimulation was analyzed by flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced a high expression of zzso in cells of both zzso and zzso as well as zzso type after 1-3 zzso A difference between the clones was noted in that the zzso clones remained highly positive in zzso zzso whereas expression in the other clones started to decline from day zzso These data indicate that zzso is expressed in activated zzso T cells of all three zzso and that the expression is sustained in zzso zzso
