The zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso cells, gives rise to several distinct structures including hair, zzso zzso sweat and zzso zzso We have recently isolated a novel zzso zzso expressed in the zzso mouse zzso zzso While investigating its zzso structure, we identified a related gene in close zzso which we have termed zzso zzso and zzso are zzso are transcribed in opposite directions and are separated by a potential promoter region of zzso zzso containing putative binding motifs for the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso small proteins rich in G, zzso zzso Y and Q and contain characteristic repeats reminiscent of the zzso proteins zzso Both genes are expressed in growing hair zzso in skin as well as in zzso and zzso sweat zzso Interestingly, expression is also detected in the zzso zzso where it is limited to the onset of the zzso growth phase and is independent of zzso zzso Their zzso zzso controlled expression pattern, together with their unique zzso acid zzso demonstrate that zzso and zzso constitute a novel zzso gene family participating in the differentiation of all zzso cells forming the zzso zzso
