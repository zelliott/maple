Historical climate changes have had a major effect on the distribution and evolution of plant species in the zzso What is more controversial is whether relatively recent zzso zzso changes have driven zzso or whether zzso species diversity is more zzso This question is addressed using evolutionary rate analysis of sequence data of nuclear zzso internal transcribed zzso in diverse zzso occupying zzso seasonally dry forests, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Species zzso in these zzso occurred both during and before the zzso in Central America, but were primarily zzso in South zzso This indicates zzso both for models that predict tropical species diversity to be recent and that invoke a role for zzso zzso change, and those that consider it ancient and zzso geological factors such as the Andean zzso and the closure of the Panama zzso zzso zzso analysis was attempted to identify common factors underlying evolution in these zzso In spite of the similar zzso to zzso ages of the study zzso and their high degree of zzso in the different fragments of South American dry forests, the analysis yielded zzso zzso patterns of area zzso
