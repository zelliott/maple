zzso is a major zzso zzso present in the zzso of zzso species with a blocked zzso zzso In order to facilitate the determination of the primary sequence of this zzso zzso zzso mixture was zzso from the zzso of zzso eye zzso zzso zzso zzso were then amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using a new protocol of Rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso product corresponding to zzso was zzso which was then zzso into zzso zzso and then transformed into zzso coli strain zzso zzso zzso from the positive clones were prepared for zzso sequencing by the automatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more than 15 clones containing DNA zzso coding for zzso constructed only one unique and complete full-length reading frame of zzso base pairs covering a deduced protein sequence of 324 zzso acids including the universal initiating zzso It shows 96, 59, 46 and 37 percent sequence similarity to another zzso from European common frog, bovine zzso zzso human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso respectively, revealing the close relationship between zzso from related zzso species and its possible evolutionary zzso with various zzso zzso In this study a zzso tree for zzso and related zzso is constructed based on zzso alignment program using a combination of distance zzso and approximate zzso zzso We have thus established the remote zzso relationship between zzso and some zzso zzso which may provide a possible link for the recruitment of this zzso from zzso zzso and its zzso role in maintaining a transparent and clear zzso
