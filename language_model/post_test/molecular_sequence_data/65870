zzso zzso disease virus zzso is a zzso zzso zzso virus which belongs to the zzso zzso of the family zzso In this study, we determined the complete zzso sequences of a zzso zzso strain zzso with segments A and B derived from attenuated and very virulent strains of zzso This strain is zzso to zzso eggs and zzso although it is not as virulent as very virulent zzso zzso sequence in zzso analysis showed that both types of natural genetic zzso of infectious zzso disease virus emerged in zzso Our findings, which strongly suggest genetic exchange between attenuated and very virulent strains of zzso emphasizes the risk of generating uncontrolled zzso viruses by using live attenuated zzso
