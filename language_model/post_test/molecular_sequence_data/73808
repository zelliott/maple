zzso sequencing of a zzso library of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been used to zzso in the restriction map of this zzso the genetic zzso already described in other zzso zzso The comparison of the vestigial zzso region with the corresponding genes in the F zzso allowed us to define the extent of the deletions that the zzso zzso zzso should have zzso The putative zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and both proved to be functional in zzso coli, but zzso was zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso showed the typical organization of zzso zzso although the similarity was lower than usual in this group of zzso The highest zzso was found with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed a maximum identity of zzso with known zzso namely the zzso of zzso and zzso both zzso plasmids isolated from zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso could arise from the zzso zzso zzso through zzso and that they are evolutionary distant from other zzso and zzso zzso
