zzso corresponding to the zzso loop located at zzso zzso on zzso protein zzso of zzso disease virus zzso generally elicit high levels of zzso and zzso zzso In some instances, however, the level of zzso zzso is low or even zzso even though the level of zzso zzso is zzso We have shown previously that the zzso activity of zzso zzso of zzso of a zzso of zzso A can be zzso by a zzso zzso retro or zzso zzso zzso This zzso analogue induced greater and zzso zzso zzso than did the corresponding zzso We now show that a single zzso of the zzso analogue elicits high levels of zzso zzso that persist longer than those induced against the corresponding zzso and zzso substantial protection in guinea pigs challenged with the zzso zzso In view of the high stability to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their enhanced zzso these results have practical relevance in designing potential zzso zzso
