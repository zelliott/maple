zzso a zzso in the zzso zzso is involved in numerous functions related to light zzso However, unlike in zzso zzso of retinal zzso receptors in zzso zzso has been hampered due to a lack of zzso To address this problem, an zzso against the 18 zzso zzso acids of the goldfish D1 zzso zzso was generated in chicken eggs and tested in zzso of goldfish and zzso and rat zzso zzso by using zzso and light microscopic zzso No labeling was observed in any tissue or zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of goldfish zzso revealed a single band at about 101 zzso The patterns of zzso zzso zzso found in rat zzso zzso and rat zzso were virtually identical to that previously reported with other zzso zzso and zzso In goldfish zzso zzso was most intense over cell bodies in the zzso cell layer, zzso cells in the zzso inner nuclear layer zzso and bipolar cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed over horizontal cell bodies and both zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso of cone zzso were labeled as zzso Double labeling showed that all protein zzso zzso bipolar cells zzso zzso were zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso cells and horizontal cells were zzso zzso zzso distribution is more extensive than zzso zzso zzso but is consistent with zzso estimates of zzso function, suggestive of both wiring and volume transmission of zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso displays zzso to zzso receptors in a zzso and a zzso and should prove useful in future studies of zzso zzso
