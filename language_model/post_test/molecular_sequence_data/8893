The molecular characteristics of zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso hair cells are largely unknown, unlike those of zzso zzso sensory zzso in vision and zzso In the present study we report the full-length sequence for three zzso zzso in a hair cell preparation from the trout zzso with high identity to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso A custom zzso targeting the zzso sequence zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso plate region of zzso hair zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was found by zzso zzso analysis to bind the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1) in both the zzso hair cell model and rat organ of zzso zzso binding between zzso and zzso was confirmed with surface zzso resonance analysis, predicting dependence on zzso with zzso M for trout hair cell proteins and zzso M for organ of zzso proteins at 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the binding to organ of zzso zzso was attributable to the zzso zzso sequence that follows a predicted zzso domain in the zzso zzso hair cells also express the transcript for zzso zzso zzso which in cone zzso regulates the degradation of zzso used to gate zzso in zzso Taken together, the evidence supports the existence in zzso hair cells of a molecular zzso linking zzso its binding partner zzso (and zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is potentially zzso in cochlear outer hair cells, given zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
