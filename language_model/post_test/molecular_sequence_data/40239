Recently, a coronavirus strain zzso was isolated from water buffalo zzso zzso and the virus which displayed a strict genetic and biological zzso with bovine coronavirus zzso was referred to as zzso coronavirus zzso Here, we report the zzso of four zzso strains identified in the zzso or zzso contents of water buffalo calves with acute zzso Single zzso infections were detected in all but one cases from which two zzso species were also zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso end of the zzso gene showed that three zzso were closely related to the zzso strain zzso whereas the fourth isolate zzso displayed a higher genetic identity to recent zzso reference zzso Three strains adapted to the in zzso grow on human zzso zzso cells were also evaluated for their ability to replicate in a bovine cell line zzso zzso bovine zzso and to cause zzso of chicken zzso and all displayed biological properties similar to those already described for the zzso zzso The present report shows that albeit genetically heterogeneous, the different zzso strains possess a common biological pattern which is different from most zzso and zzso zzso
