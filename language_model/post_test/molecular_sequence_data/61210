The zzso zzso hypoxic zzso zzso protein binds to and zzso a specific DNA sequence through an zzso domain located at the zzso To better understand the structure of zzso and how it interacts with DNA, 38 zzso zzso in the zzso domain were isolated through a combination of random and zzso zzso the latter directed to two zzso zzso that play an important role in DNA recognition and zzso by zzso zzso The zzso were characterized in terms of their ability to repress the hypoxic gene zzso and the zzso zzso gene in zzso The zzso zzso zzso were fused to zzso binding protein and expressed in and zzso from zzso coli and their relative affinities for DNA and ability to bend DNA were zzso A model of the structure of the zzso zzso domain was derived using sequence similarities between zzso and the human protein zzso the structure of which has been zzso The results of the zzso analysis are interpreted in terms of the model structure of zzso
