In most zzso mushroom species, zzso is avoided by an zzso system determined by two zzso each with multiple zzso (the A and B zzso zzso In this study we investigated the genetic structure of the zzso zzso in the tropical oyster mushroom zzso zzso using both zzso cloning and zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences from zzso regions zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso receptors zzso suggesting the genetic basis for zzso determination in zzso zzso is the same as in the model mushroom zzso Three zzso receptors were detected in a single zzso isolate of zzso zzso Only one pair of zzso genes was detected in the A zzso zzso It is hypothesized that the A zzso locus of zzso zzso is comprised of only one zzso pair, which may explain the lower number of A zzso zzso relative to other mushroom zzso
