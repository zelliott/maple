zzso receptors are G zzso receptors that contain seven zzso zzso In particular, zzso and zzso and their zzso have been implicated in the zzso of a number of diseases, including zzso arthritis and multiple zzso Based on their roles in disease, they have been attractive targets for the pharmaceutical industry, and zzso targeting both zzso and zzso can be a useful zzso zzso to the importance of these zzso information regarding the binding site is of prime zzso zzso studies have been hampered due to the lack of X-ray crystal structures, and templates with close zzso for comparative zzso Most of the previous models were based on the bovine zzso and zzso zzso In this study, based on a closer zzso with higher resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we constructed three-dimensional zzso The main aim of this study was to provide relevant information on binding sites of these zzso zzso dynamics simulation was done to refine the zzso models and zzso results indicated that the models were zzso Here, binding poses were checked with some established zzso of high pharmaceutical importance against the modeled zzso Analysis of interaction modes gave an integrated interpretation with detailed structural zzso The binding poses confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important, and we also found some additional zzso Comparisons of binding sites of zzso were done zzso and also by zzso a potent dual zzso Our results can be a starting point for further zzso drug zzso
