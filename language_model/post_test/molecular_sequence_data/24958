We analyzed a zzso sequence of the zzso zzso b gene of 34 strains of zzso zzso and 16 strains representing 12 related zzso The strains of zzso zzso were classified into 20 DNA types and 17 zzso acid zzso The differences between these strains were found in 1 to 60 zzso and 1 to 17 zzso zzso On the basis of the identities and similarities of zzso and zzso acid zzso some strains were zzso zzso two strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and one strain of zzso zzso as zzso zzso (including the type zzso three strains of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso (including the type zzso three strains of zzso zzso as zzso zzso (including the type zzso seven strains of zzso zzso as zzso zzso (including the type zzso seven strains of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso (including the type zzso one strain of zzso zzso as zzso zzso (including the type zzso and one strain of zzso zzso as zzso zzso (including the type zzso Some zzso zzso strains showed distinct zzso and zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso pair group method with the zzso zzso tree exhibited nearly the same zzso as those of the zzso trees obtained by neighbor joining, maximum zzso and maximum likelihood zzso
