In zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the synthesis of zzso the zzso component of zzso To isolate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso highly zzso in zzso family members were used to amplify zzso zzso from zzso lacking zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso matches the zzso sequence of zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso The size of the mature protein deduced from the zzso also matches that of zzso Features of the predicted protein are most similar to members of the zzso family; however, it differs from zzso zzso in having a zzso acid zzso extension and a region of substantial sequence zzso zzso zzso levels are zzso higher in embryonic than in zzso zzso and are much lower than zzso in both zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso accumulates in leaf and other zzso zzso consistent with the known distribution of zzso and zzso zzso
