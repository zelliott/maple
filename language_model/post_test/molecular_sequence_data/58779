zzso of zzso zzso occurs in its zzso extension and is zzso zzso by the protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present work, this stimulation was prevented by simultaneous treatment of the cells with the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In contrast, zzso occurring in the absence of zzso zzso was essentially unaffected by zzso although it was decreased dramatically by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Four zzso zzso that are subject to zzso have been identified by sequencing of radioactive zzso zzso zzso at positions 24 and 92, each containing zzso of the total zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso were minor sites of zzso zzso was by far the dominant site of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso treatment, and was also the major site in its zzso zzso was zzso to a high degree in the presence but not in the absence of zzso zzso zzso Thus the data indicate the influence of at least two different zzso activities in zzso zzso
