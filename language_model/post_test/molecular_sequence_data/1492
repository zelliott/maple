The zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso identifies a novel zzso fold, zzso and Ni active zzso zzso is a zzso assembly of right-handed zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso hooks zzso the active site Ni zzso This newly identified zzso zzso structural motif zzso provides almost all interactions critical for metal binding and zzso and thus will likely be diagnostic of zzso zzso zzso zzso are positioned for zzso guidance of the zzso zzso to the narrow active site zzso zzso structures show that the zzso motif is unfolded prior to metal zzso The active site Ni geometry cycles from square zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and backbone nitrogen zzso and zzso zzso to square zzso zzso with an added zzso zzso side chain zzso consistent with electron zzso resonance zzso zzso of the three zzso structures and comparisons to the zzso and zzso zzso support specific molecular mechanisms for zzso maturation and zzso and identify important zzso relationships zzso among zzso
