We generated transgenic mice, using zzso zzso pairs of the zzso upstream sequence from the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso reporter zzso and investigated the promoter function of the zzso and zzso regulated expression of zzso Most of the independent transgenic lines commonly showed the zzso expression in the defined cell layers of the zzso and four transgenic lines were characterized in detail for zzso zzso expression patterns by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso retinal cells were classified into two cell zzso One cell type was identified as rod bipolar cells on the basis of zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso The other cell type was zzso and resided at the cell layers corresponding precisely to zzso cone bipolar zzso The latter bipolar cells were found to exist as a large cell population comparable to rod bipolar zzso This observation was confirmed by zzso of zzso retinal cells with the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso analysis indicated that the zzso expression completely agrees with a zzso expression pattern of zzso during retinal zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso zzso upstream zzso sequence is capable of directing a zzso and zzso regulated expression of zzso in zzso bipolar cells and supports the view that zzso is responsible for ON responses in both the rod and cone zzso
