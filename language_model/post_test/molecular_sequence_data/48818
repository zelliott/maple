The zzso zzso zzso is a plasma membrane zzso that mediates active zzso transport in the zzso the first step in the zzso of the zzso zzso hormones zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso have been identified as a cause of zzso zzso transport zzso zzso and their investigation has yielded valuable zzso information on zzso Here we report a thorough characterization of the zzso zzso zzso in which the sixth zzso loop zzso zzso are zzso This zzso protein was zzso zzso incompletely zzso and zzso zzso Engineering 5 Ala at positions zzso partially recovered cell surface targeting and activity zzso zzso zzso with the sequence zzso in which zzso was restored at position zzso was targeted to the plasma membrane and exhibited zzso the transport activity of zzso zzso Based on our zzso zzso model, we propose that the side chain of zzso a zzso zzso throughout most of the zzso family, interacts with the main chain zzso group of zzso capping the zzso of zzso segment zzso and thus stabilizing the structure of the zzso Our data provide insight into a critical zzso interaction required for zzso folding and zzso
