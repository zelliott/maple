An analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences from zzso clinical reference specimens has identified two novel zzso zzso For each species, two strains from independent sources were zzso zzso species with zzso published names, the closest species to the newly identified organisms were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the newly identified zzso represent species that are distinct from these nearest zzso Analysis of partial zzso zzso gene sequences for the newly identified strains and their nearest zzso provided additional support for the species zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences suggested that the newly identified zzso belong to distinct but related species of the zzso zzso and are members of a zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids zzso summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso analyses further support the designation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
