zzso location and number of glacial zzso still remain unclear for many European cold-blooded zzso zzso We performed a zzso zzso zzso analysis of two zzso species combining zzso variation of 950 toads from 385 sites and nuclear genes zzso zzso from a subset of samples to reconstruct their colonization and contemporary variation zzso We identified the zzso northwest of the Black Sea and the zzso to be important zzso areas for zzso and zzso zzso This result emphasizes the importance of Central European zzso for zzso zzso species, far north of the Mediterranean areas regarded as exclusive glacial zzso for the zzso Additional zzso for zzso have been located in the southern zzso and zzso In contrast, no evidence for the importance of other east European plains as zzso regions has been zzso The distribution of zzso and zzso variation suggests the presence of local zzso near the Black Sea for zzso however, zzso simulations did not allow to distinguish whether one or two zzso were present in the zzso Strong genetic drift apparently accompanied zzso expansions reducing diversity in the colonization zzso zzso zzso coupled with the zzso isolation with migration analysis, revealed a limited and geographically restricted gene flow from the Balkan to zzso populations of zzso However, despite proximity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene exchange between them was not zzso
