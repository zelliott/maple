The search for appropriate vaccine candidates and drug targets against zzso has so far been confronted with several limitations due to the unavailability of biological material, appropriate molecular resources, and knowledge of the zzso zzso To identify targets for vaccine or chemotherapy development we have undertaken two zzso First, zzso expression libraries were constructed from life cycle stages that are critical for establishment of zzso zzso infection, the third-stage larvae zzso and the zzso zzso A gene discovery effort was then initiated by random expressed sequence tag analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that many of the transcripts were zzso and/or stage specific in either one or both of the zzso libraries when compared to the zzso zzso and both adult stages of the zzso zzso searches against the zzso database facilitated the identification of several genes of interest, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and neurotransmitter zzso as well as structural and zzso zzso Other zzso zzso genes showed zzso only to predicted genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso or were entirely zzso Some of the novel proteins contain potential zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso library with a pool of human zzso from zzso immune individuals, we identified six novel zzso proteins that otherwise would not have been identified as potential zzso using the gene discovery zzso This study lays a solid foundation for a better understanding of the biology of zzso zzso as well as for the identification of novel targets for zzso agents and/or vaccines against zzso based on zzso and rational zzso zzso
