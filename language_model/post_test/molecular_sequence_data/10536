Similar to other stages of zzso development, spore zzso is a particularly suitable model for studying regulation of gene zzso The transition from spore to zzso is accompanied by zzso regulated changes in both protein and zzso zzso A number of spore zzso zzso have been isolated zzso Among these are two members of the zzso gene family, a group of four genes defined by the presence of a common zzso repeat of zzso zzso (formerly called zzso and zzso (formerly zzso are expressed solely and zzso during spore zzso the levels of the respective zzso being low in dormant spores, rising during zzso to a maximum level at about 2 zzso and then rapidly declining as zzso are released from zzso The zzso are not found in growing cells or during zzso zzso The zzso with which these transcripts accumulate and then disappear during zzso implies that the respective products may be important for the zzso We reported previously that the zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present investigation, properties of the zzso zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of which are zzso or zzso were zzso and the upstream sequences involved in the zzso regulation of the expression of the gene have been zzso The zzso protein does not demonstrate zzso activity, but it has a zzso zzso Its role, if any, in degradation of the zzso spore wall is zzso To identify zzso elements in the zzso promoter, zzso zzso deletions of the zzso upstream zzso region were constructed and used to transform zzso Analysis of promoter activity during different stages of development shows that a short, very zzso sequence of approximately 81 base pairs is sufficient for zzso zzso zzso zzso in this sequence is the zzso zzso protein binding site, zzso which was shown previously to be a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso proteins bind to this region of the promoter, suggesting that zzso might regulate zzso gene expression zzso as it does in zzso
