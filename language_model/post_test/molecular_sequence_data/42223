A gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed using its own promoter on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso carrying zzso revealed that approximately zzso of the zzso activity was localized in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso identified as an zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso zzso sequence analysis predicted a zzso zzso acid zzso and 24 zzso acids at the zzso zzso of the sequence that are not found in the zzso zzso This 24 zzso acid sequence has many of the characteristics common to known signal zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence has considerable similarity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso acid zzso that are involved in zzso activity, zzso binding and calcium binding in several zzso were also present in zzso zzso zzso at the corresponding zzso
