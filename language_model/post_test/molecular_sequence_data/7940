Two alternatively spliced terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which code respectively for proteins of zzso and 529 zzso acids have been previously identified in the mouse zzso Here we show that the same two transcripts are also present in B lineage cells from bone zzso In addition we demonstrate that the corresponding 20 zzso acid zzso found near the zzso end of zzso significantly alters the function of the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso does not zzso N region insertions at the zzso junction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to explain the lack of N region insertions we have characterized the different parameters which distinguish the two zzso of zzso zzso of zzso cell extracts revealed a reduced capacity of zzso to add zzso to the 3' end of DNA, consistent with a lower terminal zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the zzso protein in these cells is zzso shorter than that of zzso Finally, despite the fact that zzso has the same nuclear zzso signal as zzso the cellular zzso of the two zzso was zzso zzso In contrast to nuclear zzso zzso was found exclusively in the zzso All these characteristics could contribute to the functional difference between the two zzso of zzso However, the zzso zzso of zzso on its own can account for its inability to add N zzso
