When a synthetic zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso from brain zzso protein zzso was used as a testing zzso we found that protein zzso zzso alpha was almost inactive towards this zzso In sharp contrast, when zzso of this zzso was replaced by a zzso the zzso zzso zzso became an excellent zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso manual zzso degradation together with zzso acid analysis and protein sequencing further revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso which zzso to an important abnormal zzso site zzso in Alzheimer's diseased brain zzso was the only site that was greatly zzso demonstrating that a zzso becomes a prerequisite and is essential for promoting zzso of zzso Taken together, the results provide initial evidence that zzso zzso alpha mediates a synergistic zzso control mechanism involved in the abnormal site zzso of Alzheimer's diseased brain zzso
