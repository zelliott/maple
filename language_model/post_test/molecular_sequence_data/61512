zzso domain is an zzso zzso zzso interaction domain often found in zzso regulated zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that many additional zzso motifs have been found in association with zzso domain, including zzso repeats, zinc finger zzso zzso fingers and zzso zzso Here we report a novel human gene containing double zzso zzso named zzso in agreement with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso pattern analysis shows that it contains double zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in adult brain and prostate of the 16 adult zzso zzso while it had a more abundant expression pattern in human fetal zzso The expression pattern of zzso shows it may have a function related to brain zzso
