zzso spores of the zzso zzso zzso undergo zzso cell polarity development that is driven by polar calcium zzso Here we present results that establish a role for zzso oxide zzso signaling in zzso the stimulus of gravity to directed polarization of the zzso Application of specific NO donors and zzso inhibited the zzso gravity response in a zzso zzso The effects of NO donor exposure were antagonized by application of NO scavenger zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso which zzso zzso zzso levels in the cells, disrupted zzso cell polarity in a zzso zzso zzso effects were antagonized by application of NO zzso consistent with the zzso that NO and zzso are linked in the signaling zzso To identify other components of the signaling system we analyzed gene expression changes induced by zzso treatment using zzso and quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed several genes whose expression was significantly altered by zzso zzso Three of these genes had strong sequence similarity to key signal zzso or stress response genes and quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction was used to more rigorously zzso the effects of zzso on their expression in spores and to test how closely these effects could be zzso by treatment with zzso zzso Taken together our results zzso NO and zzso as downstream zzso that help link the gravity stimulus to polarized growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso data from this article can be found in the zzso data libraries under zzso numbers BE zzso to BE zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso
