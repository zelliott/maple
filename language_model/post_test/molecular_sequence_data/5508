The expression of collagen zzso an adhesive zzso of the zzso zzso is completely inhibited in zzso transformed zzso and in many cell lines derived from spontaneous zzso zzso Here we present evidence that DNA zzso plays an important role in this zzso zzso The zzso level for DNA zzso is highly increased in zzso virus 40 zzso zzso compared with normal cells and this increase zzso with the decrease of the zzso level for collagen zzso zzso zzso of the zzso collagen promoter in zzso zzso promoter activity in a transient zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing reveals extensive zzso of the promoter region in zzso cells, but virtually no zzso of the corresponding region in normal zzso Increased zzso is also observed in a zzso cell zzso zzso Two of the zzso elements of the zzso collagen promoter lose their affinity for zzso factor zzso when zzso in zzso as demonstrated by gel zzso zzso DNA zzso is therefore involved in the zzso of the zzso collagen zzso It seems likely that the same mechanism is also responsible for the repression of other zzso zzso
