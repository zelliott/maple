In 2011, a large outbreak of an unusual bacterial strain occurred in zzso This strain was characterized as a hybrid of an zzso zzso coli zzso and a zzso zzso zzso coli zzso strain of the zzso zzso Here, we present a single zzso targeting the clustered regularly zzso short zzso repeats locus of zzso coli zzso zzso for specific detection of zzso zzso zzso strains from different geographical locations and time zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso coli zzso including reference strains for zzso coli O zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso types zzso to zzso The zzso was compared for specificity using zzso zzso targeting different zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso reacted with all types of zzso coli zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with zzso coli zzso and zzso strains carrying the zzso zzso zzso and were therefore not specific for detection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso developed for the zzso target was sufficient for specific identification and detection of the 48 tested zzso zzso zzso zzso The 35 zzso coli zzso strains expressing H types other than zzso as well as 8 zzso coli strains carrying a zzso zzso zzso tested all negative for the zzso zzso Only 12 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso coli strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reacted positive in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
