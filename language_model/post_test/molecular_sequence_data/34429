The zzso Dry zzso of zzso harbor numerous permanently zzso lakes, which provide a year-round oasis for microbial zzso zzso zzso in these lakes occupy a variety of zzso levels within the simple aquatic food web ranging from primary producers to zzso zzso Here, we report the first molecular study to describe the vertical distribution of the zzso community residing in the zzso zone of the east lobe zzso and west lobe zzso of the chemically zzso Lake zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries revealed vertically zzso populations dominated by zzso zzso with a zzso dominating shallow populations zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso occupying zzso (both zzso 13 zzso and zzso residing in the deepest layers zzso and 20 zzso zzso and 20 zzso of the zzso zzso A previously zzso zzso occurred throughout the water column of both zzso zzso variation in the zzso populations was examined during the transition from Antarctic summer zzso zzso to polar night zzso zzso zzso diversity was similar between the two zzso of Lake zzso due to exchange between the zzso zones of the two zzso via a narrow bedrock zzso However, vertical and zzso variation in zzso distribution occurred, indicating the influence of the unique water chemistry on the biology of the two dry valley zzso
