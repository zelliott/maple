zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso It is comprised of four identical zzso acid zzso zzso Recently, evidence has been provided to show that zzso is identical to the zzso zzso for zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso In the present study we show that chemical modification of zzso rat liver zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso and was accompanied by loss of zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso peptides obtained by zzso of the modified protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso 45, 89, 92, 96, zzso and 147 were zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso 45, 89, 92, and 96 were zzso only in zzso zzso suggesting that modification of these zzso resulted in zzso zzso The modified zzso zzso was quickly transported into isolated rat liver zzso This transport was specific for the zzso zzso since neither zzso nor zzso was able to enter the zzso zzso zzso zzso similar in size to the zzso zzso was labeled with zzso to a similar extent but was not transported into the zzso zzso of the zzso containing zzso zzso and subsequent extraction of the nuclear zzso with both high and low salt buffers recovered zzso only in the zzso zzso Our study supports the suggestion of an additional function for zzso probably connected with regulation of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
