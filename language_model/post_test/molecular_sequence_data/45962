The zzso A and inner core regions of zzso zzso zzso contain four zzso acid zzso zzso Two are attached to the outer unit of the zzso acid zzso zzso one to the zzso zzso and one to the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso described in the accompanying article, catalyze zzso transfer to the zzso zzso whereas zzso is responsible for modification of the core zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso a strain that normally lacks zzso modifications on its zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso activity in isolated membrane zzso suggesting that the appropriate zzso donor zzso is available in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression of zzso in zzso coli yielded inactive zzso However, zzso activity was zzso in the zzso coli system when total lipids from zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso We have now zzso and characterized zzso zzso zzso as a minor novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This substance is stable to mild base zzso and was zzso by zzso column zzso Its structure was established by a combination of zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso supports the efficient transfer of zzso to zzso zzso by zzso of zzso coli cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso The identification of a zzso zzso donor zzso suggests that the active site of zzso faces the zzso side of the inner zzso This work represents the first definitive characterization of a zzso zzso zzso with the proposed structure zzso zzso
