Focusing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the cell surface via interaction with its specific zzso zzso zzso is an important step for tumor cell invasion and zzso The ability of a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso to inhibit binding of zzso labeled zzso to zzso on human zzso zzso cells was assessed by quantitative flow zzso analysis zzso and compared to the zzso capacities of other synthetic peptides known to interfere with zzso An about zzso zzso excess of zzso resulted in 50% zzso of zzso binding to cell zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso binding zzso employing zzso soluble zzso coated to zzso plates, the minimal binding region of zzso zzso was zzso The linear zzso zzso and its more stable zzso zzso form zzso displayed zzso activity whereas other peptides such as zzso zzso or zzso did not react with zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso in which certain zzso acids were deleted and/or replaced by other zzso acids as well as zzso zzso peptides did also not inhibit zzso zzso the present investigations identified zzso as a potential lead structure for the development of zzso zzso to block zzso
