zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso sensory zzso that regulates zzso zzso production in zzso zzso Here zzso analysis and molecular biology were used to probe the signaling mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso We first identified the start zzso of zzso zzso this identification extended the N zzso of zzso for 45 zzso acids zzso from the previous zzso zzso This extension helped to address the outstanding question of how zzso receives input signals from type 4 zzso without a prominent zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso uses its zzso extension to sense an upstream signal in zzso zzso We suggest that the perception of the input signal by zzso is zzso by zzso interactions with upstream zzso zzso signal transmission likely involves zzso signaling instead of direct zzso interactions between the input and the output zzso in the zzso The basic functional unit of zzso for signal zzso is likely zzso as zzso zzso of the predicted zzso interface of zzso significantly affected zzso zzso zzso of zzso segments in the C zzso suggest that the newly defined flexible bundle zzso in zzso is likely critical for zzso function because zzso of this bundle can lead to zzso active zzso
