Analysis of zzso zzso sequences is a commonly used method for the identification and discrimination of zzso However, the high similarity of zzso and zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso group organisms (up to zzso and repeatedly failed attempts to develop molecular typing systems that would use DNA sequences to discriminate between species within this group have resulted in several suggestions to consider zzso zzso and zzso zzso or these two species together with zzso zzso as one zzso Recently, we divided the zzso zzso group into seven subgroups, zzso zzso A and B, zzso A and B, and zzso A and B, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences and identified zzso makers in each of these three zzso Here we for the first time demonstrated discrimination of these seven subgroups, including zzso zzso with a zzso gel element zzso of zzso zzso targeting zzso and zzso zzso zzso This is the first zzso enabled identification of zzso zzso and discrimination of these seven zzso in pure cell cultures and in environmental samples using zzso zzso The zzso bearing perfect zzso zzso probe pairs was specific enough to discriminate single zzso zzso zzso and was able to identify targeted organisms in zzso We also demonstrated the ability of the zzso to determine zzso affiliations for zzso zzso group zzso without zzso zzso zzso of these seven zzso with groupings based on zzso sequence typing zzso fluorescent amplified zzso length zzso analysis zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a wide spectrum of different zzso and the demonstration of zzso differences in toxin profiles, zzso and the ability to harbor some zzso suggest that these seven zzso are not based solely on neutral zzso zzso but instead reflect differences in both the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso group zzso
