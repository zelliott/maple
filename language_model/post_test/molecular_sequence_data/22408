The now finished zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso 13 allows the prediction of the genes involved in protein zzso into the zzso environment as well as the prediction of the proteins which are zzso From the sequence 296 proteins were predicted to contain an zzso signal zzso directing most of them to the zzso system, the main transport system in zzso zzso Using zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso grown in different media was zzso From the approximately 200 spots visible on the gels, 89 were identified that either contain an zzso signal sequence or are known to be zzso by other mechanisms than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso includes proteins from different functional classes, like zzso for the degradation of various zzso proteins involved in cell wall zzso zzso and zzso proteins and some proteins of yet unknown zzso zzso zzso is highest during stationary growth zzso Furthermore, cells grown in complex medium zzso considerably higher protein amounts than cells grown in minimal zzso zzso of zzso carbon and nitrogen sources results in the zzso of specific proteins that may be involved in zzso the zzso
