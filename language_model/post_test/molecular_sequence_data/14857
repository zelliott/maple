The Old World scorpion zzso zzso zzso zzso produces one of the most lethal zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso are responsible for its zzso with zzso accounting for half of zzso All four toxins are high affinity zzso of the fast zzso phase of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the high zzso zzso of zzso prevents production of a zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso dictating their zzso by zzso zzso remain zzso From an zzso zzso we generated an zzso binding zzso zzso with high affinity and selectivity for zzso and solved a zzso zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso of the zzso region of the bound toxin within a groove formed by the zzso combining zzso is associated with a toxin orientation and main and side chain zzso that dictate the zzso zzso specificity and efficient zzso From an zzso zzso we also zzso and zzso a high affinity zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure solved revealed a zzso zzso devoid of a bound zzso and with combining zzso involved in packing zzso denoting expulsion of the bound zzso upon crystal zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso combining site of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso combining surface of the zzso zzso zzso along with complementary data from a flexible zzso approach suggests occurrence of distinctive zzso zzso for the two toxins relative to their respective zzso This study provides complementary templates for designing new molecules aimed at capturing zzso zzso and suitable for zzso
