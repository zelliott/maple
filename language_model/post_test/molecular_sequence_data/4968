zzso P is a new zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso isolated from a Spanish zzso zzso zzso P inhibited most of tested zzso and food-borne zzso zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P is produced during growth in MRS broth from 16 to 45 degrees zzso it is heat resistant zzso zzso at 100 degrees zzso 15 zzso at 121 degrees zzso and can withstand exposure to pH between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and long-term storage at 4 and zzso degrees zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso by ammonium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso liquid zzso The sequence of 43 zzso acids of the N zzso was obtained by zzso zzso DNA sequencing analysis of a zzso region revealed the presence of two consecutive open reading frames zzso The first zzso encodes a zzso protein containing a zzso zzso zzso leader sequence of 27 zzso acids followed by the zzso acid sequence corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is apparently zzso as a zzso that is zzso immediately after the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso resulting in the mature zzso consisting of 44 zzso zzso and with a theoretical molecular weight of zzso A second ORF, zzso a putative immunity protein composed of 88 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso was found immediately downstream of the zzso P structural zzso zzso P shows a strong zzso activity and has the consensus sequence found in the zzso zzso however, zzso P is processed and zzso by the zzso zzso
