The neural cell zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in neural development, zzso and zzso In this study, we identified a synthetic zzso of the zzso zzso module by zzso chemistry and showed it could zzso zzso cell zzso and signal zzso with high zzso In cultures of zzso zzso this zzso termed zzso zzso zzso outgrowth by zzso a signaling zzso identical to that activated by zzso zzso zzso A similar effect was shown for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso By nuclear magnetic resonance zzso the zzso binding site in the zzso zzso module was mapped and shown to be different from the binding site of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso may prove useful as a lead in development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders, and the zzso binding site of zzso zzso may represent a target for discovery of zzso zzso
