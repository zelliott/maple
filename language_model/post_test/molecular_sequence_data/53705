The zzso coding for copper zzso zzso has been cloned from zzso pea zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso consisting of zzso zzso including the signal zzso agreed well with those reported for the zzso from a different zzso of zzso zzso and other plant sources, except for several evolutionary replacements located mostly on the molecular zzso A zzso expression system for the cloned pea zzso was constructed with the zzso zzso zzso using the zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Adding copper to the culture medium increased the zzso of an active, zzso zzso Furthermore, the inactive zzso produced in a zzso medium was activated considerably by subsequent incubation with excess zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced in the plant zzso by zzso modification that proceeds through the zzso zzso zzso as in the zzso from bacteria and zzso
