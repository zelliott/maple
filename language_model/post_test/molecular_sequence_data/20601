Studies of zzso recognition by zzso zzso have focused on zzso at the primary zzso sites, but zzso zzso zzso recognition at distinct three-dimensional structural zzso have not been zzso This is the first report to identify the key zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso was chosen as a model zzso to clarify the recognition mechanism of structural protein zzso in zzso zzso We have found previously that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for high molecular mass zzso differ zzso even though the zzso have similar primary zzso In this study, we constructed zzso between zzso and zzso using an in zzso DNA zzso system and several zzso to identify the key zzso involved in zzso zzso By comparing the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso we found that zzso 71 of zzso which is separate from the zzso zzso contributes to the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso 71 of zzso was also found to be crucial for zzso efficiency and zzso zzso
