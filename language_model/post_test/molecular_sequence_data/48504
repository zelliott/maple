zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most common genetic zzso and zzso worldwide, affecting approximately 400 million people and causing acute zzso in persons exposed to zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso drugs, and fava zzso Mouse models have not been useful because of a lack of significant response to zzso zzso We turned to zzso zzso zzso zzso which develop ex zzso and are transparent, allowing zzso of zzso We designed zzso to zzso zzso that were effective in reducing gene expression as shown by Western zzso and zzso zzso activity, resulting in a brisk zzso and zzso zzso secondary to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso allowed us to generate zzso that displayed no overt zzso until exposed to the zzso compounds zzso zzso or zzso after which they developed zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso We were also able to show that zzso zzso displayed significant levels of increased zzso stress compared with zzso We anticipate that this will be a useful model of zzso zzso to study zzso as well as zzso stress that occurs after exposure to zzso similar to what occurs in zzso zzso
