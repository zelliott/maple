zzso zzso are coated by abundant surface zzso named zzso for major surface zzso that undergo zzso zzso There are many zzso genes on the zzso but the zzso expression site is restricted to a unique site called zzso zzso and silent zzso genes can be zzso to the expression site by DNA zzso We have reported previously the existence of alternative zzso elements named zzso zzso by zzso transcript analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we characterized the features of zzso zzso and zzso genes that are under the control of zzso zzso zzso designated the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso elements are located at most of the zzso zzso zzso and are directly attached to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes consist of two zzso in coding sizes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso raised against the synthetic zzso zzso zzso detected products in molecular masses ranging from 90 to 100 zzso Although the cloned zzso zzso sequences are significantly diverse, zzso zzso that are rich and highly conservative in zzso zzso are also strictly zzso in zzso zzso zzso showing the importance of multiple zzso in the structural integrity of zzso in the cell surface of zzso zzso
