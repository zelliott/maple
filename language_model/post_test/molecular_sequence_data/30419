zzso are zzso zzso complexes consisting of multiple zzso Previously, we reported the cloning and sequencing of zzso for the largest zzso zzso of rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) zzso 28, zzso In the present study, the zzso sequence of another component zzso of zzso has been determined from a zzso zzso clone isolated by screening a rat liver zzso library with synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to partial zzso acid sequences of the zzso The deduced sequence of component zzso consists of 234 zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso These values are consistent with those obtained by protein chemical zzso A single zzso species zzso to the zzso zzso of rat liver was expressed in all rat zzso examined and in a variety of other zzso organisms, its distribution being similar to that of C2 zzso The wide distribution of the gene product, possibly zzso suggests that this protein functions similarly in most zzso zzso is an unmodified protein of a single gene and differs from any other known zzso but its overall zzso acid sequence resembles those of other zzso zzso including zzso suggesting that these components belong to a single family of proteins with the same evolutionary zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
