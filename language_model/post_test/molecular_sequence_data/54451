zzso that elicit T cell responses try to mimic protective memory T cell immunity after infection by increasing the frequency of zzso T cells in the immune zzso However, the factors that determine zzso during infection and after vaccination and the relation between zzso and protection are incompletely zzso We previously identified zzso as an zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso T cells after zzso tuberculosis zzso Here we report a second zzso zzso that is recognized by a substantial number of pulmonary zzso T zzso The relative abundance of these T cells in the zzso repertoire only partially predicts their relative frequency after zzso tuberculosis zzso Furthermore, although vaccination with zzso zzso virus expressing these zzso changes their relative zzso in the zzso T cell repertoire, this change is transient after challenge with zzso zzso We speculate that factors intrinsic to the chronic nature of zzso tuberculosis infection establishes the hierarchy of zzso and may explain the failure of some vaccines to provide zzso
