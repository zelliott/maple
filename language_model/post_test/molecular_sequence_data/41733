A zzso probe zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify PAL clones in zzso libraries made with zzso from young leaf tissue of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 hybrid zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso confirmed its identity as a full-length zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence is zzso in comparison with that of PAL genes from several other zzso Southern zzso analysis of popular zzso DNA from parental and hybrid individuals, restriction site zzso in PAL zzso zzso and sequence zzso in the 3' ends of several zzso clones suggested that PAL is zzso by at least two genes that can be distinguished by zzso restriction site zzso zzso containing each type of PAL gene were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the segregation of zzso zzso restriction zzso zzso demonstrated the existence of two independently segregating PAL zzso one of which was mapped to a linkage group of the zzso genetic zzso zzso regulated PAL expression in zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in young zzso zzso zzso and young zzso zzso was lower in older stems and zzso in mature zzso Cellular zzso of PAL expression by in zzso zzso showed very high levels of expression in zzso cells of leaves early during leaf zzso In stems and zzso expression was associated with zzso cells and vascular zzso
