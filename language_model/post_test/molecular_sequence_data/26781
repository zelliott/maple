DNA zzso delta zzso zzso is one of the main zzso DNA zzso in human cells and therefore is a critical zzso of the overall accuracy of DNA zzso Here we document the zzso of a human Pol delta zzso and systematically score the types of zzso that the zzso generates in a forward zzso zzso We find that human Pol delta is highly accurate, catalyzing less than one zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of a zzso active site zzso significantly zzso the frequency of incorporation zzso demonstrating the contribution of both the base selection and zzso zzso to the overall accuracy of synthesis by Pol zzso The highly selective nature of the zzso active site is also indicated by the zzso of Pol delta upon encountering multiple types of DNA zzso However, DNA damage is not an absolute block to Pol delta zzso We propose that partial zzso bypass by Pol delta represents a balance between zzso to allow for repair of zzso zzso by specialized repair proteins and bypass of damage to allow for successful completion of DNA synthesis by Pol delta in the presence of zzso blocking DNA zzso
