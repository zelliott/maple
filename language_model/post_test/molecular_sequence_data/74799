The stringent response is one of the most important regulatory systems in bacteria for adaptation to environmental stresses such as zzso acid zzso This response is zzso by an unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso the levels of which are controlled by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso dramatically influences a broad range of zzso activities in bacterial cells, including zzso and translation as well as the zzso activities of several zzso zzso Recently, a growing number of zzso zzso designated zzso have been identified in zzso zzso has four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In order to reveal the specific roles of the individual zzso zzso we have analyzed the zzso zzso activities of the four zzso and characterized the expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso from the present and previous studies indicate that all four zzso proteins are targeted into zzso zzso analysis of zzso coli zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso have zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using reporter gene zzso indicated that the four zzso zzso genes are expressed in green zzso and flowers, suggesting the involvement of zzso functions in zzso development and zzso We also observed that all zzso transcripts exhibit a zzso rhythm, and that induction of zzso and zzso transcripts are responsive to several environmental zzso These results suggest that expression of the four zzso genes is zzso regulated and that the zzso zzso stringent response has certain roles in the physiology of higher zzso
