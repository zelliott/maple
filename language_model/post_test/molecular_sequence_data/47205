The zzso structure of human zzso protein zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso zzso recognizes the 3' zzso zzso tail and plays critical roles in zzso translation initiation and zzso zzso The minimal zzso used in this study consists of the zzso two zzso zzso zzso connected by a short zzso zzso These two zzso form a continuous zzso zzso lined by an zzso beta sheet backed by four alpha zzso The zzso zzso adopts an extended zzso running the length of the molecular zzso zzso recognition is primarily zzso by contacts with zzso zzso found in the zzso motifs of the two zzso The convex zzso of zzso displays a zzso zzso zzso portion, which may interact with translation initiation factors and regulatory zzso
