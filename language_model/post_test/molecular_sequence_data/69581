Short open reading frames within the zzso leader of some zzso zzso are known to regulate the rate of translation initiation on the downstream open reading zzso By employing the zzso chain reaction, we learned that the zzso 5 zzso on the common leader sequence of bovine coronavirus zzso zzso were zzso and zzso throughout early infection in cell culture and that as a persistent infection became established, zzso giving rise to a common zzso zzso open reading frame were zzso Since the common leader is derived from the zzso zzso end during transcription, a common focus of origin for the zzso is zzso The zzso open reading frame was shown by in zzso translation studies to zzso translation of downstream open reading frames in a cloned bovine coronavirus zzso zzso zzso of an zzso open reading frame resulting in a general zzso of zzso translation and a zzso zzso of virus replication may, therefore, be a mechanism by which zzso and possibly other zzso viruses with a similar zzso strategy maintain a persistent zzso
