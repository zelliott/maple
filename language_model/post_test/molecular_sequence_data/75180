zzso zzso zzso are being extensively studied at the gene zzso The entire gene zzso the largest zzso of zzso zzso A, zzso was isolated and characterized in zzso Southern zzso and gene disruption experiments showed that the zzso gene is unique in the zzso zzso zzso and essential for cell zzso zzso zzso mapping was used to identify zzso zzso and 3' zzso zzso encodes a zzso chain of zzso zzso in a large uninterrupted reading zzso A dot zzso comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso with zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso B and C showed a zzso pattern of zzso regions zzso A potential zzso site zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso the zzso zzso does not harbor the zzso repeated sequence present in the zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso by the presence of two zzso zzso inserted between zzso regions I and II, and V and zzso From their zzso usage and third base zzso bias, zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso fall among zzso genes expressed at an average zzso The zzso zzso region contains features present in other zzso genes that might function in zzso
