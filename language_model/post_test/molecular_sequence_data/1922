The human general zzso factor zzso is involved in both zzso and DNA zzso We have identified a structural domain in the core zzso of zzso zzso which is absolutely required for DNA repair activity through the zzso zzso repair zzso Using zzso experiments, we showed that this activity involves the interaction between the zzso domain of zzso and the 3' zzso zzso a major component of the zzso zzso repair zzso Furthermore, we zzso a functional zzso particle with a zzso of zzso lacking the zzso domain, showing that this domain is not required for assembly of the zzso complex and zzso zzso We solved its three-dimensional structure and found an zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso domain, uncovering a new class of activity for this zzso
