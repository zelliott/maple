We have determined the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso or zzso Using two independent approaches, zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis we show the zzso maps to zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso This map position is within the zzso linkage group corresponding to human zzso zzso where the human zzso zzso 1, has been shown to map zzso zzso mapping shows the gene to be very closely linked to Met, one of the most zzso zzso on zzso zzso It thus places the gene near the zzso and the junction of the zzso and zzso zzso The essential role of the zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso interactions and its gene location provide strong support for its candidacy as the gene involved in the dysfunction of mouse zzso bearing the zzso or zzso zzso
