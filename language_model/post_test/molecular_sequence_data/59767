zzso exists in all organisms and is responsible for the hydrogen transfer to important zzso for zzso reduction and the reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have also been shown to regulate zzso activity in plants and are also involved in the regulation of zzso factors and several other regulatory zzso zzso is reduced by the zzso zzso zzso using zzso We have now determined the first structure of a zzso zzso zzso from the plant zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is structurally similar to that of the zzso coli zzso and most differences occur in the zzso Because the plant and zzso coli zzso have the same architecture, with the same zzso structure and the same position of the zzso active zzso bond, a similar mechanism that involves very large domain zzso is likely for the two zzso The zzso is divided into two zzso one that binds zzso and one that binds zzso The relative positions of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso differ from those of the zzso coli zzso When the zzso zzso are zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso must be rotated by 8 degrees to zzso on the corresponding domain of the zzso coli zzso The domain rotation we now observe is much smaller than necessary for the zzso reduction zzso
