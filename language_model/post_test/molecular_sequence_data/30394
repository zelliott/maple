zzso is a major zzso protein in bovine zzso Its presence has been demonstrated in all zzso examined except zzso and zzso However a positive cross reaction was observed for human milk proteins with zzso raised against bovine zzso We isolated and characterized a protein fraction of zzso 12 zzso responsible for the positive cross zzso zzso sequencing and zzso analysis indicated that this protein is identical with human beta zzso We observed structural zzso between zzso region zzso and beta zzso zzso which suggested that positions zzso could be the zzso region for zzso Six highly zzso zzso zzso are suggested as candidates for the zzso zzso
