The tomato zzso gene zzso resistance to races of the leaf zzso fungus zzso zzso that carry the zzso zzso zzso zzso resides at a locus containing five zzso genes and was isolated by zzso tagging using a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso The tagging experiment generated an zzso series of zzso zzso of zzso most of which were wild type in zzso However, one zzso designated zzso showed stunted growth, zzso progressive leaf zzso and necrosis and zzso expression of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was caused by a zzso zzso zzso that zzso with a Ds element zzso at the zzso zzso zzso genetic analysis indicated that the zzso locus of zzso had undergone zzso generating a zzso zzso designated zzso that comprised an zzso fusion between the zzso coding region of the zzso zzso zzso and the 3' coding region of zzso The presence of a possible zzso footprint adjacent to the junction between zzso and zzso and a Ds zzso at the zzso position in the downstream zzso zzso is consistent with zzso between zzso and zzso promoted by zzso of Ds from zzso into zzso zzso zzso transient expression of zzso in zzso zzso caused zzso and the zzso of zzso gene zzso indicating that the protein zzso by this novel zzso gene is zzso
