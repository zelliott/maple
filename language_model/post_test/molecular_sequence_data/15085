zzso zzso zzso play a significant role in the fragmentation of zzso basic protein zzso and zzso leading to zzso multiple sclerosis zzso and experimental zzso zzso zzso The classic zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in the zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso of the single zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso are widely expressed in the zzso and also in the immune zzso The relative contribution of the individual zzso to the zzso zzso is not zzso 

To zzso which zzso plays the primary role in zzso zzso we determined the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the in zzso zzso reactions followed by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso As a result, we identified the zzso zzso sites and the sequence of the resulting zzso We determined that zzso zzso and zzso are highly sensitive to redundant zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso however, was superior over all of the other zzso in zzso the zzso zzso Using the mixed zzso culture zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso readily generated, with a near quantitative yield, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso selectively zzso the proliferation of the zzso T cell clone isolated from mice with zzso and specific for the zzso zzso zzso presented in the zzso zzso zzso 

In sum, our zzso observations led us to zzso that zzso which is activated by zzso and associated with the zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso pathology and that zzso is a novel and promising drug target in zzso especially when compared with other individual zzso
