Purple acid zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso acid zzso representatives of which have been found in animals, plants, and zzso The goal of this study was to characterize purple acid zzso from sweet potato zzso and soybean seeds and to establish their relationship with the only zzso plant purple acid zzso the zzso red kidney bean zzso Metal analysis indicated the presence in the zzso sweet potato zzso of zzso zzso of iron, zzso zzso of zzso and small amounts of zinc and zzso The soybean zzso contained zzso zzso of iron, zzso zzso of zinc per zzso and small amounts of zzso copper, and zzso Both zzso exhibited visible zzso zzso at zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 3300 zzso zzso respectively, very similar to the red kidney bean zzso zzso zzso were markedly different from those of the red kidney bean zzso A cloning strategy was developed based on zzso sequences of the sweet potato and soybean zzso and short sequences around the zzso metal zzso of the zzso and red kidney bean zzso Three sequences were zzso one from soybean and two from sweet zzso All three showed extensive sequence identity zzso with red kidney bean purple acid zzso and all of the metal zzso were zzso The combined results establish that these zzso are zzso zzso zzso in the sweet potato zzso and zzso in zzso The sweet potato zzso is the first zzso example of an zzso zzso center in a zzso
