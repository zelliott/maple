During the course for the studies of zzso beta 4 and zzso alpha from zzso zzso a new analog of zzso beta 4 has been zzso This zzso consists of 41 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso is blocked by an zzso group as revealed by fast atom zzso mass zzso zzso zzso acid sequence studies disclosed that this zzso is identical to bovine zzso beta 9 except that zzso at position 6 in beta 9 is zzso by zzso Thus, this new zzso has been termed zzso beta 9 zzso The zzso of beta 9 Met, beta 4, and zzso alpha in zzso zzso have been determined (in zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso 85, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso 31, zzso heart zzso 10, zzso kidney zzso 51, zzso brain zzso 31, zzso zzso zzso beta 9 Met was found to be more active than beta 4 in enhancing zzso production in zzso blood zzso However, beta 4 appeared to stimulate higher amounts of zzso 2 and tumor zzso zzso The significance for the coexistence of two zzso peptides with similar functions in the zzso and a number of other zzso is not clear, and deserves further zzso
