zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share a unique zzso activity and specifically zzso zzso cells at the completion of virus zzso in order to release progeny zzso With the aim of determining the molecular basis for the zzso specificity of these zzso we have zzso their domain structure and examined the function of their unrelated and unique zzso cell wall binding zzso zzso Analysis of deletion zzso showed that both zzso are needed for zzso zzso zzso of zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso demonstrated that the zzso 140 zzso acids of zzso and the zzso 182 zzso of zzso are necessary and sufficient to direct the zzso zzso to the bacterial cell zzso zzso was able to target zzso to the surface of zzso cells belonging to zzso groups 4, 5 and 6, resulting in an even zzso of the entire cell zzso In contrast, the zzso hybrid bound to a zzso predominantly present at zzso regions and cell zzso but only on cells of zzso 1/2, 3 and zzso zzso binding to surface zzso zzso occurred in a zzso zzso zzso We measured 4 zzso 104 and 8 zzso 104 binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis revealed unexpected high molecular affinity zzso for the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso In conclusion, we show that the zzso are responsible for targeting the zzso zzso to their zzso and function to zzso recognition specificity on the zzso As the zzso sequences contain no repeats and lack all known sequence motifs for zzso of proteins to the bacterial cell, we conclude that they use unique structural motifs for specific association with the surface of zzso zzso
