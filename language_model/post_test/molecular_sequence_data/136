The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely zzso to a zzso structure containing zzso and zzso in zzso zzso However, both are additionally localized to the zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of a membrane occupation and recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso present at the zzso but not at the zzso zzso The anterior part of the zzso structure partially overlapped with the zzso attachment zone while the zzso part overlapped with the zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso showed that there was a modest growth zzso in zzso cells but zzso in zzso cells, showing that it is an essential protein in the zzso form of the zzso zzso appears to be a useful marker for the zzso in zzso zzso
