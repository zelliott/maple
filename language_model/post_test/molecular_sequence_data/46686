zzso repeats of a novel, zzso zzso motif zzso have been described within the products of two, highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mapping to zzso was recently shown to fuse to the zzso growth factor zzso 1 gene in the zzso zzso associated with a stem cell zzso zzso zzso at zzso is disrupted by a zzso zzso in a mentally retarded patient and is a candidate gene for zzso zzso mental zzso Here we have cloned another member of this family, designated zzso and mapped it to zzso band zzso In addition, zzso was identified as a further member of the family and mapped to zzso The predicted protein products of zzso and zzso maintain the repeats of the zzso zzso Isolation of these new members will facilitate the functional characterization of the zzso family and zzso
