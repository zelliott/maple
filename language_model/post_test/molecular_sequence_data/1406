To determine whether the zzso mouse can serve as a useful model for studying the molecular pharmacological basis of Long zzso zzso Type 1 zzso which has been linked to zzso in the human zzso zzso we measured zzso intervals from zzso zzso recordings of zzso zzso and zzso knockout zzso zzso before and after injection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but significant increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso intervals were found in zzso zzso relative to zzso siblings during baseline zzso assessments zzso zzso 57 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 22 versus 49 zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso 28, respectively, p zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso intervals significantly increased following zzso challenge in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso group zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso recordings show that the slow delayed zzso zzso current zzso was absent in zzso but present in zzso zzso where it was strongly enhanced by zzso This finding was confirmed by showing that the selective zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso and prolonged action potential duration in zzso but not zzso zzso These data demonstrate that disruption of the zzso gene leads to loss of zzso resulting in a long zzso zzso that is exacerbated by zzso zzso This zzso closely reflects that observed in human zzso patients, suggesting that the zzso mouse serves as a valid model for this zzso This idea is further supported by new zzso data showing that there is a high degree of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso between the zzso human and mouse cardiac zzso zzso
