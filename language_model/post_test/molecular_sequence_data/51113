It was shown in an earlier report (Turner et zzso 1989, zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso that the anomalous zzso zzso zzso zzso observed for the protein zzso in zzso solution at pH zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, a zzso consisting of zzso 11 to 27 of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence lifetimes were measured at the zzso maximum and in the red edge of the zzso At zzso greater than 320 zzso the data was best fit with three zzso The third exponential gave lifetimes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso when the zzso was dissolved in the zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso 275 zzso zzso zzso zzso 350 zzso These zzso lifetimes are similar to that observed for a zzso component of native zzso in the red edge of the zzso suggesting that the 1 degrees and 2 degrees features of a zzso from zzso protein has enough structural information when dissolved in zzso of intermediate polarity provide appropriate conditions for zzso zzso from a zzso species to zzso
