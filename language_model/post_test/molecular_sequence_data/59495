The primary structure and base specificity of chicken liver zzso zzso which has been reported by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso were extensively zzso The sequence study of this zzso and comparison of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso with zzso zzso from oyster and zzso zzso suggested that zzso zzso consists of three peptides with 17, 19, and zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence of these three peptides were zzso The two small peptides are joined to the large zzso by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso had 62 zzso and 63 zzso zzso identical with oyster zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and belongs to the zzso zzso family zzso zzso of the base specificity of zzso zzso found that it is zzso acid, then zzso zzso and not zzso U zzso
