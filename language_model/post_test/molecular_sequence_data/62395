A protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso showing zzso to animal proteins of the zzso family, involved in the transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, has been zzso This zzso named zzso (for zzso zzso was shown by zzso zzso to be localized to the zzso inner envelope in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was expressed in the leaf zzso cells as well as in the developing zzso at the zzso zzso Five additional zzso of zzso are found in the zzso zzso of which one was shown by green fluorescent protein zzso fusion to be also located in the zzso All zzso proteins share zzso to the animal zzso family, as well as to other zzso zzso that are members of the zzso zzso zzso family, and share the main features of zzso from this family, including the presence of 12 putative zzso zzso and of a zzso acid motif in the fourth putative zzso zzso zzso thus represent a novel protein of the zzso inner envelope that is likely to be involved in zzso zzso
