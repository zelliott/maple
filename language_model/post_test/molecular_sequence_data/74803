The zzso zzso stream of the zzso contains a special population of proteins and zzso molecules which appear to be produced in the companion cells prior to being transported into the sieve tube system through the zzso zzso During this process, these zzso proteins are thought to undergo partial zzso Recent mass zzso studies identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as potential molecular zzso functioning in the zzso zzso stream zzso et zzso zzso In the present study, we describe the cloning and zzso of a zzso bean zzso zzso zzso that has high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected with zzso sap or zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis of zzso zzso derived from a 22 zzso band in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and Western analysis of proteins extracted from zzso bean zzso indicated that zzso is an abundant protein in the companion zzso element zzso zzso experiments established that zzso zzso zzso can interact with zzso to both induce an increase in size exclusion limit and mediate its own zzso zzso zzso these findings support the hypothesis that zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso proteins after their entry into the zzso zzso zzso
