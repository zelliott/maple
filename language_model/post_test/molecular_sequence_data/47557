zzso zzso depends upon successful binding and fusion between the zzso of the zzso and the zzso These processes are thought to be zzso by a series of zzso interactions in which zzso zzso known as zzso are thought to play a key zzso Using a recently developed zzso technique, the interactions of the zzso sequence corresponding to the zzso domain of mouse zzso zzso alpha P) and zzso zzso have been zzso Following zzso zzso zzso alpha P bound rapidly to zzso zzso in a zzso manner with a Hill zzso of zzso and binding rate zzso in excess of 1000 zzso The zzso nature of the binding process is suggested to represent evidence of a structural mechanism to prevent egg zzso by immature zzso The subsequent membrane zzso was found to take place over a longer time period (with rate zzso of up to zzso zzso and was linear with respect to zzso zzso zzso of these processes with similar zzso circular zzso zzso revealed that changes in zzso secondary structure were very zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso confirmed changes in the secondary structure of zzso alpha P during interaction with PC zzso zzso indicating that the zzso is mainly present in a zzso with a small proportion of zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is the zzso species with an important role in zzso
