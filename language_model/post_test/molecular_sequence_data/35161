zzso zzso and zzso zzso form zzso zzso the zzso binding zzso zzso of which bind the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso forming a large zzso ring within in which sister zzso are zzso and thereby held together zzso zzso zzso During zzso establishment of stable cohesion is dependent on zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is thought to prevent zzso of zzso from zzso thereby zzso shut a zzso exit zzso How zzso and zzso regulatory zzso bound to zzso regulate cohesion establishment and maintenance is poorly zzso We show here that by binding to zzso adjacent to its zzso zzso binding zzso domain, zzso not only promotes zzso release from zzso but also mediates de zzso zzso of zzso by zzso during S phase and subsequently prevents zzso by the zzso zzso By first promoting zzso release from zzso and subsequently creating and guarding the chemical modification responsible for blocking release, zzso enables zzso zzso to switch during S phase from a state of high turnover to one capable of tenaciously holding sister zzso together for extended periods of time, a duality that has zzso complicated analysis of this versatile zzso zzso
