Several genes within the zzso zzso share zzso with the transforming zzso zzso of the avian zzso leukemia zzso Of these, zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to possess transforming activity in zzso and each is found to be zzso expressed in a variety of zzso In normal zzso expression of zzso and zzso is restricted to embryonic development and a few adult zzso whereas zzso and zzso are very widely zzso The proteins zzso by the various zzso genes share substantial sequence zzso zzso N and zzso proteins are all nuclear zzso that possess very short biological half lives and bind zzso All three possess identifiable motifs present in a number of other nuclear proteins involved in zzso regulation, and the possible role of zzso proteins in gene regulation is zzso Some experiments, however, zzso a different role for zzso in DNA zzso Whatever their precise molecular functions may be, it is clear that zzso genes play an essential role in the regulation of cellular zzso
