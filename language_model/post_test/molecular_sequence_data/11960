zzso of most zzso requires the viral E1 and zzso proteins and an origin of replication containing the E1 and zzso binding zzso In the case of human zzso type zzso zzso the E1 protein alone is sufficient for DNA replication although the zzso protein significantly stimulates zzso We have further analyzed the role of zzso sequences and the E1 and zzso proteins in zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that a zzso region lacking the zzso binding sites but containing an imperfect zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the putative E1 binding site contains the minimal origin of replication zzso Using a transient replication zzso we demonstrate that zzso of this zzso region causes a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso region centered around the above zzso sequence supported only low-level replication in the presence of either E1 alone or both E1 and zzso but replication was significantly increased in the presence of multiple copies of this zzso zzso containing a zzso sequence which includes the zzso zzso failed to zzso but multiple copies of this region supported replication in the presence of both E1 and zzso to significant zzso The results presented indicate that the zzso E1 protein is capable of recruiting all the cellular factors required for zzso Our results also suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso sequence may result in a significant increase in the recruitment of the E1 protein to the origin, thereby stimulating zzso This increased targeting of the E1 protein to the origin containing multiple copies of the putative E1 binding site may be functionally similar to the targeting of E1 to the origin by zzso
