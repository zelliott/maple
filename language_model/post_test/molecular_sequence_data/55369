zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso - and zzso zzso and plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso a component of zzso zzso to most zzso zzso zzso exists mostly in zzso and is generally absent in higher zzso this makes it an attractive target for the design of new zzso zzso Here, we present the cloning and characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso a protein of 410 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso was cloned into modified zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso After introduction into zzso zzso the strain zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was efficiently zzso to zzso using zzso and a gel zzso column, with zzso activity zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso zzso gene revealed identity similarities of zzso 93, 23, and zzso with from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a molecular mass of zzso The zzso exhibited activity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and showed higher specificity for the former compared with the zzso The zzso was stable from pH zzso its optimum pH was at zzso The optimum temperature for the zzso was zzso and its activity was rapidly lost at temperatures above zzso zzso metals, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso obviously enhanced zzso activity, while the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso
