The present study was undertaken to determine the pattern of expression of 2 molecular markers of zzso resistance, the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso from 50 zzso patients using a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis of zzso and zzso gene amplification was obtained in each zzso High rate of zzso expression without gene amplification was detected in all zzso samples, as well as in 10 zzso zzso and 50 samples of normal zzso On the other hand, zzso appeared to be expressed at moderate levels in normal zzso zzso while relatively high levels of zzso expression without gene amplification were occasionally observed in zzso zzso
