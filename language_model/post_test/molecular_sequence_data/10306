zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder that may be due to impaired activity of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the vitamin D zzso The disease locus for zzso has been mapped by linkage analysis to zzso but the molecular zzso underlying the zzso dysfunction has remained elusive due to the lack of sequence information for the zzso gene zzso referred to as zzso We have used a probe derived from the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence to identify and clone the zzso zzso The full-length zzso clone of zzso zzso codes for a protein of predicted Mr 55 zzso zzso activity of the cloned sequence was assessed using transient zzso and the production of authentic zzso D3 zzso was confirmed using high performance liquid zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso The expression of the gene was analyzed in vitamin zzso zzso treatment with zzso reduced zzso transcript levels by zzso while administration of zzso hormone led to a zzso increase in the expression of the zzso thus confirming the hormonal regulation previously described using zzso zzso The rat zzso was used to obtain a human zzso zzso Interestingly, the human zzso gene mapped to zzso providing strong evidence that a zzso in the zzso gene is responsible for the zzso zzso The availability of a cloned sequence for zzso generates novel tools for the study of the molecular zzso of zzso and will allow the investigation of other disturbances of vitamin D zzso
