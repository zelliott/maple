In order to understand the molecular basis of the elevated cerebral zzso levels in the zzso we compared the expression of the zzso and proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in various regions of the brain and the zzso of newborn zzso and juvenile zzso pigs and also measured the relative contribution of zzso to cerebral zzso synthesis both in zzso and in zzso by using a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso protection zzso using total zzso isolated from various regions of the zzso brain revealed that, unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso and the zzso of the newborn compared with those of the juvenile zzso zzso zzso protein comprised the majority of total zzso zzso in zzso cerebral zzso due to a zzso lower expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso decreased the rate of zzso synthesis by zzso cerebral zzso of the newborn by approximately zzso and of juvenile pigs by zzso The decrease in brain tissue zzso zzso following intravenous administration of zzso was greater in newborn pigs zzso or zzso zzso than in the juvenile animals zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso substantially reduced the net in zzso cerebrovascular production of zzso in newborn zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso in the newborn brain and cerebral zzso and the main contributor to the brain zzso levels in the newborn zzso
