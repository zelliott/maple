In order to contribute to our understanding of zzso zzso we determined zzso zzso sequences and the zzso internally transcribed zzso zzso sequence of 35 Chinese zzso zzso and three reference strains representing three zzso described species and used them to construct zzso zzso The two zzso trees were roughly similar zzso and zzso strains were assigned to eight zzso zzso In addition, the results of zzso analysis were consistent with those obtained by randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso cluster zzso Compared with a zzso tree based on the zzso zzso zzso the ITS tree showed more clearly the zzso and zzso zzso relationships of the zzso zzso zzso values of the zzso varied from zzso % to zzso % between representative strains of different species, and the maximum level of ITS divergence between strains belonging to the same species was 13 zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso we concluded that at least each of the three zzso zzso zzso groups should be considered a separate subspecies, and that five zzso Chinese zzso zzso represent one or two new species of the zzso zzso The ITS may be a potential target for the development of fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso for more accurately detecting distinct zzso of zzso strains and other closely related zzso zzso
