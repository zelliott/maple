zzso binding protein is a novel zzso that we successfully cloned and zzso First, zzso zzso binding protein was zzso from the zzso of mice with zzso shock using zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso binding protein zzso was cloned after zzso using mixed primer pair sequences based on partial zzso zzso binding protein zzso acid sequence zzso zzso human zzso binding protein zzso was cloned from zzso libraries of normal human liver using zzso zzso binding protein zzso as a zzso Next, we zzso expressed zzso human and zzso zzso binding proteins in zzso cells and zzso them from culture zzso Both zzso zzso binding proteins did not exhibit species specificity and prevented zzso binding to its zzso In addition, they inhibited zzso dependent zzso production from zzso cells zzso These results suggest that the zzso binding protein may possess zzso zzso zzso
