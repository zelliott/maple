We have previously reported that a zzso protein present in an outer membrane protein preparation seemed to be a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso zzso Jensen, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to further characterize this zzso A Western zzso zzso analysis and zzso labeling with a zzso zzso against this protein confirmed that the protein was present in all zzso zzso reference strains but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso labeling results also indicated that the protein was associated with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing confirmed that the protein was in fact a zzso zzso sheath zzso The molecular mass of this zzso first estimated to be 46 zzso by Western zzso was determined to be 44 zzso when the protein was evaluated more precisely by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and the protein was zzso as determined by zzso zzso and also by zzso F zzso Five other zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso which may have been the core proteins and had molecular masses of 39, 35, 32, 30, and 29 zzso were zzso related and zzso with the zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso Finally, serum from a pig zzso infected with zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso zzso sheath zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso sheath protein of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso
