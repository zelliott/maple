The zzso portion of cartilage zzso core zzso zzso expressed by in zzso translation, binds zzso affinity zzso The in zzso expression approach has been used to define the zzso portion of the core zzso The active fragment, which zzso closely to the zzso zzso in the family of zzso zzso animal zzso has been expressed in bacteria and zzso The CD spectrum of the domain is very similar to the spectrum of the binding domain of serum zzso zzso suggesting that its overall structure probably resembles the known three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso The binding specificity of the core protein zzso has been characterized using a zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso site is also similar to that in other zzso zzso zzso
