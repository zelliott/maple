The zzso of the zzso 2 protein zzso of influenza A virus represents an attractive target for developing a universal influenza A zzso with its sequence being highly zzso amongst human zzso of this zzso With the aim of targeting zzso zzso presumably shared by diverse influenza A zzso a vaccine zzso was constructed linking zzso (in its consensus zzso to the zzso zzso zzso due to its zzso region this zzso is known to form zzso in zzso solution and in this manner we hoped to zzso the natural zzso of zzso as presented in zzso zzso was then evaluated side-by-side with synthetic zzso zzso for its zzso and protective efficacy in a zzso influenza challenge zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso fused to the zzso protein zzso an accelerated, zzso and more broadly zzso zzso response than does zzso zzso as measured in two different zzso Most importantly, vaccination with zzso caused a significant decrease in lung virus load early after challenge with influenza A virus and maintained its efficacy against a lethal challenge even at very low vaccine zzso Based on the results presented in this study zzso merits further investigation as a candidate for or as a component of a universal influenza A zzso
