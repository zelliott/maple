We isolated and cultivated 31 strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and marine sediments with low zzso of zzso zzso analysis of small zzso zzso zzso showed that the strains constitute a single zzso the zzso According to combined zzso zzso plus molecular zzso our zzso belong to seven species and five zzso from which three species and two zzso are zzso In addition, previously described zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso are transferred to the zzso We identified a flagellate stage of zzso zzso which was reported to produce only zzso Two environmental sequences previously obtained from zzso environments belong to the zzso as well, suggesting a broad ecological importance of the zzso The zzso of two zzso species was also zzso zzso features of the zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso groove and four zzso and a zzso structure in the zzso A new overall zzso of the zzso is zzso Our data show that the zzso are much more diverse than previously thought and constitute the main zzso lineage within the zzso
