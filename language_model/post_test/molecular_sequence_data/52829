After characterization of a novel zzso protein zzso zzso isolated from the rat zzso zzso the corresponding zzso was cloned by zzso zzso zzso the sequence of which is close to that of previously reported rat zzso has been zzso by the zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 80 zzso in a form identical to the natural protein as shown by zzso zzso sequencing and zzso We observed that, in contrast with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso exhibiting two zzso bonds zzso and zzso a pairing close to that of zzso zzso zzso interacts with fluorescent probe zzso zzso with a zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso Fluorescence experiments revealed that zzso was displaced efficiently by molecules including usual zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso to the large zzso amounts zzso we set up a novel zzso zzso zzso binding zzso to study the zzso of airborne zzso without zzso and attempted to understand the zzso capture by zzso in the zzso zzso under natural zzso The zzso permitted observations on the binding of airborne zzso of different chemical structures and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of airborne zzso in nearly zzso conditions strengthens the role of zzso as volatile zzso zzso carriers in the zzso of the zzso zzso through the zzso barrier towards the zzso zzso
