zzso zzso is indirectly responsible for the maintenance of zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso interacts with a zzso pair operator DNA zzso within it a zzso pair perfect zzso zzso sequence whose bases make a direct contact with the zzso We have zzso six zzso pair zzso consisting of 21 base pair natural operator and its modifications in which certain zzso situated zzso base pairs were replaced systematically with zzso to understand their zzso The binding interaction studies of zzso zzso to such natural and modified operator zzso reported here indicate that the zzso close to the center of symmetry make major contacts with the protein zzso zzso zzso to the periphery form weak zzso zzso protection experiments indicated that when the zzso near the center of symmetry were replaced with zzso the central zzso became more accessible for zzso zzso zzso with possible zzso change in zzso The circular zzso studies indicated that upon zzso binding zzso changes in DNA takes place with a possible increase in zzso of the zzso zzso
