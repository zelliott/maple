zzso strains expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to display an zzso symbiotic performance as a consequence of lowering the plant zzso levels that inhibit the zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso zzso have been studied in zzso zzso however, not much is known about the presence of zzso genes in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and zzso of zzso genes in zzso strains including a collection of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso genes were detected in 10 of 12 zzso type strains as well as in 18 of 18 zzso zzso zzso studied in this zzso No zzso zzso activity was detected in any zzso strain tested under zzso zzso Despite the lack of zzso zzso activity, it was possible to demonstrate that in zzso zzso zzso , the zzso gene is transcribed under symbiotic zzso zzso analysis indicates that strains belonging to different species of zzso but zzso the same host plant, have similar zzso zzso suggesting that zzso genes are zzso acquired by transfer of the zzso zzso This data, together with analysis of the zzso islands from completely zzso zzso zzso suggest the presence of the zzso gene in a zzso common zzso that possessed this gene in a unique zzso zzso
