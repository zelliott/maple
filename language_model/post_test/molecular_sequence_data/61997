zzso is among the most frequent targets of zzso zzso in human zzso We report here the molecular analysis of a zzso that has disrupted zzso in a patient with de zzso zzso acute zzso zzso By using zzso analysis, we show that this zzso results in the fusion of a novel gene immediately downstream of zzso 5 or zzso 6 of zzso indicating that the zzso zzso lies in zzso 6 and that alternative fusion zzso zzso are zzso The sequence of the novel zzso located at zzso does not have any significant zzso with any of the known genes in the human zzso DNA zzso However, the first 118 bases are identical to a part of a human zzso zzso Also, its high zzso with mouse and rat sequences suggests that this sequence most probably represents a part of a novel zzso which we named zzso zzso Gene 7 to zzso Following the zzso open reading frame, the zzso sequence encodes an unknown protein of 27 zzso zzso We isolated three bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones that contain the zzso sequence and confirmed the zzso of the gene on the patient's zzso spreads by zzso in zzso zzso using these zzso as zzso zzso and Northern zzso analyses revealed that zzso is expressed in zzso and skeletal muscle zzso The predicted zzso zzso proteins contained a limited number of zzso fused to zzso in a situation similar to that reported for the zzso fusion that is a product of zzso It is possible that the expression of a zzso shortened zzso could compete with full-length zzso and act as a dominant negative inhibitor of the promoters that the core binding factor zzso
