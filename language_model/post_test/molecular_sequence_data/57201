A new zzso called zzso has been isolated and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Its complete zzso acid sequence has been zzso The zzso zzso consists of 100 zzso including 9 zzso and has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso mass zzso In its native form, zzso is a zzso as deduced from molecular sieve zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to contain zzso zzso zzso iron atoms and 13 zzso 1 zzso sulfur zzso consistent with the presence of four zzso zzso The zzso visible zzso spectrum of oxidized zzso exhibited zzso at 282 and at zzso zzso and a shoulder near 314 zzso zzso was fully reduced by excess zzso at pH zzso or zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso of reduced zzso with zzso indicated that each zzso zzso exchanges two zzso Exposure of zzso to air resulted in a rapid and irreversible zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso spectrum of fully reduced zzso showed a broad signal with an average g value of zzso that integrated to about two zzso zzso analysis of partially reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a complex set of signals which was interpreted as being the resulting sum of the contribution of two distinct zzso zzso Based on its zzso and zzso properties, it is concluded that zzso is a zzso zzso containing four zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso occurs only under growth conditions allowing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of in zzso electron transfer zzso indicate that zzso cannot serve as an electron donor to zzso
