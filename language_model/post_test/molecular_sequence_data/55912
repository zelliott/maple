The structure of the zzso hybrid zzso where zzso letters designate zzso zzso has been determined on the basis of zzso analysis and zzso zzso The central zzso in this sequence has been previously studied zzso zzso zzso Salisbury, zzso zzso Brown, zzso Williams, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via one-dimensional zzso methods and circular zzso zzso zzso to their results, we find that this duplex does not assume a zzso zzso in zzso Instead, the zzso zzso retain their zzso zzso zzso as indicated by the absence of zzso zzso and by strong zzso to zzso zzso The zzso of the DNA zzso on the other hand, do not assume an zzso (or a zzso zzso but an intermediate zzso in the zzso range zzso approximately zzso zzso as indicated by the presence of strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cross peaks, strong zzso zzso cross peaks, and zzso zzso zzso that are of approximately the same magnitude as the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso strand not only retains its zzso structure but also exerts an influence on the zzso of the DNA zzso Our results provide strong evidence that zzso hybrid duplexes do not assume an zzso zzso zzso neither do they assume an zzso zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, although not the main focus of this study, a comparison of the zzso relaxation times of the DNA and zzso zzso indicates the need for extended relaxation delays in two-dimensional zzso zzso of hybrid duplexes, as has been previously observed for zzso zzso duplexes zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Flynn, zzso & Reid, zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso
