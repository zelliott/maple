The aim of these studies was to examine the organization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso virulent strain of zzso zzso were zzso and used to raise a specific zzso in zzso This zzso was used in a colony zzso to screen a zzso DNA library constructed in zzso coli using zzso zzso zzso DNA and the zzso zzso An zzso coli clone expressing a zzso zzso zzso was zzso No zzso activity was detected in the culture media, or in crude soluble and membrane zzso prepared from this zzso zzso mapping and deletion analysis of the zzso zzso zzso was used to locate the coding region to a zzso zzso zzso which was subsequently zzso A large open reading frame was found to extend through the zzso site from a putative start zzso just downstream from the zzso site, which indicated that the complete gene was not zzso Southern zzso demonstrated that there were at least three zzso zzso zzso fragments which were zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Based on these results the existence of multiple zzso genes in zzso zzso was zzso
