zzso protein D zzso is an zzso C type zzso that promotes zzso by binding to microbial surface zzso A zzso zzso zzso has been shown to bind zzso in the presence of calcium but does so independently of zzso zzso This protein exists both in a soluble form and in association with the zzso of zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso has been established by molecular zzso which yielded a zzso zzso sequence zzso a zzso chain of 2, 413 zzso zzso The domain organization features 13 scavenger zzso zzso zzso zzso each separated by an zzso domain, except for zzso 4 and 5, which are zzso The 13 zzso zzso are followed by two zzso zzso zzso zzso separated by a 14th zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be an alternative spliced form of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the main sites of synthesis of zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso and zzso zzso revealed strong zzso for zzso in zzso and other tissue zzso zzso of the zzso membrane was either uniform or focal in a way that suggested zzso whereas other zzso showed strong zzso zzso within the zzso zzso In some zzso zzso and zzso were located in the same cellular zzso zzso zzso was also found in zzso cells of the small zzso and in the ducts of zzso zzso The distribution of zzso in zzso is compatible with a role as an zzso zzso for zzso
