In Europe, southern zzso served as zzso during cold periods in the zzso acting both as zzso of origin of zzso and as sources from which formerly zzso areas were zzso during zzso zzso Previous studies have revealed that within the main zzso areas, zzso lineages often survived in zzso zzso We zzso two zzso markers zzso control region, approximately zzso zzso in 103 individuals representing the entire distribution of zzso zzso a zzso endemic to the western zzso zzso We zzso the evolutionary history of the species through zzso zzso and historical demographic zzso The results revealed unexpected, deep levels of geographically structured genetic zzso We identified two main evolutionary zzso each containing three zzso zzso The first historical split involved populations from zzso coastal zzso and the zzso of all the remaining populations around zzso million years zzso Both lineages were subsequently fragmented into different population groups between zzso and zzso million years zzso According to zzso zzso analysis, at lower zzso levels the patterns suggest restricted gene flow with isolation by distance, whereas at higher levels the zzso exhibit signatures of zzso range zzso zzso Skyline zzso show recent zzso followed by demographic expansions in all zzso The significant genetic structure found is consistent with long-term survival of populations in zzso zzso supporting the zzso scenario for southern European zzso The comparison of our results with other zzso species highlights the zzso of this hypothesis for the zzso zzso and suggests that Mediterranean zzso had more relevance for the composition and distribution of present zzso patterns than currently zzso We briefly discuss the zzso and conservation implications of our zzso
