zzso a major zzso zzso expressed in the zzso is zzso at increased rates in response to infectious agents, zzso that zzso exert a protective role against zzso zzso However, zzso and pathological studies suggest that excessive zzso zzso causes airways obstruction and zzso To determine whether increased zzso zzso alone produces airway obstruction and/or zzso we generated a mouse model zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was cloned from mouse lungs and zzso internally with zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso analysis demonstrated an approximate zzso increase in zzso zzso which formed zzso zzso zzso studies and cell counts revealed no airway zzso obstruction or inflammation in the lungs of zzso zzso zzso zzso clearance was zzso zzso that the excess zzso zzso produced an zzso rather than more concentrated zzso layer, a prediction confirmed by electron zzso To test whether the larger zzso barrier zzso increased protection against zzso zzso animals were challenged with zzso influenza viruses and showed significant decreases in infection and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced infection, likely via binding to zzso zzso zzso consistent with influenza protection in zzso In conclusion, the normal zzso transport and absence of a pulmonary zzso in zzso mice suggests that zzso zzso alone is not sufficient to trigger zzso zzso plugging or airways zzso cell zzso In contrast, increased zzso zzso appears to exhibit a protective role against influenza zzso
