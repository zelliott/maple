zzso S zzso a type B zzso zzso zzso bond synthesis in zzso and in zzso The attachment of zzso S to the large zzso zzso zzso is competitively inhibited by zzso zzso a zzso and enhanced by zzso M zzso a type A zzso We have previously zzso by zzso energy transfer zzso that zzso S binds at the base of the central zzso of zzso the putative location of zzso domain zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 25, zzso In the present work, the zzso protein components at the zzso S binding site were affinity labeled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso Evidence has been provided for zzso the association constant of zzso complex formation being similar to that of native zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso being antagonized by zzso and enhanced by zzso M, and zzso a specific linkage of zzso with a single region of zzso with virtually no fixation to zzso After zzso of zzso zzso complexes, the resulting zzso proteins have been zzso by zzso and zzso to zzso and the zzso proteins have been detected by an zzso zzso More than zzso of label was present within a double spot corresponding to proteins zzso and zzso whose zzso were modified by the zzso zzso It is concluded that these proteins are components of the zzso domain of bacterial zzso for which a topographical model, including the available literature data, is zzso
