Many chemotherapy regiments are successfully used to treat breast zzso however, often breast cancer cells develop drug resistance that usually leads to a zzso and worsening of zzso We have shown recently that zzso changes such as DNA zzso and zzso modifications play an important role in breast cancer cell resistance to zzso zzso Another mechanism of gene expression control is zzso via the function of small regulatory zzso particularly zzso zzso its role in cancer cell drug resistance still remains zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in the resistance of human zzso breast zzso cells to zzso zzso Here, we for the first time show that zzso zzso cells zzso exhibit a considerable zzso of the zzso profile and altered expression of zzso processing zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso link of zzso deregulation and the zzso zzso of zzso cells was evidenced by a remarkable correlation between specific zzso expression and corresponding changes in protein levels of their targets, specifically those ones that have a documented role in cancer drug zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso regulates the expression of zzso resistance 1 zzso More importantly, zzso of the zzso cells with zzso resulted in the increased sensitivity of cells to zzso indicating that correction of altered expression of zzso may have significant implications for therapeutic strategies aiming to overcome cancer cell zzso
