The zzso of human zzso zzso light chain constant region gene zzso has been identified by the zzso zzso or DNA typing zzso The three zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso acid zzso at positions of zzso 153 and 191 in the zzso light chain constant zzso The zzso zzso were designated as zzso zzso has zzso zzso at position 153 and zzso zzso at zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso chain zzso specific zzso zzso was used to provide a specific zzso typing system for the zzso gene in zzso unrelated zzso For zzso zzso the zzso coding regions plus 35 zzso of the 3' untranslated regions were amplified with specific zzso zzso genes were zzso with zzso zzso zzso at positions of zzso 153 and 191 and were detected using a zzso detection zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The estimated zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso or the zzso of zzso was not observed in this zzso The zzso method distinguished the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also distinguished the zzso from zzso zzso zzso vary significantly among various zzso zzso in Koreans was very similar to those observed in northern Chinese, Japanese, and the native people of British zzso It was lower than that reported in zzso Indian, or southern zzso
