zzso gene zzso has been previously zzso as a cell wall protein of either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein families zzso zzso However, zzso shows important differences between its zzso acid sequence and these other zzso zzso lacks any motifs typical of major groups of cell wall zzso but contains 36 repeats of a unique zzso zzso which we have named the zzso zzso This motif is repeated in only one other zzso protein zzso but proteins containing repeated zzso motifs are found in many other zzso zzso is predicted to zzso an zzso zzso zzso We characterized the zzso of transgenic zzso with either reduced zzso or increased zzso zzso zzso transcript expression of zzso zzso lines exhibited significantly slower zzso and root growth, while zzso lines had accelerated zzso and root growth compared to wild zzso Similarly, when grown on soil, zzso lines had delayed growth and zzso while zzso lines had accelerated growth and flowering as compared to wild zzso Based on zzso acid zzso the presence of a distinct repeated zzso motif and predicted zzso zzso structure, we conclude that zzso is not an zzso zzso or zzso zzso Because zzso is a distinct and zzso zzso we propose to name it zzso and to name its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary for normal rates of zzso and growth, while zzso of zzso is sufficient to accelerate zzso and zzso
