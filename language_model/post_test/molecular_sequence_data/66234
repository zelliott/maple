zzso zzso is zzso zzso bacteria associated with canine zzso There is little information available about the specific identify and relative occurrence of pigmented zzso in companion zzso Our aim was to clarify the factor involved in the adherence and colonization of the zzso in the oral zzso zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of this protein was approximately zzso as estimated by zzso An zzso against zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso revealed that the zzso zzso serum bound to zzso on the cell surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso had the same size and zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the deduced zzso acid sequences have zzso zzso zzso zzso has adherent ability to zzso zzso zzso The properties of zzso zzso zzso are similar to those of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the surface structure of zzso zzso may play a role in the colonization of this zzso in zzso pockets in companion zzso
