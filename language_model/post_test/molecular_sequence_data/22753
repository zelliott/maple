The plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso has an important role in terminating zzso zzso by zzso of zzso from the synaptic zzso The expression of zzso on the cell surface is therefore a critical zzso In this study, we examined the role of the zzso zzso of zzso in trafficking to the plasma zzso zzso zzso activity was used to measure the effects of systematic deletions or zzso zzso in the zzso We found that deletion of 16 zzso acids in the zzso zzso had no effect on zzso activity, whereas further deletion was zzso for the function of zzso Cell surface zzso was used to determine the role of the zzso in zzso and zzso We showed that the zzso is crucial for the delivery of zzso to the plasma membrane and that the deletion of this part of the zzso results in a lack of mature zzso and impaired trafficking to the plasma zzso Furthermore, the zzso truncated zzso were shown to have a dominant negative effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso
