zzso disease zzso is associated with expansion of a zzso repeat in a new zzso We have recently defined a zzso in a paternal zzso of 30 to 38 zzso repeats in the HD gene which is greater than that seen in the general population zzso 30 zzso but below the range seen in patients with HD zzso zzso These intermediate zzso are unstable during transmission through the zzso and in sporadic cases expand to the full zzso associated with the clinical zzso of zzso Here we have zzso three new zzso families where, in each, the zzso and at least one zzso have zzso sizes in the HD zzso In one of these families, two zzso with expanded zzso repeats are both clinically affected with zzso thus presenting a zzso pattern of zzso In all three families the parental intermediate zzso has expanded in more than one zzso thus showing a previously zzso risk of inheriting HD to zzso of sporadic cases of zzso
