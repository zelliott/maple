The fruit fly zzso zzso has been extensively used to identify genes required for zzso cell zzso We show that the zzso zzso originally isolated as a zzso visual zzso with an zzso zzso encodes two novel zzso zzso We identified the DNA sequences zzso the zzso gene by rescuing the zzso zzso using zzso germ line zzso The zzso locus is expressed as two extensively overlapping zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both proteins contain a putative protein zzso domain joined to a domain zzso to the head region of the zzso heavy chain and are zzso restricted to zzso zzso
