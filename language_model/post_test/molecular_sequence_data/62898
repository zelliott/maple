A rice nuclear zzso zzso restores the zzso fertility disturbed by the zzso male sterile zzso and is widely used for commercial seed production of zzso hybrid zzso zzso fragments carrying zzso were identified by conducting zzso walking and a series of zzso zzso Isolation and analysis of zzso clones corresponding to the fragments demonstrated that zzso encodes a zzso targeted protein containing 16 repeats of the zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso lacks one zzso in the putative coding region, presumably resulting in zzso a truncated protein because of a frame zzso Rice zzso is the first zzso gene isolated from cereal crops that has the property of reducing the expression of the zzso male zzso zzso zzso gene like many other zzso zzso The present findings may facilitate not only zzso the mechanisms of male zzso by the zzso zzso and its restoration by zzso but also zzso other zzso genes from cereal crops, especially zzso
