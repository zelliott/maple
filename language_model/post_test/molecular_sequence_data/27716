zzso pharmacological and zzso evidence implies the existence of tissue specific zzso of the zzso zzso The alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso of the skeletal muscle calcium channel have been previously cloned and their zzso acid sequence zzso Here we report the isolation and sequencing of a partial zzso that encodes a heart specific zzso of the alpha 1 zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from this part zzso clone shows zzso similarity with the skeletal muscle alpha 1 zzso Northern analysis reveals 2 zzso bands, zzso and 13 zzso in contrast to one zzso zzso band in the skeletal zzso Selective zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso by complementary zzso derived from the heart clone provides further evidence that the zzso zzso to an essential component of the zzso These data further support the existence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
