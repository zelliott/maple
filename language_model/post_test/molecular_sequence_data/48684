zzso gene regulation via designed zzso factors has great potential for precise zzso modification and acceleration of novel crop trait zzso To this end, designed zzso zzso have been constructed by fusing zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso virus, zzso was used to identify plant regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified from each protein and fused with zinc finger zzso proteins zzso to generate designed zzso zzso In addition, specific sequences within each zzso zzso domain were modified to mimic the zzso contact motif that interacts directly with zzso zzso II core zzso zzso To evaluate these designed zzso zzso test systems were built in zzso and tobacco zzso reporter genes driven by promoters containing zzso sites upstream of the zzso start zzso In zzso zzso zzso from the plant proteins zzso and zzso activated zzso reporter gene expression to levels similar to zzso and the modified sequences displayed even greater levels of zzso Following stable transformation of the tobacco reporter system with zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso reporter gene transcript zzso was equal to or greater than those derived from zzso Moreover, a modified zzso domain displayed significantly enhanced zzso zzso compared with zzso and with the unmodified zzso zzso These results demonstrate that plant sequences capable of zzso zzso zzso can be found and, when fused to zzso zzso can enhance gene zzso
