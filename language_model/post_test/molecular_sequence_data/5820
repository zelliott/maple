Maintenance of a negative membrane potential in the cortical collecting duct zzso principal cell depends on a zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso In the present study, a candidate zzso zzso this zzso channel, zzso was isolated from a mouse collecting duct cell line, zzso zzso shares a high degree of zzso with a human brain zzso zzso channel zzso zzso By Northern analysis, zzso transcript zzso zzso was readily detected in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso canine zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso or monkey kidney zzso cell zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction confirmed zzso expression in the zzso zzso expression studies in zzso zzso revealed that zzso operates as strongly zzso zzso zzso The zzso selectivity profile of zzso zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Na zzso zzso is similar to the zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibits the pharmacological features of the native zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso functions as a high open zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso consistent with the native zzso Based on these independent lines of evidence, zzso is a possible candidate for the zzso zzso zzso channel in the zzso
