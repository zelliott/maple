zzso zzso zzso are frequently expressed in many different types of cancer, whereas their expression in normal zzso is limited to the germ cells of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso proteins may be attractive candidates for zzso of zzso This review describes the structure and zzso of the zzso family members and presents a revised zzso which will enable a more clear distinction of genes and gene zzso The zzso gene locus at zzso X zzso consists of at least 16 zzso each of which is located in one of an equal number of highly zzso tandem repeats, and more genes remain to be zzso These genes are likely the creation of unequal replication under positive selection after the divergence of primates from other zzso The zzso products are predicted to be highly similar small zzso proteins involved in germ cell zzso When expressed in tumor cells, zzso proteins can elicit both cellular and zzso immune responses, indicating that they are appropriate targets for cancer zzso The potential use of zzso proteins in cancer zzso including possible limitations, is also zzso
