The risks of zzso viral infection by blood and products derived from plasma have long been known and still remain an area of zzso Blood banks and zzso zzso are faced with the imminent introduction of zzso acid amplification testing zzso of plasma pools as used by the plasma zzso In this paper, we show a part of our results of a validation study of an in-house method for routine zzso chain reaction zzso screening for zzso C virus zzso zzso in plasma pools and the results of testing zzso zzso negative plasma pools for the presence of zzso zzso The European Committee for zzso Medical Products zzso recommended that from 1 July 1999, only batches derived from plasma pools tested and found zzso for zzso zzso using validated test methods of suitable sensitivity and zzso should be batch released by zzso The quality and efficiency of zzso detection of zzso zzso is among others influenced by the efficacy of zzso isolation, the primer selection and the use of control zzso Using modern molecular biology techniques zzso and specific in-house amplification methods for detection of zzso zzso and automated zzso we zzso samples of plasma pools from different Croatian zzso zzso By detection of zzso zzso in an zzso working zzso zzso 3) and a zzso zzso zzso run control zzso 1) we determined a high zzso and sensitivity zzso 100 International Units zzso for our in-house zzso By direct sequencing zzso zzso we proved the specificity of the test system and the possibility of determining the zzso zzso when the method was used for zzso screening of zzso zzso in single zzso Of zzso zzso negative plasma pools we have found that zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso of our investigation confirm the necessity of testing zzso zzso in plasma pools to further increase the safety of human zzso zzso
