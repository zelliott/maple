The determination of zzso concentration in liver samples is likely to provide interesting insights for the study of disease progression and for evaluation of the efficacy of zzso zzso 

A procedure was developed for the precise zzso of zzso in liver zzso based on the competitive reverse zzso chain reaction zzso This competitive zzso consists of the zzso of the target zzso with known amounts of a competitor zzso zzso containing the same sequence as the target plus an zzso in the middle, allowing resolution of the two amplification products by gel zzso 

The amounts of zzso and zzso zzso (the latter being used as an internal standard to overcome the problem of zzso of quantitative zzso zzso were evaluated in liver zzso of 15 patients affected by zzso C zzso chronic liver disease at the time of zzso All the patients underwent zzso therapy for 6 months and were subsequently followed for at least 1 further year after the end of zzso zzso zzso concentration (which ranged from 2 to zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules per zzso zzso zzso directly correlated with the efficacy of treatment, indicating that low levels of viral replication in the liver are associated with a poor response to zzso 

This study suggests that the determination of viral load in the liver is an important zzso tool for the prediction of the efficacy of zzso zzso
