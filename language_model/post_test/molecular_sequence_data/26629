zzso zzso one of the most economically important fruit fly zzso in East Asia, is well adapted to various environmental zzso zzso pathogens and other stresses can cause zzso damage in most zzso The zzso zzso zzso family contains some of the most important zzso in the zzso protection system of the fruit fly and other zzso 

Four full-length zzso sequences zzso one zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The expression profiles of these four genes under different stresses showed them to be involved in response to zzso conditions including heavy metals, zzso extreme temperatures and zzso zzso zzso More specifically, the expression levels of these genes were found to be depressed in the presence of copper, zinc and zzso The expression of all four zzso genes increased upon exposure to lead, cadmium, low temperature zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso zzso increased significantly at high temperature (40 zzso zzso The expressions levels of zzso and zzso increased significantly in the presence of zzso and zzso but only the expression of zzso increased in the presence of zzso zzso 

These different expression profiles suggest that the four zzso play different roles and respond to different zzso stresses in zzso zzso Some zzso undergo specific reaction in the response to specific zzso zzso
