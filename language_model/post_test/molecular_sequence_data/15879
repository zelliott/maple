We have determined the molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso and the zzso effect on indirect flight muscle, jump muscle, and zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso is essentially a zzso zzso which results in the zzso and zzso zzso associated with this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O'Donnell, zzso zzso Bernstein, zzso zzso zzso Wright, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso deletion in the zzso gene which removes most of zzso 5 and the zzso that precedes zzso zzso zzso mapping indicates that zzso transcripts follow two alternative processing zzso Both pathways result in the production of mature transcripts with altered reading zzso apparently yielding zzso truncated zzso zzso Interestingly, the preferred zzso zzso uses the more zzso of two available zzso donor zzso We present the first zzso characterization of a completely zzso muscle and show that it lacks any zzso thick zzso zzso in these muscles are completely zzso suggesting that thick filaments play a critical role in zzso zzso To understand why the zzso zzso severely zzso indirect flight muscle and jump muscle function in zzso but does not seriously affect the function of other muscle types, we examined the muscle zzso of zzso zzso We find that these organisms have a nearly 50% reduction in the number of thick filaments in indirect flight muscle, jump muscle, and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso shaped thick filaments are common in the jump muscle and zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the differential sensitivity of muscle function to the zzso zzso is a consequence of the unique zzso zzso in each of these zzso The highly variable zzso array of zzso zzso muscle makes its function relatively insensitive to changes in thick filament number and zzso zzso the rigid double zzso lattice of the indirect flight muscle, and the organized lattice of the jump muscle cannot be zzso without interfering with the specialized and zzso more complex functions they zzso
