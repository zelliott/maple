zzso cell zzso zzso is a form of male zzso in which zzso cell differentiation and testosterone production are zzso This report describes the first case of a nonsense zzso zzso in zzso 11 of the human zzso hormone zzso zzso gene in two sisters with zzso This zzso causes loss of function of the zzso by introducing a stop zzso at zzso zzso in zzso zzso 5 of the zzso Surface expression of the truncated zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso was diminished compared to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso These results establish that single base zzso in zzso 11 of the zzso gene can produce zzso as well as zzso of the zzso Furthermore, they demonstrate that functional zzso between zzso zzso 5 and the zzso zzso tail of the zzso are required for normal cell surface expression of the zzso and signal zzso
