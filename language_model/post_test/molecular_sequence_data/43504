The complete sequence of a 36 196 zzso DNA segment located on the right arm of zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been determined and zzso The sequence includes the zzso coding region of the zzso zzso the zzso leader zzso sequence and 17 open reading frames zzso of at least 100 zzso zzso Two of these zzso to previously known genes zzso zzso whereas 15 zzso to new zzso The putative translation products of three zzso show significant similarity with known zzso one is a putative transport zzso another appears to be a zzso zzso and the third is an zzso zzso
