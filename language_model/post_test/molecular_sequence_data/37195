We designed a screen to identify zzso zzso proteins able to bind zzso zzso B by affinity zzso on a zzso B zzso zzso displaying low affinity for zzso We identified a zzso protein previously described as a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso is zzso by a single zzso gene and the native protein is matured by zzso a signal zzso We firmly establish the fact that it is a true zzso zzso zzso since the zzso protein binds zzso zzso B in absence of any zzso Finally, we show that the zzso of zzso and of zzso zzso in maturing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and first polar body zzso
