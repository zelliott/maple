zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the most abundant zzso of plants, improving plant productivity and zzso They are thought to mostly grow zzso a trait assumed to limit zzso However, zzso can also harbor genetically different zzso zzso It has been shown that one zzso can produce zzso novel offspring with proportions of different zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso respond rapidly to a change of environment zzso zzso through changes in the frequency of zzso zzso zzso novel offspring exhibit different genetic responses to environmental change than the zzso and zzso zzso novel offspring exhibit a wide range of zzso plasticity to a change of zzso We subjected zzso parents and offspring to a host zzso We observed rapid and large zzso changes in all zzso lines that were not zzso zzso and zzso responses were different among offspring and their zzso Even though growing zzso zzso offspring display a broad range of zzso and zzso changes in response to host zzso We conclude that zzso have the ability to rapidly produce variable zzso increasing their probability to produce offspring with different fitness than their parents and, consequently, their potential zzso to new environmental zzso Such zzso and zzso flexibility could be a fast alternative to sexual reproduction and is likely to be a key to the ecological success of zzso
