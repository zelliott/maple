The zzso C virus zzso zzso region zzso is important for virus infection and zzso zzso Here, we constructed a panel of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso sequences from different zzso strains or types, and examined the requirements for stable zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso from zzso strain zzso and other zzso genes from type zzso strain zzso supported stable colony formation and replication in zzso zzso However, extending the type zzso sequence to include 132 zzso acids of zzso resulted in a defective zzso zzso In contrast, a similar zzso containing zzso strain zzso sequences linked in zzso to zzso zzso and zzso supported stable replication suggesting that the interaction between the zzso proteins and the zzso may represent a critical zzso Lastly, the type zzso zzso from zzso was unable to zzso replication when paired with zzso coding sequences from zzso or zzso and the zzso from zzso was unable to zzso replication when paired with zzso or zzso zzso These results highlighted the importance of sequence specific interaction among zzso and two distinct zzso of the zzso coding region as a zzso in supporting stable replication of zzso zzso The results underscore the importance of directly cloning zzso sequences from relevant clinical zzso
