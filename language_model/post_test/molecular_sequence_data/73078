zzso zzso are a family of zzso with a diverse zzso specificity and zzso zzso Members of this group of zzso are found in zzso zzso bacteria, zzso bacteria and in the zzso of humans and other zzso but so far none have been zzso A zzso in the human gene zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a zzso disease which leads to severe zzso thus reflecting the importance of this family of zzso All zzso share a common mechanism in which the zzso zzso is transferred from a donor zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The transfer has been described by a zzso mechanism in which zzso is bound to the zzso zzso of the zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso We describe here the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso from the strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso activates zzso to zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso We initiated this project to gain further insight into the function of this zzso and the structural basis for the characteristics of zzso 

The crystal structure of zzso was solved by multiple zzso replacement to zzso A zzso The zzso is a zzso and its overall arrangement of zzso can be regarded as an zzso obeying 222 zzso Both zzso A and B belong to the open zzso class and can be described as a zzso zzso type with a novel composition and connectivity of the secondary structure zzso The core of zzso A consists of seven zzso repeats resulting in an all parallel central beta sheet, against which zzso pack from both zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso B is formed by a zzso mixed beta zzso In both zzso the zzso C zzso is folded back onto the zzso domain to form the third layer of zzso 

The active site of zzso is located at the interface of zzso A and B and is formed by zzso of both zzso The zzso opening to the active site has a depth and diameter of about 20 A with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso B, at the zzso The zzso zzso zzso is stabilized by hydrogen zzso Despite very low zzso acid sequence zzso zzso A and B reveal a similar overall zzso Large parts of their structures can be zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso have evolved from a common zzso
