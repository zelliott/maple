To date, two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been discovered in the wood frog, zzso zzso and likely support freezing zzso Although previous studies have established tissue distribution of each zzso there have been no studies that explore their functional consequences in intolerant zzso To assess the ability of zzso and zzso to zzso freeze zzso we zzso each protein into a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso controls were the zzso of an unrelated protein zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, greater survival after freezing at zzso for 1 h than did zzso zzso To investigate how these novel proteins protect cells from freezing damage, protein structures were predicted from primary zzso acid zzso Analysis of the structures indicated that zzso is a zzso protein and may be a new type IV zzso zzso whereas zzso may have zzso membrane associated zzso This study shows that freezing protection can be provided to intolerant cells by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from this study will provide new insights into adapting intolerant cells for medical organ zzso using a natural zzso model of zzso
