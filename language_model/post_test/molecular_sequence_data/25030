The cell surface of zzso zzso zzso zzso is completely covered by an zzso lattice which consists of the zzso protein zzso On zzso gels, the mature zzso protein zzso as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of 122 zzso During zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 67 degrees C instead of 55 degrees C, a zzso developed that had a secondary cell wall zzso identical to that of the zzso strain, but it carried an zzso zzso that could be separated on zzso gels into four bands with apparent molecular masses of 92, zzso 150 and 175 zzso After zzso only a single protein band with a molecular mass of 92 zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence zzso the protein zzso of this zzso zzso termed zzso was established by zzso and inverse zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso with a zzso signal zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso the signal zzso and the zzso sequence zzso acids zzso different zzso for zzso and zzso were observed in 46 positions, but zzso of these zzso were silent, thus leading to a level of identity of zzso for the zzso zzso The level of identity of the remaining parts of zzso and zzso was below zzso indicating that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso region in combination with a distinct type of secondary cell wall zzso remained zzso upon zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso the mature zzso protein cloned into the zzso zzso led to stable expression in zzso coli zzso This is the first example demonstrating that zzso variation leads to the synthesis of an zzso zzso
