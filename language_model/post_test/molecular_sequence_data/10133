The zzso method restriction zzso protection, selection, and amplification zzso was used to determine the preferred duplex DNA binding sites of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After 12 rounds of zzso several sequences were identified that bound zzso with an apparent affinity of zzso zzso Among these, the zzso sites averaged 10 zzso in zzso suggesting that these sites may be occupied by zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso approach that allows the identification of preferred DNA targets for small zzso zzso at zzso relevant zzso in zzso As such, it should prove useful in the design and screening of zzso zzso zzso
