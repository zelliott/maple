The zzso zzso gene zzso which codes for the zzso structural zzso was identified by DNA sequence analysis in a collection of DNA fragments bearing in zzso promoters for the zzso 28 form of zzso zzso The zzso gene and adjacent regions of the zzso zzso zzso were restriction zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso The zzso gene was transcribed at all stages of growth from a single promoter that had sequences in the promoter recognition region characteristic of the consensus sequence for the zzso 28 zzso zzso of zzso was eliminated by zzso zzso that blocked synthesis of the zzso 28 zzso These findings provide strong support for the previous proposal that the zzso 28 form of zzso zzso controls zzso of a zzso specifying zzso zzso and zzso functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso increased during exponential growth and peaked as the zzso zzso cells entered the stationary zzso The transcript levels then decreased to zero within 4 h after the onset of zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso function is temporally zzso
