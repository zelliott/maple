zzso zzso zzso is a rare bleeding disorder resulting from zzso in either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The disease is relatively frequent in highly zzso populations such as Iraqi zzso The molecular basis of zzso in 6 unrelated zzso patients was previously identified as an zzso deletion in zzso 12 of the zzso zzso We now describe a second zzso found in 3 unrelated zzso families that consists of an zzso deletion between an zzso repeat in zzso 9 and zzso 13 of the zzso zzso The zzso DNA is transcribed into zzso in which zzso 10 through 13 are zzso zzso of zzso 9 directly to zzso 14 leads to a shift in the reading frame resulting in a stop zzso The predicted protein is truncated in the middle of the third zzso domain before the zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were devised for identification of both zzso in Iraqi Jews for the purpose of carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis enabling prevention of zzso A survey of the general zzso population for the first zzso deletion and the second zzso deletion disclosed that the zzso frequency of the first zzso was zzso whereas none of 700 individuals examined bore the second zzso zzso frequency zzso Among 40 zzso patients of zzso origin 31 were zzso for the first zzso 4 were compound zzso for the first and second zzso and 2 were zzso for the second zzso zzso analyses using 4 zzso markers in the zzso gene showed that each zzso originated in a distinct zzso
