The zzso zzso cells of the pond snail zzso zzso generate long lasting zzso of zzso zzso activity to release their zzso During zzso cell zzso a zzso factor is released which zzso similar zzso in silent zzso cells zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) Brain zzso zzso zzso To identify this factor, the zzso effects of putative zzso cell gene products, zzso zzso cell hormone, four alpha zzso cell peptides and three beta zzso cell zzso were tested individually and in various zzso zzso alpha zzso cell zzso and beta 1 zzso cell zzso each had no effect on membrane potential or zzso of the zzso zzso All other zzso cell peptides caused zzso responses, but did not induce zzso Instead, only a specific combination of four zzso cell zzso zzso cell hormone and alpha zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso evoked zzso cell zzso with similar characteristics to zzso evoked zzso zzso versions of this combination failed to cause a zzso In addition, zzso to zzso cell hormone or alpha zzso cell zzso reduced zzso cell zzso and prevented the generation of zzso by electrical zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso caused by four zzso cell peptides provides a means to amplify zzso zzso thus leading to the generation of the all-or-nothing zzso cell zzso
