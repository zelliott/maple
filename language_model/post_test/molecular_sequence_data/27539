zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides are zzso zzso peptides that are widely distributed in the zzso zzso In known members of zzso zzso zzso an array consisting of eight zzso zzso is completely zzso In this study, we report a novel member zzso which contains only six zzso zzso in the pig round zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso deleted in zzso were not identical to a pair of zzso forming a zzso bridge in zzso suggesting a zzso of zzso bonding zzso Gene organization and zzso analyses suggested that zzso was generated from an ancestral zzso gene after the divergence of zzso from zzso zzso transcripts dramatically increased after bacterial injection, suggesting that zzso may contribute to immunity in zzso
