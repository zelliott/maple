It has been previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso from the promoters zzso and zzso An additional internal promoter is identified and designated zzso This internal promoter, which allows independent expression of zzso has been analyzed both in zzso and in zzso Our results indicate that: zzso zzso exists in both zzso coli K-12 and zzso zzso as demonstrated by fusion to the zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso coding sequence of zzso zzso the zzso sequences are not identical for these two bacterial zzso zzso zzso from zzso of zzso coli K-12 was zzso zzso expression from zzso responds to the availability of zzso zzso potential 3' zzso zzso zzso protein binding sites exist adjacent to zzso
