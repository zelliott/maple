Human zzso virus type 1 zzso containing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso finger zzso have greatly reduced zzso even though zzso packaging is largely unaffected in certain zzso To examine replication zzso viral DNA zzso was isolated from cells infected with viruses containing zzso changes in their zzso fingers zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso a double zzso zzso or zzso zzso In zzso zzso have established potential roles for NC in reverse zzso and zzso In zzso results for these processes were obtained by quantitative zzso cloning of zzso products, and comparison of the quantity and composition of zzso generated at discrete points during reverse zzso zzso analysis of the reverse zzso zzso for these species strongly suggests decreased stability of the DNA zzso Both zzso finger zzso appear to be defective in DNA zzso with the zzso and zzso transfer processes being affected while interior portions of the zzso remain more zzso zzso obtained from zzso amplification and cloning of zzso circle junction fragments revealed that the NC zzso had a zzso similar to the IN zzso removal of the terminal CA zzso necessary for integration of the zzso is disabled by the NC zzso Thus, the loss of zzso in these NC zzso in zzso appears to result from defective reverse zzso and integration processes stemming from decreased protection of the full-length zzso Finally, these results indicate that the zzso activity of NC extends from the management of viral zzso through to the full-length zzso
