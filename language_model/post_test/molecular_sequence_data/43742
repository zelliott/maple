The authors report on the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso were extracted from the zzso of a patient zzso with zzso The protein zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso by gel zzso zzso performed on the zzso protein material showed zzso protein bands in the range of 22 to 32 zzso corresponding to zzso of zzso zzso The protein was characterized by zzso acid analysis and zzso zzso zzso digest combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso with zzso established the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso The protein was compared to other proteins in the zzso zzso showing zzso with the zzso light chain variable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed some unique zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were exchanged to zzso and zzso respectively, possibly altering the three- zzso structure of the zzso
