We used zzso library screening to identify the changes that occur in gene expression during zzso cell zzso zzso zzso DNA from normal zzso cells zzso 2) was zzso from a complementary DNA library constructed from a human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The library was screened for genes zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cell line cells, and several zzso clones were zzso One of these clones has a zzso core and high zzso with the human silent information regulator protein zzso This zzso designated zzso was zzso in human zzso zzso cell lines and zzso but not in zzso The human zzso protein has a molecular weight of 39 zzso and is primarily located in the zzso under the nuclear zzso The zzso gene is located on zzso zzso
