In zzso zzso channels, it is thought that zzso responsible for zzso are located within the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we compared the zzso zzso properties of zzso calcium channels in which highly zzso zzso zzso located at analogous positions in the zzso regions of all four zzso were individually zzso All of the zzso exhibited a loss of selectivity for zzso over zzso zzso However, the zzso properties of the individual zzso varied in a position dependent zzso The results provide strong evidence that these zzso zzso positioned at equivalent locations in the aligned zzso play significantly different roles in forming the selectivity barrier of the calcium channel, and are probably arranged in an zzso manner inside the zzso zzso
