The tumor zzso gene zzso regulates zzso checkpoint prior to the initiation of DNA zzso which can either induce zzso arrest or signal zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso may also be related to its ability to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso gene product prevents most types of zzso cell death, suggesting that zzso interferes with an essential signaling zzso involved in the zzso cell death zzso Although the zzso protein is shown to be zzso in many types of human tumor including breast cancer, its zzso or pathological consequences are poorly zzso To determine the effects of zzso zzso on zzso and transformation of breast zzso cells and to investigate whether zzso interferes with the zzso pathway, we introduced the zzso expression zzso into zzso cells, which were derived from zzso human breast zzso cells containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented free zzso zzso and induced a partially transformed zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso did not affect the expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso such as zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso may inhibit zzso functional activity and is involved in the regulation of an early commitment step either to zzso or zzso
