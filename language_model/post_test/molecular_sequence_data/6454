This report examines the transport properties and specificity of zzso zzso transport by the zzso zzso for zzso presentation zzso complex in isolated zzso preparations from zzso zzso zzso The zzso TAP complex has a zzso of zzso zzso and a maximum zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein for a modified zzso corresponding to a defined zzso class I binding zzso from influenza zzso recognized by zzso zzso in association with the zzso zzso This high zzso value for zzso transport suggests that the rate and efficiency of zzso transport of the TAP complex are influenced by the concentration of processed peptides derived from self and foreign proteins in the cell zzso Furthermore, these findings imply that competition among peptides for zzso transport is unlikely to be an important factor in determining the zzso of certain zzso zzso within a foreign protein recognized by zzso T zzso We also examined the specificity of TAP transport for peptides containing bona fide zzso zzso class I binding zzso and provide evidence that certain zzso zzso can affect the efficiency of zzso zzso transport by the TAP zzso
