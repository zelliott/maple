zzso zzso is a highly zzso protein that has multiple functions in the zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso plays an important role in combating zzso stress and its expression is zzso in human and animal models of inflammatory zzso zzso Little is known regarding the regulation of zzso expression in zzso or other zzso In this study we examined the regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells using the model cell line zzso We successfully cloned the zzso human zzso promoter region and identified the zzso start site zzso zzso upstream from the translation start site due to an intervening zzso We show that the acute phase zzso zzso zzso increases zzso protein and zzso abundance and zzso zzso promoter zzso The zzso response element site in the zzso promoter is required for zzso zzso promoter activity and responsiveness to zzso zzso also increases binding of nuclear proteins to the zzso response element in the zzso promoter that are zzso by a zzso zzso Both zzso promoter activity and zzso responsiveness are attenuated by signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 short interference zzso suggesting that signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 mediates zzso activity by zzso zzso these in zzso results, zzso mice exhibit reduced zzso expression in the colon compared with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression in cultured zzso zzso cells and in the zzso in zzso
