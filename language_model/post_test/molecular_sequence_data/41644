zzso of protein zzso 1 zzso is controlled by a diverse array of regulatory zzso However, how these proteins direct zzso specificity is not well zzso More than one-third of the nuclear pool of zzso forms a zzso with the nuclear inhibitor of zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso among other essential biological zzso Here, we show that the zzso domain of zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which binds zzso in an unexpected zzso zzso forms an zzso zzso that engages zzso at a unique interaction site, using polar rather than zzso zzso zzso the structure also reveals a shared zzso interaction site outside of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso selectivity is determined by altered zzso and enhanced zzso zzso Together, our results provide the molecular basis by which zzso directs zzso zzso specificity in the zzso
