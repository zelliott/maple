The zzso sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from potato were modified by zzso chain reaction and subsequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that they closely resembled their native zzso Treatment with reduced zzso or zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso whereas the activity of the zzso zzso was not influenced by zzso As for the native zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was accelerated by zzso m and could be fully reversed by subsequent addition of zzso To identify the zzso which are involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso each of the six zzso in the mature protein sequence was exchanged separately for zzso by zzso zzso Two zzso proteins exhibited characteristics of the reduced zzso zzso Exchange of either zzso or zzso to zzso abolished the regulatory properties, suggesting that these zzso zzso are the sites responsible for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
