The enrichment culture zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with strong zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso formation was analyzed for the presence of zzso zzso bacteria and reductive zzso genes zzso zzso bacteria were identified to be involved in zzso zzso to zzso whereas zzso bacteria mainly zzso zzso to zzso Two zzso genes highly similar to zzso reductive zzso genes zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present as well as an zzso gene very similar to the zzso reductive zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso A single strand zzso zzso zzso method was developed allowing the simultaneous detection of the three zzso genes and the zzso of their zzso zzso analysis of different zzso cultures showed that one zzso gene was expressed during zzso zzso whereas the second was expressed during zzso zzso The zzso gene was involved in zzso zzso to zzso Analysis of the internal transcribed zzso region between the zzso and zzso zzso genes revealed two distinct sequences originating from zzso suggesting that two zzso populations were present in zzso Whether each zzso population was catalyzing a different zzso step could however not be zzso
