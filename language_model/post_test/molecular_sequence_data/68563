A zzso target capture zzso sandwich zzso technique has been developed for the detection of zzso viral zzso The zzso is a form of sandwich zzso that zzso two zzso a zzso capture probe and a labeled detector zzso Following zzso of both zzso to the zzso in solution, the zzso capture probe is used to selectively remove the hybrids by capture on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso the presence of specific hybrids is revealed by detection of the labeled zzso After zzso of all parameters by using zzso zzso zzso was used as a label to zzso the use of zzso The sensitivity of the developed zzso procedure was zzso The lowest amount of virus zzso in cell culture zzso by using zzso zzso was 20 zzso while with zzso zzso 200 zzso was zzso The zzso procedure also detected zzso virus in infected zzso both individually and in zzso The zzso has the advantage of being performed directly on crude samples, eliminating the need for zzso extraction and zzso of target zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso procedure is sensitive, zzso and easy to perform and that its use in surveillance programs will allow detection of dengue virus in pools of mosquitoes more rapidly than current zzso
