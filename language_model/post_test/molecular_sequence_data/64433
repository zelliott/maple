The inflammatory response to bacteria and bacterial products, such as zzso zzso is zzso by a variety of zzso factors, but zzso effects of zzso have been ascribed to the tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso is probably the most zzso zzso and, given the deleterious effects to the host of this factor, it has been zzso that its expression must be tightly zzso Our laboratory has recently isolated, cloned and characterized a novel human zzso factor named zzso or zzso zzso zzso The present study reports the isolation, cloning and characterization of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that mouse zzso mapped to mouse zzso 16, in a region highly zzso with the area on which human zzso was previously zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that mouse zzso is already expressed at embryonic day 7 of development, and is highly expressed in adult liver, heart and zzso Moreover, upon zzso zzso we show that: zzso zzso expression is increased in a mouse zzso cell line; and zzso zzso expression is reduced in zzso zzso zzso lacking one copy of zzso zzso Taken together, these results highlight the important role of zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression and suggest a potential role of zzso in mouse zzso
