zzso is an zzso found in bacteria and plants that zzso the reaction of zzso with zzso to produce zzso and carbon zzso In zzso coli, zzso is induced from the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso is functionally active as a zzso of 17 zzso zzso and displays zzso binding of zzso or zzso zzso The zzso shows no significant zzso acid sequence zzso with other zzso 

We have determined the crystal structure of zzso at zzso A resolution using the zzso anomalous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso and contain one zzso in the zzso zzso zzso protein offers 40 zzso atoms for use in zzso zzso of zzso with bound zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso allowed identification of the active zzso 

The zzso zzso is composed of two zzso The zzso domain shows structural similarity to the zzso zzso bundle zzso The zzso domain has an zzso zzso with no structural zzso to other zzso The zzso of zzso are arranged in a novel manner both at the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure reveals the zzso zzso to be zzso and the zzso is formed by a zzso of these zzso The active site of the zzso is located between zzso and is comprised of zzso from four adjacent zzso of the zzso The structural data allow a conceivable reaction mechanism to be zzso
