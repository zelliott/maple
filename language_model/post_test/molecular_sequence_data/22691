The initiation of DNA replication is tightly regulated in zzso cells to ensure that the zzso is precisely duplicated once and only once per cell zzso This is accomplished by controlling the assembly of a zzso complex zzso which involves the sequential binding to replication origins of the origin recognition complex zzso zzso zzso and the zzso maintenance complex zzso or zzso Several mechanisms of zzso regulation are known, including zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, protein zzso and zzso binding by zzso zzso zzso may also affect the initiation of DNA zzso but at present neither the zzso nor the steps involved are zzso Here, we show that zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, is a previously zzso positive regulatory factor for zzso zzso When zzso expression was inhibited in human cells, zzso failed to associate with zzso even though zzso and zzso loading was zzso When zzso egg extracts were zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso was lost, and DNA replication was zzso The binding of zzso to zzso in zzso extracts could be restored by the addition of zzso zzso
