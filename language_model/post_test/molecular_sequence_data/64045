zzso zzso zzso the elimination of zzso from zzso and zzso to zzso a known second zzso in cellular calcium signaling zzso We have determined to zzso A resolution the structure of zzso zzso with zzso bound zzso at zzso and with the base exchange zzso zzso zzso bound to the active zzso In addition, further refinement at zzso A resolution of the structure of zzso zzso which was previously reported, reveals that zzso is also zzso bound in this structure, and a second zzso site was zzso The structures of native and zzso zzso zzso were also solved to zzso and zzso A zzso It is proposed that the second zzso site serves to promote zzso by clearing the active site of the zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso mechanism can be proposed in which the zzso reaction proceeds through a zzso bound zzso
