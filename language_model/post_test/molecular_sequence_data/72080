zzso responsible for regulation of pulmonary zzso zzso expression in the zzso period are under investigation to better understand normal lung development and airway disease zzso The zzso zzso zzso channel is regulated by changes in pH and volume and is most abundant in lung during fetal zzso In this study, we identify and sequence the zzso promoter, which is zzso rich and lacks a zzso zzso By construction of a series of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso sequence in the promoter is shown to be critical to zzso expression in primary and immortalized fetal lung zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that the zzso and zzso zzso factors are expressed in fetal lung zzso and interact with the zzso box sequences in the zzso zzso techniques demonstrate that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in the lung with the same zzso sequence as zzso zzso This work suggests that zzso and zzso activate zzso gene zzso and that reduction in zzso and zzso at birth explains zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso
