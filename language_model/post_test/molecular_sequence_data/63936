zzso cancer is an important cause of cancer zzso Here, we focused our investigation on the zzso gene which is implicated in zzso zzso and tested whether zzso zzso is zzso in the plasma of zzso zzso and zzso patients using quantitative reverse zzso 

Plasma zzso zzso was measured from 58 zzso zzso patients, 49 zzso zzso patients, and 43 apparently normal subjects using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Five zzso parameters were studied and correlated with plasma zzso zzso zzso Additionally, 19 zzso zzso patients after tumor removal were also recruited for plasma zzso zzso measurement to further demonstrate the clinical usefulness of this zzso 

zzso zzso was detected with median zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma in zzso zzso zzso zzso and apparently normal subjects, zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that plasma zzso zzso concentration was correlated to tumor stage but not sex, age, zzso zzso status, and degree in zzso Moreover, plasma zzso zzso concentration decreased significantly after tumor removal in 16 of 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that plasma zzso zzso may potentially serve as a marker for zzso zzso
