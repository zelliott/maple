The current study zzso the combined zzso and zzso zzso insights to profile structural zzso for the selectivity of representative diverse classes of zzso and zzso as well as dual zzso high affinity zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to be one of the most notable recognition sites for the known zzso zzso Based on the zzso comparison of four common zzso pockets zzso of zzso and zzso the greater structural disparity was observed in the zzso which was more symmetrical zzso in zzso as compared to zzso mainly due to the presence of zzso and zzso zzso in latter in place of zzso and zzso respectively in former zzso The zzso pocket forming partial roof at the entry of 12 zzso deep zzso with two extended zzso running zzso to each other by undergoing zzso zzso has two zzso zzso zzso forming zzso with the bound zzso for governing zzso binding zzso The zzso scoring, and binding pose comparison of the representative zzso and selective zzso into the active sites of zzso and zzso revealed critical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selectivity through zzso and long-range zzso zzso Interestingly, most of the zzso zzso attained zzso zzso in zzso while zzso zzso attained L-shaped zzso in zzso The role of zzso at zzso position of zzso and zzso toward governing zzso selectivity was further substantiated using molecular dynamics simulations on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models were developed and validated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to feature molecular zzso of zzso binding affinity using the zzso zzso alignments zzso of 141 zzso and 39 zzso zzso class of potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso insights well zzso with the zzso insights in terms of the role of zzso zzso and zzso parameters for governing the selectivity for the two zzso The new zzso insights presented in this study are expected to be valuable for understanding and designing potent and selective zzso zzso
