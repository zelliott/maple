To determine the biological significance of the zzso deletion in the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso we examined the zzso of a constructed zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso deletion was filled in with the corresponding zzso sequence of zzso mink cell zzso virus, whereas the zzso zzso and the single base zzso near the 3' zzso of zzso zzso remained zzso zzso was zzso in adult zzso During passage of zzso through newborn mice, we recovered various zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of a distinct deletion in each zzso zzso which was similar but not identical to that in the zzso zzso zzso Starting with the zzso zzso DNA, other zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed in which the sequence coding for the zzso zzso zzso site present in the zzso zzso was modified by zzso zzso zzso to prevent the zzso These zzso zzso were also zzso These results indicate that for the zzso activity of zzso a certain zzso deletion is necessary which causes production of a zzso fusion protein with an absence of at least the zzso one-third of the zzso zzso
