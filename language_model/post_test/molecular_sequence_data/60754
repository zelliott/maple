zzso for genetic transformation in zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso system zzso by two genetic zzso zzso and zzso Additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in the DNA zzso process and zzso share an unusual consensus sequence at zzso and zzso in the promoter, which is absent from the promoters of zzso and zzso This pattern suggests that a factor regulating zzso of these transformation machinery genes but not involved with zzso and zzso expression might be an alternative zzso zzso A search for such a global zzso regulator was begun by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In preparations from competent zzso cultures a protein which seemed to be responsible for zzso zzso in zzso was zzso The corresponding gene was identified and found to be present in two copies, designated zzso and zzso located adjacent to two of the repeated zzso zzso zzso of transformation machinery zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was shown to depend on zzso while zzso expression depended on zzso but not on zzso zzso We conclude that the factor is a zzso global zzso zzso which links zzso information zzso to zzso to competence and propose that it acts as an alternate zzso zzso We also report that zzso and zzso are not sufficient for zzso of zzso zzso gene expression nor for the subsequent zzso period, suggesting that these phenomena depend on one or more zzso zzso
