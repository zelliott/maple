The first fully zzso structures for a series of structurally related metal complexes of the important zzso metal binding protein zzso are zzso The structures were calculated based on structural information obtained from existing zzso and zzso data, and minimized using molecular mechanics zzso zzso A two domain structure, with zzso of zzso and zzso where M zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assembled and zzso The zzso three-dimensional structure closely resembled that of rat liver zzso 1 obtained by analysis of zzso zzso data zzso zzso Robbins, zzso zzso zzso Williamson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structures for zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Deep zzso that expose the zzso clusters are seen in each zzso However, for the zzso zzso much of the zzso structure is visible and it is proposed that this provides access for extensive interaction between zzso water molecules and the zzso resulting in the observed distortion away from zzso geometry for zzso Volume calculations are reported for the protein zzso with 7 zzso zzso or zzso A series of structural changes calculated for the zzso zzso replacement of zzso by zzso and zzso in the zzso alpha domain are zzso
