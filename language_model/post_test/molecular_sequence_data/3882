In higher plants, the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso has been shown to be implicated in both zzso division, which occurs in dividing cells and in the division of the differentiated zzso present in zzso zzso Here we report studies on the expression of the two zzso gene families in higher plants, zzso and zzso in zzso and synchronized tobacco zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized members of each gene family from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for each tobacco zzso gene family and zzso zzso specific for the zzso and zzso proteins were obtained in order to determine zzso and protein zzso A constant level of zzso and zzso transcripts and proteins was observed in zzso cell zzso However, a complex pattern of expression of both gene families was observed during the cell cycle in synchronized cells, with zzso and protein levels zzso during cell division, thus zzso that the zzso proteins may be involved in zzso transmission to the two daughter zzso
