A zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from activated sludge of a zzso and was subjected to a zzso zzso zzso The isolate grew in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and at pH zzso optimum growth was observed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and at pH zzso zzso zzso was zzso formed zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and was able to zzso zzso zzso 40 and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as major fatty zzso The zzso DNA zzso content of strain zzso was zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the new isolate belonged to the zzso zzso and exhibited closest zzso affinity to the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but less than zzso sequence similarity with respect to the type strains of other recognized zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso and reference strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were 29, 45 and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso data, strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
