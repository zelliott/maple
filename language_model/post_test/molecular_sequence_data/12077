We previously reported the identification of the human zzso and zzso genes which zzso proteins related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso zzso zzso has also been previously zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso the rat zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso identical to each zzso Using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso method, we have examined zzso and zzso zzso levels in various adult rat zzso Our results show a dramatic difference in the pattern of expression of these two zzso zzso with previous reports, we detected zzso zzso in all zzso zzso however, levels vary substantially between zzso In particular, we found that zzso zzso are present at relatively high levels in zzso zzso and zzso at moderate levels in brain, zzso liver and small zzso and at significantly lower levels in heart, skeletal muscle and zzso We have also investigated the levels of zzso in rat zzso by zzso with a zzso zzso raised against a human zzso fusion zzso In general, we find that the zzso zzso levels reflect the amount of zzso found in different zzso In contrast, zzso transcripts were present at relatively high levels in zzso at moderate levels in brain, heart and skeletal muscle, at lower levels in zzso skin, kidney and small zzso and were zzso in liver or zzso The differences between the sequences and expression patterns of zzso and zzso are significant and suggest that these proteins have distinct functional zzso
