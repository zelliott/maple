The zzso zzso is known to regulate several aspects of plant development, and zzso zzso factors play a pivotal role in zzso zzso To extend our understanding of the multiple functions of zzso further, the present study describes the functional characterization of zzso a member of the tomato zzso gene zzso zzso displays a distinct behavior compared with most zzso genes regarding the regulation of its expression by zzso and the zzso protein harbors a unique motif of unknown function also present in zzso and remarkably zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Tomato transgenic plants zzso the zzso gene revealed multiple zzso related to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in higher zzso sensitivity, altered root development and reduced zzso content in zzso Both zzso and zzso display a dramatic loss of fertility in zzso zzso lines, and the internal anatomy of the flower and the fruit are zzso with an enlarged zzso in smaller zzso In line with the reduced zzso content in zzso zzso interference zzso leaves, genes involved in zzso synthesis display lower expression at the level of transcript zzso Even though zzso is closely related to zzso in terms of sequence zzso and the zzso proteins share common structural features, the data indicate that the two genes regulate tomato fruit initiation and development in a distinct zzso
