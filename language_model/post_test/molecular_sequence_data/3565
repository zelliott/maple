The potential of zzso as a new drug target has recently come to the zzso with the recognition that zzso molecules can adopt complex three-dimensional structures that, as with zzso enable the design of specific zzso Another reason for the present interest comes from the fact that many zzso agents, such as zzso zzso their genetic information in zzso zzso Unfortunately, the high toxicity and rapid emergence of high-level resistance have severely limited the usefulness of naturally occurring zzso zzso To tackle these problems, it is an important concern to design new synthetic compounds with smaller, simpler structures which possess higher zzso binding zzso better zzso better zzso activity, and stronger resistance against the zzso zzso compared to their parent zzso Here, we will attempt a survey of current efforts to develop zzso zzso or derivatives that target zzso The latest advances in this field including rational design, synthetic strategy, and structure activity relationships are zzso
