zzso development of zzso zzso relies on systems of zzso termination and zzso The zzso N early regulatory zzso acting with the zzso proteins of zzso coli, modify zzso zzso to a form that zzso many zzso termination zzso These modifications require zzso sites, zzso located downstream of the early zzso zzso The nut sites in zzso zzso 21, and zzso which share similarities but are not zzso contain two signals, zzso and zzso We demonstrate that although a consensus sequence for the zzso signal zzso zzso is found only in zzso changes to consensus in the zzso sites of zzso and 21 create more effective zzso signals than the zzso zzso An in zzso competition zzso demonstrates that a zzso nut region with zzso zzso nut regions with zzso as well as other variations of the zzso zzso for the host zzso zzso This suggests that zzso influences zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso competition by zzso requires zzso of the nut site as well as N zzso zzso replacement further demonstrates that bases at both ends of zzso are important for zzso
