Two new members of a family of putative zzso genes involved in zzso zzso have been identified and mapped by FISH and zzso library screening to zzso zzso One of these zzso is an expressed zzso with zzso in the zzso DNA and zzso The six members of the zzso family are grouped into two tightly linked triplets on human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This arrangement could arise by an ancient cluster formation, followed by a more recent cluster zzso All of the zzso genes have unique zzso expression patterns as determined by Northern zzso analysis of 23 human zzso zzso zzso and zzso are widely zzso but zzso is zzso expressed in bone zzso and zzso while zzso is zzso expressed in zzso and skeletal zzso zzso zzso was zzso only in zzso by Northern zzso as previously reported, but was zzso in fetal and zzso zzso libraries by zzso suggesting a possible role for this gene during embryonic zzso
