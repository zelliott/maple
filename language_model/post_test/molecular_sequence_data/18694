zzso strain zzso is a salt tolerant zzso zzso that has been isolated from Iranian zzso The main aim of current study was finding strain zzso zzso position and to find the genes which are potentially involved in salt tolerance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular characteristics indicate that this strain is a member of the zzso zzso zzso analyses based on an almost complete zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that this strain is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso test estimated zzso zzso between two strains and confirmed that zzso is a strain of zzso zzso In order to find novel genes that are zzso expressed in response to the salt treatment, zzso was carried zzso One of the selected expressed sequence tags zzso was found to be zzso to zzso gene which produces a bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso Lon gene expression was induced following 450 zzso salt zzso treatment and its expression level was further zzso increased in response to salt when zzso was added to the zzso These results suggest that two protein protection systems including zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso stress also caused an enhancement in the activity of zzso zzso
