zzso secondary zzso mass zzso zzso operating in the zzso and zzso modes was used to study fragmentation profiles and to obtain the zzso acid sequences of a set of seven zzso zzso The use of zzso as the liquid zzso led to increase in fragmentation of zzso The prominent zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso mode are zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso are observed zzso The most dominant zzso in those mass zzso however, are the zzso zzso and a few zzso zzso zzso zzso The mass zzso in the zzso mode are more zzso and provide data complementary to that from the zzso zzso The zzso group marker zzso zzso 79 zzso and 97 zzso are prominent and both zzso and zzso sequence zzso are formed with equal facility in this mode of zzso Both zzso and zzso mass spectral data are useful in determining the zzso acid sequence of all the seven zzso Thus, zzso alone can be a viable option to the tandem mass zzso approach when sufficient quantities zzso 50 zzso of zzso are zzso
