The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is preceded by a promoter and an zzso repeat which is located between the promoter and the zzso coding zzso The zzso repeat acts as a zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso in the presence of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso transcripts can be detected only in zzso zzso The major zzso transcript is initiated from the zzso promoter but minor amounts of larger zzso possibly initiated at upstream zzso zzso can also be zzso In zzso cells short transcripts are present, corresponding to initiation at the zzso promoter and termination at the zzso zzso Upon zzso these short transcripts disappear and are replaced by full-length zzso zzso The zzso of full-length zzso transcripts were mapped to an zzso repeat located immediately downstream of zzso These results show that zzso of zzso zzso is regulated by zzso of zzso
