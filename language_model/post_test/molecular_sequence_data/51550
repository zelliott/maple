To improve the specificity of zzso markers of zzso zzso zzso we have developed a double zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure cardiac zzso zzso in zzso We produced eight zzso zzso zzso against human cardiac zzso zzso and tested them against human and animal zzso zzso and zzso zzso Five zzso were zzso none of the zzso were zzso Two of the five zzso zzso zzso were zzso in an zzso zzso were made by adding zzso human zzso to zzso zzso human zzso to cover the range zzso zzso for zzso The zzso curve was zzso but zzso Total zzso zzso zzso varied between zzso and zzso The upper limit of the reference range zzso zzso zzso was established as zzso zzso by measuring zzso concentration in zzso of 159 hospitalized patients without evidence of cardiac zzso zzso human skeletal zzso up to 10,000 zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated zzso in 49 consecutive patients with proven zzso In the 30 patients for whom sufficient information was available to establish an accurate time course, zzso was more sensitive during the first 4 h after the onset of chest pain, but thereafter the sensitivities were similar up to 48 zzso However, zzso is more zzso than is zzso and remains increased longer than does zzso
