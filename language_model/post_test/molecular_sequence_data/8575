Two types of zzso heavy zzso chain clones have been isolated from zzso libraries of human fetal and adult brain: one zzso to the zzso H chain zzso that is abundant in liver and is called zzso brain zzso the other contains an additional 279 zzso zzso sequence in the 3' untranslated region and is called brain zzso H chain zzso To map the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification was carried out using DNA from zzso zzso human hybrid cell lines containing single human zzso as templates, and zzso zzso zzso to the 3' end of the zzso sequence zzso zzso and to a coding sequence just zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso product of the size expected from analysis of the brain zzso H chain zzso clones and a zzso zzso H chain clone zzso zzso was generated only from zzso DNA containing human zzso zzso This zzso product and the zzso brain zzso zzso the zzso zzso both zzso to zzso 11 fragments that are known to define the zzso functional liver zzso H chain gene and a putative zzso zzso data indicate that primer A (and thus the zzso zzso maps to the functional zzso H chain gene fragments, but binding to the zzso has not been ruled zzso
