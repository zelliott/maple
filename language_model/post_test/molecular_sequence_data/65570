The rapid increase in the number of putative zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso family in various zzso zzso from the zzso zzso or zzso underscores a need to identify the corresponding zzso in relevant zzso Moreover, the presence of provided structural zzso implies the level of the complexity of zzso regulation in zzso Much less is known of the functions of zzso zzso than of those of its counterpart present in zzso In the blue zzso zzso zzso we know little of zzso involvement in response to the stressful conditions that naturally occur in zzso zzso We have identified two zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso and isolated a full-length zzso zzso zzso from the zzso organ zzso The functions of zzso and zzso in this species were studied with regard to expression and release in response to stressful zzso zzso zzso and zzso Animals exposed to hypoxic conditions responded with zzso release of both zzso In contrast, the zzso transcripts zzso two zzso were zzso zzso zzso increased, whereas zzso zzso This result suggests a possible differential regulation of zzso of these zzso
