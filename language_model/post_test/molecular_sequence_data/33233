zzso have been classical model organisms for over 250 years, yet little is known about the toxins they produce, and how they zzso these toxins to catch zzso protect themselves from predators and fulfill other biological roles necessary for zzso Unlike typical zzso organisms the zzso zzso system is complex and zzso produced by various stinging cells (in the hunting tentacles and body zzso as well as by zzso zzso zzso proteins also fulfill novel, zzso roles in zzso This review described the toxins produced by zzso within the context of their biology and natural zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein and a protein of approximately 30 zzso which zzso a long-lasting zzso zzso No zzso weight toxicity is observed, suggesting the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso The occurrence of a potent zzso activity in the zzso is supported by the detection of several zzso zzso zzso genes expressed by zzso zzso also produce toxins which are not part of the zzso zzso In the green zzso zzso a novel family of zzso zzso are zzso into the zzso cavity during zzso probably helping in disintegration of the zzso Other putative zzso zzso may be involved in zzso development or regulation of zzso As the first zzso zzso for which modern molecular tools are available, zzso provide a useful model to answer many outstanding questions on the way zzso organisms zzso their toxins to zzso
