zzso differences encountered in the zzso sequences of a highly variable region of the zzso zzso gene were used to design a multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for the identification of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso of zzso This multiplex zzso zzso uses a common forward primer and two reverse zzso which are specific for the two zzso zzso of a zzso product of size zzso zzso indicates the presence of zzso zzso whereas a product of size zzso zzso indicates the presence of zzso zzso The zzso was found to be highly specific and zzso
