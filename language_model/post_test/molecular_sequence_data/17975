zzso within the zzso gene are observed in a high proportion of independent zzso cell lines derived from the zzso of mice infected with zzso leukemia zzso The majority of cells with at least one rearranged zzso zzso do not express zzso levels of zzso zzso Here, we show that in 4 out of 19 newly established zzso cell lines induced by infecting zzso mice with either the anemia zzso or zzso zzso strains of zzso virus, the zzso gene is rearranged as a result of integration of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso of zzso within the zzso gene resulted in zzso of gene expression as determined by Western zzso zzso The sites of zzso integration in the zzso gene were found, by Southern zzso analysis and the zzso chain reaction, to be localized in a zzso region between zzso 7 and zzso In addition, loss of the normal zzso zzso was observed in three of the zzso cell lines that carried a rearranged zzso zzso zzso of zzso in these cell lines resulted in either the appearance of zzso zzso transcripts or the complete lack of zzso zzso The results presented in this paper demonstrate that zzso insertions can not only contribute to zzso transformation by zzso dominant zzso but also by zzso genes that normally function in a negative way to control cell zzso Thus, it may be possible to identify additional genes of this class by characterizing zzso sequences that are adjacent to common sites of zzso integration in zzso
