The zzso zzso gene of human zzso virus zzso plays an essential role in the replication cycle of zzso Previous studies have evaluated the extent and zzso aspects of zzso zzso using zzso and adherent zzso zzso We have exploited the zzso property of the zzso gene to achieve high levels of hybrid zzso resulting from zzso between zzso zzso For this purpose, we have generated zzso transformed human zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso gene product of zzso zzso analysis of the cell lines for the presence of zzso protein by zzso zzso terminal repeat zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed low, moderate, and high zzso producer cell zzso zzso cell lines also showed enhanced virus production upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso producer cell lines showed a high amount of hybrid virus in comparison to the control zzso cells upon zzso of truncated viral zzso Thus, zzso cell lines would be valuable target cells for generating homogeneous viruses upon zzso of viral zzso
