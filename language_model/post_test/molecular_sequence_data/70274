The zzso zzso zzso was identified in a family in which three members developed zzso zzso To help characterize the region on zzso 3 surrounding this zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were linked by zzso gel zzso to the same zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso was localized to a region zzso to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid zzso from the zzso cell zzso and zzso localized zzso to the zzso zzso was used to screen the zzso zzso artificial zzso zzso library, which revealed a zzso zzso that spanned the zzso zzso into Lambda DASH II and production of a zzso array of overlapping zzso clones revealed a zzso zzso that spanned the zzso A rare restriction zzso map for the zzso zzso was constructed, and multiple clusters of rare restriction sites within the zzso were identified, possibly indicating the disruption of a gene by the zzso zzso zzso
