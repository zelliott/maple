zzso zzso is a zzso toxin that has been isolated from the zzso of the zzso scorpion zzso zzso zzso The toxin displays an exceptionally wide range of pharmacological activity since it binds onto small zzso zzso zzso channels and also blocks zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso zzso possesses zzso sequence identity with zzso and zzso two other zzso channel short chain scorpion toxins zzso by four zzso zzso These three toxins differ from other zzso channel scorpion toxins zzso by either three or four zzso bridges by the presence of an extra zzso zzso in the middle of a consensus sequence generally associated with the formation of an zzso scaffold (an zzso connected to an zzso zzso by two zzso zzso Because zzso exhibits an uncommon zzso bridge organization among known scorpion toxins zzso zzso zzso and zzso instead of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso toxins or zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso we designed and chemically zzso an zzso analog with three instead of four zzso bridges zzso and in which the entire consensus motif of scorpion toxins was restored by the substitution of the two zzso in positions 19 and 34 zzso to C4 and zzso by two zzso zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso in solution was solved by zzso zzso This analog adopts the zzso scaffold with now conventional zzso pairings connecting zzso zzso and zzso (with C4 and zzso replaced by Abu zzso This novel arrangement in zzso pairings that concerns the last zzso bridge results mainly in a zzso of the zzso regarding the zzso zzso In zzso zzso remains lethal in mice as assessed by zzso injection of the zzso zzso value of zzso 25 zzso The structural variations are also accompanied by changes in the pharmacological selectivity of the zzso suggesting that the organization pattern of zzso bridges should affect the three-dimensional presentation of certain key zzso critical to the zzso of zzso channel zzso
