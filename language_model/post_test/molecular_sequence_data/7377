zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso contains complex zzso zzso which are composed of multiple class A and class B zzso To examine the role these proteins play in zzso zzso structure, and function and to develop strains which may provide insight into the importance of zzso in the zzso of this zzso we constructed specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso and zzso genes were disrupted by replacement of internal fragments with zzso and/or zzso gene zzso Following delivery of these suicide plasmids into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exchange at the targeted zzso zzso and zzso genes was verified by zzso zzso and Southern zzso The utility of a zzso resistance gene cassette for targeted gene disruption was demonstrated and found more amenable than zzso as a selective marker in zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso raised against zzso zzso or zzso confirmed the absence of the corresponding sheath or core zzso Both zzso selectively abolished expression of the targeted gene without affecting synthesis of the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains exhibited altered zzso in zzso and were less efficient in movement through a liquid zzso Paradoxically, zzso strains containing specifically disrupted zzso or zzso zzso were capable of assembling zzso zzso that were zzso normal as evidenced by electron zzso This is the first report of specific zzso of a zzso gene in zzso
