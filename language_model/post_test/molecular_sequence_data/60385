We have previously shown that a major group of zzso zzso proteins decreases after the zzso surge in bovine zzso cells zzso In the present study, we have characterized two proteins in this group in search of factors that may intervene in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against 28 zzso or 29 zzso bovine zzso proteins were used to screen a complementary DNA zzso expression zzso This resulted in the characterization of two zzso zzso for alpha class zzso zzso named zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 791 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 959 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have 222 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were compared and showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso identity to human zzso whereas zzso and zzso are zzso identical to each zzso The zzso represents a novel zzso zzso because it harbors a specific 16 zzso acid sequence not found in any other species and zzso zzso Northern blots showed that zzso and zzso are zzso and are tissue specific with single transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively for zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso corpus zzso adrenal zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso kidney and zzso and the relative abundance of their zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso vary between zzso indicating that expression of these genes is controlled zzso zzso observations revealed that expression of zzso is cell specific, being associated with zzso and zzso cells, small zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso adrenal cortex, specific zzso cells in the adrenal zzso zzso zzso convoluted zzso cells, and Clara cells in the zzso Studies in zzso showed that levels of zzso for zzso were elevated in zzso wall of zzso zzso before zzso treatment, but decreased by zzso 12 h after zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso zzso the decrease in zzso for both zzso was only zzso at 24 h following zzso zzso We concluded that zzso and zzso expression is zzso and zzso is associated with zzso active cells, and is zzso regulated by zzso in the bovine zzso zzso
