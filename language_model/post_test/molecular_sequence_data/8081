In zzso coli, deletion of zzso and zzso results in an inability to zzso zzso zzso and a loss in the ability to grow on zzso zzso minimal zzso Two spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso able to zzso complete zzso without the reappearance of zzso were localized to that portion of zzso coding for zzso region zzso of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso revealed distinct zzso zzso Both zzso cause growth rate defects exacerbated in the presence of zzso and paralleled by reductions in zzso zzso reporter gene zzso as if growth of these zzso is limited by zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso as a function of growth rate, are lowered by a constant fraction zzso in the zzso strain and by a decreasing fraction at lower growth rates in the zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso expression at different zzso levels is interpreted for the zzso zzso as resulting from a hypersensitivity to zzso For the zzso zzso there is a normal sensitivity to zzso but the action of zzso is functionally zzso that is, a low intrinsic zzso zzso promoter activity is zzso even in the absence of zzso In addition to effects on zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the stationary zzso zzso factor zzso zzso which is normally zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso and in one, zzso found to be restored in the absence of zzso The behavior of these zzso thus seems consistent with a zzso effect of zzso on zzso resulting in both negative and positive regulation of gene zzso In addition, the cellular fraction of zzso 70 associated with zzso appears reduced by both zzso zzso as judged by comparison with zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the amount of zzso zzso 70 was higher in the zzso than in the zzso strain, possibly indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions are decreased by zzso
