zzso zzso that act on zzso zzso are a family of zzso editing zzso that convert zzso to zzso within zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso perfectly zzso zzso zzso zzso is limited to a few, selected zzso within zzso containing zzso zzso and internal zzso As a first step in understanding how zzso structural features promote zzso we investigated the role of internal zzso within zzso zzso We observed that a zzso zzso is zzso at the same sites whether it exists as a free zzso or is flanked by internal zzso Thus, internal zzso delineate zzso ends for zzso Since zzso zzso short zzso at fewer zzso than long zzso zzso decrease the number of zzso within an zzso by dividing a long zzso into shorter zzso For a series of zzso internal zzso related in zzso larger zzso zzso zzso acted as zzso ends, whereas smaller zzso zzso zzso did zzso Our work provides the first information about how secondary structure within zzso zzso dictates zzso and suggests a rational approach for zzso minimal zzso for zzso zzso by zzso in zzso
