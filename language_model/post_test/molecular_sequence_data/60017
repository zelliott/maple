Two zzso zzso derived from plant zzso zzso were used to cut off the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso transcript through a zzso zzso zzso Stem I of the zzso zzso comprises 8 zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso but stem III of the zzso zzso consists of 8 zzso of the 3' end of zzso zzso The construct containing two zzso zzso zzso target sequences identified the zzso sites to cut off a required zzso zzso This method was applied for preparation of 35 zzso long zzso zzso Its activity was proved by the complex formation with the zzso zzso It seems that this approach based on zzso scissors can also be used for the generation of required zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso
