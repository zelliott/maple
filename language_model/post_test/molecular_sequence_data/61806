zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, possesses type IV zzso and a type II protein zzso zzso system, both of which are dependent upon the zzso zzso zzso By analyzing multiple zzso zzso and various types of zzso zzso as well as performing zzso of these zzso we have confirmed that zzso and type II zzso genes are required for zzso zzso infection of both zzso and human zzso Based upon a complete analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that the type II system controls the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso C, zzso A, and zzso and zzso acid zzso activities and influences the appearance of zzso zzso of the developing zzso zzso zzso database indicated that the zzso has two other zzso zzso and zzso that are predicted to promote zzso and thus a set of genes that is comparable to the type II zzso genes in other zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking either the zzso zzso the zzso zzso or zzso were not defective for colonial growth, zzso activities, or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also not impaired for type zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso into zzso mice, zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso exhibited a reduced ability to grow in the zzso as measured by competition zzso The zzso zzso was also defective in an in zzso kinetic zzso zzso of infected mouse zzso revealed that type II zzso proteins are expressed in zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso system is a zzso factor and the only type II zzso system linked to zzso zzso
