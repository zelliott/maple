zzso zzso is an important pathogen causing invasive pulmonary zzso in zzso zzso The fungus zzso by zzso which are the infectious structures zzso by the human zzso zzso is thought to contribute to clearance of the zzso zzso a process that is facilitated by complement deposition on zzso zzso We now show that zzso zzso zzso exhibit significant increases in zzso binding capacity compared with wild zzso A zzso zzso that led to enhanced zzso binding was zzso by a zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA zzso from the subsequently rescued zzso was sufficient to restore the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a level of zzso binding similar to that of the parental zzso A zzso designated zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso revealed that it has two zzso and encodes a putative protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso is very similar to zzso zzso an zzso involved in zzso synthesis in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is zzso zzso being expressed during zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso zzso the zzso pigmentation of zzso as well as complement zzso
