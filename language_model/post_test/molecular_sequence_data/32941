The zzso type 2 domain is a prominent feature of a large and growing family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and is also present in more than 1500 additional zzso Most proteins usually contain a single zzso domain, although some proteins contain tandem zzso consisting of both type 1 and type 2 zzso which actually share little sequence zzso Recently, we determined the solution structure of zzso from zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in zzso zzso zzso syndrome, and showed that it adopted a zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso structure of the zzso zzso domain from zzso using zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso domain consists of a short zzso and a structured loop with two short zzso zzso and adopts a zzso structure similar to the zzso and zzso structures, even though there is minimal primary sequence similarity between these zzso By zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso we show that the zzso domain coordinates two zinc atoms with a zzso zzso one by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the other by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, this is the first case that an zzso acid is involved in zinc atom coordination in a zzso domain, although zzso acid has been shown to coordinate zzso zinc in zzso zzso In addition, the finding of a zzso substitution identified in a patient with zzso zzso zzso syndrome supports the importance of proper zinc coordination for the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, our structure differs from the only other published zzso structure, that from zzso which was shown to coordinate one zinc zzso Finally, the similarity in zzso structures of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests these zzso have evolved from a common zzso
