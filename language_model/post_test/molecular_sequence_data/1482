To describe the zzso microbial diversity and the candidate bacteria for the genetic manipulation for the generation of transgenic mosquitoes zzso to transmission of diseases, the zzso of wild zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied using a conventional culture technique and analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso from the host zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene library was composed of zzso unidentified and zzso bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The coverage calculated for the 150 clones was zzso Thus, the probability of the next cloned sequence falling in a novel operational zzso unit (not yet observed) was zzso The majority of the cultured zzso and the zzso zzso gene library clones belonged to the zzso zzso Most of the bacteria have been previously reported to inhabit the zzso of different zzso zzso zzso the results of this study indicate that different zzso species harbor common representatives of the zzso that may be the potential candidates for genetic manipulation to control the disease transmission capabilities of the zzso
