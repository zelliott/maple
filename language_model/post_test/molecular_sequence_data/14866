Although bacteria play dominant roles in microbial zzso few of them have been reported that were capable of utilizing zzso zzso organic pollutants as their sole sources of carbon and zzso However, many soil zzso can metabolize those of pollutants, although they rarely complete zzso In this paper, we investigated the dynamic relationship between zzso and bacteria associated with degradation of zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed cultures were constructed to simulate the environment of actual zzso zzso Four bacterial strains and seven zzso strains were isolated that related to the removal of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso Furthermore, these strains were used to create mixed culture of bacteria zzso mixed culture of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso removal rate zzso zzso was observed in the zzso compared with cultures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The same tendency was also indicated in the degradation of zzso and zzso In addition, a dynamic relationship during the degradation process between zzso and bacteria was monitored through using zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso
