zzso membrane zzso exchange is a principal mechanism of zzso zzso zzso Na zzso and H zzso and thick ascending limb H zzso Based on current data on zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is the zzso candidate for the zzso membrane zzso The present study zzso zzso in rat kidney using zzso zzso against zzso zzso of rat zzso These zzso recognized an approximately 87 zzso protein in zzso zzso cells zzso with the rat zzso gene but not in zzso zzso All zzso labeled an approximately 87 zzso protein in plasma zzso from zzso and outer zzso zzso of cortical zzso showed labeling in zzso but not zzso zzso Cross linking studies suggested existence of zzso forms of the zzso zzso showed strong zzso of the zzso membrane of zzso convoluted, and zzso convoluted zzso with lesser zzso of the zzso straight zzso and absent zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed in thin descending limbs in the inner stripe and intense zzso was seen in the zzso membrane of zzso and cortical thick ascending zzso zzso zzso was absent in the remainder of the zzso In zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso convoluted zzso and zzso zzso in the thick ascending zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso convoluted zzso zzso membrane zzso exchange activity is likely zzso by other zzso of the zzso zzso
