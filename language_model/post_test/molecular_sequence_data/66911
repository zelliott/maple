zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen whose primary niche is the zzso environment of zzso dental zzso but initial colonization of the oral cavity is likely to occur on zzso surfaces that already support robust zzso zzso Our studies have shown that zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso through interaction of the minor zzso zzso zzso with a specific region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso designated zzso We show that a synthetic zzso zzso the BAR sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso adherence to zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and prevents the development of zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso zzso that possessed the same side chain zzso as that of BAR was zzso suggesting that interactions of zzso with the zzso backbone of BAR are important for zzso A zzso constrained analog of BAR inhibited zzso zzso adherence and zzso formation but at a lower specific activity than that of zzso zzso to further define the structural features of the zzso interaction, we functionally screened zzso libraries of BAR in which active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso were replaced with each of the 19 common zzso zzso zzso containing positively charged zzso acids at position zzso or zzso zzso at position zzso bound zzso zzso more efficiently than did control peptides containing zzso and Val at these positions, suggesting that zzso and zzso interactions may contribute to zzso zzso In contrast, replacement of Pro or zzso at these positions was zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso of the BAR secondary structure influences zzso The net effect of zzso for zzso was less pronounced either positively or zzso than that at the other zzso These results define zzso characteristics of the interacting interface of zzso and zzso and suggest that peptides or zzso with greater specific zzso activity than that of BAR can be zzso These compounds may represent potential zzso that target some of the first molecular interactions that allow zzso zzso to colonize the oral zzso
