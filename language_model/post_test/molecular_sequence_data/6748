The zzso fraction from zzso columns was used as the source of at least four additional zzso basic protein zzso zzso From this fraction we routinely obtained two major zzso called zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were further zzso on zzso Each contained two proteins in the zzso to zzso range which we called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso values zzso as zzso plus zzso were high in three of the four zzso which was accompanied by a zzso decrease in the zzso zzso The compositions clearly identified these four proteins with the zzso form of zzso Western zzso analysis showed that both H and L forms reacted with anti zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis after zzso zzso zzso showed that the sequences of both proteins in the zzso fraction zzso and zzso were identical to the zzso zzso of zzso Mass zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso provided us with accurate masses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We concluded that the H and L proteins from the zzso zzso were zzso Although similar detailed analyses of the zzso and zzso have not been done they are also considered to be zzso on the basis of the zzso with anti zzso zzso The origins of these proteins is not known at this time and their functional significance is zzso The possibility that they are found in early forms of zzso as components of transitional zzso between zzso and zzso or are involved in zzso cannot be zzso
