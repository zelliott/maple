The transport of zzso proteins is, in general, zzso by zzso zzso receptors via zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel class of receptors that regulate the transport of zzso zzso in the enteric zzso zzso zzso which is a good model zzso to investigate membrane zzso A novel 110 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family 1, zzso was initially discovered by affinity zzso of the major zzso zzso which plays a pivotal role in the zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso transport from the zzso zzso to zzso and its binding to zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by gene zzso led to the zzso of the zzso form of zzso in the zzso compartment and the zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the trafficking and processing of zzso The zzso represents a new class of zzso that bind to zzso zzso in a zzso fashion and regulate their trafficking, processing and zzso and, thus, regulate the physiology and zzso of zzso zzso
