To investigate the possible zzso of the zzso that make up so-called zzso zzso we examined five zzso and zzso zzso zzso using DNA zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso which is a characteristic feature of these zzso On Southern zzso analysis, both zzso from four of five zzso contained zzso zzso DNA zzso confirming the single cell origins for these zzso No zzso zzso DNA zzso were observed in the fifth lymphoma, but zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso DNA showed identical zzso crossovers in the two zzso The migration differences of both the zzso and zzso 18 DNA zzso were shown to result from zzso acquired zzso of the zzso genes from the fifth zzso These studies indicate that zzso gene zzso and zzso expression are not consistently stable zzso markers since they are subject to zzso as a result of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso 18 DNA zzso are more reliable, they may also vary among cells of some tumors since zzso zzso can zzso as well, DNA of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
