The molecular basis of cell zzso alternative zzso at the 3' zzso site remains largely zzso We isolated a protein zzso zzso zzso acid zzso element from a 3' zzso site of the zzso protein 25 zzso gene for zzso zzso during zzso differentiation of rat zzso zzso zzso The element binds specifically to zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso K in a zzso way, which directly competes with the U2 auxiliary factor zzso an essential component of early zzso zzso with similarly localized zzso K target motifs upstream of alternative zzso are enriched in genes often associated with neurological zzso We show that such motifs upstream of the zzso zzso 6 also bind zzso K, and importantly, zzso K is required for zzso repression of the zzso Interestingly, this zzso encodes the zzso domain that determines the switch of the zzso zzso activity of zzso a change known to be critical in specifying zzso zzso zzso with an important role of the target genes in zzso knocking down zzso K severely zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, through zzso K, the zzso differentiation stimulus zzso targets a critical 3' zzso site component of the zzso machinery to control alternative zzso of crucial zzso This also provides a regulated direct competitor of zzso for cell signal control of 3' zzso site zzso
