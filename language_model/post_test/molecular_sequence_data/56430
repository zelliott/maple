We have investigated the zzso and spreading of zzso on zzso zzso of varying structure to identify sites that mediate these zzso zzso was prepared with zzso to remove both zzso A zzso and zzso B zzso and with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to selectively remove zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were inhibited with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso and was equal on zzso prepared with each of the three zzso In contrast, zzso zzso increased spreading as zzso by zzso zzso of zzso stained for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso spreading on zzso was significantly less than the zzso zzso zzso on zzso or zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso III from zzso zzso zzso was used to specifically cleave zzso B beta zzso from zzso to further investigate the role of the beta chain zzso in promoting zzso zzso After zzso with zzso this zzso zzso lacked beta zzso and supported significantly less zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso with beta 15-21 inhibited spreading on zzso as did zzso beta zzso while control zzso and peptides had no significant zzso These results indicate that zzso and spreading of zzso on zzso are zzso by different zzso and that spreading can be zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the beta chain including zzso beta zzso
