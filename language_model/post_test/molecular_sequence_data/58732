Three genes zzso to zzso which encodes the major zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso The zzso proteins showed the typical modular structure of zzso associated proteins and, that found in the zzso proteins of zzso zzso The variable number of repeats that constitute the zzso zzso domain suggests that the zzso genes have evolved by zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that under the culture conditions employed only two zzso zzso and zzso are efficiently expressed and their products are detected in the culture zzso The zzso genes are not zzso located in the zzso and appear to be expressed zzso zzso extension experiments located a zzso start site 29 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso The zzso and zzso promoter regions are closely related to the consensus sequence of zzso coli zzso 70 zzso The cell wall binding capacity of the zzso zzso their abundance in the zzso media, together with the existence of gene zzso suggest that the zzso proteins should play an important role in the interaction of this zzso with its surrounding zzso
