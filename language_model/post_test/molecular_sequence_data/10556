Low ratio zzso zzso technique was previously used in this laboratory to enrich and isolate a number of low abundance zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 85, zzso that led to the identification and cloning of five important zzso and human zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Holbrook, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso In this study we have characterized the remaining DNA zzso zzso zzso Of the 24 zzso zzso 3 clones zzso zzso and zzso representing different regions of the same zzso zzso exhibited near perfect zzso to human zzso zzso The zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso displayed very high sequence zzso with the human zzso nuclear zzso rat translation initiation zzso zzso and human zzso respectively, whereas clones zzso and zzso matched with express sequence zzso sequences of unknown zzso The zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso were different zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso and displayed high sequence zzso with the members in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso A18 zzso zzso as a probe, we screened human zzso zzso library and isolated the corresponding full-length human zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence revealed that the putative protein contains all the zzso features of a novel zzso zzso The A18 zzso levels were specifically increased in response to DNA damage induced by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Thus the putative A18 zzso is the first zzso whose zzso is specifically regulated in response to zzso DNA zzso zzso it may play some role in repair of zzso DNA zzso
