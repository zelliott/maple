zzso III plays a role in zzso plasticity and maps to zzso zzso a region suggested to be linked to zzso To determine if zzso III plays a role in this disease, we searched for zzso in this gene in patients with schizophrenia and zzso 

The zzso III gene was initially zzso from 10 individuals with schizophrenia to identify zzso Association analysis was then performed using 118 individuals with schizophrenia and 330 population zzso zzso III expression was studied by zzso zzso and zzso sites were mapped by sequencing zzso zzso III fragments zzso with zzso 

A rare, zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso III gene and appeared more frequently in individuals with schizophrenia than in controls zzso zzso The site affected by the zzso zzso was determined to be a zzso for zzso protein zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso was increased during zzso development and in response to zzso in cultured zzso zzso 

Our observations suggest an association of a rare zzso in zzso III with zzso but further studies will be required to clarify its role in this zzso
