zzso zzso is a zzso modification found in many zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso from zzso cells was zzso by mass zzso and zzso degradation, to contain zzso zzso at five positions in its zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Whereas these five zzso were zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso of zzso K and zzso was zzso in zzso of the zzso All other zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso 1 was identified as the only zzso zzso zzso K in zzso and in zzso An zzso K zzso in which the five zzso modified zzso zzso had been zzso was not zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso 1 did not influence the zzso activity, the translation zzso function, or the cellular zzso of zzso K but reduced the interaction of zzso K with the zzso zzso zzso This led to an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso K zzso These findings support the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
