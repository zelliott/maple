zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso four zzso each with two zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate many important zzso zzso We employed a zzso genetic screen to identify functional channels from libraries of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the allowed sequences indicate that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso interaction surfaces identified by the patterns were verified by sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso packing indicate that the zzso zzso inner zzso are surrounded by the zzso zzso outer zzso arranged such that the zzso zzso participate in zzso zzso This arrangement is distinctly different from the structure of a bacterial zzso channel with the same zzso and identifies zzso zzso as hallmark sequences common to all zzso zzso zzso
