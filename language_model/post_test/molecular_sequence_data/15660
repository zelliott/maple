In the body, the brain is the most zzso zzso Despite this, remarkably little is known about the mechanisms in the brain that regulate cholesterol zzso Due to the zzso barrier, plasma zzso are unable to zzso and instead cholesterol must be zzso de zzso from within the central nervous zzso zzso hormone zzso activated in response to zzso hormone zzso are known to zzso the level of serum cholesterol via complex regulatory zzso By screening for zzso genes we have identified zzso a zzso zzso protein that is related to the zzso family of zzso Analysis by zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso is predominately expressed in specific cell types of the brain, zzso and zzso Using the model of zzso in zzso we observed the zzso of zzso expression in the zzso Furthermore, in zzso analysis of zzso expression in cells treated with zzso revealed both positive and negative zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and was further found to zzso with zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso resulted in elevated cholesterol levels combined with an altered cholesterol zzso Given that zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso and retinal zzso cells and that its zzso results in increased cholesterol levels, it is tempting to zzso that zzso may contribute to cholesterol zzso in neural cell zzso Taken together, we propose that zzso represents a new molecular link between zzso hormone and cholesterol zzso
