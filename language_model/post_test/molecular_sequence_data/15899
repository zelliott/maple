The soybean zzso complex II zzso zzso was composed of one major and three minor zzso zzso zzso binding zzso This study demonstrated that the soybean zzso contained at least 11 genes that code for these Cab zzso Three members of the soybean Cab gene family were zzso Cab 3 coded for a zzso zzso mature zzso with a 32 zzso acid transit zzso Comparisons with previously published Cab protein sequences indicated that Cab 3 coded for the major Cab protein of zzso zzso Cab 2 coded for a novel Cab protein with an apparent molecular weight of zzso zzso Cab 2 retained a high degree of similarity with Cab 3, but distinguished itself from previously reported minor zzso II type II Cab genes and zzso Finally, Cab 1 was determined to be a zzso that had two deletions relative to Cab 2 and Cab zzso
