zzso zzso the core promoter for the cucumber necrosis virus zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined using deletion analysis and zzso zzso The deletion studies indicate that the promoter lies within a region located 20 zzso upstream and 6 zzso downstream and including the zzso start zzso zzso further upstream or downstream of the core promoter do not appear to strongly affect promoter activity or viral zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso immediately surrounding the zzso start site regulate promoter zzso zzso of sequences within the zzso promoter region with the corresponding region of other zzso shows that the zzso promoter shares a region of near complete identity in 14 of the 26 core promoter zzso Little similarity exists between the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter and the region surrounding the zzso initiation site for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, limited similarity occurs with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso motifs found in the promoters of several zzso zzso zzso plant and animal viruses are not zzso This study represents the first analysis of a zzso promoter from a member of zzso II of zzso zzso zzso
