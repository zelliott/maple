zzso is a systemic zzso caused by the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso the interactions between zzso zzso and the host tissue depends on the study of the different steps of the process of zzso especially zzso in which the pathogen recognizes zzso on the surface of host zzso This study aimed to verify the role of zzso in the host zzso interaction and the ability of zzso to bind to zzso zzso zzso to determine its zzso zzso and to study the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The data revealed that zzso is the major zzso of zzso zzso of the location of zzso at an zzso level revealed that it is distributed in various cellular zzso but at a high level in the cell zzso The analysis of the zzso acid sequence revealed an internal zzso motif zzso which is zzso in most organisms and described as an important interaction site of the zzso with the host cell zzso This suggests that zzso performs additional functions related to the zzso zzso and also plays a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso this study increases the knowledge about the characteristics of zzso and its influence on the binding process of zzso zzso
