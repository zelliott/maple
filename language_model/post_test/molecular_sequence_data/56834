We have used zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and a zzso method to identify zzso zzso that appear to be important to zzso zzso addition in the zzso group I zzso from zzso zzso For the majority of these zzso zzso however, the effect of zzso alpha S substitution is significantly reduced in reactions containing the added presence of zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso The observed zzso of the zzso alpha S effect at these positions is thought to be due to the larger affinity of zzso for zzso These data suggest the direct coordination of zzso metal zzso within the highly zzso zzso core of the zzso zzso Because many of these metal binding sites appear to be in positions of close zzso approach, and adjacent to the zzso binding site the zzso zzso we suggest roles for the corresponding zzso in stabilizing zzso structure and zzso recognition and as participants in zzso
