zzso form complexes with zzso zzso By controlling activity of the zzso zzso regulate progression through the cell zzso A- and zzso zzso were discovered due to their distinct appearance in S and zzso zzso and their rapid zzso destruction during zzso Transition from zzso to zzso is basically controlled by zzso zzso In zzso two zzso B proteins are well zzso zzso B1 and zzso zzso Recently, a human zzso B3 gene was zzso In contrast to the expression pattern of other zzso zzso we find zzso B3 zzso expressed not only in S and zzso cells but also in zzso and zzso Human zzso B3 is expressed in different zzso We show that one zzso remains in the zzso whereas the other zzso is zzso to the zzso Transport to the nucleus is dependent on three autonomous zzso nuclear zzso signals that where previously not implicated in nuclear zzso It had been shown that zzso B3 zzso with zzso but this complex does not exhibit any zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso version of zzso B3 can arrest cells in zzso and zzso Taken together with the finding that zzso B3 zzso is not only expressed in zzso but is also detected in significant amounts in resting cells and in zzso zzso This may suggest a zzso function of human zzso B3 in competition with zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso phase of the cell zzso
