Although zzso plays an essential role in controlling zzso the biology of zzso zzso remains poorly zzso but is known to involve the complex interplay of multiple zzso factors including zzso We have identified a zzso element within the rat zzso promoter containing an zzso and partial zzso response element site that are bound by the basic zzso loop zzso zzso factor family members, upstream stimulating factor zzso and the basic zzso zzso member, zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso factors increased zzso transcription, an effect not observed if the zzso binding site was zzso zzso expression of a dominant negative zzso zzso or zzso zzso attenuated induction by zzso whereas dominant negative zzso or zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso stimulation specifically induced an increase in zzso zzso occupation of the zzso promoter, leading to the recruitment of zzso protein to enhance gene zzso In conclusion, a composite element bound by both zzso and zzso serves to integrate signals for zzso and zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso
