zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso requires the product of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso It has been suggested that this gene product is an zzso protein controlling the expression of the structural genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso perhaps by binding to DNA sequences upstream of these zzso We report the sequence of the zzso zzso A single open reading frame is seen capable of zzso a protein of 470 zzso acid zzso The deduced sequence of this protein indicates that it is a zzso finger protein supporting the hypothesis that the zzso gene product is a DNA binding zzso
