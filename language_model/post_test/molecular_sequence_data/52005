The zzso locus at zzso is highly zzso due to a zzso variable number of tandem repeats zzso zzso In previous studies, one of the zzso sites zzso the zzso zzso a correlation between zzso and X zzso zzso Here we show, by DNA sequence analysis, that this zzso site is located within the zzso island at the zzso end of a zzso element, which is zzso zzso from the zzso The zzso status of the zzso island was assessed in Southern zzso experiments using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All these sites were completely zzso on active X zzso consistent with previously reported findings of full zzso of zzso elements throughout the zzso However, on inactive X zzso these sites were predominantly zzso although patterns were found to be zzso The results suggest that zzso elements on the inactive X zzso are not suppressed by full zzso of their zzso zzso The differential zzso of the zzso zzso island provides the basis for a highly zzso X zzso analysis zzso
