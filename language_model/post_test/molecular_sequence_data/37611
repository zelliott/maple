Gap zzso zzso communication zzso liver zzso and growth control in the zzso The major gap junction protein expressed by zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells do not express this zzso We investigated the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso factors in liver zzso zzso zzso zzso using deletions of the rat zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso linked to the zzso gene were performed in zzso rat zzso cells that express zzso zzso compared with zzso rat liver zzso cells that do zzso The zzso promoter element was located within zzso zzso to zzso and was zzso more active in zzso cells than zzso cells whereas the entire promoter zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso more active in zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso complexes that bound to zzso consensus sites within the zzso promoter were formed using nuclear extracts from both types of zzso Additional promoter sequences increased promoter activity more strongly in zzso cells than zzso cells and this was correlated with the binding of zzso nuclear zzso zzso to two zzso consensus sites centered at zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and binding to these elements was only observed with zzso zzso Other specific zzso complexes were formed, however, that included zzso and zzso complexes, but these were not related to promoter zzso zzso increased zzso promoter activity and expression in zzso cells, but had little effect in zzso cells and did not alter zzso complex zzso These data suggest that zzso is responsible for zzso promoter zzso activity, that zzso determines the zzso expression of zzso and that zzso increases zzso expression through other zzso
