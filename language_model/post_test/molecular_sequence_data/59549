The zzso zzso gene zzso is expressed in terminally differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of this gene in the zzso cell layer of transgenic skin results in a severely abnormal zzso zzso and leads to zzso zzso The zzso cells of affected mice ceased to zzso and expressed the zzso and zzso genes which are normally transcribed only in the latest stages of zzso zzso All zzso cell types were diminished and the stratum zzso was reduced to a single zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso results in transformation of zzso cells into more differentiated zzso suggesting that this zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso
