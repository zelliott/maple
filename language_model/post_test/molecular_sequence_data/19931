zzso strains isolated in Europe from zzso and zzso zzso form a distinct zzso designated zzso II, on zzso gene zzso zzso II zzso appear to prevail also in the zzso of Western Australia and South Africa following probably accidental introduction with seeds of their zzso and zzso zzso Given this potential for zzso we investigated zzso zzso originating from a range of native New World zzso based on zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene trees revealed considerable diversity among zzso zzso with most zzso placed in the zzso zzso zzso while some European strains were closely related to zzso zzso The zzso gene tree resolved seven strongly supported groups zzso I to zzso that correlated with strain geographical origins and to some extent with major zzso zzso All European strains were placed in zzso II, whereas only a minority of New World strains was placed in this zzso This work, as well as our previous studies, suggests that zzso II diversified predominately in the Old World, possibly in the zzso Most New World zzso formed zzso zzso zzso in a large zzso zzso III, which appears to be New World in origin, although it also includes strains originating from zzso zzso Trees generated using zzso and zzso gene sequences zzso well with the zzso tree, but evidence is presented that the zzso gene may not be required for zzso of zzso and that loss of this gene is zzso
