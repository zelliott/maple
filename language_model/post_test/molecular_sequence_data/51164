A method is reported for zzso an analog of zzso zzso to zzso zzso This method enables the zzso zzso to be coupled to the zzso backbone between any two desired bases in a zzso When zzso to a target zzso the zzso zzso can be directed toward a zzso base and, in turn, can undergo a zzso reaction with the target under zzso zzso at 365 zzso Several different zzso zzso zzso have been prepared for incorporation into zzso zzso by standard zzso zzso In addition, an zzso activated zzso analog of zzso zzso has been zzso for zzso to the zzso zzso Using this approach, we have prepared a number of zzso zzso which are complementary to the zzso zzso zzso associated with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso have shown that the zzso zzso does not adversely affect duplex zzso zzso gel zzso analyses have demonstrated that the zzso zzso undergo zzso to the zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs when the zzso zzso is inserted adjacent to one or more zzso zzso in the zzso zzso particularly between zzso and zzso zzso This internal labeling approach greatly increases the number of potential target sites available for zzso zzso
