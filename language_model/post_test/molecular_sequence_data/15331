The complete zzso of three strains from the zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis placed them as a unique zzso They share zzso traits with members of the zzso the zzso and the zzso The three strains appear to be versatile zzso zzso and culture traits indicate the use of carbon sources that span simple zzso to more complex zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso and zzso ABC zzso for zzso suggesting that they are best suited to zzso zzso They appear capable of nitrate and zzso reduction but not zzso fixation or zzso The zzso contained numerous genes that zzso zzso zzso but no evidence of zzso production was found, suggesting that they may obtain iron via interaction with other zzso The presence of cellulose synthesis genes and a large class of novel zzso zzso proteins suggests potential traits for zzso resistance, zzso formation, and/or contribution to soil zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes suggest the production of novel zzso zzso Genes that zzso a variety of novel proteins were also zzso The abundance of zzso in zzso worldwide and the breadth of potential carbon use by the zzso strains suggest significant and previously zzso contributions to the zzso carbon zzso Combining our zzso evidence with available culture traits, we zzso that cells of these zzso are zzso divide slowly, exhibit slow zzso rates under zzso conditions, and are well equipped to tolerate fluctuations in soil zzso
