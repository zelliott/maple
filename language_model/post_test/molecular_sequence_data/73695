zzso zzso gel zzso zzso is a powerful and convenient tool for analyzing the sequence diversity of complex natural microbial zzso zzso was evaluated for the identification of zzso zzso of the beta subdivision of the zzso based on the mobility of zzso zzso zzso fragments and for the analysis of zzso of zzso products from this group generated by selective zzso of DNA extracted from coastal sand zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso incorporating a zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify a zzso zzso zzso region spanning the zzso and zzso variable zzso The zzso were tested against a representative selection of clones and cultures encompassing the currently recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Analysis of these products by zzso revealed that while many of the sequences could be zzso some which were known to be different migrated similarly in the zzso system zzso The zzso primer pair was used to amplify zzso zzso sequences from DNA extracted from soil sampled from Dutch coastal dune locations of differing in pH and distance from the zzso The derived zzso patterns were zzso across multiple DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences from different zzso groupings isolated from gene libraries made from the same sand dune DNA samples but prepared with different zzso gave zzso bands which zzso with most of the bands detected from the sand dune zzso zzso from the zzso gels of environmental samples were zzso zzso and directly zzso revealing strong similarity or identity of the recovered products to the corresponding regions of library zzso Six of the seven zzso clusters of zzso zzso zzso were detected in the dune systems, and differences in community structure between some sample sites were zzso The most zzso dune site contained sequences showing affinity with sequence clusters previously isolated only from marine environments and was the only site where sequences relate to zzso genes could be zzso zzso sequences were present in all sites, and there was some evidence of differences between zzso populations in acid and alkaline dune zzso Such differences in community structure may affect zzso differences within zzso zzso zzso with zzso effects on zzso rates in response to key environmental zzso
