The organization of eight small nuclear zzso (the zzso U2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously studied by others and three additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been investigated in cultured human cells by zzso in zzso zzso with zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso Using highly sensitive digital imaging zzso we demonstrate that all of these zzso are widespread throughout the zzso but they are excluded from the zzso In addition, the U2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are concentrated in discrete nuclear zzso known as coiled bodies, but zzso and zzso are zzso In addition to coiled bodies, a classic speckled pattern was observed in the zzso of zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso cells revealed a more diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso using various zzso zzso shows complete agreement with that of their zzso zzso zzso zzso Although U2 zzso is concentrated in coiled bodies, zzso of the zzso signals from the U2 zzso probe reveals that the bulk of the U2 zzso is located in the zzso Furthermore, simultaneous zzso of the U2 zzso and the zzso repeated U2 genes demonstrates that coiled bodies are not the sites of U2 zzso
