zzso factors, zzso and zzso whose expression is restricted to the inner cell mass zzso in mouse and human zzso are used to characterize zzso embryonic stem cells zzso in zzso However, zzso may not be a useful marker in domestic animals due to its expression in both ICM and zzso zzso while zzso zzso and protein expression have only been described fully in zzso In an effort to identify zzso markers for domestic animals, expression patterns of zzso zzso and the cell surface markers zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined in zzso goat zzso a species that has proven to be a superior choice for the production of transgenic proteins in milk zzso Our results indicate that while goat zzso express zzso zzso and zzso zzso their expression is not strictly restricted to the zzso In a unique zzso pattern, zzso protein was localized to the zzso and zzso in ICM cells, but was localized strictly to zzso in zzso This pattern may reflect zzso of protein by zzso utilizing a zzso mechanism known to operate in stem zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in TE was also significantly zzso as compared with that in zzso Taken together, this novel expression pattern of zzso in goat zzso zzso suggests that zzso could serve as marker of zzso in zzso and may be useful in derivation and characterization of zzso zzso This study is the first to characterize both zzso zzso and protein expression in any species other than the zzso
