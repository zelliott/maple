African clawed frogs of the zzso zzso constitute a zzso system in which to study the evolutionary trajectory of duplicated genes and are a source of zzso peptides with therapeutic zzso zzso events within the zzso have given rise to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The primary structures and zzso of zzso peptides from the zzso frogs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be compared with those from the zzso frogs zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, components in skin zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso may be compared with those from the zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso peptides may be classified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the numbers of zzso from the zzso frogs were not significantly greater than the corresponding numbers from the zzso zzso zzso were not identified in skin zzso of zzso frogs and the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso peptides from zzso zzso was not greater than that of zzso zzso The data zzso therefore, that zzso zzso zzso has been the most common fate of zzso zzso genes following zzso While some duplicated gene products retain high zzso potency zzso the very low activity of others suggests that they may be evolving towards a new biological role zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso show potential for development into zzso agents for use against zzso zzso zzso
