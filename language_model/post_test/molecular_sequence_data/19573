zzso exchange between zzso cells of zzso zzso has been implicated by mating experiments using zzso and behavioral zzso zzso To observe zzso transport between mating cells, we cloned and expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene as a fusion protein attached to an enhanced yellow fluorescent protein zzso named zzso zzso fluorescent signals derived from zzso zzso were detected throughout the zzso and zzso of zzso cells after zzso of the expression zzso The normal growth and high mating zzso of the zzso indicated that zzso functioned zzso Seven hours after a zzso cell expressing zzso zzso was zzso with an zzso complementary zzso cell, zzso derived from zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso About 48 h later, the fluorescent signal was detected not only in the zzso and zzso of zzso cells but also in the zzso zzso of both mating zzso This suggests that zzso cells share parental zzso during zzso and subsequent DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in zzso cells 15 and 24 h after zzso We concluded that at least the zzso of zzso zzso was transferred from the transformed, to the zzso cell during zzso
