We have investigated the zzso and zzso properties of chicken serum zzso zzso and of the native sequence zzso derived from the zzso of this zzso zzso and equilibrium dialysis experiments demonstrate that zzso and zzso bind zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso displacement studies show that the zzso zzso in the fourth position of the protein does not appear to participate in the binding of the two zzso zzso results were obtained with the native sequence zzso zzso acid zzso The results presented here demonstrate that neither the zzso acid zzso in the third position nor the zzso in the fourth position participate in the binding of zzso and zzso to zzso It is known, however, that a number of other zzso with a zzso zzso in the third position possess zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide further evidence that the zzso zzso motif requires a zzso at the third position in order to bind zzso and zzso zzso
