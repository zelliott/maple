zzso are two zzso genes which zzso broad spectrum zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the largest zzso cluster of these genes which zzso to zzso zzso Using hidden zzso models, we identified six zzso zzso zzso sequences and subsequently found full-length expressed transcripts for these novel zzso zzso was high in brain and zzso zzso Eleven zzso could be grouped into two clear zzso by virtue of their position and high signal sequence zzso 1 zzso zzso In contrast, however, there was a very low level of sequence conservation in the zzso 2 region zzso the mature zzso zzso zzso of the gene sequences of zzso in other zzso also revealed an excess of zzso changes that altered zzso acids in the mature zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed strong evidence that following gene duplication, zzso 1 and surrounding zzso DNA show little divergence within zzso The focus for rapid sequence divergence is localized in the DNA zzso the mature zzso and this is driven by accelerated positive zzso This mechanism of evolution is consistent with the role of this gene family as defense against bacterial pathogens and the sequence changes have implications for novel zzso zzso
