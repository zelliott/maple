We surveyed the molecular evolutionary characteristics of 11 nuclear genes from 10 conifer trees belonging to the zzso the zzso and the zzso Comparisons of substitution rates among the lineages indicated that the synonymous substitution rates of the zzso lineage were higher than those of the zzso This result parallels the pattern previously found in zzso zzso zzso tests showed that the zzso rate ratio did not change significantly among zzso In addition, after adjustments for lineage effects, the zzso zzso of synonymous and zzso zzso were considerably reduced, and the latter was close to zzso These results indicated that the acceleration of evolutionary rates in the zzso lineage occurred in both the nuclear and zzso zzso and that generally, this lineage effect affected synonymous and zzso zzso zzso We also investigated the relationship of synonymous substitution rates with the zzso substitution rate, base zzso and zzso bias in each zzso zzso substitution rates were positively correlated with zzso substitution rates and zzso content at third zzso positions, but synonymous substitution rates were not correlated with zzso zzso Finally, we tested the possibility of positive selection at the protein level, using maximum likelihood models, assuming zzso zzso rate ratios among zzso zzso zzso zzso Although we did not detect strong evidence of positively selected zzso sites, the analysis suggested that significant variation in zzso rate ratio exists among the zzso The most likely sites for action of positive selection were found in the zzso zzso which is an important component of the apparatus for zzso
