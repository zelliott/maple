zzso receptors are zzso channels gated by zzso zzso We report here cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso deletion in the zzso zzso and the analysis of the corresponding zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso is as highly expressed as the original zzso sequence in various zzso zzso currents zzso by zzso expressed zzso or zzso receptors showed significant differences in zzso time zzso and zzso currents in the continuous presence of zzso These results imply functional differences between cells zzso expressing these zzso zzso
