An zzso zzso strain, designated strain zzso was isolated from a fermented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liquor sample, aged for 10 months, that was obtained from Date City, zzso Branch, zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence zzso suggested that strain zzso is a member of the zzso zzso with the closest relatives being zzso zzso zzso similarity to the type zzso and zzso zzso zzso similarity to the type zzso the only species with zzso zzso gene sequence similarities higher than zzso to strain zzso The cells of the isolate stained zzso and were zzso zzso straight rods that were zzso by means of zzso zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso with optimum growth at 36 zzso It grew at pH zzso with optimum growth at pH zzso No zzso zzso was zzso and the DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso fatty acid profile consisted mainly of zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso with the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to differences in zzso characteristics from reported species of the zzso zzso and results of zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences and zzso zzso data, the isolate merits zzso within a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
