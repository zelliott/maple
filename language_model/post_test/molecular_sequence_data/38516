We have cloned a human zzso that is related to the zzso zzso I zzso factor zzso of zzso zzso The zzso human protein displays both sequence similarity and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and is capable of rescuing a zzso strain carrying a disruption of the zzso gene in zzso Point zzso of an zzso acid that is zzso between the zzso and human proteins compromises the function of each factor, confirming that the observed sequence similarity is functionally zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso zzso factor shown to be functionally zzso between zzso and zzso suggesting that at least one mechanism that regulates zzso zzso synthesis is zzso among zzso
