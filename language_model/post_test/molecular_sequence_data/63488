zzso I and zzso II are natural zzso peptides that were identified in the zzso of the Wolf zzso zzso zzso These peptides were found to be potent growth zzso for bacteria zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Recently, shortened zzso of zzso and zzso have been reported to have decreased zzso zzso A shorter zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso was active only above 10 zzso but was also the least zzso On the basis of these findings, we became interested in obtaining a deeper insight into the membrane activity of zzso zzso as this zzso may represent the first major step for the future development of selective, zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction of this zzso with zzso of different composition was studied by zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results obtained from the zzso and zzso techniques were jointly discussed in an attempt to further understand the interaction of this zzso with model zzso
