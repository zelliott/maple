The zzso fold is found in proteins that serve a wide variety of zzso Among these are zzso which catalyze the reduction of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso Although the common structural fold shared by zzso and zzso suggests the possibility that they have evolved from a common zzso it has been difficult to examine this hypothesis in depth because zzso sequence identities between proteins in these two zzso are statistically zzso Using the zzso program, we have found that sequences of zzso involved in maturation of zzso in certain bacteria bridge the sequences of zzso and zzso Analysis of motifs found in a divergent set of zzso zzso maturation zzso and zzso provides further support for an evolutionary relationship between these zzso Within the zzso motifs are specific zzso that are characteristic of individual protein classes, and therefore are likely to be involved in the specific functions of those zzso We have used this information, in combination with existing structural and functional information, to gain new insight into the zzso relationships in these proteins and to construct a model for the emergence of zzso from a zzso zzso
