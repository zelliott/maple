We present a methodology to perform zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso acids zzso linked to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso duplexes are zzso from zzso DNA using zzso interaction zzso on a zzso zzso zzso Nearly quantitative recovery is achieved at zzso of 50 zzso after incubation of zzso with a zzso amount of zzso for 1 zzso or zzso The method exhibits high sequence zzso zzso and resolution when applied to zzso of various zzso up to 60 base pairs in zzso
