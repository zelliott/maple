The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was cloned into zzso coli using the structural gene coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the cloned DNA was zzso The primary structure of the zzso DNA zzso was deduced from the zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso comprised zzso zzso acid zzso and its molecular mass was determined to be zzso On alignment of the whole zzso acid zzso zzso DNA zzso showed a high sequence zzso with the zzso coli DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso identity with zzso DNA zzso 38% with zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso An extremely high sequence identity was observed in the region containing the zzso zzso The zzso usage in the zzso DNA zzso gene was in fact similar to the characteristic zzso in the genes for proteins from bacteria of zzso zzso the zzso content in the third position of the zzso was as high as zzso The zzso DNA zzso gene was expressed under the control of zzso promoter on a high copy zzso zzso in zzso zzso
