The zzso zzso zzso shows coexistence of sexual and asexual zzso providing an opportunity to study the evolution of breeding system variation in the context of theories on the origin and maintenance of zzso However, assessments of the distribution of sexual and asexual lineages of this zzso are complicated by the difficulties in rapidly characterizing their breeding zzso To facilitate this task and to gain insight into the genetic zzso between sexual and asexual zzso molecular markers linked to breeding system differences were recently zzso In this study, we have successfully converted a random amplified zzso DNA zzso marker associated with zzso variation in zzso zzso into a zzso zzso amplified region zzso zzso and natural populations of known breeding systems were examined to evaluate the life zzso marker zzso Complete linkage was found in segregating populations while the association averaged zzso in field zzso zzso analysis of zzso distribution and sequence divergence of the zzso locus among sexual and asexual populations provides further evidence for a unique and apparently ancient loss of sexuality in this zzso It also suggests that occasional gene flow occurs between populations differing in their breeding system, zzso by males produced by zzso zzso This system provides the possibility for the zzso emergence of new asexual zzso ensuring the longer persistence of zzso and would have important implications for the assessment of costs and benefits of sex in zzso
