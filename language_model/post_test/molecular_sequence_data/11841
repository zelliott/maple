The zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso complex of spinach and is found in a number of other zzso organisms, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in the function or assembly of the zzso zzso complex, the gene was cloned from zzso zzso excised from the DNA fragment, and replaced with a zzso resistance zzso A zzso deletion strain of zzso zzso was then obtained by zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso deletion strains are unable to grow zzso and zzso analysis shows markedly decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To verify that this zzso was due to the removal of zzso we also constructed a strain with a deletion in the open reading frame zzso which is found 25 base pairs downstream of zzso The zzso deletion strain grew zzso and had zzso levels of the four major zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the absence of the zzso protein affects either the assembly or stability of the zzso zzso complex in zzso zzso
