zzso requires tight control of expansion, zzso and survival of zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso zzso is required for zzso cell zzso expansion of zzso zzso we examined the role of the zzso zzso box, class O zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and nuclear zzso increased during zzso zzso whereas untimely induction of zzso activity accelerated differentiation of zzso zzso to zzso We identified B cell zzso gene 1 zzso protein 2 as a zzso target gene in zzso zzso zzso studies indicated zzso as a direct target of zzso zzso of zzso in primary mouse bone zzso cells blocked the outgrowth of zzso zzso which required a domain of zzso that binds protein zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso increased zzso zzso coincided with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity blocked zzso maturation without affecting expansion of zzso zzso We propose zzso expression of zzso and subsequent regulation of protein zzso zzso zzso activity as a novel mechanism controlling zzso expansion and zzso
