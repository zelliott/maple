zzso pancreatic necrosis virus zzso a zzso is an important pathogen in fish zzso zzso of viral proteins showed that zzso is the major structural and zzso zzso of the zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso are specific to zzso and bind to continuous or zzso zzso In order to determine which parts of the protein are involved in zzso variations, five zzso strains were zzso over the zzso coding zzso zzso of the sequences obtained with three previously published strains revealed a central variable domain zzso 183 to zzso which encompasses two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which escaped zzso were then selected with zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso of three zzso revealed a single zzso acid mismatch in each of zzso All of these zzso occurred in the zzso zzso suggesting that these regions are involved in the formation of a zzso zzso Finally, expression of different truncated zzso in zzso coli allowed zzso of the binding site for zzso zzso which recognize continuous zzso One of these zzso bound to the region adjacent to the zzso of the variable domain of zzso while two others reacted with the central and zzso parts of the variable zzso No zzso reacted with the zzso of zzso These results suggest that the variable domain of zzso and the 20 adjacent zzso acids of the zzso zzso part are the most important in inducing an immune response for the protection of zzso
