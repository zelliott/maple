In the year 2005, an epidemic of Japanese encephalitis zzso occurred in the northern states of zzso The present study was planned to zzso the circulation of zzso in the area and to assess the trend of the disease to slow down the burden of zzso 

Surveillance was conducted to identify patients with acute zzso Blood and zzso fluid specimens from suspected cases underwent zzso zzso and demographic zzso zzso testing for evidence of Japanese encephalitis virus zzso infection was also performed, either by zzso capture zzso or zzso To identify circulating zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso analysis was zzso Based on clinical cases reported between 1992 and 2008, the trend of zzso infection in the state was analyzed to examine the dynamics of zzso 

Our investigations zzso zzso zzso revealed that only zzso cases were positive for zzso zzso examination revealed marked zzso in zzso zzso zzso and peripheral zzso zzso zzso with mild zzso Males were more susceptible than females with a ratio of zzso and significant gender difference zzso was observed in patients below six zzso In the patient group younger than six years, the rate of infection per million was zzso higher zzso in males as compared to zzso Our zzso study suggests that the circulating strain during the 2005 zzso epidemic was close to zzso and in the future a larger epidemic may zzso 

The 2005 zzso epidemic was possibly caused by zzso zzso and it is spreading into newer zzso The trend of zzso suggests that the problem in North India is escalating and larger zzso may occur in the zzso therefore, serious steps are necessary to combat zzso including the development of more efficient surveillance methods and differential zzso
