zzso inflammation is involved in the zzso of chronic zzso degenerative zzso zzso host responses that are deleterious later in life may originate from evolutionary selection for genetic variation zzso resistance to infectious diseases under adverse environmental zzso 

In the zzso region of Ghana where infection has remained the leading cause of death, we studied the effect on survival of genetic variations at the zzso gene locus that have been associated with chronic zzso Here we show that an zzso zzso that associated with a zzso innate immune response, zzso by low zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was enriched among zzso elders zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in an environment where the source of drinking water zzso zzso zzso influences mortality risks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed that carriers of the zzso zzso have a survival advantage when drinking from zzso but a disadvantage when drinking from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene region did not uncover any additional common zzso in the zzso zzso to those zzso that were initially zzso 

Altogether, these data lend strong arguments for the selection of zzso host responses to overcome fatal infection and promote survival in adverse zzso
