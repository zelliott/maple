The determination of the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso regions zzso in the A and B zzso of DNA zzso is the molecular test for the detection of zzso resistance in zzso We looked to see if the assignment of zzso species could be obtained simultaneously by analysis of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso and zzso zzso was performed for 133 reference and clinical strains of 21 zzso species commonly isolated in clinical zzso zzso sequences of zzso and zzso zzso were species specific, regardless of zzso zzso
