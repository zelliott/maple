We zzso describe the zzso identification of a zzso deletion in the open reading frame of the zzso zzso causing the zzso Crooked Tail zzso in zzso The resulting zzso reveals a premature stop zzso that causes zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the virtual absence of functional zzso protein in affected zzso Cases exhibit skeletal anomalies thought to result from impaired zzso zzso zzso during zzso and as of yet unexplained muscular zzso We demonstrate that carrier status is very significantly associated with desired characteristics in the general population, including enhanced muscular development, and that the resulting zzso advantage caused a selective sweep which explains the unexpectedly high frequency zzso of carriers in the Belgian Blue Cattle zzso
