The WW domain consists of approximately 40 zzso has no zzso bridges, and forms a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in zzso It thus provides a model system for studying zzso stability in native zzso We performed molecular dynamics simulations of two WW zzso zzso and zzso with very different stability zzso in order to explore the initial unfolding of the zzso The less stable zzso domain is much more sensitive to simulation conditions than the zzso zzso Under standard simulation conditions in water (with or without zzso zzso at 300 K, the zzso of the zzso WW domain disintegrated at early stages of the zzso zzso commenced with the breakage of a hydrogen bond between the second and third strands of the zzso due to an zzso transition of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions play a role in this event, and the zzso WW domain structure is more stable when simulated with a complete explicit model of the surrounding zzso zzso Other factors affecting stability of the zzso are zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the flexible chain zzso and the binding of zzso zzso
