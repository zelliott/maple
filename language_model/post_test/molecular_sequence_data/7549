zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This led to the expression of a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In such zzso cells a novel approximately 109 zzso species was recognized by zzso zzso raised against a zzso whose sequence is found at the extreme zzso of both zzso and another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso was found distributed between both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities exhibited similar low zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and were both inhibited by low zzso of zzso with zzso values for the soluble activity being lower zzso zzso zzso than for the zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was resistant to release by either high zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso with the zzso zzso zzso identified two zzso species, namely an approximately 79 zzso species reflecting zzso and an approximately 109 zzso species that zzso with the zzso species seen in zzso cells zzso to express zzso The approximately 109 zzso species was found distributed between both the zzso zzso and high-speed zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso derived from both brain and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was found exclusively in the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso by these zzso from brain zzso had the characteristics of zzso zzso zzso with zzso approximately zzso zzso and zzso approximately zzso zzso The distribution of zzso activity zzso from the zzso of various brain regions paralleled that seen for the distribution of the approximately 109 zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the 109 zzso species identified in brain zzso and zzso zzso is the native form of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to have distinct patterns of expression among various brain zzso zzso and zzso activities appear to provide the major source of zzso activity in brain zzso whereas the zzso zzso activity is suggested to reflect predominantly the activity of the zzso zzso Alternative zzso of the zzso gene zzso distinct zzso zzso on zzso and zzso which zzso the zzso of these zzso and defines their distinct zzso distribution zzso
