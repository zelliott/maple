The switch from zzso to zzso growth is marked by the termination of zzso development and the adoption of floral identity by the shoot zzso zzso zzso This process is called the floral zzso To zzso the molecular zzso involved in this process, we performed zzso zzso expression profiling on zzso zzso zzso shoot zzso at zzso and early zzso stages using zzso parallel signature sequencing zzso zzso revealed significant zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after the floral zzso zzso and zzso map to duplicated regions on zzso 1 and 5 and are linked to neighboring zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso This gene order is zzso with the zzso locus responsible for floral induction in winter wheat zzso zzso and similar zzso in other zzso zzso of zzso and spatial expression patterns indicated that the duplicated pairs zzso and zzso are zzso activated after the floral transition in early developing zzso More detailed analyses revealed zzso expression zzso in leaf zzso of zzso shoot zzso and later increases within zzso zzso acquiring zzso zzso zzso analysis in late flowering zzso positioned all four genes downstream of the floral zzso zzso zzso and delayed zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to early flowering in transgenic zzso and suppresses the late flowering zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest zzso may play roles in both floral induction and zzso zzso
