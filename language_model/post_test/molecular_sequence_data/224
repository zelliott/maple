In this study we cloned and characterized a zzso gene zzso from zzso fish zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso are 57 and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The coding region of the zzso gene consists of a single zzso with a zzso zzso zzso that is two zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso protein shares a relatively high identity with the zzso and zzso proteins of other zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis indicates a close zzso of zzso to zzso of other zzso Many binding sites for zzso zzso factors were present in the promoter region of the zzso zzso indicating that it might be activated by certain zzso The level of zzso zzso when zzso to that in liver zzso was highest in zzso zzso zzso with intermediate levels in kidney zzso zzso blood zzso zzso and head kidney zzso zzso and relatively low levels in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso during the clinical stage of infectious zzso and kidney necrosis virus zzso infection showed that its expression was regulated over the course of zzso On day 4 after zzso challenge, zzso expression was zzso in blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso head kidney zzso zzso and kidney zzso zzso
