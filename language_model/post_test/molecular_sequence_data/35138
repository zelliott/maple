zzso effective in modulating zzso interactions and resistant to zzso have potential in therapeutic zzso An appealing yet underperforming zzso strategy is to employ zzso acids and reversed sequences to mimic a lead zzso zzso either separately or as the combined zzso zzso In this work, we examine the zzso of zzso reverse and zzso peptides of zzso using implicit zzso molecular dynamics simulation and circular zzso zzso In order to obtain zzso ensembles for the zzso we find enhanced sampling is required via the replica exchange molecular dynamics zzso From these replica exchange simulations, the zzso zzso of zzso result in a predominantly left-handed zzso zzso When the parent sequence is reversed sequence as either the zzso and zzso these peptides display a greater zzso zzso feature reflected by zzso and CD studies in zzso zzso The simulations also indicate that, while approximately similar zzso of the zzso are possible by the zzso zzso their ability to mimic the parent zzso is severely compromised by backbone orientation (for zzso zzso and zzso orientation (for reversed zzso A zzso zzso is disadvantaged as a mimic in both aspects, and further chemical modification is required to enable this concept to be used fruitfully in zzso zzso The replica exchange molecular simulation approach adopted here, with its ability to provide detailed zzso insights into modified zzso has potential as a tool to guide zzso design of new improved zzso
