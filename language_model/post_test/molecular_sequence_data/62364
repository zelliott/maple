zzso catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso pesticides and chemical warfare nerve agents with various zzso The directed evolution of zzso to enhance the breakdown of poor zzso is desirable for the purposes of zzso A limiting factor in the identification of zzso zzso with increased activity is the ability to effectively screen large zzso zzso To this end, we have investigated the possibility of zzso zzso activity to cell growth by using zzso zzso as the sole zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso would occur via the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and then zzso The zzso coli strain zzso expressing the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to grow when zzso is used as the sole zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso capable of growing when zzso zzso is the sole zzso zzso The zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso has been previously characterized as a zzso zzso We isolated and characterized the genes zzso the zzso zzso The zzso was identified from a shotgun clone that enabled zzso coli to grow when zzso zzso is the sole zzso zzso zzso coli zzso the zzso and zzso grew when zzso was the sole zzso zzso By constructing a short zzso pathway, we have enabled zzso coli to use zzso as a sole source of zzso
