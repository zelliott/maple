Despite zzso patterns being well zzso in a large number of species, and zzso patterns emerging, the zzso do not all appear to show consistent zzso While some species tend to fit with standard theoretical zzso expectations zzso zzso others show little obvious modern zzso structure zzso zzso In this study we briefly review these studies, and present a new zzso study of the red fox zzso zzso throughout Europe, using a combination of ancient DNA sequences obtained from museum zzso and modern sequences collated from zzso We used zzso b zzso zzso and the zzso control region zzso zzso to zzso both current and historical zzso zzso 

We found evidence for slight isolation by distance in modern zzso as well as differentiation associated with time, both of which can likely be attributed to random genetic zzso Despite high sequence diversity zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso no evidence for spatial structure (from zzso trees) is found either in modern samples or ancient samples for either zzso and zzso skyline plots suggested little change in the effective population size over the past 40,000 zzso 

It is probable that the high zzso ability and zzso of the red fox has contributed to the lack of zzso zzso which appears to have remained consistent over tens of thousands of zzso zzso patterns of how animals are thought to have responded to historical zzso change are not necessarily valid for all species, and so understanding the differences between species will be critical for predicting how species will be affected by future zzso zzso
