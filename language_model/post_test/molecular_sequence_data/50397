The zzso gene is specifically expressed in certain zzso tumors but not in their zzso zzso It is also expressed in several normal cell and tissue types that exhibit the ability to be zzso The gene was cloned from both mouse and human sources and the zzso zzso regions were zzso The sequencing data revealed a zzso region of high zzso between the mouse and human zzso zzso This zzso was observed in the vicinity of the zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene was also observed to have a high degree of zzso to some known promoter and zzso zzso To determine the role this region plays in regulating the zzso of zzso promoter analysis was zzso Sixteen zzso were prepared in which the zzso zzso gene was fused to different regions of the mouse zzso zzso These zzso were analyzed in transient zzso zzso in two related cell lines derived from mouse zzso zzso zzso a zzso cell line with low levels of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso cell line with high levels of zzso zzso zzso of our transient zzso zzso in conjunction with results obtained from in zzso and in zzso zzso of the promoter region show no evidence of zzso control elements important for the zzso regulation of zzso in these cell zzso A few zzso upstream of the zzso box are sufficient for zzso levels of zzso zzso Because no zzso control elements were found, restriction of zzso zzso in zzso cells must exist on some other zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The possible role of zzso in progression of the zzso zzso zzso cell line toward the zzso zzso zzso cell line is zzso
