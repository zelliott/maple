zzso is a zzso of zzso that is uniquely expressed and regulated in the zzso cells of the anterior zzso zzso zzso hormone receptors zzso are known to mediate zzso suppression of zzso gene expression at the level of promoter zzso The role of other nuclear receptors in regulation of this gene is less clearly zzso zzso X receptors zzso are a family of nuclear zzso factors that function both as zzso acid zzso zzso receptors and zzso partners with zzso and other nuclear zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso has been identified in the anterior zzso zzso and found to be restricted to zzso cells within the zzso In this report, we have further characterized the distribution of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and different cell zzso We have found that zzso zzso and protein are expressed in the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we have studied the effects of zzso on zzso promoter activity and hormone regulation in these zzso cell zzso Both zzso and zzso independently suppressed promoter activity in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the combination of zzso suppressed promoter activity more than either alone, indicating that these hormones may act zzso to regulate zzso gene expression in zzso The zzso zzso was necessary for the zzso suppression of zzso promoter activity in zzso and zzso cells, both of which lack this zzso zzso a more widely distributed zzso did not mediate these zzso Finally, we showed that the zzso zzso promoter region between zzso and zzso zzso a majority of the zzso suppression of promoter activity in zzso This region is distinct from the zzso response region near the zzso start zzso These data suggest that zzso can mediate zzso gene regulation in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is required for this zzso
