The most recent revision of the zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggested a reduction to a set of four zzso zzso Chlorella species, while a growing number of zzso different species such as zzso (formerly zzso were found to cluster within the zzso of zzso In this study, the generic concept in zzso to Chlorella and zzso was evaluated by means of combined zzso and zzso zzso sequence analyses and zzso to induce development of zzso on the cell zzso zzso zzso analyses of Chlorella and zzso strains confirmed their separation into two different zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and zzso base changes zzso in the secondary structures of zzso and zzso zzso sequences were found for both zzso using this zzso The zzso zzso can be differentiated into three different zzso Using culture medium of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plasticity in Chlorella and zzso was zzso zzso zzso cells developed zzso during incubation with zzso culture zzso whereas Chlorella did not produce zzso zzso experiments with zzso showed the zzso preferred to feed on zzso zzso The dominance of colonies versus solitary cells in the zzso culture was not correlated with the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso characteristics like formation of zzso represent zzso adaptations to the conditions in the zzso
