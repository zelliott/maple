We isolated three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and characterized their zzso expression at both the transcript and protein zzso We also characterized the binding specificity between each zzso protein and its potential zzso zzso protection zzso showed that these three zzso zzso genes were expressed similarly in all zzso at all times during the zzso life cycle, except at the initiation of zzso and during late seed zzso Western zzso analyses showed that a different group of zzso zzso proteins accumulated in dehydrated seeds during seed maturation and the accumulated proteins remained high during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso of these three zzso zzso were determined using the zzso 30 zzso of the three zzso to select bound zzso using zzso display zzso and were confirmed by zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso specifically bound to the zzso 30 zzso region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the core of the zzso as well as zzso 6 and 7, might contribute to the binding zzso Our results indicate that the function of these three zzso may not be important in seed maturation or in zzso zzso but are more likely involved in normal growth and zzso
