In addition to their role in zzso zzso the human zzso proteins zzso and zzso are important models of how zzso zzso proteins execute zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from potato and thereby provide the only evolutionary comparison available for both proteins and represent the only full-length genes zzso plant zzso proteins to have been cloned and zzso In zzso zzso binding experiments revealed the ability of potato zzso to interact with human zzso to enhance zzso binding and to distinguish zzso zzso of either plant or animal zzso A comparison of the sequence of zzso and zzso proteins indicated that multiple zzso which could affect zzso motif zzso probably govern the specific distinction in zzso binding by these zzso Since human zzso zzso zzso in zzso the possibility that plant zzso might be exploited in the characterization of this process in plants was zzso However, unlike zzso zzso neither zzso from potato nor zzso bound their own zzso and no evidence for binding to upstream efficiency elements in zzso signals was zzso suggesting that plant zzso is not involved in zzso
