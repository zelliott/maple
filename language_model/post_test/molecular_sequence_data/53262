The zzso protein zzso gene encodes two zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso which are members of the highly zzso zzso family of zzso zzso While the functions of this family are poorly zzso the fact that zzso zzso of the zzso gene cause zzso in man is testament to the importance of zzso and zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso differs from zzso by the presence of a 35 zzso acid domain exposed to the zzso which is not zzso by other zzso genes and appears to have arisen in zzso approximately 300 million years before zzso However, the zzso gene family can be traced back at least 550 million years and is represented in zzso and zzso Thus, from an evolutionary perspective zzso can reasonably be anticipated to perform functions in zzso zzso that cannot be accomplished by other zzso zzso we use a novel zzso strategy to generate mice expressing zzso levels of a zzso gene that has been modified to zzso only zzso Although zzso is incorporated into functional compact zzso zzso in young animals, our data show that the 35 zzso acid zzso zzso is required to zzso the normal zzso period and to zzso long-term stability on this zzso zzso
