The hairpin zzso is a small zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural studies exclude a requirement for zzso metal zzso zzso and zzso one active site zzso in particular, zzso in the zzso zzso Our previous work demonstrated that the zzso activity that is lost when zzso is replaced by an zzso zzso is restored when certain zzso are provided in zzso The specificity and pH dependence of zzso zzso rescue were consistent with several models of the rescue zzso including general acid base zzso zzso stabilization of negative charge in the transition state or a requirement for zzso to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso rescue for both zzso and zzso reactions now allow us to refine models of the rescue zzso zzso increased with increasing pH for both unmodified zzso reactions and zzso reactions of zzso zzso lacking zzso This similarity in pH dependence argues against a role for zzso as a general base zzso because zzso zzso could not be responsible for the zzso transition in the zzso zzso zzso zzso rescue of both zzso and zzso activity increased with decreasing zzso arguing against a role for rescuing zzso in general acid zzso because a zzso that contributes general acid zzso in the zzso zzso should provide general base zzso in zzso Analysis of the concentration dependence of zzso rescue at high and low pH demonstrated that zzso promotes zzso within the zzso zzso complex but does not stabilize zzso binding in the ground zzso These results support an zzso stabilization mechanism in which zzso zzso binding counters negative charge that develops in the transition zzso
