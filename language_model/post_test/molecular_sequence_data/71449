zzso based on amplification of zzso zzso genes for comparing bacterial communities are now widely used in microbial zzso but zzso of these techniques with traditional tools, such as zzso has been conspicuously zzso In this study, we compared levels of bacterial community diversity in two zzso zzso soil samples and two zzso zzso soil samples by analyzing 179 cultivated bacterial zzso and 801 zzso zzso genes amplified from extracted soil zzso zzso were defined by performing a restriction zzso length zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences with the zzso zzso and zzso The average level of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of members of a zzso was zzso based on an analysis of partial zzso A total of zzso zzso were identified among the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso while 34 zzso occurred among the cultivated zzso Analysis of sequences from a subset of the zzso showed that at least seven bacterial divisions were represented in the clone libraries, whereas the zzso represented only zzso The zzso zzso frequency distribution zzso and composition of the four culture collections and the four clone libraries were investigated by using a variety of diversity zzso Although zzso and zzso zzso cloning analyses gave contradictory descriptions of the relative zzso richness for one of the four zzso the two methods identified zzso consistent relationships when levels of zzso were zzso The levels of zzso similarity between communities were zzso low (15 to zzso Both methods consistently indicated that one environment was distinct from the other zzso Our data illustrate that while zzso zzso cloning and zzso generally describe similar relationships between soil microbial communities, significant discrepancies can zzso
