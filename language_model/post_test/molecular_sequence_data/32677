zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso and one zzso were observed in batch culture while zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to two zzso were isolated from information obtained from the released draft sequence of this zzso strain zzso and cloned in zzso zzso The zzso zzso were shown to be zzso producing a zzso identified by zzso as zzso confirming our recent report stating that these are also mosaic zzso bearing structural features of zzso in the zzso and zzso terminal regions, as is also the case of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso and characterized in terms of zzso temperature, and kinetic zzso The zzso exhibits zzso kinetic properties with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso behaves mainly as a zzso as only zzso of the zzso is zzso in a wide range of zzso zzso with higher zzso activities at low zzso zzso With this report we zzso confirm the unusual structural pattern displayed by zzso present in zzso species that group as a novel zzso family of zzso
