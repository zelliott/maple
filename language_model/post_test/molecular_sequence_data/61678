zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso one of a limited number of compounds that accumulate to high levels in the zzso of cells to prevent zzso and zzso in adverse zzso zzso In the present study, the highly zzso rich zzso gene zzso for zzso zzso was cloned from zzso DNA of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and expressed to high yields in zzso coli strain zzso The resulting zzso was zzso to high levels in a single zzso step using zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso analyses showed that the zzso linkage between the zzso zzso and the protein is preserved in zzso zzso zzso consistent with protein zzso being a zzso zzso The zzso was shown to be a zzso of zzso Da by zzso zzso and to be active with both zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso sequence of zzso originally reported in zzso contains seven flaws, resulting in a translated protein with a significantly altered zzso acid sequence between position zzso and zzso
