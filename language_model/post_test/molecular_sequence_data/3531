Using zzso chain zzso zzso zzso we have isolated genes expressed during the in zzso differentiation of zzso embryonic stem cells into zzso cells zzso Among the genes zzso we identified one gene that was zzso by vascular zzso growth factor zzso in the zzso zzso line zzso Analysis of the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that the protein was composed of zzso zzso zzso including an zzso consensus sequence of the zzso zzso family, and is thought to be a mouse zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from synthetic zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was expressed in zzso during zzso zzso zzso elimination of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso migration, and network formation of zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso to zzso inhibited zzso in zzso These results suggest a novel function of zzso which is expressed in zzso and plays an important role in zzso
