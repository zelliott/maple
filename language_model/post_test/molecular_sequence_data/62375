zzso zzso of seven clinical strains of zzso zzso representative of those isolated between 1994 and 2002 from a fish farm with endemic enteric zzso disease was zzso All zzso displayed indistinguishable zzso gel zzso restriction patterns, indicating that they represented a single zzso However, considering both zzso zone diameters zzso and zzso the zzso recovered in zzso formed a separate cluster with lower levels of zzso to all the zzso tested, especially zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso compared with the zzso recovered between 1994 and zzso Analysis of the zzso product of the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene from clinical zzso of zzso zzso with reduced zzso to zzso and zzso revealed a single zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso zzso coli zzso zzso substitution was observed in induced zzso zzso zzso which displayed zzso and zzso of zzso similar to those of the clinical zzso of zzso zzso with reduced zzso to these zzso zzso These data indicate in that for zzso zzso the substitution of zzso by zzso at position 83 of the zzso gene is associated with reduced zzso to zzso
