We have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso zzso that encodes an zzso of a major zzso zzso zzso zzso p V zzso referred to as zzso p zzso Singh et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88 (1991) zzso and zzso p zzso zzso et zzso zzso 339 (1992) zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso expression library using grass zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso from an allergic serum zzso The zzso zzso sequence of clone zzso potentially encodes a zzso protein of 339 zzso acids zzso It possesses a leader zzso essentially identical to the previously characterized zzso of zzso p V zzso p zzso This indicates a mature processed zzso protein of 314 zzso zzso well with the size of the zzso revealed by Western analysis of zzso proteins using zzso zzso affinity zzso from zzso fusion protein zzso zzso by clone zzso as solid zzso There is no zzso zzso The protein zzso by clone zzso designated zzso p zzso has zzso identity and zzso similarity with zzso p zzso However, a zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not recognize zzso zzso by clone zzso indicating that zzso p zzso does not share this zzso zzso studies using affinity zzso zzso zzso showed that both zzso share similar zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso from a population of 30 patients showed that zzso possess zzso zzso that recognize both zzso p V zzso Variation occurred in the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
