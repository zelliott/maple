zzso a zzso zzso protein expressed on zzso and zzso regulates zzso interactions and serves as the zzso zzso We showed previously that zzso zzso the expression of human zzso by acting at the zzso zzso We now investigate whether zzso expression could also be regulated by zzso another member of the zzso 5 zzso gene zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso expression on human zzso By contrast, expression of zzso and zzso was enhanced zzso zzso of zzso involved neither shedding nor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, soluble zzso was not increased in the zzso of zzso zzso and expression of zzso another zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso transcript levels were reduced zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso membrane zzso by suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso release of zzso was inhibited markedly zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso after a zzso zzso with zzso However, zzso also directly inhibited zzso zzso because it blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso may play a major role in the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso
