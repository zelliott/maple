A short zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso site consensus sequence zzso zzso is sufficient to bind zzso small nuclear zzso particle zzso or to induce the association of U2 zzso and zzso triple zzso Analysis of the requirements of these interactions demonstrates that the zzso zzso is recognized independently by at least two different elements during zzso zzso the zzso end of zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Since stable zzso zzso zzso base pairing prevents interaction of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso complex, we conclude that disruption of the initial base pairing between the zzso zzso and the zzso end of zzso zzso is required for subsequent zzso zzso
