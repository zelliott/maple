We have cloned human zzso one of the newly emerging zzso family of zzso domain zzso zzso The channel has 411 zzso acids with a zzso extension at the zzso when compared with the cloned mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso produced a substantial zzso shift in resting membrane potential accompanied by the induction of large, zzso zzso zzso currents which were zzso zzso zzso zzso currents were only blocked to a limited extent by classic zzso channel zzso or open channel pore zzso known to zzso inhibit other zzso The channel was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso distribution of zzso is widespread with higher levels being observed in zzso zzso amygdala, zzso and spinal zzso Only low levels of expression were seen in the majority of peripheral zzso Thus, zzso although functionally and zzso similar to mouse zzso appears to have a more zzso zzso
