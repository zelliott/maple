zzso wheat zzso B zzso was used to study the effects of alien zzso zzso into a wheat genetic background, subjecting the wheat zzso to a new and transient zzso zzso Using this experimental material, we have previously demonstrated that no large-scale zzso zzso occurred as a result of the zzso constitution of the addition zzso However, we have shown that the presence of a number of rye B zzso is associated with changes in the zzso organization and expression patterns of wheat zzso zzso We have now extended our studies to focus on a further characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso and also on high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso In the process, we have uncovered an unusually large zzso of the zzso zzso locus on wheat zzso zzso (not to be confused with rye B zzso and 2 novel zzso zzso zzso zzso These changes are not directly related to variation in rye B zzso number in the present material, but the fact that a new, and still zzso zzso zzso gene was identified indicates a recent zzso for its zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus zzso a unit sharing zzso zzso with a rye zzso zzso zzso suggesting the possibility that the wheat locus was zzso by highly zzso rye sequences during the breeding of zzso when the rye and wheat zzso were together, albeit briefly, in the same zzso
