A procedure for producing and zzso zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso is zzso These zzso are produced by zzso zzso with a zzso containing the gene zzso for either the human zzso virus type 1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso Both proteins are partially processed by host cell zzso giving rise to a mixture of zzso and zzso products, which are subsequently resolved to near zzso by zzso on zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso devoid of excess zzso zzso or zzso precursors are isolated, enabling comparative zzso characterization of the fully active (and biologically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by this methodology exhibit near equivalent zzso and zzso H zzso
