zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that is the major cause of zzso zzso zzso zzso The biology of this pathogen remains poorly understood in part due to unavailability of molecular genetic zzso zzso with an objective to develop DNA zzso capabilities for zzso zzso the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene was isolated from a zzso library and used to construct expression zzso In transient zzso the reporter molecules zzso zzso and yellow fluorescent protein zzso could be detected in zzso zzso zzso thereby confirming the feasibility of zzso expression in this zzso zzso transformation of zzso zzso was achieved using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso that zzso resistance to zzso This selection system was used to create transgenic zzso zzso that zzso express zzso and zzso As shown in this study, these transgenic clones can be useful for analyzing growth rate of zzso in zzso and for assessing drug zzso More importantly, the DNA zzso methods described zzso should greatly facilitate studies examining zzso zzso by this important zzso zzso
