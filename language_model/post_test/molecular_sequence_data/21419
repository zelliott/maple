zzso proteins are zzso found on the cell surface and in the cell walls of higher zzso The zzso zzso of most zzso proteins are composed of zzso main chains and zzso side zzso to which other auxiliary zzso are zzso For the present study, an zzso designated zzso was first zzso and cloned from winter mushroom zzso zzso The zzso specifically zzso zzso but did not act on zzso zzso zzso and zzso It released various zzso together with Gal from zzso in the early phase of the reaction, demonstrating that it acts on zzso in an zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is member of a novel zzso distinct from known zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso family zzso Point zzso replacing the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso in this family with zzso abolished zzso These results indicate that zzso is a highly specific zzso zzso 16 zzso
