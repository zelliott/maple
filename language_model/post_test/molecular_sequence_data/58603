The zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli is a zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene located upstream of the gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence resembles those of the approximately zzso zzso found in zzso proteins zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nitrate zzso These zzso contain four zzso zzso zzso which are thought to function as zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be a zzso zzso containing two iron atoms and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and resonance zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso having remarkably similar properties to the zzso cluster of zzso zzso may thus be a zzso zzso participating either in zzso of iron zzso zzso (or other iron zzso or in zzso regulation of zzso zzso
