zzso of U2 zzso to the branch point sequence of zzso is a necessary step in zzso zzso In the current model, zzso bound at the zzso tract of the zzso recruits U2 zzso to the branch point sequence by interacting with the U2 zzso protein zzso We demonstrate that the zzso domain of zzso contains multiple zzso binding sites that are distinct from the binding site for the U2 zzso protein zzso mapped to zzso acids zzso of zzso The zzso domain of zzso appears to adopt a primarily unfolded structure but is functional to inhibit zzso in zzso zzso binding studies show that the zzso domain of zzso binds zzso zzso and that the sites for zzso binding and zzso binding are overlapping (or the zzso within zzso We propose that the zzso domain of zzso adopts a primarily unfolded structure that functions as a scaffold to facilitate zzso multiple zzso and zzso zzso The multiple zzso binding sites on zzso suggest a model in which multiple zzso molecules bound to the zzso could enhance U2 zzso recruitment to the branch point zzso
