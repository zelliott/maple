zzso is an important zzso in the innate immune system that plays a vital role in fighting microbial zzso In the current study, we identified, zzso and characterized a gene that encodes an zzso zzso from the disk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso consisted of zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes 131 zzso zzso The theoretical molecular mass of mature zzso was zzso zzso with an zzso point of zzso zzso features in other zzso such as zzso sites for zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso and ten zzso zzso were identified in zzso zzso sequence analysis with respect to its zzso showed that zzso was organized into four zzso interrupted by three zzso Several zzso zzso factor binding sites were discovered in the putative promoter zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso depicted high identity and closer zzso respectively, with an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and indicated that zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso is mainly transcribed in zzso followed by zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was induced following bacterial zzso zzso and zzso zzso and viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso demonstrated strong zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso activity against several zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed optimum zzso activity at pH zzso and 60 zzso while exhibiting optimum zzso activity at pH zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is potentially involved in immune responses of the disk zzso to protect it from zzso
