zzso zzso that operate via an zzso mechanism were developed by in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display libraries were created where the zzso active site zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were combined with a zzso human zzso V gene zzso zzso from these libraries with zzso zzso trapped the zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso by formation of stable zzso The selected zzso zzso retained the essential zzso zzso zzso and its function in altered and humanized primary zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso was directly related to the structure of the zzso used for zzso The zzso values of the zzso zzso reactions were correlated with the zzso values, zzso the zzso of the selected zzso zzso for the corresponding zzso zzso that bound to the zzso with a lower zzso value displayed a higher zzso value in the zzso reaction, and a linear relationship was observed in the plots of zzso versus zzso These results indicate that selections with zzso directed the evolution of zzso zzso in zzso that operate via an zzso zzso This strategy provides a route to zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso
