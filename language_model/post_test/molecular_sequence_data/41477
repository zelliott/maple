The zzso nuclear zzso sequence of zzso in zzso zzso is critical for its nuclear import zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso lateral sclerosis zzso related zzso are clustered in zzso We report here the zzso zzso and cell biological characterization of the zzso and its clinical zzso The crystal structure of the zzso complex shows extensive contacts between the two proteins and a unique zzso structure in the zzso The binding affinity between zzso and zzso zzso and 12 zzso zzso was zzso As compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each zzso zzso caused a decreased affinity and the range of this reduction varied widely from zzso over zzso The affinity of the zzso correlated with the extent of impaired nuclear zzso and more importantly, with the duration of disease progression in ALS zzso This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the nuclear targeting mechanism of zzso and illustrates the significance of zzso in zzso
