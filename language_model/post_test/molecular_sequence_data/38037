Two human expressed sequence tag zzso zzso sequences with identity with zzso and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified from the zzso database of zzso Pharmaceuticals, zzso zzso Alto, CA, zzso An zzso complementary to the 3' zzso zzso sequences was used to screen human liver zzso using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The amplified DNA zzso had zzso identity with a putative open reading frame zzso predicted from a human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso in mouse zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso protein was a zzso as determined by the conversion of zzso acid zzso into zzso acid zzso The human zzso contained a predicted zzso zzso zzso domain, as well as three zzso zzso A tissue expression profile revealed that this gene is highly expressed in fetal liver, fetal brain, adult brain and adrenal zzso A search of the existing databases led to zzso of this zzso within a 14 zzso zzso flanked by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
