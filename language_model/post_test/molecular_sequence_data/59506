The bacterial pathogen zzso zzso is the most prolific zzso species within the zzso zzso The toxins are responsible for a wide variety of human and veterinary diseases, many of which are zzso zzso zzso type A strains are also associated with one of the most common forms of food-borne illness zzso The zzso results from the production and gastrointestinal zzso of a zzso known as zzso The regulation, zzso and mechanism of action of zzso has been of considerable interest as the protein is zzso zzso expression is zzso zzso although the mechanism of zzso regulation is not fully zzso Cloning studies suggest the involvement of global regulators, but these have not been zzso Although very few type A strains are naturally zzso the zzso gene appears highly zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso whereas in veterinary zzso zzso may be zzso Variation in zzso location suggests the involvement of zzso genetic zzso zzso proteins are produced by some zzso zzso types C and zzso and silent remnants of the zzso gene can be found in zzso zzso type E strains associated with the iota toxin zzso zzso has received attention for its biomedical zzso The toxin has been implicated in sudden infant death syndrome zzso because of its zzso zzso zzso can destroy a wide variety of cell types both in zzso and in zzso suggesting that it could have potential in the construction of zzso to zzso zzso It is obvious that zzso is an interesting protein that deserves continued zzso
