A deletion of an zzso was detected in a zzso zzso for the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso was recently isolated from a zzso library made from peripheral blood zzso of a patient with primary zzso zzso The region, where the deletion occurred, represents a hot spot region in the La zzso It leads to a frame shift zzso and a premature stop zzso zzso zzso acids downstream of the deletion site within one of the zzso sensitive regions of the La zzso In spite of the frame shift zzso expression of full length La protein occurred efficiently in zzso zzso Full length La protein was also made in zzso cells infected with zzso zzso although the efficiency of full length protein production was zzso Two major peptides with molecular weights of 29 zzso and 25 zzso were zzso The size of these peptides was similar to the known zzso degradation products of La zzso The zzso 29 zzso zzso containing the zzso consensus sequence located in the zzso The 25 zzso zzso zzso containing the nuclear location signal entered in the nucleus and associated with nuclear zzso In conclusion, the ability to zzso zzso zzso remain in the nucleus and zzso assemble with nuclear zzso resides in the zzso domain of La protein and does not depend on the zzso zzso zzso
