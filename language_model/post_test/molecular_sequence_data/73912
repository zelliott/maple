To determine the zzso gene zzso in zzso blood, we made libraries of zzso sequences from two zzso blood zzso zzso The rearranged sequences were amplified using random amplification of zzso ends zzso ensuring unbiased amplification of all zzso zzso Although the human zzso locus contains approximately 38 potentially functional V zzso we observed that approximately zzso of the 146 sequences from our two samples used only nine zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we also amplified zzso and zzso zzso from zzso DNA from one of these zzso zzso zzso give an approximation of the relative frequency of gene zzso Some of the genes that were overused in the zzso libraries were also observed to rearrange zzso but others did not show high zzso zzso suggesting that cellular selection caused their increase in the zzso Surprisingly, we observed a high frequency of zzso using zzso which has been reported to be a defective zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed two new functional zzso of this zzso We observed that N zzso were present in zzso of the productive sequences from zzso blood DNA and zzso To determine the actual rate of N region addition, we analyzed zzso junctions of zzso of two zzso V zzso zzso percent of those zzso blood sequences contained N zzso In comparison, 57% of junctions of the rearranged zzso gene from adult zzso contained N zzso Finally, we observed that zzso length zzso was more pronounced for zzso genes than for all of the other zzso zzso
