zzso zzso zzso are covered by a surface layer consisting of mainly zzso and other zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso are small zzso proteins that determine the number and size of accumulated zzso zzso Five zzso proteins zzso to zzso are known for zzso zzso In this study, we identified three additional potential zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso by inspection of the zzso zzso zzso for sequences with zzso 2 zzso To determine whether the corresponding proteins represent true zzso zzso with zzso zzso yellow fluorescent zzso were zzso Similar zzso of zzso with zzso to zzso as well as zzso with zzso zzso zzso an inactive zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso All zzso were investigated in zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was found for all zzso zzso and for zzso to zzso Additionally, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso with zzso however, did not zzso with zzso zzso but did zzso with the zzso zzso zzso all zzso (except zzso were soluble in a zzso zzso These data confirm that zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso true zzso for which we propose the designation zzso zzso and zzso zzso When zzso of zzso was investigated at different stages of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were soluble in the first 3 h under zzso conditions, although zzso zzso appeared after 10 zzso At later time points, the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of strains expressing zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso localized predominantly near the cell poles or in the area of future zzso zzso This phenomenon was not observed for the other zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and indicated that some zzso can have additional zzso A zzso deletion of zzso or zzso had no visible effect on formation of zzso zzso
