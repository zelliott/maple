The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso shares with members of the zzso zzso the property of possessing structural zzso and zzso zzso genes in opposite zzso The three zzso genes located in the zzso half on one strand zzso three zzso proteins assumed to be involved in viral DNA zzso zzso and zzso which are common to all zzso and a zzso zzso zzso with a unique zzso Whereas the essential role played by zzso zzso in viral DNA replication has been clearly established zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nothing is known of the biological zzso of zzso To investigate this function, we designed zzso derived from zzso a zzso encompassing an infectious sequence of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Dumas, zzso zzso zzso with partial or complete deletion of zzso sequence or with the zzso initiation zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of these zzso to sensitive zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso larvae prevented the accomplishment of a productive zzso We clearly established that the blocking of the zzso cycle in the absence of zzso expression occurred at the level of viral DNA zzso zzso of viral DNA could be restored by zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso expressing zzso protein in zzso Time course analysis showed that zzso is produced early (6 h zzso in the zzso cycle, and its production parallels that of zzso viral zzso Finally, we present evidence that zzso and zzso proteins are zzso at apparently the same levels whether or not zzso is zzso
