The expression of the zzso I gene from zzso zzso a wide host range zzso of the zzso zzso group, was studied in zzso zzso Using a promoter test zzso a promoter was detected upstream of the zzso I zzso From a zzso protection experiment, the zzso was determined to start 360 zzso upstream of the coding zzso Two putative promoter zzso and zzso sequences were found upstream from the predicted zzso zzso The presence of this promoter sequence in other R factors was discussed in relation with previous data showing that the zzso I genes were transcribed from other zzso The translation product of the zzso I gene was detected in zzso Its size indicates that the translation starts at the first zzso zzso found in the open reading zzso
