The sequences of zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso structural locus have been determined from zzso of the mouse zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso and direct sequencing of the amplified zzso Four individual zzso differences were observed between the two zzso The difference at zzso acid zzso 94, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may account for the differing zzso migration, zzso point, and zzso of the two zzso Two of the other observed differences in the coding region zzso acid zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are silent and do not affect the predicted zzso acid zzso on zzso The fourth observed difference is located within the 3' zzso sequences of the zzso The change at zzso acid zzso 94 is associated with the presence of a zzso restriction site in zzso which is absent in zzso and may be a useful method for determining this zzso
