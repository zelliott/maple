zzso species are capable of zzso gene transfer between bacteria and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso consists of a circular and a linear zzso the zzso and the zzso which harbors bacterial zzso genes required for tumor formation in zzso Little is known about promoter sequences and the small zzso zzso repertoire of this and other zzso We used a differential zzso sequencing zzso approach to map zzso start sites of 388 zzso genes and zzso In addition, a total number of zzso zzso was revealed from all four zzso zzso Twenty-two of these were confirmed by independent zzso gel zzso analysis and several zzso were zzso expressed in response to growth media, growth phase, temperature or zzso One zzso from the zzso was zzso induced under zzso zzso The presence of 76 zzso zzso two of them on the reverse strand of zzso zzso suggests considerable zzso zzso in zzso The information gained from this study provides a valuable zzso for an in-depth understanding of zzso regulation of the complex physiology and infection process of zzso
