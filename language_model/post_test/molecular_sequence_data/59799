The zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso protein with a high zzso to the rat zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A 1500 zzso upstream promoter zzso was fused to the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene or zzso zzso reporter gene and transferred into tobacco plants by the zzso leaf disk transformation zzso Analysis of zzso activity in leaf zzso showed that mechanical wounding increased the zzso promoter activity about 5 times as compared to zzso controls and that the promoter activity was further enhanced by plant growth regulators, zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns of the transgenic plants showed that the zzso promoter activity is high in actively growing zzso including various zzso floral zzso and developing zzso A series of zzso deletion analyses of the zzso promoter indicated that a 50 zzso region located between zzso and zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this region reduced the promoter activity to an zzso zzso zzso of the 50 zzso sequence into a minimal promoter restored the promoter activity and the promoter strength was zzso to the copy number of the upstream zzso The role of zzso and zzso box regions was studied by a series of 3' deletion zzso A 3' deletion up to zzso did not significantly affect the promoter zzso However deletion of the promoter up to 70 zzso which deleted the zzso box region, significantly reduced promoter zzso Further deletion of the promoter up to - zzso eliminating the zzso box region, abolished the promoter zzso These results suggest that the zzso box and zzso box regions are also important for the zzso promoter activity in addition to the 50 zzso upstream zzso
