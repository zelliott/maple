zzso of the cellular zzso of zzso in zzso cells has enabled its interaction with other proteins to be zzso tested and zzso zzso a calcium sensing zzso is now thought to act by zzso of the light state through interference with the interaction of zzso and zzso Because of the detection of zzso in multiple cell zzso the specificity of the cellular zzso of zzso was investigated in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso chicken, frog, and zzso and compared to that for zzso zzso and zzso In addition to zzso cell zzso the application of zzso zzso against zzso demonstrated zzso cells in the inner nuclear layer and a rare zzso cell in the zzso cell layer of the zzso rat and rabbit zzso Only zzso cells were stained with zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso whereas no cells were zzso in the chicken zzso In all six species zzso only zzso cells were zzso with zzso against zzso zzso or zzso Based on intensity of zzso two distinct populations of zzso cells were distinguished in the zzso cell layer of the zzso of the rat and zzso with the more darkly stained cells (probably zzso representing about zzso of the zzso zzso The presence of zzso in cells other than zzso suggests it has an alternative or additional function and indicates the presence of multiple cell zzso expression signals in the regulatory region of the zzso zzso
