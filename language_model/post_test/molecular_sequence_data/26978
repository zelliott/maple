A significant number of zzso sequences have been revealed in human zzso by zzso searches, zzso that zzso may be involved in important biological processes and may be new zzso zzso zzso it is important to discover the potential interactions of zzso with other molecules or zzso Here we describe a class of zzso which can bind to zzso groups that widely exist in zzso and drug zzso The specific interaction of these zzso with zzso groups was identified by high performance affinity zzso zzso using immobilized zzso and zzso as stationary phase zzso The circular zzso zzso zzso and native zzso gel zzso zzso show that these zzso binding zzso adopt an zzso parallel zzso The relationship of zzso binding and zzso structure provides new clues for the zzso studies as well as for the molecular designs of therapeutic zzso
