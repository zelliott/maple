zzso as zzso insects, live in dense groups with high zzso increasing the risk of pathogen spread and possibly driving the evolution of their zzso immune zzso zzso zzso of seven zzso species provide a new source to undertake comparative study of their zzso peptides zzso key components of insect innate zzso By using zzso approaches, we analyzed five zzso families that include zzso zzso insect zzso zzso and zzso in ants, which comprise 69 new zzso Among them, a new type of zzso zzso was recognized and they are exclusively present in zzso zzso a family of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso exhibit variable numbers of zzso tandem repeats in a zzso manner and all zzso in zzso have evolved an zzso zzso zzso In some zzso species, insect zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso fold and zzso zzso with the inhibitor zzso knot zzso fold have undergone gene expansion and differential gene zzso Moreover, extensive sequence diversity exists in the zzso of the zzso and the zzso peptides and the zzso of the zzso Also, we identified for the first time a zzso zzso in ants, which are only known in crustaceans zzso These zzso zzso zzso gain an aromatic zzso zzso zzso when compared with those of zzso Our work not only zzso the insect zzso resource, but also sheds light on the complexity and dynamic evolution of zzso in zzso
