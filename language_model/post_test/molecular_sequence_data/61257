zzso zzso is an inherited disorder of zzso zzso leading to delayed relaxation of skeletal muscle following zzso zzso in a skeletal muscle zzso zzso channel, zzso have been identified as the molecular genetic basis for the syndrome in humans, and in two well characterized animal models of the disease: the zzso zzso and the arrested development of righting zzso zzso We now report the molecular genetic and zzso characterization of a canine zzso zzso that causes zzso zzso zzso zzso in miniature zzso The zzso results in replacement of a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso segment with zzso zzso characterization of the zzso introduced into a zzso zzso and zzso expressed in a cultured zzso cell line demonstrates a profound effect on the zzso of zzso such that zzso channels have a greatly reduced open probability at zzso near the resting membrane potential of skeletal zzso The degree of this dysfunction is greatly diminished when zzso channels containing a zzso and zzso zzso are expressed together as a zzso zzso strongly supporting the observed zzso inheritance in affected dog zzso zzso and zzso characterization of the zzso dog provides a new and potentially valuable animal model of an inherited skeletal muscle disease that has advantages over existing models of zzso zzso
