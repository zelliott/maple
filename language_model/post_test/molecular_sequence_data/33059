zzso sewage samples from 12 cities in the United States were screened for the presence of recently characterized zzso and DNA viruses found at high prevalence in the stool specimens of South Asian zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso in the zzso family and of DNA zzso and human zzso were zzso expanding the known genetic diversity and geographic range of these newly identified zzso All four virus groups were detected in sewage samples of less than a zzso from multiple zzso zzso zzso screening of zzso viral zzso acid in sewage samples could therefore rapidly establish the presence and determine the diversity of four newly described enteric viruses in large urban zzso More frequent and deeper sampling of viral zzso acids in sewage samples could be used to monitor changes in the prevalence and genetic composition of these and other novel enteric zzso
