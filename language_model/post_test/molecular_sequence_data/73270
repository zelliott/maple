For zzso of the zzso status of the Japanese zzso species, whole zzso DNA of zzso zzso from Australia, zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from Japan was zzso with three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The resulting zzso patterns showed that for each zzso there were some bands specific for each geographical isolate and that the Japanese zzso zzso shared more bands with zzso zzso than with zzso zzso zzso sequences of two regions, the second internal transcribed zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso cluster and zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso were also compared among zzso The zzso sequence was highly zzso among the three zzso zzso zzso and the Japanese zzso zzso were zzso but they differed from the Australian zzso zzso at six sites, one of which was a zzso The zzso sequence was less zzso but implied a similar relationship between the zzso There seems no reason to regard the Japanese zzso zzso as anything other than a strain of zzso zzso
