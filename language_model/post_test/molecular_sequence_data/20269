The presence of zzso in seaweed zzso zzso has been suggested as the protecting agent against toxic metals in the contaminated waters it can grow zzso We report the first kinetic zzso data for zzso binding to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The time and temperature dependence of the relative zzso of zzso and the five zzso species have been determined following mixing of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the detailed zzso mass spectral data for zzso zzso allows the simulation of the zzso reactions showing the consumption of zzso the formation and consumption of zzso to zzso and zzso final formation of zzso The kinetic model proposed here provides a zzso analysis of the zzso reaction showing zzso occupancy of the zzso and the zzso zzso The rate zzso zzso zzso calculated from the fits for the zzso gamma domain are zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for the zzso beta domain are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso energies and zzso factors for each of the reaction steps are also zzso zzso has a long 14 zzso zzso which as we show from analysis of the zzso zzso data, allows each of its two zzso to bind zzso independently of each zzso The analysis provides for the first time an explanation of the differing zzso properties of zzso zzso with zzso of varying zzso suggesting further comparison between plant (with long zzso and zzso (with short zzso zzso will shed light on the role of the zzso zzso
