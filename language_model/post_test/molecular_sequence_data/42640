We have found that zzso antioxidants specifically induce expression of the zzso and zzso zzso After treatment of zzso human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso or other zzso zzso the levels of zzso and zzso zzso are substantially zzso This response is zzso specific, dose dependent, and zzso with zzso levels at 3-6 zzso The zzso induction of zzso promoter zzso in transient zzso indicates that at least a portion of this response is zzso zzso and point zzso map sequences required for the zzso response of the zzso promoter to the serum response zzso The zzso induction of expression directed by a reporter zzso containing four zzso sites and the induction of zzso zzso activity confirm previous results indicating that zzso treatment increases zzso zzso
