To determine whether zzso T zzso from zzso patients expressing zzso and zzso show broad zzso against different zzso of a zzso zzso zzso which might account for the good prognosis of zzso individuals with zzso 

zzso and zzso were recruited from zzso Kenya and from Oxford, zzso All patients had been zzso positive for at least 8 years and could be zzso as slow zzso 

zzso zzso T cell clones were generated from zzso and zzso donors and tested for their ability to recognize zzso zzso of an index zzso zzso in standard zzso zzso zzso responses in freshly isolated peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were assessed by zzso zzso production and zzso zzso 

Broad zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso binding was observed in zzso T cell clones from patients zzso the index zzso zzso zzso of zzso were similar in freshly isolated zzso but varied between individuals in terms of strength and breath of responses zzso One common zzso induced an unusual response with zzso binding but often failed to induce zzso production, and another was a weak zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso donors demonstrate broad functional zzso to both common and rare zzso of a dominant zzso zzso which could be relevant to the association of zzso zzso with slow progression to zzso
