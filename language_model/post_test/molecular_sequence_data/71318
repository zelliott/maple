We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in a human melanoma zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed expression in the poorly and zzso zzso cell lines and a marked zzso in the highly zzso cell zzso Using zzso expression was also seen in several other tumor cell lines and normal cell types of human zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an zzso of 687 zzso acids containing seven putative zzso zzso zzso and a long zzso The gene was mapped to zzso zzso zzso was observed with members of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We propose the zzso of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing seven zzso proteins with a long zzso zzso zzso
