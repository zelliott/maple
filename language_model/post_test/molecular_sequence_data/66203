zzso plays a critical role in the initiation of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is inhibited by zzso at zzso by zzso zzso in response to growth zzso Here, we show that zzso of this site is specific for these classical zzso and is not strongly induced when zzso and zzso zzso are activated by zzso By deletion and zzso analysis, we identify zzso in zzso and zzso that mediate their zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso requires a basic zzso domain zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso analysis of zzso reveals a zzso motif required for recognition of zzso that acts independently of the putative common zzso zzso zzso modeling supports the conclusion that zzso in the D domain of zzso interacts with zzso in the zzso motif of zzso zzso in the zzso motif in other zzso family members could account for the selective recognition of zzso by zzso This selectivity may be important for the zzso role of classical zzso in contrast to the zzso roles of zzso zzso
