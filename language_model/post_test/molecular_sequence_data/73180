The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of two zzso of mouse zzso zzso heavy chain zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a single open reading frame that encodes 1972 and 1938 zzso acids zzso Da and zzso zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso heavy chain zzso was expressed highly in smooth muscle tissue zzso zzso and zzso in heart and zzso Each of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The expressed zzso heavy chains were detected with an zzso raised against smooth muscle zzso heavy chains and showed the same mobility as the native smooth muscle zzso heavy chains in zzso
