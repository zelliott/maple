zzso processed zzso bound to human zzso zzso zzso zzso class I molecules of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were isolated for sequence zzso zzso peptides were subjected to zzso zzso liquid zzso separation and zzso sequencing was performed by zzso zzso The peptides were found to be zzso or zzso and they were derived from the processing of zzso zzso Three independent sequences were obtained from zzso zzso One of the peptides showed sequence zzso to the zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso one to zzso zzso and the other to no known zzso Two independent sequences were obtained from zzso zzso zzso one showed sequence zzso to the human zzso zzso the other showed no zzso to any known zzso A synthetic zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso sequence was confirmed to bind to zzso zzso L zzso These data suggested that peptides potentially recognized by zzso T cells can bind to zzso class I molecules on tumor cells in zzso
