An zzso based on the competitive zzso chain reaction technique was developed to zzso zzso zzso during zzso disease development in zzso rape zzso By means of zzso specific to the highly virulent type of zzso zzso a zzso internal control template was prepared by amplifying and cloning DNA from zzso zzso under zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the internal control DNA provided accurate zzso of 1 to zzso copies of target zzso The zzso was applied to a comparative study of zzso zzso colonization of resistant and susceptible rape zzso The zzso revealed that zzso size was associated with the quantity of zzso zzso DNA during the first 12 days after zzso of the susceptible zzso zzso and the moderately resistant zzso zzso In these zzso the quantity of DNA per zzso increased during the first 12 days after zzso and then zzso This decline in zzso zzso DNA coincided with abundant zzso rapid zzso and the onset of leaf zzso Trace amounts of zzso zzso DNA were detected in the resistant zzso zzso in which zzso size was similar to that in the wounded, zzso zzso The zzso is zzso accurate, and very sensitive and can be incorporated into conventional disease screening zzso
