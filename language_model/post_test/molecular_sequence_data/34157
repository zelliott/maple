In this study, we characterized the zzso virus zzso zzso strain cattle type zzso which is the most classical isolate in Asia, by complete zzso sequence analysis and compared it with its zzso Nakamura III zzso zzso The zzso rates of the M, zzso and H genes were higher than those of other zzso In contrast, the deduced zzso acid zzso substitution rates of the zzso C, and V genes were higher than those of other zzso although their zzso rates were not zzso The characteristic zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso B and zzso zzso strains were observed in the zzso M, and L zzso According to these results, we speculate that zzso substitution in the zzso genes is one of the key zzso for the difference in the zzso to cattle of the B and L zzso
