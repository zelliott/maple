The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a component of the electron transport chain catalyzing zzso reduction with zzso as the electron donor zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso fragments of DNA adjacent to the integrated zzso were used, together with zzso derived from the zzso of zzso and zzso to clone from a gene bank a DNA zzso that contained the corresponding zzso After sequencing, zzso zzso and zzso were identified by sequence comparison with the zzso of the three zzso The genes are arranged in the order zzso zzso zzso a fourth open reading frame zzso in between, but overlapping zzso and zzso is also zzso The zzso gene product contains an apparent leader zzso with a zzso zzso The remainder of the translated zzso acid sequence is similar to that of a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrate zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene product contains four zzso clusters and is similar to various zzso protein zzso The zzso gene product contains a putative zzso leader zzso but there are no similarities between the remainder of the translated protein and other protein zzso The zzso contains two zzso and four zzso zzso and these may zzso bind zzso zzso is a component of the active zzso zzso The zzso gene product encodes a putative protein that shows no significant sequence similarities to other zzso However, the location of the zzso within the other zzso genes is similar to that of zzso within the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus suggesting that the role of zzso may be similar to that of zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso
