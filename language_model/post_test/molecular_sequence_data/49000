The machinery of zzso zzso is an ideal site at which to look for novel zzso zzso zzso display was used to develop novel zzso zzso for zzso an essential zzso involved in the early steps of zzso of zzso zzso 

We cloned and zzso the zzso zzso and -C genes from zzso zzso in the zzso expression zzso adding a zzso to their C zzso The three proteins were zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso the identity of which was confirmed by mass zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Two zzso libraries were screened against zzso in order to identify zzso zzso to the zzso 

Three rounds of zzso were carried out, successively increasing zzso specificity from round 1 to zzso The third round was accomplished with both zzso zzso and competitive zzso with each of the three zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso The DNA of 10 zzso selected randomly from each group, was extracted and zzso and consensus zzso sequences were zzso zzso were zzso and tested for zzso of the zzso reaction, and two peptides were shown to be zzso of zzso activity with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The powerful selection technique of zzso display allowed us to identify two zzso zzso of the essential bacterial zzso zzso The zzso sequences represent the basis for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso
