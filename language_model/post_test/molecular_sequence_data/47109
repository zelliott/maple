The solution structure of the zzso derived from the zzso bonding of the zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of anti zzso zzso zzso anti zzso to the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positioned opposite a zzso zzso zzso in the DNA sequence context zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been studied using structural information derived from zzso data in combination with molecular dynamics zzso zzso The solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso duplex has been determined using an MD protocol where both zzso distance and zzso angle restraints deduced from zzso and zzso zzso are used during the refinement process, followed by additional relaxation zzso refinement to the observed zzso zzso to account for spin diffusion zzso The results established that the zzso attached zzso ring zzso into the DNA zzso directed towards the zzso of the modified strand and stacks predominantly with zzso when zzso between zzso and zzso zzso All zzso including the modified zzso zzso are aligned through zzso pairing as in normal B zzso In addition, the potential strain associated with the highly zzso hindered zzso region of the aromatic portion of the zzso ring is relieved through the adoption of a zzso zzso geometry within the zzso ring zzso This zzso shares common structural features with the related zzso zzso zzso zzso in the identical base sequence context, derived from the zzso region zzso zzso zzso in which zzso is also observed towards the zzso of the modified zzso zzso
