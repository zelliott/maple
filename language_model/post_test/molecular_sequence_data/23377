The zzso zzso mediates cellular entry into zzso The zzso gene is a target for zzso zzso by the tumor zzso protein zzso and this repression can be shown to contribute to zzso cell cycle zzso Two independent mechanisms have been zzso One involves the direct binding of zzso to a site in the zzso promoter, and the second involves a zzso zzso Both of these mediate zzso repression at levels of zzso comparable to those produced by DNA zzso Three zzso elements in the zzso promoter that were previously implicated in zzso repression fail to do so at zzso relevant levels of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso represents an additional mechanism for zzso cell cycle arrest in response to DNA zzso zzso this is a clear demonstration of zzso zzso zzso that is dependent on zzso DNA binding by zzso
