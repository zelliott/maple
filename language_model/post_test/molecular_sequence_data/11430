A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso method was used to identify zzso yellow mosaic virus zzso in leaves of infected zzso zzso zzso which zzso to regions in the nuclear inclusion body zzso and the coat protein zzso zzso generated a zzso product from zzso and also from the closely related zzso mosaic virus type 2 zzso However, no product was obtained from zzso zzso zzso which also zzso zzso zzso and zzso were differentiated using a third primer which was complementary to a sequence in the zzso zzso a zzso amplified product was obtained for zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso fragments of Australian zzso and zzso strains revealed zzso sequence identity between zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignments indicated that the zzso sequence which codes for the zzso of the zzso was zzso identical for different zzso of zzso The Australian isolate of zzso was zzso identical to all zzso of zzso and was zzso identical to a Florida isolate of zzso
