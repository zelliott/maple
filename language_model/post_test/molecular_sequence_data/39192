The large zzso zzso zzso directs zzso migration during brain development and plays a fundamental role in layer zzso It is composed of eight tandem repeats of an approximately zzso unit, termed the zzso zzso which has a central zzso growth factor zzso module flanked by two zzso zzso with no obvious sequence similarity to proteins of known zzso The zzso A crystal structure of the mouse zzso repeat 3 reveals that the zzso assumes a zzso fold with unexpected structural similarity to zzso zzso Despite the interruption by the zzso zzso the two zzso make direct zzso resulting in a compact overall zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso encompassing repeats zzso which is capable of inducing zzso zzso in zzso show a zzso zzso Furthermore, a three-dimensional molecular envelope of the zzso obtained by zzso zzso can be fitted with four zzso repeat 3 atomic structures, providing the first glimpse of the structural unit for this important signaling zzso
