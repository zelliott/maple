To evaluate zzso chain reaction zzso for detection of zzso zzso 117 zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients undergoing a diagnostic zzso were processed and a zzso zzso followed by Southern zzso and zzso with a zzso probe was zzso The sensitivity and specificity were 85 and zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso system zzso was evaluated on all zzso and found to be as effective as zzso To increase the speed and convenience of zzso a dot zzso system was tested, but sensitivity dropped markedly with this zzso A further 33 patients had both induced zzso and zzso zzso performed and the induced zzso was zzso using zzso and routine zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity on induced zzso was equal to that of routine zzso At present the evaluated zzso cannot replace routine zzso methods for detection of zzso zzso on either zzso fluid or induced zzso
