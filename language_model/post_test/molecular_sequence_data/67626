Agricultural zzso plants were operated in most cases below their optimal zzso An increase in the zzso temperature and a spatial separation of zzso and zzso are known strategies in improving and stabilizing zzso zzso In this study, the dynamic zzso of the bacterial and zzso community was monitored within a zzso leach bed zzso reactor supplied with rye zzso and straw during a zzso temperature increase from 55 to zzso within the leach bed reactor zzso using zzso zzso To identify the terminal restriction fragments that were zzso bacterial and zzso zzso zzso gene libraries were zzso Above zzso the bacterial community structure changed from being zzso toward being dominated by members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso several changes occurred, including a decrease in the total cell count, degradation rate, and zzso yield along with zzso in the intermediate zzso A zzso with zzso at zzso led to slight improvements in the reactor performance; these did not persist at zzso However, the zzso community within the downstream zzso filter reactor zzso operated constantly at zzso altered by the temperature increase in the zzso At an zzso temperature of zzso members of the zzso order were prevalent in the zzso whereas at higher zzso temperatures zzso zzso Altogether, the best performance of this zzso reactor was achieved at an zzso temperature of below zzso which indicates that this temperature range has a favorable effect on the microbial community responsible for the production of zzso
