We have previously identified a novel rat zzso member of the zzso family zzso zzso that may mediate the zzso of synaptic material and the zzso snake zzso zzso zzso Here we report human zzso and zzso sequences of a second zzso zzso This zzso which we propose to name zzso zzso II zzso gene symbol zzso shows zzso zzso acid identity to rat zzso zzso zzso with zzso identity over the zzso half of zzso and is zzso identical to a newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that zzso message is present in brain, zzso zzso liver, heart, and skeletal muscle, so, unlike zzso zzso is not exclusively localized to zzso Like zzso zzso has potential zzso zzso zzso The human zzso gene is 11 zzso in zzso contains four zzso and is localized to zzso zzso These data demonstrate the existence of a family of zzso proteins that are expressed in the brain and other zzso and that may play important roles in the zzso of zzso zzso
