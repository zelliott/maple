We have isolated a zzso from zzso zzso for a protein consisting of 323 zzso acids with similarity to an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso plates has demonstrated that the gene product has zzso activity dependent on zzso and inhibited by zzso designated CAN zzso zzso Differing from the zzso zzso CAN has neither a signal zzso nor any long zzso regions, suggesting that it is not a zzso zzso
