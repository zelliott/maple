Various in zzso zzso zzso have been developed for protein delivery in treating human zzso However, most zzso are highly zzso which can lead to the rapid release of loaded zzso The purpose of this study is to apply zzso acid zzso to zzso an in zzso zzso zzso model to control the release of zzso The zzso were studied using secondary structural predictions and binding zzso The results showed that the structural predictions were different from the experimental zzso in numerous zzso The affinity of the zzso was significantly affected by the zzso of the essential zzso whereas it was not significantly affected by the variations of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were then used to zzso the zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso could prolong protein zzso Moreover, the release rates could be controlled by adjusting the affinity of the zzso
