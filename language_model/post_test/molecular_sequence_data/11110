The human zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been implicated in human diseases such as schizophrenia and in a personality trait called zzso zzso has not yet been characterized at the protein zzso Following zzso scanning of the zzso we have produced a highly specific zzso zzso named zzso raised against an zzso zzso in a predicted zzso region of the zzso zzso decorated zzso zzso on the surface of intact Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells by flow zzso and zzso zzso and also recognized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by western zzso zzso When expressed zzso in zzso cells, all three zzso zzso contained zzso zzso and showed apparent molecular masses of 48, 55, and 67 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso representing zzso protein or zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in crude membrane extracts of zzso human brain tissue by zzso The zzso zzso provides a new zzso tool with the potential to further our understanding of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso
