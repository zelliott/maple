Multiple reaction monitoring zzso is a highly sensitive method of targeted mass zzso zzso that can be used to selectively detect and zzso peptides based on the screening of specified precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity depends critically on the tuning of instrument zzso such as collision energy and cone zzso for the generation of zzso product zzso zzso Although generalized equations and values exist for such instrument zzso there is no clear indication that optimal signal can be reliably produced for all types of zzso transitions using such an zzso zzso To address this issue, we have devised a zzso functional on both zzso zzso Premier and zzso zzso zzso triple zzso instruments that allows rapid determination of the optimal value of any zzso instrument zzso for each zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the strategy for the zzso of collision energy and cone zzso but the method could be applied to other instrument zzso such as zzso potential, as zzso The zzso makes use of the incremental adjustment of the precursor and product zzso values at the zzso decimal place to create a series of zzso targets at different collision energies that can be zzso through in rapid succession within a single run, avoiding any zzso zzso in execution or zzso zzso are easily zzso and zzso using the zzso software package zzso M to determine the optimal instrument parameters for each zzso
