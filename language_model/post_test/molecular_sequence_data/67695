The formation of diverse, appropriately patterned cell types is critical in the development of all complex zzso zzso In flowering plants, zzso patterning is a complex process essential for successful sexual zzso However, few genes regulating this process have been characterized to zzso We report here that the gene zzso zzso regulates early zzso cell differentiation in rice zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were characterized using molecular markers and zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned and its expression pattern was analyzed through zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso protein was observed by zzso zzso encodes the rice zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso display zzso different from those of zzso zzso with only two layers of zzso wall cells zzso zzso has an expression pattern distinct from that of zzso Its transcripts and proteins predominate in inner zzso cells, but show little zzso in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is responsible for the differentiation of primary zzso cells into secondary zzso cells in rice zzso and suggest that rice and zzso zzso might share similar regulators in zzso zzso but divergent mechanisms are employed in these zzso
