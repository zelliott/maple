A zzso including a mouse zzso zzso gene was zzso into the zzso human zzso line zzso and mouse zzso and zzso lines zzso 231 and zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso cells zzso mouse zzso zzso chains as a major zzso protein but the zzso 231 and zzso zzso transcribed the introduced zzso gene at lower zzso In zzso zzso most of the zzso of the introduced heavy chain gene initiated 40 and 62 zzso upstream of the beginning of the zzso zzso translation start, although a small proportion of transcripts initiating further upstream was zzso zzso 231 and zzso zzso gave a much higher proportion of upstream zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso was monitored following zzso of mouse myeloma with the zzso gene DNA in various zzso zzso zzso zzso was only observed if the plasmids contained a segment derived from the large zzso zzso of the zzso heavy chain zzso This segment, located between zzso and switch regions, functioned both downstream of the zzso zzso and upstream in either zzso The existence of a zzso zzso element in this region is therefore zzso
