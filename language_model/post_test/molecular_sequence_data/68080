We previously reported that the induction of zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells was zzso zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify the molecular mechanism of this synergistic action on zzso zzso we have isolated zzso DNA clone zzso including zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso The zzso start site and the zzso sequences of the promoter regions were zzso We found that this clone contains a zzso box and a zzso in the promoter region, and several putative binding sites for regulatory proteins in the zzso zzso With zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso deletion zzso of zzso fusion zzso it was found that the sequence from zzso to zzso is essential for the regulatory zzso involved in the increased zzso of the zzso gene with zzso and zzso
