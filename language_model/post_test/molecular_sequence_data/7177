zzso is associated with zzso to increase the zzso of a number of target genes and is a nuclear zzso with a very short zzso This instability of zzso may be important in regulation of the normal cell zzso Here we report a mechanism for degradation of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells caused marked increase in the instability of zzso whereas zzso the zzso counterpart of zzso was stable irrespective of the zzso of zzso Interestingly, deletion of the zzso zzso region of zzso which is altered in zzso by a zzso zzso greatly enhanced its stability, with loss of the effect of zzso on its zzso zzso zzso in zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso association with zzso had no effect on the degradation of zzso but the additions of three protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso resulted in marked acceleration of its degradation by the zzso system, though only in the presence of zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso with a truncated zzso motif were not zzso suggesting that they escaped from zzso by zzso These findings indicate a new zzso zzso induced by acquisition of zzso stability of a cell cycle zzso zzso
