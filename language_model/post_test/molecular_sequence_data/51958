zzso sites zzso are short stretches of DNA that can be specifically detected by the zzso chain reaction zzso and can be used to construct long-range physical maps of zzso zzso These zzso can be detected by zzso zzso developed by reference to data obtained from the sequencing of restriction zzso length zzso markers for zzso 21, which were derived from zzso zzso and zzso clones made from DNA of a zzso hybrid cell zzso In this report, we describe the generation of 19 new zzso that are specific for human zzso zzso
