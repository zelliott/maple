Through zzso zzso analysis of gene expression in human zzso and zzso we detected strong expression of zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso only in these zzso zzso In a subsequent search for zzso of zzso among 192 patients with zzso deafness, we identified two zzso at the zzso one was a de zzso change zzso in a patient with unaffected parents, and the other was a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso When the zzso proteins were expressed in zzso cells, their zzso zzso were different from that of the normal zzso the zzso zzso showed zzso distribution in the zzso and the zzso zzso localized in zzso areas, whereas normal protein was distributed zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins might cause dysfunction of the zzso product and result in hearing zzso In zzso zzso analysis using mouse zzso indicated its expression in the lateral region of the spiral ligament and the zzso of the spiral zzso zzso its possible involvement in the zzso recycling zzso Our results strongly zzso zzso in normal auditory function and identify it as one of the genes that can be responsible for zzso zzso
