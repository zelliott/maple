Virtually all cells respond to heat stress by increased expression or induction of one or more of the highly zzso cellular stress response zzso heat shock proteins zzso Here, we report the unusual property of rat zzso cells, a zzso zzso line, to display reduced zzso expression following exposure to elevated zzso After heat stress (41 degrees C, 1 zzso there was no evidence of zzso members of the 70 zzso zzso family, a response common to other cell culture and tissue zzso Moreover, expression of zzso members of the zzso and zzso families decreased during the heat stress, apparently reflecting a decrease in zzso zzso zzso shift zzso revealed that heat shock factor zzso was activated in spite of the lack of expression of zzso zzso zzso although its DNA binding rapidly zzso zzso using an zzso specific to zzso indicated that zzso of zzso may be responsible for this rapid termination of heat shock element zzso zzso zzso a component of zzso zzso zzso was also reduced by heat stress in zzso cells and may account for the decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the fragmentation of zzso protected heat shock element and zzso zzso prevented the decline in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and restored a modest expression of zzso zzso following heat zzso zzso of this study describe a unique regulatory zzso in zzso expression in zzso cells, possibly a common characteristic of other zzso zzso
