Recently we have isolated and characterized a zzso coding for a novel zzso regulated chick zzso zzso cartilage associated protein zzso Here we describe the isolation and characterization of the zzso coding for the mouse zzso zzso of the zzso putative protein sequence with the chick sequence shows a very high identity overall zzso in particular the chick protein is zzso to the half zzso zzso of the mouse zzso Furthermore, the comparison of the zzso zzso sequence with sequences of the zzso database confirms our hypothesis that the zzso genes belong to a novel family that also includes genes zzso for some nuclear zzso In all mouse zzso examined three zzso zzso species are zzso whereas in chick zzso a single zzso is zzso zzso studies show that the protein is expressed in all mouse embryonic zzso The mouse cartilage associated protein gene zzso was assigned to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
