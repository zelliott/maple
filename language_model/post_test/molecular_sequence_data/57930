The three-dimensional X-ray structure of a zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length 198 zzso was determined by the method of molecular replacement using the related structure of zzso from zzso zzso as a search zzso This zzso human zzso zzso in space group zzso with a zzso in the zzso unit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hartman, zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso 1989, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the protein structure zzso atoms with zzso and no zzso with restraints maintaining zzso zzso zzso at an zzso of zzso using all data from zzso to zzso A resolution and group zzso zzso The zzso interactions typical of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso are retained in the human zzso but the zzso interactions that form the zzso are very different from those found in the structure of zzso from zzso zzso In human zzso one of the zzso is rotated by 84 degrees relative to its equivalent in the zzso zzso As a result the zzso are arranged in an approximately zzso zzso the zzso packing is more intimate than observed in the bacterial zzso from zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso determined by refinement and verified by zzso of omit zzso are identical to those observed in zzso zzso zzso
