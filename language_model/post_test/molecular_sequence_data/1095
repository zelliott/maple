Gene tagging is the basis of zzso selection and zzso zzso To develop zzso markers for zzso a dominant powdery zzso resistance gene of zzso we surveyed 46 group 2 zzso markers between zzso zzso line zzso zzso zzso and the zzso parent Chancellor zzso One of the zzso zzso detected zzso and was used for zzso an zzso population of 85 plants derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping indicated that zzso was linked to zzso at a distance of zzso zzso To identify more zzso markers for zzso we also converted the restriction zzso length zzso marker zzso linked to it into a zzso site zzso zzso The zzso primer designed based on the end sequences of zzso amplified an approximately zzso zzso band in both zzso Following zzso of the products with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso it was discovered that the band from zzso zzso consisted of at least two products, one of which had a zzso pattern different from the band from zzso In the zzso population, the zzso zzso revealed by the zzso marker between the parents zzso with powdery zzso zzso To design zzso zzso zzso the zzso band from zzso and the zzso associated with zzso in zzso zzso were zzso and zzso Based on these sequences a new zzso marker was identified, which detected a zzso product only in the zzso zzso These zzso markers provide a zzso option for zzso selection of zzso
