Spinal muscular zzso zzso is a common zzso zzso disorder that results in the zzso of spinal motor zzso zzso is caused by zzso of the survival motor zzso ( zzso ) gene which encodes a novel protein of zzso unclear zzso The zzso protein associates with zzso particles involved in zzso processing and exhibits an zzso zzso We have isolated the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and have found that the zzso capacity is zzso across zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from both species showed selectivity to zzso zzso zzso in zzso similar to that of the human zzso zzso deletions of the zzso zzso zzso we defined an zzso element in zzso zzso which is highly zzso across species, and revealed that its binding activity is modulated by protein zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the deleted zzso zzso protein mimicking an zzso zzso zzso showed a dramatic change in zzso in the formation of the zzso zzso These observations indicate that the zzso capacity of zzso is an zzso zzso function and further support the view that defects in zzso metabolism most likely account for the zzso of zzso
