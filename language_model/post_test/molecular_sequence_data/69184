We have developed an approach which allows functional in zzso examination of zzso proteins through zzso of zzso containing the zzso domain into living zzso The present analysis zzso serum response factor zzso a zzso factor that binds to the serum response zzso We have expressed in bacteria a zzso portion of this protein zzso acids 113 to zzso containing the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso it to zzso by a single DNA affinity zzso step using the zzso zzso site zzso We have tested the efficiency of zzso to prevent zzso zzso function through analysis of zzso expression and DNA synthesis zzso by fetal calf serum, two events known to require zzso zzso of zzso zzso into rat zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by growth zzso Moreover, DNA zzso induced after serum addition, is also suppressed by zzso zzso This implies that overproduction of zzso makes the cell deficient in the function of zzso zzso and that zzso acts as a dominant negative zzso These data show that, for the study of zzso zzso expressing and using portions of the protein that zzso to the zzso domain present a useful method for generating dominant negative zzso and illustrate the potential application of the zzso region to facilitate the study of events at the zzso zzso
