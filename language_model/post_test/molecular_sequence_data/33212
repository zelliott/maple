A zzso library was constructed to clone a zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso isolated from a deep zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of 49 zzso This protein showed the highest sequence identity zzso with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso domain that belongs to the zzso zzso family 10 zzso and a zzso module zzso belonging to family zzso The optimum pH and temperature for zzso activity were pH zzso and 55 degrees C, zzso zzso exhibited good pH stability, remaining stable after treatment with buffers ranging from pH zzso to zzso The protein was not significantly affected by a variety of chemical zzso including some compounds that usually inhibit the activity of other related zzso In addition, zzso showed activity on zzso These properties mark zzso as a potential zzso for industrial application and zzso processes essential for zzso zzso
