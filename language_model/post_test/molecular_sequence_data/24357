zzso zzso function as essential regulators of zzso transport between zzso compartments of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso accessory factor, zzso zzso release and binds tightly to the zzso form of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso analysis of zzso that are zzso only in zzso zzso zzso reveals three zzso that are critical zzso of the broad specificity recognition of zzso zzso zzso by zzso One of these zzso is located at the zzso of the switch I region near the zzso binding site whereas the other two flank an exposed zzso zzso previously implicated in zzso zzso The spatial disposition of these zzso with respect to the structure of zzso zzso with the dimensions of the zzso zzso interaction zzso in zzso and supports a mode of interaction similar to that of other exchange zzso zzso The zzso of the corresponding interaction surfaces suggests a hypothetical structural model for the complex between zzso and zzso zzso
