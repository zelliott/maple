Current models of insulin binding to the insulin zzso zzso propose zzso that there are two binding sites on the surface of insulin which engage with two binding sites on the zzso and zzso that zzso binding involves structural changes in both the zzso and the zzso Many of the features of insulin binding to its zzso namely zzso zzso interactions with the zzso repeat domain and zzso zzso interactions with zzso zzso from another part of the zzso are also seen in models of zzso and zzso zzso 3 binding to their zzso We show that these principles can likely be extended to the group of zzso peptides described by zzso and zzso which are reported to have no sequence identity with zzso This review summarizes our current understanding of zzso zzso of the zzso and highlights the key issues that remain to be zzso
