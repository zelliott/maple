The zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso is a zzso channel that is activated by zzso zzso zzso channel activity is also zzso by zzso protein zzso and protein zzso zzso 

Here, we show that zzso channel zzso by zzso may also occur zzso In zzso from one-third of zzso donors, the zzso of zzso by zzso averaged zzso of the level achieved by zzso The currents activated by either zzso zzso displayed similar zzso zzso zzso pharmacology and zzso zzso zzso stimulation by zzso and zzso was not zzso suggesting that both zzso zzso activate the same zzso zzso was one order of magnitude more potent than zzso and its action was insensitive to protein zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence of zzso revealed a domain in the zzso portion of the third zzso loop that resembles a class of zzso zzso related to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso in this zzso and zzso identified which, when changed to zzso altered the response to zzso independently of the response to zzso 

We conclude that direct zzso zzso binding may play a role in channel gating of zzso The zzso domain may provide a useful target for zzso intervention in zzso zzso
