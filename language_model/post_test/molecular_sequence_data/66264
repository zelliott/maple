A gene for zzso yellow protein zzso was identified from the zzso sequence of the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence is zzso related to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and contains most of the zzso acid zzso identified as necessary for zzso However, the Sr zzso gene is not flanked by its two zzso genes as in other zzso To determine as to whether the Sr zzso gene encodes a functional zzso we cloned and expressed it in zzso coli, along with the genes for zzso zzso from zzso zzso The Sr zzso has a zzso zzso extension as compared to other zzso that appears to be important for zzso however, zzso of these extra zzso did not change the spectral and zzso zzso Sr zzso has an zzso maximum at 431 zzso which is at shorter zzso than the zzso zzso zzso (at zzso zzso It is also zzso being zzso zzso by either blue or white zzso The zzso of dark recovery is slower than any of the zzso reported to date zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso Sr zzso appears to have a normal zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso The presence of the zzso intermediate is also zzso on the basis of the effects of temperature and zzso on zzso Sr zzso has an intermediate spectral form in equilibrium with the 431 zzso form, similar to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso strength zzso the 431 zzso form at the expense of the intermediate spectral form, and the zzso of recovery is accelerated zzso between 0 and zzso M zzso This is observed with zzso from both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso strength also zzso zzso against zzso zzso as the melting temperature is increased from 74 degrees C in buffer alone to 92 degrees C in 2 M zzso Sr accumulates zzso in the zzso like zzso to balance zzso pressure and has very zzso zzso We thus believe that Sr zzso is an example of a zzso protein that requires zzso to zzso screen the excess negative charge and stabilize the zzso zzso
