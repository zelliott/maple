The present work demonstrates that zzso zzso possess different zzso for zzso and muscular zzso sodium zzso ) channels, with subtle differences on channel zzso zzso 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 zzso reduced the peak current of several skeletal and zzso channel zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 were more potent on zzso zzso zzso 4 and 6 on zzso zzso and zzso 5 on zzso zzso zzso (except zzso 1 and 5) caused a zzso shift in the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shifts of zzso zzso fitted to zzso and zzso occurred with a decrease in zzso Since the slope is zzso to zzso changes in zzso probably express changes in zzso the zzso in a zzso zzso Changes in zzso may express zzso changes in the channel zzso environment, perhaps due to surface charges of the zzso zzso 2 induced a zzso zzso zzso shift of the zzso zzso but no shift of the zzso zzso zzso zzso peak zzso zzso was reduced in both channel forms, suggesting that channel zzso resulted from toxin binding to a site partially distinct from the zzso zzso binding site zzso zzso emerge as potential research tools to understand sodium channel zzso zzso relationships and also as zzso interesting zzso
