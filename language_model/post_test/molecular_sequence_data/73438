The zzso regulatory elements of many zzso zzso genes contain adjacent or overlapping binding sites for the zzso and zzso families of zzso zzso Similar zzso of functionally important zzso and zzso binding sites are present in the zzso enhancers of human zzso viruses types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso suggesting that this pattern of nuclear protein binding sites reflects an zzso zzso mechanism for regulating zzso zzso gene expression that has been zzso during zzso zzso Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso and zzso proteins zzso regulate zzso zzso gene expression remained zzso In the studies described in this report, we demonstrated a physical interaction between multiple zzso and zzso proteins both in zzso and in activated normal human T zzso This interaction is zzso by the zzso domain of zzso proteins and the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso interaction requires the presence of DNA binding sites for both zzso as it is abolished by the DNA zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso and enhanced by the presence of synthetic zzso containing binding sites for zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso that binds DNA but fails to interact with zzso proteins zzso the synergistic zzso of the zzso and zzso enhancers by zzso zzso + zzso and zzso suggesting that physical interaction between zzso and zzso proteins is required for the zzso activity of the zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso physical interactions between zzso and zzso proteins are important in regulating the zzso expression of zzso genes and zzso These interactions represent a potential target for the development of novel zzso and zzso zzso
