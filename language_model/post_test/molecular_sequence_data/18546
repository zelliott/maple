zzso foot, and mouth disease zzso has been one of the most common infectious diseases in zzso City, as is the situation in China zzso In the National zzso surveillance system, the pathogen detection was focused on zzso and zzso and therefore, information on the other zzso is very zzso In order to identify the circulating zzso zzso in the zzso outbreaks in zzso City during zzso zzso patients presented with zzso were recruited in the study, and clinical samples were zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed using the molecular typing methods, and zzso analyses based on entire zzso sequences of human zzso 71 zzso zzso A16 zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The results revealed that zzso and zzso were the 2 most important pathogens but the circulating trends of the 2 viruses showed a shift, the spread of zzso became increasingly weak, whereas the spread of zzso became increasingly zzso zzso and zzso were the third and fourth most prevalent zzso zzso zzso of two viruses at the same time was not found in these zzso Based on entire zzso region zzso the zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso continued to zzso The zzso strains were assigned to 4 zzso zzso whereas the zzso strains were assigned to 5 zzso zzso with clear geographical and zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequences belonged to 4 epidemic lineages within zzso C, whereas the zzso zzso sequences belonged to 2 epidemic lineages within zzso zzso which may have the same origins as the strains reported in other part of zzso zzso and zzso 2 pathogens that were previously infrequently zzso were identified as pathogens causing the zzso zzso This study underscores the need for detailed zzso surveillances of zzso in mainland zzso
