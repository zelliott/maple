zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso that is resistant to infection by zzso zzso and to binding of the zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso was characterized as a zzso sugar zzso of the zzso apparatus occurring exclusively in zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso Based on the above zzso we hypothesized that zzso may have altered zzso that may enable the zzso zzso to grow unaffected in the presence of the above zzso zzso Following analyses of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and wild type zzso using a combination of zzso degradation, zzso and mass zzso we found in zzso a zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso acid and zzso as well as a reduction of zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso These results are consistent with the specificity of zzso for zzso and strongly suggest that the above zzso play an important role in allowing zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to wild type zzso zzso Furthermore, because zzso cells as well as zzso cells zzso their zzso to the zzso and surrounding surfaces, the results also demonstrate the critical role of these cells and their zzso zzso in zzso interactions and offer a zzso basis for strategies to block such recognition zzso
