zzso zzso is a newly suggested zzso species colonizing zzso zzso In the diagnostic laboratory the sole difference to the zzso lung pathogen zzso zzso is a negative zzso zzso In order to substantiate and improve this important differentiation a zzso test was developed using the relevant reference strains including zzso zzso The zzso of the test was confirmed on 20 clinical zzso of zzso zzso cultured from 100 zzso samples originating from 18 farms in zzso zzso the newly developed zzso test 10 zzso were identified as zzso zzso and 10 as zzso zzso with one of them being zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing confirmed zzso of all 10 strains as zzso zzso zzso These results emphasize that suspected zzso zzso zzso particularly from zzso zzso should be confirmed by zzso in order to prevent false positive zzso
