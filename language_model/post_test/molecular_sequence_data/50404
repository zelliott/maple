The zzso zzso intermediate zzso acid zzso stimulates expression of the bean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene promoter in zzso zzso of alfalfa zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed the effects of zzso zzso zzso and competition with promoter sequences in trans on the expression of a zzso zzso zzso gene fusion in zzso alfalfa zzso Two distinct sequence zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are required for stimulation of the zzso promoter by zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso promoter sequence containing both zzso elements zzso responsiveness to zzso on the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso minimal zzso The zzso and zzso in combination establish the complex zzso pattern of zzso expression and are also involved in stress zzso zzso potential internal zzso regulation through zzso stimulation by zzso operates by zzso of the signal pathways for zzso and environmental zzso
