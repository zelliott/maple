zzso membrane outer layer protein I zzso tightly bound to zzso zzso of zzso egg zzso membrane was characterized in terms of its zzso acid sequence and structural zzso The deduced sequence of zzso using the conventional sequencing method is: zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is composed of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The sequence confirms the zzso sequence of zzso we recently determined and does not show any significant similarity to proteins compiled in the zzso zzso Two of the four zzso bonds found in zzso were estimated to lie between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso The sequence analyses show that zzso contains three zzso internal repeats that contain distinctive regions of turns flanked by zzso consistent with the recent finding that the zzso contains a new zzso zzso the zzso The molecular characteristics of zzso in solution were examined by CD zzso in the far and near ultraviolet regions, zzso zzso and high sensitive differential scanning zzso zzso CD zzso in the far zzso region at room temperature were similar to that assigned to a random zzso while in the near zzso region, small positive zzso were zzso The zzso in both regions decreased on raising the zzso zzso zzso experiments showed the native structure unfolds to zzso zzso at 70 degrees zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
