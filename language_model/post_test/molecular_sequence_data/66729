zzso and DNA damage stabilize the zzso zzso but the subsequent effect that each stress has on zzso regulation of known zzso target genes is zzso We have used zzso zzso followed by zzso island zzso zzso zzso to identify promoters bound by zzso under both zzso and zzso conditions in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, we have verified an association with zzso of the highest enrichment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso with zzso of intermediate enrichment zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with zzso of low enrichment zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found little difference in promoter binding when zzso is stabilized by these two distinctly different zzso However, expression of these genes varies a great zzso while a few genes exhibit classical induction with zzso the majority of the genes are unchanged or are mildly zzso by either zzso or zzso Further analysis using zzso zzso in the core DNA binding domain revealed that the interaction of zzso with zzso may be occurring through both zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these experiments describe the identification of novel zzso target genes and the subsequent discovery of distinctly different expression phenomena for zzso target genes under different stress zzso
