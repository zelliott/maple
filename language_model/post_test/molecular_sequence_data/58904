The zzso zzso preparation zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the stability of zzso barrier zzso zzso To determine if the increase in zzso zzso stability is associated with an zzso of gene zzso the present investigation studied the effect of C1 on the expression of a zzso reporter gene in brain zzso cultured zzso zzso zzso response studies showed that C1 markedly increased the expression of zzso when the zzso gene was zzso On the contrary, C1 produced no changes in the expression pattern of the control reporter zzso which lacks the zzso regulatory zzso zzso of the protein zzso C zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso had no effect on the increased levels of zzso induced by zzso zzso efficiency was determined by measuring zzso levels of the expression zzso using a quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The data presented here demonstrate that C1 increases zzso gene expression in zzso cells through a mechanism that appears to be independent of zzso of zzso
