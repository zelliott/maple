zzso and determination of the primary structure of zzso laid the foundation for determining the complete structure and zzso Identification of the functional groups in the active site and demonstration of the sequence zzso of zzso and zzso proteins have been the most important steps to date in characterizing the general properties of zzso The demonstration of a long zzso structure in the active site of zzso and other zzso zzso was another important zzso The lack of zzso and zzso specificity between human and zzso zzso suggests that the active site of human zzso is zzso This has been clearly demonstrated by the synthesis of an inhibitor zzso specific for human zzso
