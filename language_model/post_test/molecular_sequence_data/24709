We present evidence for two zzso of zzso protein I zzso both containing high amounts of zzso resident proteins but only minor amounts of zzso zzso Early zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso are shown to be sorted together into zzso that are distinct from those containing zzso II, a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso into each zzso population is zzso and zzso zzso dependent and is inhibited by aluminum and zzso zzso Using synthetic zzso we find that the zzso domain of zzso can bind zzso zzso protein zzso and cause direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso on zzso bound to zzso and zzso zzso We propose a zzso reaction to explain how zzso zzso constitutes a prerequisite for sorting of resident zzso yet becomes inhibited in their zzso
