zzso zzso a tropical zzso zzso is an endemic species of the Brazilian northeast and exhibits great potential for honey and zzso production in addition to its role as one of the main zzso of the zzso zzso To understand the genetic structure and better assist in the conservation of this species, we characterized the population zzso of zzso zzso using geometric zzso of the zzso and zzso c zzso I gene zzso zzso We collected workers from six localities in the northernmost zzso Both zzso indicated that the zzso among the sampled populations is related both to the environment in which samples were collected and the geographical distance between the sampling sites, indicating that differentiation among the populations is due to the existence of at least evolutionary zzso zzso clock data suggest that this differentiation may have begun in the middle zzso approximately zzso zzso The conservation of all evolutionary lineages is important since they can present differential resistance to environmental changes, as resistance to drought and zzso
