zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso regions were carried out from zzso zzso and zzso sequences for zzso DNA samples from strains representing 16 bacterial species (12 zzso Multiple products were produced containing zzso zzso sequences at the 3' and zzso ends, separated by highly variable internal zzso zzso These products zzso forming zzso DNA structures containing zzso ends surrounding an internal zzso zzso zzso DNA was also produced in the amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso DNA components were identified by their zzso to removal by zzso with a zzso zzso The relative formation of zzso and zzso DNA was reduced by reaction conditions favoring zzso zzso for example, higher zzso strength, higher primer zzso and lower zzso temperature, as well as by decreasing the number of amplification zzso zzso and zzso DNA structures were also generated by zzso and zzso zzso amplification products in the absence of zzso zzso Whereas zzso and zzso DNA structures provide additional information that is helpful in distinguishing between species of bacteria that produce similar zzso products, the mobility of zzso and zzso DNA structures DNA structures is extremely sensitive to zzso zzso
