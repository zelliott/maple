To explore the role of a zzso domain of zzso in the interaction with a zzso chain we have zzso a zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of native zzso zzso and studied by zzso and zzso the interaction zzso zzso with both zzso and (27 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The loop corresponding to zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso only in the absence of zzso and under similar conditions but not to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments were zzso after zzso zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso M in the presence or absence of zzso Although zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso with a zzso of zzso M, this zzso did not bind to the zzso zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso zzso sequence should be a potential binding site to zzso depending of the zzso state of the intact 70 zzso segment of zzso
