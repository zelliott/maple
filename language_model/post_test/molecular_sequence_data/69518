zzso of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso is modulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso containing two zzso motifs zzso and zzso and an zzso response zzso To determine the zzso component of this fragment, zzso containing the individual elements were inserted in front of a minimal CT promoter and tested for reporter protein production in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, using two copies of zzso or four copies of zzso increased minimal promoter activity a zzso zzso Using two copies of zzso had no effect on minimal promoter zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso response element was active but the two copies of zzso were zzso Similar results were obtained with the zzso zzso zzso I therefore concluded that zzso was the zzso component of the zzso An zzso binding protein was detected in both zzso cell lines but not in zzso This protein had different mobility and zzso specificity in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso motif of zzso modulated the zzso zzso of the CT zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso cells correlated with modifications in its binding zzso
