We previously showed that zzso of zzso of the N zzso domain of the type VI zzso zzso zzso partly zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso of zzso We now report that zzso of the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which form the zzso core complex of zzso also contributes to zzso zzso In zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso and C2 zzso and of the synthetic peptides representing potential zzso zzso sites, suggests that zzso and zzso of the C1 domain and zzso of the C2 domain might act as zzso for zzso We next created several full-length zzso zzso in which one or more of the four likely zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso of at least two of the three likely zzso located in the N and C1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso was required to render zzso zzso completely insensitive to zzso zzso In contrast, a single zzso of zzso was sufficient to create a functional zzso zzso that exhibited no zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that the three zzso zzso of zzso might form a regulatory zzso zzso of this regulatory complex at different sites might induce a zzso of the zzso core complex and subsequently lead to zzso in the zzso activity of zzso
