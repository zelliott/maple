Using expression cloning to screen a human fetal kidney zzso library for zzso of zzso zzso zzso processing zzso by zzso zzso 1 zzso we isolated a zzso whose product zzso with zzso zzso It encodes the zzso zzso acid region of a zzso zzso zzso 3, with a zzso acid substitution at the zzso zzso and thus was named zzso zzso comprises a signal zzso a unique domain, a zzso domain, and a zzso domain but lacks a zzso zzso domain and two putative zzso attachment sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was also inhibited by the zzso of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated direct interaction of zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso 1 or zzso 3 but not zzso 2 also inhibited zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso and substitution of zzso acids zzso in zzso revealed that the unique zzso domain of zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 3 was detected in normal brain but zzso in zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso or zzso 3 gene into zzso zzso cells or zzso canine kidney cells transformed by zzso suppressed their invasive growth in collagen zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso 3 would interfere with tumor invasion by zzso zzso
