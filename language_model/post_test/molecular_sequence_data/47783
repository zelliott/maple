zzso adaptation and zzso were studied in the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso actively adapts to freezing during a zzso at 20 degrees C, resulting in an approximately 1, zzso increased survival after four zzso cycles compared to zzso cells grown at an optimal temperature of 42 degrees zzso No adaptation is observed when cells are exposed to a temperature (10 degrees zzso below the minimal growth temperature of the strain (just below 15 degrees zzso By two-dimensional gel zzso several zzso zzso proteins were identified, which are the major induced proteins after a shift to 20 degrees zzso These cold shock proteins were zzso expressed at 20 degrees C, while the induction level was low after cold shock to 10 degrees zzso To confirm the presence of zzso genes in zzso zzso a zzso strategy was used which yielded products of different zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso sequences that were up to zzso identical to those of zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a zzso to zzso induction of zzso zzso after a temperature shift to 20 degrees C, showing that this zzso zzso indeed contains at least one zzso zzso gene and that its regulation takes place at the zzso zzso
