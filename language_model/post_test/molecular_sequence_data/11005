The membrane protein zzso zzso in several zzso interactions that have been implicated in neurotransmitter zzso To probe the zzso importance of these zzso we zzso into the zzso giant zzso terminal zzso toxin zzso which zzso zzso and the zzso domain of zzso which mediates binding to other zzso Both zzso inhibited synaptic transmission yet did not affect the number or distribution of synaptic zzso at the zzso active zzso zzso zzso domain inhibited the interactions between zzso and zzso that zzso the formation of stable zzso complexes in zzso These data support the notion that zzso zzso complexes are necessary for zzso synaptic zzso to zzso
