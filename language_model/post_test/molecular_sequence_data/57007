The human tumor necrosis factor locus zzso zzso is located within the major zzso complex between the class III genes and zzso We recently characterized and studied two closely linked highly zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the upstream region of the human zzso zzso zzso We also characterized two linked zzso and zzso repeats located downstream of the zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso Here, we combine these four markers together with a zzso zzso repeat in the first zzso of the zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso to type 105 cell lines from the American Society of zzso and zzso Workshop and the Center for Human zzso Studies reference panels of zzso typing cell zzso These 6 zzso markers define 35 distinct zzso zzso and together with the reference panel can be used for disease association and population zzso zzso
