zzso is the sole source of energy for the zzso stages of zzso zzso making zzso zzso putative therapeutic zzso zzso a single copy gene in zzso zzso is one such zzso whose activity is elevated approximately zzso fold in infected zzso It holds the possibility of having multiple biological functions in the zzso and hence can be a suitable candidate for diagnostic and zzso zzso 

We have aimed at generating zzso zzso in the form of zzso zzso We have raised zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Two zzso zzso were obtained with zzso zzso and specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso has a plant like zzso sequence zzso which is uniquely different from the host zzso A zzso spanning this zzso region zzso coupled to zzso was used to raise zzso zzso Four zzso were obtained with zzso zzso and of zzso zzso 

All the zzso are specific for zzso zzso zzso and one of them display zzso against native zzso zzso zzso signifying this zzso to be surface exposed and zzso
