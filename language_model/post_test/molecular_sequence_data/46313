zzso play an important role in many zzso processes of zzso zzso by zzso receptors zzso The full length of the zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shared the highest zzso acid identities with counterparts of three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso tree of zzso zzso indicates zzso zzso zzso zzso are more related to counterparts of zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was high in zzso and zzso The zzso transcript was the highest in the liver of female fish and was evenly high in the liver, zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso transcript was high in liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso juvenile at 34 days post zzso were exposed for 3 days to zzso zzso chemicals including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso expression following the zzso exposure was analyzed by quantitative real-time zzso zzso exposure at zzso zzso and 1 zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was suppressed by zzso at all zzso However zzso transcript had opposite response to zzso at low and high zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso Except a weak increase of zzso at 10 zzso zzso varying decrease of three zzso transcripts was resulted in by zzso at 10, 100 and 1000 zzso zzso transcript was significantly zzso by zzso at 10 zzso A zzso weak increase in zzso zzso expression was caused by 1 zzso zzso However 1 zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso resulted in significant and zzso decrease of zzso transcript, zzso The zzso zzso at other zzso almost had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression profiling following exposure to three zzso indicated that zzso transcript is a sensitive zzso of the juvenile zzso zzso at 34 zzso to the zzso especially to zzso These results combined suggest that the zzso genes are not modulated in the same manner by zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso may not contribute equally to the zzso regulation of genes involved in fish development and zzso
