To determine whether decreased zzso pressure affects the abundance and distribution of zzso and its zzso and the expression of the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso gene within the zzso adult male zzso rats were subjected to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso arteries zzso zzso zzso 8) and compared with zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso Renal zzso distribution was determined by zzso using a specific zzso zzso against rat zzso zzso zzso was assessed by in zzso zzso to a zzso zzso complementary to rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were determined by Northern analysis using a zzso pair rat zzso zzso zzso zzso blood pressure, measured 24 h after surgery, was lower in zzso than in zzso rats (75 zzso zzso zzso 122 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the percent of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and its zzso (85 zzso zzso and 66 zzso zzso zzso 49 zzso zzso and 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the intensity of zzso signals zzso zzso 89 zzso 71 zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, recruitment of zzso gene expressing cells was observed along zzso zzso in zzso rats, whereas zzso and its zzso were limited to the zzso in zzso zzso Renal zzso zzso gene expression was zzso lower in zzso than in zzso zzso We conclude that reduction of zzso pressure after abdominal zzso zzso acutely enhances zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
