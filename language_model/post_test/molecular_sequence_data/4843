A new zzso at the locus zzso the mast cell growth factor zzso is described and designated as zzso zzso zzso have a light zzso zzso sometimes with white zzso zzso are zzso but with reduced litter size, when zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso parameters indicated no difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso obtained from the brain of zzso zzso revealed an zzso exchange at position 400 leading to a predicted zzso acid exchange from zzso at position zzso As a consequence of the predicted zzso acid exchange an extension of the zzso context and a decreased zzso of the region at positions zzso can be zzso This single zzso acid exchange is outside of the known important zzso of zzso and explains the weak zzso of zzso
