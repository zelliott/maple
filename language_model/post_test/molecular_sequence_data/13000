Human serum zzso the major iron transport protein in humans, is a zzso zzso that is composed of two zzso zzso the zzso domain is formed by zzso acids zzso and the zzso domain is formed by zzso acids zzso Each domain is capable of binding one iron atom zzso with a zzso zzso however, the two zzso iron binding sites are not chemically zzso The zzso sequence coding for the zzso domain has been cloned and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a protein of approximately 38 zzso (the size expected for zzso zzso its zzso sequence agrees with the predicted zzso and the protein zzso with zzso serum zzso zzso The zzso protein appears to be properly folded and can bind iron as demonstrated by its spectral properties and zzso zzso It is estimated that zzso zzso represents approximately zzso of all protein zzso into the culture medium and that it is expressed at levels exceeding 50 zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso can easily be expressed in the simple host system, zzso zzso and that the zzso protein is capable of zzso binding zzso
