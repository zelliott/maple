zzso zzso were produced to peptides representing the zzso zzso of three zzso of zzso zzso C zzso beta which have been identified by isolation of zzso zzso zzso Lin, zzso zzso zzso Ellis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso indicates that zzso beta 3 is present in a variety of cell lines and rat zzso whereas the distribution of zzso beta 1 and beta 2 is more zzso A combination of conventional and zzso zzso techniques was used to purify zzso beta 1 and beta 3 from rat brain zzso zzso beta 2 was zzso from zzso of zzso zzso All three zzso were activated by zzso G protein alpha zzso zzso with the following relative zzso zzso beta 3 zzso or zzso zzso beta 1 zzso zzso beta zzso All three zzso zzso were also activated by G protein beta gamma zzso with varying zzso The presence of beta gamma zzso depressed the ability of alpha zzso to activate zzso beta 1 and beta 3 at low zzso zzso (1 zzso At higher zzso of zzso (2 zzso or zzso zzso of zzso beta 3, but not zzso beta 1, by beta gamma and alpha zzso became zzso zzso beta 3 was activated by alpha zzso even in the presence of a zzso concentration of beta gamma zzso This indicates that there are separate sites for interaction of zzso with G protein zzso and that this interaction differs depending on the zzso zzso and the concentration of zzso
