zzso factor zzso zzso plays an important role in assembling the initiation factor zzso on genes transcribed by zzso zzso III zzso zzso In zzso zzso assembly of the zzso complex by zzso zzso is thought to be initiated by its zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso which interacts directly with the zzso factor, zzso In this work, we have identified 10 dominant zzso in zzso that increase Pol III gene zzso All of these zzso are found within a discrete zzso region of the protein encompassing zzso zzso studies of one of the zzso zzso show that the increase in zzso is due to an increase in the recruitment of zzso to zzso The zzso zzso does not affect the affinity of zzso for DNA, and the differential in both zzso and zzso complex assembly is observed at zzso levels of zzso This indicates that zzso and zzso zzso complexes have the same affinity for zzso and suggests that the increased recruitment of this factor is achieved by a zzso binding zzso A novel mechanism of zzso in which the zzso zzso facilitate a zzso change in zzso that is required for zzso binding is zzso The implications of this model for the regulation of processes involving zzso proteins are zzso
