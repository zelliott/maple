zzso encodes a small protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and is found from zzso to higher zzso A zzso deletion zzso was constructed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso showed a higher zzso ratio than the wild type and a higher zzso zzso I zzso ratio measured at 77 zzso Under zzso conditions, the growth rates were not much different from those of the wild zzso zzso electron transport activities around zzso I were not much different between the wild type and the zzso However, the effects of zzso an inhibitor of zzso on zzso electron transport in the zzso were different from those in the wild type; it was severely inhibited in the wild type but not much in the zzso Together with the effects of zzso which accepts electrons from zzso via zzso zzso and those of zzso it was suggested that the zzso of zzso electron transport is altered in the zzso
