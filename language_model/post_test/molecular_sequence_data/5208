zzso artery zzso and zzso zzso shock was induced in rats by clamping both the superior zzso artery and the zzso trunk for 45 zzso followed by release of the clamp zzso zzso Following this zzso period, rats developed a fall in mean zzso blood pressure, associated with a significant increase in tissue zzso zzso activity in the zzso and a marked zzso injury to the zzso zzso Treatment of rats with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the progressive fall in blood pressure and prevented the zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also reduced the degree of zzso injury in the zzso as evaluated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also produced a marked improvement in zzso shock zzso maintained mean zzso blood pressure and reduced tissue zzso zzso and this was reversed by zzso with two different zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso the extent of zzso cell zzso and significantly attenuated zzso zzso the number of adherent zzso in the rat zzso vascular bed, as assessed by video zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso into zzso zzso thereby zzso the outcome of zzso zzso
