The role of zzso in the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso cells was zzso The transport of zzso to the zzso compartment was investigated in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been selected because it zzso zzso zzso maturation in zzso cells and leads to the zzso of a single immature zzso The structure of this zzso has been identified as zzso by labeling experiments, affinity zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast with previous results showing that zzso is a prerequisite for zzso of zzso zzso this zzso is not affected by the presence of zzso As a consequence, the presence of this zzso zzso is sufficient for an efficient zzso of zzso in the zzso compartment of zzso zzso zzso
