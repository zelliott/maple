zzso of the zzso gene is highly regulated during zzso differentiation and in a zzso zzso We characterized the human zzso alpha promoter region to determine whether tissue specificity resides within the promoter and to define important regulatory zzso A set of six fragments zzso of the zzso alpha gene were linked to a zzso reporter zzso The zzso activity was then measured in a transient zzso zzso We found that zzso alpha promoter activity can be detected from a zzso zzso upstream of the translation start site, but not from a zzso zzso The zzso zzso response element zzso site within the 10 zzso from zzso to zzso is critical for promoter zzso zzso of the zzso in the context of a zzso zzso causes loss of zzso zzso specificity does not reside in the zzso zzso because this zzso directs expression in both T and zzso cell zzso zzso longer than 146 zzso are generally expressed less well in the cell lines suggesting the potential existence of negative regulatory elements upstream of zzso Using a zzso zzso as a probe in an zzso mobility shift zzso three retarded bands formed by proteins binding to the DNA were detected using nuclear extracts from two T cell zzso Two of the three bands contain proteins of the zzso protein zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso factor proteins play a role in the expression of many other T zzso zzso our work strengthens the hypothesis that the zzso motif is important for regulating the expression of T zzso zzso
