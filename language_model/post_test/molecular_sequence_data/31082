The introduction of the bovine zzso or human zzso E6 gene into susceptible cells can result in their zzso but there are few clues to the mechanism of action of the E6 zzso The characteristic features of E6 proteins are their small size zzso 150 zzso zzso and the potential to form two large zinc zzso To determine if E6 can function as a zzso factor, the zzso E6 gene was fused to the sequence specific DNA binding zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso protein zzso promoters that incorporated zzso binding elements in both zzso cells and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso to the target promoter, zzso did not zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at the base of each finger zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso These data demonstrated that the zzso E6 gene encodes a zzso zzso domain and imply that a specific structure of the zzso most likely the zinc fingers, is critical for this zzso Since these zzso zzso are also transformation zzso E6 zzso functions may be required for its zzso zzso
