The zzso sequence of zzso an insect zzso reveals large open reading frames zzso on both strands of the viral zzso form zzso Previously, we identified two viral transcripts within the zzso zzso fraction of infected host larvae zzso et zzso 1990, zzso zzso zzso 56, zzso In this work we used zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso blots to show that the two zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso larvae, are of zzso zzso To determine their coding zzso zzso zzso were isolated from hybrids with DNA from the left and right halves of the viral zzso and translated in a rabbit zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to direct the synthesis of four zzso that zzso with the four viral zzso proteins and were zzso with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso yielded three zzso none of which was detected among the viral zzso zzso This type of expression strategy is unique among zzso and most zzso zzso which use only one DNA strand to zzso all their zzso On the other hand, the basic organization of zzso in which the regulatory and structural proteins are zzso respectively, by two clusters of zzso located at the left and right halves of the zzso is zzso
