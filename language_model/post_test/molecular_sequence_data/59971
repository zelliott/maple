Members of the zzso zzso zzso play important roles in a wide variety of signal zzso zzso and several members have been zzso However, the diversity and complexity of cellular responses in zzso systems may imply existence of zzso unidentified members of the zzso zzso zzso 

We report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso We isolated full-length mouse and human zzso that zzso complete open reading frames of a novel protein zzso termed zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso contains all of the protein zzso zzso consensus motifs and shows a modest similarity to members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso possesses a zzso zzso motif in the zzso loop domain, as do classical zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in normal zzso and zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso is able to zzso several known zzso zzso zzso and to undergo zzso A zzso in the zzso motif to zzso abolished the zzso activity of zzso and the treatment of cells with a zzso zzso zzso acid, enhanced the zzso activity of zzso suggesting the existence of an upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to stimulate the zzso activity of zzso whereas serum zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment did not significantly activate zzso 

These results indicate that zzso is zzso related to members of known zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and can therefore be classified as a novel zzso
