A novel strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a sulfur zzso mat in a saline spring at the zzso zzso resort zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso exhibited a zzso zzso The zzso required zzso in the growth medium and was able to zzso it zzso to zzso sulfur via the interaction of zzso with zzso and deposit it in the zzso zzso Growth occurred at zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolate used several zzso and zzso as carbon or energy sources but did not use zzso zzso zzso organic acids or zzso The products of zzso zzso were zzso zzso ethanol, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso fell within a group of species in the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it shared less then zzso sequence zzso On the basis of its zzso physiology and other zzso properties, as well as its zzso position, the new isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
