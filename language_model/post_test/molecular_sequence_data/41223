The zzso proteins of some zzso viruses can zzso to the nucleus and interfere with cellular zzso In this study we found that the zzso zzso protein of zzso B3 zzso was zzso localized in the nucleus of the cells zzso with zzso zzso The zzso nuclear zzso also occurred in the cells infected with zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso nuclear zzso sequence located near the zzso The substitution of zzso with zzso completely abolished its zzso The zzso proteins of other zzso types might have the nuclear zzso potential because this region was highly zzso Moreover, the zzso nuclear zzso induced cell cycle deregulation, including a prolonged S phase and shortened zzso zzso Besides these findings, we also found a domain between zzso and zzso that caused the zzso zzso dotted distributed in the zzso Our results suggest a new zzso mechanism of zzso
