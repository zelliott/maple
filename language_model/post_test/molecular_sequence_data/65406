Human zzso zzso plays an essential role in growth and zzso and its effectiveness is modulated by the availability of its specific zzso zzso zzso zzso on target zzso The zzso gene has a complex zzso region containing multiple first zzso Seven are clustered within two small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed whereas those from module B are only found in zzso liver, suggesting zzso and zzso regulation of module B zzso gene zzso To characterize the elements regulating module B activity, we studied a zzso promoter of the highest expressing zzso in liver, zzso This promoter was zzso in zzso zzso however, either zzso or zzso relieved this, suggesting the presence of multiple negative regulatory zzso Six putative zzso nuclear factor 4 zzso response elements were zzso We determined that zzso is zzso regulated in the human zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in fetal zzso but only zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso have a similar dual effect on zzso zzso zzso via site 1 in the zzso promoter and repression through site 6, approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses confirmed these two sites are bound by zzso Based on these data, we speculate there are multiple regions working together to repress the expression of zzso zzso transcripts in zzso other than the normal zzso liver, and that zzso is a good candidate for regulating zzso zzso expression in the human zzso
