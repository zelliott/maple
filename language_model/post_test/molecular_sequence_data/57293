In the zzso whale zzso zzso two different repeat types (A and zzso of the common zzso DNA satellite were zzso The evolution of each group of repeats appears to be independent from that of the zzso The sequence similarity between the two groups is less than the similarity between group A and repeats of the satellite in related whale zzso The systematic relationship within and between the families zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was addressed by both sequence analysis of the satellite and comparisons with the families zzso and zzso The zzso blue whale zzso zzso was used as an zzso in the zzso The molecular zzso when zzso analysis and the zzso method were used, grouped together species of each zzso At the family level the zzso grouped closet to the families zzso and zzso The similarities between the common zzso satellite of the blue whale and the zzso whale were greater than those between the blue whale and the other zzso included, suggesting that the evolution of the satellite is slower in the zzso whale than in the other zzso
