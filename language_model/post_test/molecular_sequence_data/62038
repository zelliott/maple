The zzso protection zzso that is defective in patients with zzso anemia zzso is controlled by at least eight zzso including zzso A key step in the zzso involves the zzso of zzso which critically depends on a zzso nuclear zzso zzso of at least six zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Except for zzso which has zzso repeats and a zzso finger domain, no significant domain structure has so far been recognized in any of the core complex zzso By using a zzso search strategy comparing the human zzso protein sequence with its zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso rice zzso and zzso zzso zzso we identified at least seven zzso repeat motifs zzso covering a major part of this zzso zzso are zzso zzso acid repeat motifs which function as scaffolds zzso zzso zzso often found in zzso zzso In four out of five zzso motifs tested zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso the motifs at the critical position 8 of each zzso caused complete or partial loss of zzso zzso Loss of function was evident from failure of the zzso proteins to complement the cellular zzso zzso in zzso zzso which was correlated with loss of binding to zzso Although the zzso zzso fully zzso the cells, it showed a reduced interaction with zzso suggesting that this zzso may also be of functional zzso The recognition of zzso as a typical zzso protein predicts this protein to play a key role in the assembly and/or stabilization of the nuclear zzso protein core zzso
