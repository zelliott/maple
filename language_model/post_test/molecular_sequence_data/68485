The binding of the zzso zzso zzso component and the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso component zzso a zzso enhancement in the rate at which the zzso zzso E1 zzso versus free zzso zzso free zzso The zzso and E1 associate with small exterior zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso binds to one of two zzso zzso and the E1 component binds to a domain in zzso structure between the zzso domain region and the inner zzso Sixty of the latter zzso assemble to form a zzso inner zzso zzso of the zzso to a detached zzso domain region enhanced zzso zzso This zzso domain zzso induced a zzso enhancement in the slow rate of zzso of zzso zzso and intact zzso gave only a 50% higher zzso In contrast, the zzso domain zzso gave only a zzso enhancement in the faster rate of zzso of zzso whereas the rate of zzso of E1 was markedly increased zzso depending on zzso by zzso interaction with the intact zzso zzso zzso of E1 to an zzso structure lacking only the zzso domain region did not enhance zzso zzso Thus, binding of the zzso to the zzso domain region elicits a structural change which enhances zzso zzso however, other processes are required to explain the very large enhancement in zzso of E1 zzso by intact zzso zzso Among the latter is a need for a mechanism allowing one zzso zzso to zzso many E1 zzso whereas both E1 and the zzso stay bound to the zzso zzso core zzso zzso appears to be much faster than the zzso of either the zzso or E1 zzso from zzso zzso Exposure of zzso bound to the zzso domain zzso to intact zzso core for 10 s allowed a transition to a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso In the opposite direction, an increasing level of the free zzso domain zzso rapidly reduced, in a zzso manner the activity of zzso bound initially to intact zzso The data strongly support zzso transfer between free zzso zzso and the intact zzso core and fit about a zzso tighter binding of the zzso to intact zzso zzso over binding to free zzso zzso Such an interchange of the zzso between these zzso structures was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
