Avian zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso or zzso in fish, is composed of at least two zzso Previous studies have indicated that one of the zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso is produced in the zzso cells of the developing zzso of quail zzso on stimulation with zzso However, little is known about the molecular biology of the other component of the avian zzso zzso zzso and information about gene expression is particularly zzso We have cloned the zzso in Japanese quail and examined its gene zzso A zzso zzso quail zzso was isolated from the zzso of mature females using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso zzso It zzso a zzso acid protein that showed greatest zzso zzso zzso with the chicken zzso zzso amplification indicated that the zzso zzso in the liver was restricted to mature laying zzso The expression of zzso zzso was zzso by in zzso treatment with zzso in immature females as well as zzso These results suggested that zzso and zzso zzso regulate the formation of quail zzso membrane zzso In addition, the use of zzso zzso induction in males or immature females as a biological marker of environmental zzso is zzso
