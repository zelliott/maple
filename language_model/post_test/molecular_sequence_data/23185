In a search for zzso genes expressed during early stages of development, we have identified two zzso zzso proteins related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso codes for a small protein with no clearly identified functional zzso and which is highly zzso during zzso This paper describes the identification and a detailed gene expression analysis of zzso zzso zzso during zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso encodes a maternal transcript detected in both zzso and zzso cell at the 1-2 cell zzso and in the zzso during zzso We show that a putative zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso from the vegetal zzso into animal zzso determines the zzso of the transcript in the animal pole, immediately after zzso Furthermore, the zzso array contained into the zzso cell seems to be responsible for the high level of zzso zzso transcript detected in the central zzso at the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed into the zzso region during zzso and starting from zzso to 24 zzso the expression domain becomes progressively restricted to the developing neural tube and zzso structures, and zzso to the zzso zzso
