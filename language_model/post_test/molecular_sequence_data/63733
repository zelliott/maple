zzso zzso is a zzso derived from the winter zzso In our previous study, we reported the zzso effect of zzso and its mode of zzso To develop novel zzso peptides useful as therapeutic agents, two zzso with zzso acid zzso were designed to decrease the net zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso at the zzso face of zzso without changing the zzso zzso By substituting zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso and by substituting zzso though the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso the zzso of this zzso was zzso CD zzso showed the substitution of zzso or zzso decrease the zzso zzso of analog zzso Studies with analog peptides have shown decreases in zzso and zzso do not affect zzso activity but decrease zzso zzso These results suggest that highly zzso and zzso zzso are not desirable in the design of zzso zzso
