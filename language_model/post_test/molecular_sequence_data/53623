The zzso family of proteins is a large group of zzso factors implicated in many aspects of normal zzso development, as well as zzso For example, the zzso zzso gene is required for normal zzso zzso zzso adult bone zzso zzso and is rearranged or deleted in numerous zzso This report describes the cloning and characterization of a novel zzso gene that is highly related to zzso and is therefore called zzso The zzso gene consists of 8 zzso spanning approximately 21 zzso zzso in human zzso zzso Unlike the zzso expressed zzso zzso however, zzso appears to be expressed predominantly in zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso of the zzso protein were used to show that zzso zzso to the zzso All zzso proteins can bind DNA via the highly zzso zzso domain, which recognizes a zzso DNA sequence with a zzso core zzso DNA binding zzso show that zzso can bind the same consensus DNA binding sequence recognized by zzso Additionally, the zzso protein is capable of zzso with itself and with zzso in doubly zzso zzso cells, and this interaction is zzso through the pointed zzso domain of zzso The striking similarities of zzso to the zzso zzso its expression in zzso zzso and its ability to associate with zzso suggest that zzso may be an important zzso regulatory zzso
