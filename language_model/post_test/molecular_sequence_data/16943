The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the central nervous system and specific cell lines with varying expression levels perhaps playing important zzso One of the zzso zzso regulators, zzso zzso factor zzso has been shown to repress the expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso However, we showed here that the zzso zzso element zzso of zzso functions as a critical regulator to repress the zzso gene expression in specific zzso cells depending on zzso expression zzso Using zzso studies, we showed that the zzso of the zzso promoter is functional in zzso cells zzso and zzso but not in zzso cells zzso zzso binds to the zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso manner confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The suppression of zzso activity with either zzso A or a zzso zzso induced zzso promoter activity and zzso of the zzso zzso When the zzso was disrupted in zzso and zzso cells using small interfering zzso the zzso of the zzso target zzso gene increased zzso This provides direct evidence the role of zzso in the cells and also indicates that zzso expression is regulated by zzso modification in zzso zzso zzso Our data suggested that zzso can function as a zzso of zzso zzso in specific cells, via a mechanism dependent on the zzso zzso
