The zzso zzso zzso was engineered to express the zzso 1 zzso of the human zzso acid zzso 1 zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso that was isolated from several transformed zzso strains produced fully functional zzso receptors in zzso zzso The zzso currents zzso in the zzso were fast, zzso zzso zzso and the order of zzso potency was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the receptors were resistant to zzso strongly antagonized by zzso zzso acid, and modulated by zinc and zzso Thus, the zzso receptors expressed by the zzso zzso retained all of the principal characteristics of receptors expressed by zzso or native zzso zzso Western zzso zzso showed zzso in zzso plasma membrane zzso and a zzso zzso fusion gene showed mostly zzso distribution with a faint zzso toward the plasma zzso In zzso zzso of zzso 1 in zzso demonstrated that some receptors reach the plasma zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso plasma zzso to zzso zzso resulted in the incorporation of a small number of functional zzso zzso 1 receptors into the zzso plasma zzso These results show that zzso may be useful to produce complete functional zzso receptors suitable for structural zzso
