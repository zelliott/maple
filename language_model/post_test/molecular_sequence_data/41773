A gene from zzso zzso was zzso that encodes a protein with zzso to a family of putative zzso These zzso proteins include the zzso cell division cycle protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso proteins necessary for fusion of transport zzso to target zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a protein necessary for zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein that influences the rate of DNA escape from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins that interact with zzso zzso This newly zzso zzso named zzso for zzso family zzso is located on zzso zzso zzso to the zzso open reading frame and encodes an essential protein of zzso zzso acids that is most zzso to zzso
