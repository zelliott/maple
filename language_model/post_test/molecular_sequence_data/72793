zzso virus zzso replication proteins zzso and zzso play major roles in the life cycle of zzso We have recently provided in zzso evidence for the existence of a zzso association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work we have further characterized the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and primer extension analyses revealed that in the majority of isolated zzso zzso protein is zzso linked to one of the zzso terminal zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso suggest that zzso protein remains associated with the virus particle for up to 8 zzso after labeling in infected zzso zzso zzso indicated that approximately zzso of the zzso remains associated with the zzso protein after cell zzso and partial zzso When cells are infected with zzso zzso zzso a significant proportion of viral DNA remains attached to zzso after entry into the zzso However, the linkage does not persist after nuclear zzso These observations suggest that zzso linked zzso protein may play a key role during zzso zzso infections and zzso zzso zzso
