zzso is a rapid process during which zzso zzso undergo dissolution with the consequence of a zzso of zzso zzso A zzso of those dissolution processes of zzso can be approached by a zzso program using zzso plants that can resist alkaline pH and higher zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso that mediate a rapid and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In the present study, the zzso expression of a CA zzso zzso for the plant zzso zzso from the parsley zzso zzso is zzso The studies were primarily been performed during zzso of the seeds up to the zzso zzso The CA zzso was zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis revealed that the gene expression level of the zzso zzso CA is strongly and significantly affected at more alkaline pH in the growth medium zzso zzso This abolishing effect is zzso both by addition of zzso and by addition of zzso zzso to the culture zzso In response to zzso the increased pH in the zzso of the growing plants is zzso The effect of zzso let us to propose that this zzso acts as a buffer system that zzso the adjustment of the pH in the zzso In addition, it is proposed that zzso has the potential to act, especially in the zzso as a fertilizer that allows the zzso plants to cope with the adverse pH and zzso condition in the zzso
