The zzso of zzso zzso strains in sensitivity to zzso is correlated with genetic differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sensitive strain zzso was shown to contain an additional zzso zzso not found in strains that are less zzso zzso is zzso arranged with zzso which is identical to the zzso zzso gene zzso except for the zzso zzso analysis indicated that most of zzso had been lost by a zzso event between zzso and zzso generating the zzso gene zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was also found in zzso of zzso selected as zzso resistant zzso These zzso like zzso zzso double zzso were unable to grow on zzso when zzso was blocked zzso zzso and zzso repression was strongly zzso zzso or zzso single zzso of zzso were zzso but still an influence of the zzso zzso on zzso repression was zzso zzso was not affected in a zzso zzso deleted for the zzso zzso gene suggesting that the influence of zzso genes on repression is not caused by a reduction of the zzso zzso The data rather suggest that sensitivity to zzso repression is dependent on the rate of zzso zzso
