The zzso zzso zzso and zzso 55, were partially zzso from bovine and guinea-pig zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso of zzso 16 and zzso 55, were shown by sequencing, to be similar to mouse zzso and a human milk protein of zzso zzso Both of these latter proteins are associated with the zzso and contain zzso growth zzso zzso and/or factor zzso zzso These data complement earlier zzso studies on the zzso tissue distribution and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 55, and indicate that zzso proteins are expressed on the zzso surfaces of zzso zzso cells and are zzso both in a soluble form and as major components of the zzso in diverse zzso The possible function of these proteins in zzso and in zzso and zzso development is zzso
