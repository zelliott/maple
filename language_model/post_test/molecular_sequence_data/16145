zzso analysis of the promoter of the zzso gene that functions in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified a zzso upstream zzso site zzso It is contained within a single zzso zzso region located immediately upstream of the zzso box and is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso When placed upstream of a zzso gene fusion, the zzso sequence zzso zzso regulation on zzso A zzso deletion within the zzso zzso in an otherwise intact zzso promoter resulted in zzso expression of a zzso gene zzso When a zzso bearing this zzso promoter was placed in a strain carrying a zzso zzso in the positive regulatory gene zzso expression of zzso was not zzso but occurred at levels below those found under zzso zzso In zzso as well as zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso appeared to be responsible for zzso as well as zzso levels of zzso Although located immediately adjacent to the zzso zzso the zzso box did not appear to play a regulatory role, as indicated by the results of experiments in which it was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence containing this zzso box was critical to the expression of zzso since a deletion of this region completely abolished zzso activity of the gene under both inducing and zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso promoter has a comparatively simple structure, requiring zzso and zzso sequences as well as the zzso gene product zzso or zzso for its zzso
