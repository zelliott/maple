zzso receptors were studied in zzso rat zzso cells zzso either zzso zzso zzso human zzso growth factor I zzso receptors or zzso human zzso receptors truncated at position zzso in the beta zzso zzso region zzso zzso binding was increased in both zzso zzso zzso and truncated human zzso zzso zzso stable zzso zzso when compared to zzso cells that contained zzso rat zzso zzso zzso cell labeling followed by zzso with zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso revealed the presence of hybrid zzso human zzso truncated zzso human zzso and zzso human zzso zzso Both zzso and hybrid receptors were zzso slower than zzso zzso receptors zzso 16 zzso Despite their markedly increased zzso binding and prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso the zzso signal to suppress growth hormone zzso Also, they neither underwent zzso nor zzso zzso zzso The expected suppression of zzso by zzso rat zzso receptors was completely zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were therefore completely devoid of biological signaling to zzso despite the presence of zzso rat zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso receptors block zzso zzso rat zzso signaling by functioning as a dominant negative forming zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso receptors may function therefore as dominant negative zzso which suppress normal zzso responses in zzso zzso
