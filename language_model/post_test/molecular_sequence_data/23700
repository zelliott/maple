Fluorescent proteins are genetically zzso easily zzso reporters crucial in biology and zzso When a protein is zzso by fusion to a fluorescent zzso interactions between fluorescent proteins can zzso disturb targeting or zzso Unfortunately, all zzso zzso fluorescent proteins reported so far are zzso zzso and often toxic or zzso The first true zzso was zzso derived from the zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso by directed evolution first to increase the speed of zzso then to break each zzso interface while restoring fluorescence, which zzso required 33 zzso Although zzso has already proven widely useful, several properties could bear improvement and more colors would be zzso We report the next generation of zzso The latest red version matures more completely, is more tolerant of zzso zzso and is over tenfold more zzso than zzso Three zzso with distinguishable hues from zzso to zzso have higher quantum zzso
