zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso able to specifically remove the zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso Since nothing was known concerning the regulation and function of zzso a zzso of a zzso strain lacking zzso activity zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso using a zzso fusion between zzso and a reporter gene zzso The zzso and zzso strains were grown in synthetic media and in milk to investigate the environmental effects on zzso zzso The expression of zzso and of the zzso fusion zzso was not sensitive to environmental conditions like temperature, zzso or nitrogen and zzso zzso but was induced by the product of the zzso activity, zzso acid zzso The expression of the native gene and the fusion in inducing conditions was also controlled by the iron zzso The identification in the zzso promoter sequence of putative zzso zzso regulator zzso binding sites suggests a zzso regulation in a zzso zzso Two other putative regulatory stretches, corresponding to zzso repeated sequences with perfect and imperfect zzso were also zzso zzso and iron are therefore at least two of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
