The cardiac zzso system comprises a specialized tract of zzso coupled zzso responsible for impulse propagation through the zzso zzso in cardiac zzso are responsible for numerous forms of cardiac zzso but relatively little is known about the gene regulatory mechanisms that control the formation of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso which encodes a gap junction protein required for normal zzso zzso delay in mice, is necessary and sufficient to direct expression to the developing zzso zzso system zzso Moreover, we show that this zzso requires zzso and zzso for proper expression in the zzso system, and zzso mice have short zzso intervals indicative of accelerated zzso zzso Thus, our results zzso zzso in zzso system function and provide a clearer understanding of the zzso pathways that impact normal zzso zzso
