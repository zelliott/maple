There is growing evidence for diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from the alternative zzso of a primary zzso In this study, we show the existence of zzso zzso in the human cardiac zzso by zzso zzso We found that the zzso DNA segment zzso the zzso tail of the protein is composed of nine zzso and two alternative zzso The alternative zzso of these latter two zzso gives rise to the formation of three message zzso for this zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso of the reverse zzso chain reaction products showed significant variations in the distribution of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in distinct parts of the heart, the zzso and zzso zzso of the three zzso in zzso zzso or in zzso cells and analysis of the zzso and zzso dependence of the induced zzso currents revealed only insignificant differences in the behavior of these zzso When the zzso were zzso with a human zzso no zzso zzso were observed, but the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso properties were zzso The differential abundance of the three zzso and the influence of an accessory zzso are of potential zzso zzso
