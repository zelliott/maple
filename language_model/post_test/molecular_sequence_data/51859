The gene zzso is one of the genes which affect the cell membrane zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were cloned and the DNA sequences were zzso The zzso gene was dominant in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was a point zzso zzso which generates an zzso acid exchange zzso in the putative zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein revealed that it has a zzso motif which may be responsible for the ability to bind in a zzso manner to zzso This finding indicated that the zzso protein may regulate the expression of genes that are associated with cell zzso of drugs in zzso zzso The position of the zzso acid substitution between the zzso protein and the zzso protein was located within a possible zzso domain, suggesting that the zzso protein zzso may have lost DNA binding ability and regulator zzso
