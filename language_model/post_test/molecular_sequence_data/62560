The zzso patterns of a small marine fish, the common zzso zzso zzso were assessed at 12 sites along the northeastern Atlantic coasts and the western Mediterranean zzso A combination of two genetic markers was zzso cellulose zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus zzso zzso Both markers were zzso in revealing significant differences between samples zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the zzso DNA zzso and a pattern of zzso zzso analyses yielded a shallow branching structure with four zzso Three of those were confined to the Atlantic basin and showed a zzso zzso The fourth group contained a central zzso occurring at the edges of the zzso distribution, accompanied by a few more rare zzso which were restricted to the Mediterranean zzso A genetic break was observed around the British zzso with distinct zzso dominating at either side of the English zzso A significantly negative correlation between the degree of genetic diversity and latitude was recorded both for zzso DNA zzso and zzso in the Atlantic zzso Gene flow analysis suggested that zzso of the North Sea and the coasts of western Scotland and Ireland may have taken place from a glacial zzso in the Southern zzso of the North zzso These results are discussed in the perspective of possible zzso migration routes of marine fish along the northeastern Atlantic zzso
