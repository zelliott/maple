zzso breakage syndrome zzso is a genetic disorder characterized by zzso instability and hypersensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients display a clinical zzso more severe than the majority of zzso patients zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients, contains a zzso domain necessary for the zzso strand break zzso damage zzso Recently, a second zzso domain has been identified, however, its role is still zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso binding after induction of DNA damage, leading to a delay in zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that the 215 zzso of zzso is located between the two zzso zzso affecting their relative orientation that appears critical for zzso zzso Present data represent the first evidence for the role of zzso tandem zzso zzso in zzso recognition, and could explain the severe zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso
