The zzso sequences of the zzso coli zzso between the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of DNA which follows zzso have been zzso The region between zzso and zzso contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which we call zzso This zzso is capable of coding for an Mr zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid zzso sequence for the putative product shows significant similarity to the zzso coli zzso branching zzso and to several different zzso zzso and zzso The regions of sequence similarity include zzso which have been reported to be involved in zzso binding and zzso by zzso This suggests that the proposed product may catalyze zzso or zzso zzso The cloned region which follows zzso contains an incomplete zzso zzso zzso zzso which appears to zzso zzso zzso of the N zzso of zzso zzso based upon sequence similarity with the zzso from rabbit muscle zzso identical zzso zzso and with zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso identical zzso zzso zzso suggest that neither zzso is required for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes together in a cluster may facilitate the regulation of these systems in zzso
