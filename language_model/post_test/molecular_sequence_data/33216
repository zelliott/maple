The human zzso virus zzso protein zzso acts as a zzso zzso that stimulates expression of the infected viral zzso It is released from infected cells and can similarly affect neighboring zzso The zzso is an important protein that has a related significant role in early zzso zzso and which contributes to the rapid viral replication that occurs during zzso zzso To investigate the interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso using zzso and flag NC zzso in zzso zzso cells and reverse zzso chain reaction to validate the zzso zzso Four zzso genes and nine zzso genes were selected as candidate zzso Gene zzso analysis was conducted to define the biological process of the input zzso A zzso approach using zzso determined the relationship between zzso and zzso two automatically built pathways represented the interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso and zzso genes regulate zzso replication and zzso and viral zzso
