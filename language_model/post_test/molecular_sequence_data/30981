zzso DNA derived from a zzso zzso zzso zzso constructed to zzso the human zzso zzso zzso coding region along with the mouse zzso zzso promoter, was zzso cloned in order to characterize a deletion previously observed in this zzso zzso sequence comparison with the original zzso zzso construct revealed two deletions in the cloned zzso One of the deleted regions originated entirely from within the mouse zzso zzso A second deletion eliminated portions of both viral and zzso promoter zzso All four deletion junctions in the original construct included sequences which conform to those proposed as zzso consensus zzso donor and zzso signals, including a previously zzso cryptic zzso donor signal in the zzso leukemia virus envelope zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso between inadvertently juxtaposed donor and zzso signals was responsible for the observed zzso
