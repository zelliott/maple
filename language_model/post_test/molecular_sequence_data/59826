The zzso zzso sequence of the cryptic zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso DNA has very low zzso content zzso and may serve as a model for studying the modes of maintenance and replication of zzso DNA under conditions of zzso zzso The zzso sequence revealed three open reading frames zzso which would zzso zzso of zzso 68 and 59 zzso zzso respectively, and these proteins were zzso in zzso coli extracts primed with the zzso We found that the product of zzso may be initiated at the zzso start zzso zzso and has similarities with the zzso motifs of zzso proteins zzso by rolling circle zzso plasmids of the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso of zzso zzso cells harboring zzso revealed zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso is able to replicate in zzso cells via the zzso zzso The most significant similarities are found between zzso zzso protein and the zzso proteins of three zzso plasmids of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso Comparative analysis of these zzso proteins showed that despite the significant level of zzso these zzso proteins share a high degree of similarity in the regions of five well-known zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins and fall into two groups in accordance with the similarities found in their active zzso
