Members of the zzso zzso are predominantly receptors that mediate interactions between cells or provide signals to cells when binding specific zzso Here we describe an zzso zzso that requires zinc for its zzso zzso cell zzso receptors zzso belonging to the zzso zzso mediate zzso of zzso cells upon recognition of zzso molecules on target zzso An abundance of zzso zzso in the first zzso domain of zzso including the signature zinc binding motif zzso suggested that this zzso may bind zzso Two distinct zzso molecules that mediate recognition of zzso and zzso respectively, bound specifically to zinc affinity zzso Furthermore, addition of the zinc zzso zzso during zzso release zzso reversed the zzso of killing by zzso clones specific for zzso or zzso demonstrating that zinc is necessary for the zzso function of zzso Such functionally relevant zinc binding has not been described for other members of the zzso zzso and may represent a novel regulatory mechanism for zzso zzso zzso
