We have identified new malaria vaccine candidates through the combination of zzso prediction of stable protein zzso in the zzso zzso zzso chemical synthesis of zzso in zzso biological functional zzso and association of an zzso zzso response with protection against clinical zzso Within the predicted open reading frame of zzso zzso hypothetical protein zzso several segments with low zzso zzso acid content, which are likely to be zzso zzso were zzso The synthetic zzso corresponding to one such segment zzso was well recognized by zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells of adults living in different regions where malaria is zzso High zzso zzso were induced in different strains of mice and in rabbits zzso with the zzso formulated with different zzso These zzso recognized native zzso in zzso zzso zzso formed distinct bands in Western zzso and were zzso in an in zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso together with its low zzso and association with clinical protection from malaria in humans, warrant its further development as a malaria vaccine zzso
