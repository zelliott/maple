A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and used to show that oxygen regulates the zzso levels of zzso zzso using a zzso gene fusion demonstrated that oxygen does not zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is not regulated by oxygen nor is the zzso feedback inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso It was demonstrated that less than zzso of zzso was incorporated into zzso suggesting that the majority of the zzso is diverted from the common zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was not observed in this zzso however, an zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso The specific activity of this zzso increased with increasing oxygen zzso The results presented here suggest that carbon flow over the common zzso zzso is regulated by a combination of feedback zzso of zzso zzso and diversion of zzso from the zzso by zzso zzso
