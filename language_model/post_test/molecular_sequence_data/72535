The zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso forms, together with zzso a functional zzso zzso complex for zzso zzso zzso and others, reported the cloning of the zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso and recently described the structure of the zzso zzso We also described the presence of a second zzso locus in some mouse zzso In this study we report that the second zzso designated zzso encodes an zzso zzso The transcript was zzso identical to the zzso transcript in the coding and zzso region, but had a different zzso zzso The complete zzso organization of the zzso locus is zzso and the two zzso are shown to be located on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the expression pattern of the zzso and zzso genes using an zzso restriction zzso length zzso strategy revealed that while the expression of zzso was zzso expression of zzso was restricted to zzso zzso zzso and zzso
