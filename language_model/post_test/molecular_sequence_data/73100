zzso zzso zzso is of bacterial origin and expressed in plant zzso to generate an unusual compound, zzso which is zzso into the environment where zzso zzso uses it as a zzso zzso The zzso promoter contains three distinctive regions which are important for the promoter zzso Among these, the upstream region between zzso and zzso is essential for the zzso zzso The upstream region consists of two zzso motifs which are separated by an eight zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the role of the zzso motif that is located between zzso and zzso zzso the distance between the zzso and the downstream regulatory region significantly reduced the promoter activity, indicating that a proper distance between the regulatory elements is needed for an optimum level of zzso zzso of a single copy of the zzso enhanced the promoter in both zzso Point zzso in the inserted zzso sequence reduced the enhancing zzso These results confirmed that the zzso motif is important for the zzso promoter zzso The b sequence that is located immediately downstream of the zzso motif did not function by itself, but together with the zzso it appeared to enhance the promoter zzso These indicate that the sequence surrounding of the upstream regulatory element is also involved in controlling the promoter zzso
