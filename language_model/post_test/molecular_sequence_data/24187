zzso from pea was zzso expressed in transgenic tobacco plants and assessed for functional zzso The successful assembly of the zzso proteins into zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso tandem mass zzso zzso production of zzso led to increased number of zzso zzso per zzso increased zzso zzso higher zzso numbers per zzso cell and increased zzso capacity at low zzso both on a zzso and leaf area zzso The transgenic plants also displayed increased cell volume, larger leaves, higher leaf number per plant at zzso increased biomass and increased seed weight, when grown under low zzso zzso Under high zzso both transgenic and wild type plants displayed similar zzso rates when tested at 25 degrees zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso values increased in the transgenic zzso The exposure of transgenic plants to a zzso treatment (4 degrees C for 4 zzso under continuous zzso resulted in more zzso impairment of photosynthesis, since recovery was slower than the zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso expression of additional zzso zzso led to a series of changes at all levels of the plant zzso leaf and whole zzso and a delay in flowering and zzso The additional production of the pea protein appears to be zzso by increasing cellular structures such as the number of zzso per zzso zzso volume, zzso per cell, and leaf zzso The presence of the zzso pea protein in the tobacco zzso however, caused a possible change in the organization of the associated zzso that in turn limited photosynthesis at low zzso
