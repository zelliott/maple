The Class zzso of the zzso zzso is the largest zzso zzso in which zzso zzso and zzso are zzso We conducted a molecular genetic test of this indication that zzso zzso may have evolved without sexual reproduction or genetic zzso The test is based on the expectation that after millions of years without these zzso zzso will no longer contain pairs of closely similar zzso and instead will contain highly divergent descendants of formerly zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso of individual zzso zzso representing four different species, appear to lack pairs of closely similar sequences and contain representatives of two ancient lineages that began to diverge before the zzso radiation many millions of years ago when sexual reproduction and genetic exchange may have zzso
