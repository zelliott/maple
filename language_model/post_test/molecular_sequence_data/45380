zzso zzso exerts most of its effect through nuclear zzso hormone receptors zzso which bind mainly as zzso with zzso receptors zzso to zzso hormone response elements zzso in target zzso It is well known that the synergistic interaction of zzso and zzso has a role on the synthesis of growth hormone in rat zzso cell lines and in the zzso metamorphosis in zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our laboratory reported increased specific zzso actions of zzso in rat liver by zzso zzso through a mechanism involving an zzso of the zzso binding capacity of zzso In this study we further explored the participation of zzso in the molecular mechanism of the zzso increase on liver zzso zzso zzso zzso administration to zzso rats induced an increase of liver zzso protein and zzso Nuclear zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells indicated that zzso increased the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso induced the binding of additional proteins related to or neighboring the DNA sequence of a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso for an interaction of zzso on the zzso promoter have been zzso Moreover, the specificity of the zzso binding to zzso was determined not only by the zzso DNA zzso but also by the interaction of the zzso with other zzso factors bound to sequences zzso the zzso
