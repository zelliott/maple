zzso bacteria are frequently isolated from bovine zzso with the zzso species, and zzso zzso is the most frequently isolated zzso of this zzso However, previous studies on the zzso of zzso have incorporated only a single reference zzso We examined the zzso of zzso zzso using 47 strains isolated from bovine zzso zzso zzso studies were performed by direct sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso and comparison to sequences of reference zzso All strains identified as zzso zzso demonstrated similarity of zzso or higher to the zzso zzso gene sequences of the type strain of zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that all strains tested clustered with members of the zzso zzso group confirming that zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso zzso Further investigation into the diversity within the species using repetitive element zzso zzso indicated only minor differences between the strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the highest similarity zzso with zzso zzso indicating that this zzso does not belong in the zzso zzso
