A range of zzso of zzso zzso from widely different environmental sources were examined for their ability to zzso zzso zzso No significant differences in the quantity or composition of the zzso zzso could be produced by manipulating the growth zzso zzso for the zzso genes indicated low levels of strain variation, and the majority of zzso did lead to zzso acid sequence changes that had no evident zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso genes showed a fixed sequential expression pattern during growth, and no significant zzso could be induced by varying producer strains or growth zzso The results indicated that zzso are highly zzso molecules and that their gene expression has a rather stringent zzso This leaves little opportunity to manipulate and greatly increase the yield of zzso from strains of zzso zzso for zzso zzso
