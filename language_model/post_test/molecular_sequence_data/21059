zzso detection is critical to the process of generating and testing zzso infant formula zzso An obstacle associated with zzso microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and zzso We have developed a zzso DNA zzso detection technique to identify 10 different zzso bacteria associated with zzso contamination based on the zzso zzso gene internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso were zzso One hundred zzso strains were used to validate the zzso zzso (including zzso target pathogen strains and 51 closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity zzso zzso zzso DNA or zzso zzso zzso real zzso samples were tested by the zzso with zzso zzso The data presented reveal that the designed zzso zzso is a promising method for basic zzso clinical diagnosis, food safety, and zzso zzso
