zzso of a human zzso zzso DNA clone extending 900 base pairs upstream and 400 base pairs downstream of the gene has been previously examined in adult transgenic zzso In adults, expression of human zzso was evident in zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso and zzso Previous studies of mouse and rat zzso have demonstrated that kidney zzso becomes evident at approximately 15 days of gestation and that expression is localized first to smooth muscle cells of the developing zzso zzso tree and becomes progressively restricted to zzso zzso As a prelude to performing cell specificity studies to zzso the pattern of human zzso gene expression in the developing zzso zzso and zzso days of gestation fetuses and newborns were obtained for expression zzso zzso were pooled and expression was examined in zzso liver, gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso heart and zzso The number of transgenic fetuses in each pool was determined by human zzso zzso chain reaction of DNA zzso from zzso or tail zzso Renal human zzso expression was abundant at all three time zzso zzso was also evident in the zzso tract at zzso and zzso days of zzso Interestingly, although no human zzso zzso was evident in lung at zzso or zzso days of zzso extremely high levels of human zzso zzso were detected in the newborn zzso zzso of the human zzso gene in these zzso was further confirmed by differential primer extension analysis which is capable of zzso the closely related human and mouse zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
