We develop a method, which zzso a combined atomic force microscope zzso microscope and small copy number zzso chain reaction zzso to zzso individual zzso species in a single cycle from a small pool of zzso zzso zzso In this method, a library of small zzso each of which is zzso with fluorescent zzso of different zzso is zzso This library of zzso beads is flowed over immobilized target molecules on a glass cover zzso zzso zzso zzso bind tightly to the target for prolonged periods and resist subsequent washes, resulting in a strong zzso signal on the zzso zzso This signal is observed from underneath the sample via zzso zzso The zzso tip, situated above the sample, is then directed to the coordinates of the zzso signal and is used to capture a three-dimensional high-resolution image of the zzso zzso and to extract the zzso (plus attached zzso The extracted zzso is zzso zzso and may then be subjected to further zzso zzso Here, we describe the underlying principles of this method, the required zzso zzso and the results of zzso zzso In these experiments, we selected zzso in eight trials from a zzso pool containing a zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso and a nonsense zzso In each of the eight trials, the positive control zzso was successfully zzso zzso zzso and characterized by zzso amplification and zzso In no case was the nonsense zzso selected, indicating good selectivity at this early stage of technology zzso
