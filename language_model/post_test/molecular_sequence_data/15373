Under stressed conditions such as prolonged exposure to high zzso the zzso zzso bridge in bovine zzso zzso is susceptible to a base zzso zzso zzso This reaction converts the zzso bond to a zzso zzso with loss of a zzso zzso Two altered species were isolated in pure form and determined to be generated from this zzso zzso One is a zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso linkage, and the other is an zzso zzso linked zzso containing a zzso These two novel structures were zzso determined using various techniques including zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing and analysis, and mass zzso The zzso zzso was demonstrated to be zzso to normal zzso in a zzso rat zzso thus showing that formation of zzso in place of this zzso bond does not affect it zzso
