zzso in the active site of human zzso I was changed by zzso zzso into zzso zzso or zzso in order to evaluate its possible role in zzso The zzso I zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso on an zzso affinity zzso The zzso properties of the zzso proteins were similar to those of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited the same high specific activity as zzso zzso I, whereas the zzso and zzso zzso had zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso values of the zzso zzso I determined with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were reduced to between 10 and zzso of the zzso zzso This reduction was due to lower zzso values for the zzso and zzso zzso and a twofold increase in the zzso value for the zzso zzso With the zzso of zzso and zzso the kinetic parameters of the zzso were also of the same magnitude as those of zzso zzso zzso Studies with the competitive zzso zzso and zzso revealed that the affinity was reduced to zzso of the zzso affinity for the zzso and zzso zzso and to zzso for the zzso zzso as measured by a comparison of Ki zzso The results show that zzso has no direct role in zzso but is rather involved in forming the zzso site of human zzso zzso The high activity of the zzso zzso suggests that a structurally equivalent zzso zzso in the zzso half of zzso zzso zzso I may be part of a zzso competent active zzso
