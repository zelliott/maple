zzso zzso infection is an important trigger of zzso syndrome zzso and zzso zzso strains are zzso among zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso resemble human zzso suggesting that molecular mimicry could be important in triggering the neural zzso We assessed the genetic diversity among 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains by analysis of zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso patterns of 12 LOS zzso genes zzso zzso zzso amplification revealed that the size, order, and direction of each zzso gene was identical among all strains zzso However, an additional ORF, located between zzso and zzso was detected in 28 of the 36 zzso zzso and zzso sequence analysis revealed that the gene was identical to zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso An zzso repeat motif was found downstream of the zzso stop zzso and upstream of the zzso stop zzso an organization allowing pairing of repeated sequences that could lead to deletion of the internal zzso zzso of the zzso products with restriction zzso zzso or zzso and cluster analysis of zzso zzso patterns showed that all zzso strains were closely related and distinct from zzso zzso consistent with earlier zzso suggesting that zzso strains represent a highly zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes also may be useful for zzso zzso
