Type I zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso an inhibitor endowed with zzso affinity for zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso human zzso I) zzso (for which we report an improved expression and zzso zzso as well as zzso coli zzso I) zzso Its zzso value of 41 zzso for human zzso is the lowest value ever reported for an inhibitor of zzso zzso a neutral analogue of the reaction intermediate zzso is about 15 times less efficient at zzso both zzso in zzso with the zzso nature of the zzso zzso reaction zzso Using the zzso molecular mechanics, sum of interactions between fragments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structures of the complexes between zzso zzso zzso I) zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and between the zzso and the zzso intermediate analogue inhibitor zzso are zzso Their analysis allows us to identify clearly the nature of each individual active site zzso acid and to formulate a hypothesis for the overall mechanism of the reaction zzso by Type I zzso that is, the zzso and zzso steps, zzso Following zzso zzso of zzso by zzso water and zzso zzso zzso is identified as the probable zzso base involved in zzso transfer between the two carbon atoms C1 and C2 of the zzso zzso zzso
