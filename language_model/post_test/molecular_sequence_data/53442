The zzso and zzso zzso forms of the delta protein zzso and zzso zzso of zzso delta virus zzso differ only in the zzso zzso extension unique to zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso while zzso is needed for particle zzso These proteins share a region at zzso 12 to 60, which mediates zzso interactions essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 1998) reported a crystal structure for a zzso spanning this region which demonstrates an zzso zzso zzso interaction with the potential to form zzso of zzso Our studies tested whether predictions based on this structure could be zzso to conditions where the zzso was replaced by full-length zzso or zzso and when the zzso were not in zzso but in zzso Nine zzso acids that are zzso between several zzso of zzso and predicted to be important in zzso were zzso to zzso on both zzso and zzso We found that the predicted hierarchy of importance of these nine zzso correlated to a significant extent with the observed in zzso effects on the ability of these proteins to zzso support in trans the replication of the zzso zzso when expressed on zzso and zzso act as zzso zzso of replication when expressed on zzso We thus zzso that these biological activities of zzso depend on ordered zzso zzso
