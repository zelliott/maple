zzso is an zzso green zzso zzso which uses reduced sulfur compounds to fix carbon dioxide in the zzso The pathways for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have not been characterized with certainty for any species of zzso However, soluble zzso zzso and zzso c zzso have previously been implicated in the zzso of zzso and zzso on the basis of zzso zzso in zzso We have now made a number of observations relating to the zzso of reduced sulfur zzso zzso Western analysis shows that soluble zzso zzso in zzso zzso is regulated by zzso consistent with a role in the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso (which is normally a soluble protein in other zzso is zzso and not regulated by zzso as expected for an zzso zzso species dependent upon zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso and have found seven other zzso which are also presumably involved in sulfur metabolism and located near that for zzso zzso zzso These include genes for a zzso c zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso four small proteins (including zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso interchange protein zzso zzso zzso We have established that the zzso expressed zzso genes zzso are located elsewhere in the zzso zzso Through a database search, we have found that the eight zzso zzso genes are clustered in the same order in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso zzso gene clusters occur in at least six other bacterial species but may additionally include genes for zzso and zzso zzso
