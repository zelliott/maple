The full extent of genetic diversity among small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arthritis encephalitis viruses zzso and zzso viruses zzso remains zzso This is due in part to the fact that few sequences of zzso are zzso To contribute to this knowledge, zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences from an zzso named zzso originating from a goat from western France were zzso This analysis revealed that this virus is closely related to the zzso and 63 zzso American zzso zzso zzso acids between the zzso virus and zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso 7, and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The differences between the zzso virus and zzso prototypes ranged from zzso zzso and zzso for the protein zzso zzso A screening using a zzso mobility zzso zzso adapted to zzso revealed that 6 of 10 zzso virus field zzso were closely related to zzso indicating that this latter isolate was a zzso of zzso common in the west of zzso zzso trees drawn using CA, zzso or zzso sequences of numerous zzso and rooted with zzso sequences revealed that zzso and zzso zzso all infectious for zzso clustered in one zzso From these zzso and zzso zzso it appears that zzso and French zzso zzso form a zzso that had emerged from a much more diverse group containing all zzso infectious for zzso These zzso zzso form a more ancient group in which the zzso is zzso
