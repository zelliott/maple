We have determined the zzso sequence for the zzso large zzso from four zzso species of zzso zzso open reading frames are present in two species zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the remaining species zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso from species of zzso have few changes in the promoter and zzso binding sites compared to zzso higher zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveal that zzso sequences from zzso plants have regions capable of forming zzso structures, but zzso zzso are deleted upstream of the zzso in the zzso plants compared to their zzso zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have many large and small zzso few zzso are shared in common, zzso that their common zzso probably had an intact zzso reading zzso zzso zzso reading frames in zzso zzso and zzso zzso retain a bias of synonymous over zzso zzso and deduced protein sequences are consistent with potentially functional zzso large zzso zzso A conservative model of random substitution processes in zzso sequences estimates that the probability is low zzso zzso zzso that these sequences would retain an open reading frame by zzso Species of zzso have either had recent zzso ancestors, zzso multiple independent losses of photosynthesis in this zzso or the zzso gene may serve an unknown function in some zzso zzso
