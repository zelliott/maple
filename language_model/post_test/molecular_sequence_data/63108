Using the zzso hybrid zzso primer zzso chain reaction method, 26 new zzso zzso zzso fragments were isolated from a marine zzso sample in the East China Sea zzso and analyzed by construction of a zzso zzso With a zzso zzso gene zzso used as a probe, a partial zzso zzso zzso gene cluster was isolated and identified by zzso screening of a marine zzso sample zzso zzso library constructed for this zzso A new zzso zzso gene was cloned from the zzso gene cluster and zzso expressed as a protein fused to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was used to study the binding of the zzso fusion protein and single AT domain to zzso using zzso and bovine serum zzso as control zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso were calculated and used to analyze the zzso specificity of the zzso We concluded that there are many zzso new zzso gene clusters in marine sediments in the zzso The zzso is presumably an zzso from a new zzso gene zzso
