Using a reverse zzso chain reaction method, a zzso for the complete coding region and part of the zzso region of rat zzso was cloned from rat zzso zzso zzso following the induction of zzso basement membrane zzso zzso The coding region of zzso zzso displays zzso and zzso sequence identity with the coding regions of human and mouse zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat zzso reveals zzso and zzso zzso with the human and mouse zzso zzso Using the rat zzso zzso as a molecular probe, increased production of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso tissue is demonstrated in the first 48 hours of zzso zzso in the zzso The data suggest a role for zzso in the inflammatory response in zzso
