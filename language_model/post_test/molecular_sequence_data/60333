The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have identified a zzso zzso that interacts with zzso which is a member of a new zzso zzso gene zzso zzso lacking zzso display many, but not all, of the zzso of cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso including sterility, multiple stress sensitivity and a zzso zzso zzso is zzso after stress but this is not zzso zzso zzso is not required for zzso of zzso but is required for zzso zzso via its zzso zzso We find that in the absence of zzso zzso appears to zzso to the nucleus but zzso is not fully zzso and becomes unstable in response to environmental zzso zzso is also required for effective zzso via the zzso factor zzso but does not prevent its nuclear zzso Remarkably zzso zzso of zzso with chicken zzso sequences rescue loss of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel component of the zzso zzso zzso
