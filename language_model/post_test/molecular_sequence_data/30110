An extensive series of zzso was reacted with zzso activated zzso C zzso and the resulting zzso zzso complexes were isolated by zzso zzso and characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also served for zzso of the yield of zzso zzso zzso duplex zzso containing a single central zzso gave high yields of zzso between the two zzso while those having zzso instead, gave zzso In another series, the central sequences zzso and zzso both yielded 50% zzso while zzso was completely zzso zzso was conducted also in two steps: zzso zzso zzso by zzso at zzso at either a zzso or zzso sequence were zzso with their complementary strands followed by reductive zzso of the bound zzso to form a zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso while the zzso ones were again zzso These results show zzso that the zzso zzso is absolutely specific to the zzso duplex zzso confirming our previous finding zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Volume zzso DNA and Its Drug zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso Press, zzso zzso Evidence is presented that this specificity is due to the specific orientation of the zzso attached zzso in the minor zzso zzso on the zzso requirement, a zzso sequence preference was observed at zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso atom of zzso is more zzso toward the drug than that of zzso due to the favorable effect of the negative zzso of the zzso of the zzso on the zzso in zzso zzso was more zzso than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
