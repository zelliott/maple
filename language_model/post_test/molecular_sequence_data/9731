The zzso protein zzso of the human zzso virus zzso type 1 is important for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso acting as a primer during reverse zzso of zzso zzso A wild type zzso and a zzso zzso having a disrupted zinc finger were analyzed with far zzso circular zzso zzso CD data analysis revealed that zzso has a high content of extended structures in zzso zzso decreasing in zzso zzso and in zzso in the absence of zzso An increase in zzso structures is observed in zzso bound to zzso Furthermore, CD data shows that zzso zzso binds zzso The CD spectrum of zzso is typical of an zzso zzso and retains this structure after binding of zzso which demonstrates that zzso does not induce zzso zzso CD zzso of zzso were measured from 5 to 80 degrees C to observe CD changes resulting from zzso zzso zzso modeling of the complex identifies two potential zzso zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso region and first zinc zzso In this model, both binding sites can interact with 12 zzso in the zzso domain without requiring a base zzso
