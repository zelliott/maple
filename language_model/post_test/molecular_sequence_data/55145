zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso methods have been widely explored for DNA zzso We report here the design, zzso and evaluation of a novel set of chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso for the DNA zzso extension reaction and its application in DNA sequencing by mass zzso zzso These zzso zzso have a zzso zzso attached to the 5 position of the zzso zzso and zzso or the 7 position of the zzso (A and zzso via a chemically zzso zzso zzso with different length zzso arms serving as mass tags that contribute to large mass differences among the zzso We demonstrate that these modified zzso are efficiently incorporated by DNA zzso and the DNA strand bearing zzso zzso is captured by zzso beads and efficiently released using zzso in zzso solution, which is compatible with DNA and downstream zzso We performed zzso sequencing reactions using these zzso to generate DNA fragments for zzso zzso zzso Both synthetic DNA and zzso chain reaction zzso products were accurately zzso and a read length of approximately 37 bases was achieved using these zzso in zzso zzso
