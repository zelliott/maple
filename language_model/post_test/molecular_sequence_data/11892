zzso zzso with zzso or human zzso to outer surface protein A zzso can protect mice against zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso during natural infection in mice or humans are unable to clear the zzso from the infected zzso To examine zzso binding by zzso during the course of human infection, we amplified the zzso zzso full-length zzso and zzso from zzso zzso of a patient with chronic zzso arthritis, the first such zzso from human material, at four separate time points over zzso zzso and expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso that passively protected mice from infection did not bind one of the expressed zzso because of a deletion in zzso that resulted in a frame shift and premature stop zzso near the zzso zzso However, expressed zzso from a later zzso fluid sample did not contain this zzso Thus, although altered forms of zzso which potentially can influence host immune effectiveness, do occur in the human host, they cannot be the only factors responsible for microbial zzso
