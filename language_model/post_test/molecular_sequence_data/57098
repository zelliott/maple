zzso is a zzso zzso that is believed to function in regulated zzso A zzso zzso protein zzso and a zzso zzso releasing factor zzso specific for zzso have recently been zzso In this study we have described the zzso activities of zzso zzso in zzso 31, 81, zzso and zzso which zzso to zzso 12, 61, zzso and 146 in zzso The results demonstrate that simple extrapolations from the properties of Ras zzso are not valid for all small zzso zzso and zzso had a reduced zzso zzso activity, but surprisingly were sensitive to the effects of zzso and insensitive to zzso zzso and zzso zzso that were bound to a zzso zzso analog had similar affinities for zzso In zzso the percent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso interact with zzso different from those of previously described zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso had increased intrinsic zzso rates for zzso However, the zzso rate for zzso was zzso zzso higher than that for zzso suggesting that, in zzso of the two, zzso would more likely be zzso in the zzso zzso
