zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso distinctly known as phase II zzso zzso zzso play a significant role in cellular defense against toxicity and have been identified in nearly all organisms studied to date, from bacteria to zzso In this study, we have identified a full-length zzso of the zzso class zzso from zzso zzso zzso an important commercial edible zzso zzso zzso was cloned and the zzso protein zzso in order to study its zzso characteristics and determine its zzso zzso The zzso comprised an zzso of zzso zzso zzso 231 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 27 zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso possessed characteristic zzso zzso of the zzso family, Class zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Super family zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso linked with other zzso class zzso The zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli zzso cells and the zzso zzso showed high activity with zzso zzso like zzso and zzso zzso dependent zzso activity of zzso investigated with zzso zzso as zzso affirmed the zzso property of zzso By quantitative zzso zzso was found to be zzso expressed in all zzso zzso with the highest levels occurring in zzso zzso and zzso Since zzso may act as zzso zzso to mediate immune defense, the effects of pathogen associated molecular pattern, zzso and intact zzso zzso bacteria challenge on zzso gene zzso were zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression changes induced by immune challenges were similar to those of the zzso defense zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the first zzso zzso class zzso reported, and its zzso role in zzso clam may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for protecting this important aquaculture zzso
