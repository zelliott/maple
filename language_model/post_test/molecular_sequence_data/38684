Three classes of zzso represented by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to exist in zzso form in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso clones derived from reverse zzso chain reaction protocols used to select zzso zzso revealed that, at least for the zzso and zzso there are three apparent types of zzso In the first case, the zzso tail is added at or near the mature 3' end, even when this follows a strong secondary zzso In the second case, the tail is added to zzso or zzso suggesting a possible competition between zzso and zzso zzso Finally, in all cases, the zzso tail can be added internally, possibly as a part of an zzso zzso The tails found in zzso zzso differ from those of spinach zzso in zzso content, being nearly zzso zzso zzso versus zzso in spinach, and are similar in length to those of zzso coli, being mostly between 20 and 50 zzso In zzso zzso using a zzso zzso protein extract showed that a 3' end zzso tail was sufficient to stimulate rapid degradation of zzso zzso in zzso with a lesser effect for zzso and only minor effects on zzso We therefore propose that zzso contributes to zzso degradation in zzso zzso but that its effect may zzso
