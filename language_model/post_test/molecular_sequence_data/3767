Regulatory DNA from the zzso gene zzso causes zzso of a linked reporter gene zzso in transgenic zzso This zzso is strengthened in flies zzso for the zzso and has been called zzso zzso The zzso zzso activities of a large zzso zzso zzso and a small zzso zzso zzso were zzso Since zzso zzso is often associated with zzso group response elements zzso we tested the activities of each of these zzso fragments in a construct designed to detect zzso activity in zzso Both fragments were found to behave as zzso in a zzso reporter zzso while the larger zzso showed additional zzso zzso Using the zzso reporter zzso a zzso minimal zzso element zzso was zzso DNA zzso zzso using zzso nuclear extracts suggested that there are eight zzso sites within this zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that at least five of these sites are important for zzso zzso One of the required sites is for the zzso group protein zzso and another is zzso a sequence bound by the proteins zzso factor and zzso The identity of the other proteins is zzso These data suggest a surprising degree of complexity in the zzso proteins required for zzso zzso
