zzso 2 zzso is a distinctive member of the family of zzso zzso recognized mostly by their abilities to catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso zzso uniquely binds and zzso zzso binding zzso zzso its zzso activity but allows it to function in signal zzso zzso the zzso zzso The core domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso comprises the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain zzso zzso and contains almost all of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso point zzso at zzso positions 180, zzso zzso zzso and 337 showed that, upon binding zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was the weakest zzso less than wild zzso in resonance energy transfer from the protein zzso zzso zzso 290 zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and had a reduced affinity for zzso zzso situated near the zzso center and the zzso area of zzso may be part of the zzso relay machinery that zzso negative zzso signals from zzso binding to the active center of zzso A most important observation was that, whereas no zzso activity could be detected when zzso was replaced with Ala or zzso partial preservation of zzso activity was seen with zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is essential for zzso possibly by stabilizing the transition states by zzso zzso or van der zzso zzso This contrasts with the zzso related zzso family of zzso zzso which uses zzso zzso for stabilizing the transition zzso
