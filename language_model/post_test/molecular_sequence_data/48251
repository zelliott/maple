zzso zzso zzso virus types 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso are associated with a zzso skin zzso on zzso that appears and zzso zzso We have determined the complete zzso sequences and zzso profiles of these zzso zzso and zzso are large, complex zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso respectively, that are closely related to one another and to zzso zzso zzso virus zzso These zzso zzso contain three open reading zzso zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are adjacent to one another and located downstream of zzso The zzso proteins were previously identified as zzso D zzso that may contribute to the induction of cell proliferation leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence analysis of zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso proteins are zzso related to the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso arose by gene zzso zzso that the precursor of zzso and zzso was derived from a cellular zzso these genes are the first accessory genes of complex zzso that can be traced to a cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the only zzso that have an open reading frame, zzso of considerable size zzso 130 zzso zzso in the leader region preceding zzso While we were unable to predict a function for the zzso zzso they are more zzso than zzso and zzso suggesting that they may be biologically important to the zzso The zzso profiles of zzso and zzso were also similar to that of zzso Northern zzso analyses detected only low levels of the zzso transcripts in developing zzso whereas abundant levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were detected in zzso zzso The zzso donors and zzso of individual transcripts were identified by reverse zzso zzso The similarities of zzso zzso and zzso suggest that these viruses use similar strategies of viral replication and induce cell proliferation by a similar zzso
