zzso decrease type I zzso synthesis by decreasing the steady state levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present studies were undertaken to determine the functional sequences of the pro alpha zzso collagen gene required for the zzso decrease of type I zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso were zzso zzso with the zzso DNA zzso construct containing the zzso zzso region zzso from zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of the mouse alpha zzso collagen zzso zzso treatment of these zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso activity which agrees with the zzso decrease of the steady state levels of type I zzso zzso To determine the possible role of the first zzso zzso in the zzso decrease of zzso activity, zzso a zzso zzso containing the first zzso zzso and the zzso early promoter, was zzso into mouse zzso and treated with zzso No significant decrease in zzso activity was zzso The zzso response was then localized within the zzso zzso region by preparing a series of zzso containing internal deletions and zzso these plasmids into mouse zzso The regions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso were required for the zzso response of gene zzso However, the DNA stretch from zzso to zzso was zzso Analysis of the DNA sequences of these regions revealed a single zzso at zzso to zzso and a modified zzso at zzso to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
