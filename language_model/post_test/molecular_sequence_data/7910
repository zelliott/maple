Numerous synaptic zzso including several integral membrane zzso have been assigned roles in synaptic zzso fusion with or retrieval from the zzso plasma zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso associated with the zzso surface of synaptic zzso appear to play a much broader role, being involved in the regulation of neurotransmitter release and in the organization of the nerve zzso Here we have administered zzso zzso II zzso to zzso zzso zzso either before the onset of zzso or 1 week after the onset of zzso In both cases, zzso II was no longer zzso within zzso h of zzso After 5 days of treatment, cultures were analyzed for the presence of zzso by zzso I and zzso zzso labeling and by electron zzso zzso in which zzso II was suppressed after zzso zzso but before zzso formation, did not develop zzso zzso in which zzso II was suppressed after the development of zzso lost most of their zzso zzso with the removal of the zzso zzso zzso and their synaptic connections zzso These studies lead us to conclude that zzso II is involved in the formation and maintenance of zzso in zzso zzso
