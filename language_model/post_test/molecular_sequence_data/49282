To understand molecular mechanism of zzso two zzso zzso and zzso were found from zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene related to dense fiber protein of outer membrane of the human zzso and mouse zzso gene zzso The gap was filled by zzso chain reaction, and a zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso zzso was named zzso zzso and zzso related gene 4 zzso zzso number zzso Its opening reading frame was zzso zzso as was proved by zzso in human zzso zzso gene was located in zzso and the putative protein was zzso zzso acid with a theoretical molecular weight of 43 zzso and zzso point of zzso The zzso of zzso acid sequences were zzso between zzso and zzso gene and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso is expressed in a wide range of adult zzso including zzso whereas the zzso mouse zzso gene zzso is expressed specifically in the zzso
