The zzso of four insect zzso hormones has been analyzed zzso using secondary structure prediction routines and comparison with structures in the Brookhaven zzso zzso Based on this analysis, a common zzso zzso zzso zzso had a high probability of forming an zzso zzso zzso zzso studies found that addition of zzso zzso to an zzso solution of the zzso zzso zzso a change from random zzso to zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso produced zzso values and zzso zzso zzso confirming a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first five zzso zzso to zzso were all zzso or zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso values zzso zzso were observed between V2 and zzso and zzso and zzso The longer fragments zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in water alone, both containing the zzso sequence of the locust zzso zzso zzso hormone, maintained the zzso as determined by CD zzso However, the remaining 20 zzso of the locust zzso hormone did not maintain the same amount of zzso in water and all of the truncated fragments were not biologically zzso
