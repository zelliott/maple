To evaluate the rapid detection of various forms of zzso B cell zzso by using the zzso chain reaction zzso to identify zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso 

Thirty four B cell zzso defined by zzso zzso and positive zzso heavy chain gene zzso detected by Southern zzso analysis were zzso An additional 22 cases representing zzso zzso and zzso disorders were also zzso 

zzso zzso were identified in 19 zzso cases of B cell zzso The method was less sensitive in the detection of zzso zzso cell zzso (15 of 28, or zzso than zzso zzso cell zzso (four of six, or zzso zzso zzso was not identified in 19 control cases, including T cell zzso Hodgkin's disease, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Three cases showed positive zzso gene zzso by zzso but were negative on Southern zzso Two of these cases had zzso clinical, zzso and zzso evidence of zzso B cell proliferation suggesting that zzso could, on occasion, pick up cases missed by Southern zzso and that the two methods are complementary in zzso zzso disease zzso The third case represented a zzso zzso zzso reaction involving a zzso zzso 

zzso analysis, using the primer sequences outlined in this study, will detect about zzso of zzso zzso zzso with increased sensitivity for zzso zzso cell zzso With these levels of detection in mind, this testing strategy can still be especially useful in cases which prove zzso problematic with standard zzso and zzso analysis, and in instances where the quantity and type of diagnostic material is limiting zzso zzso and cellular zzso
