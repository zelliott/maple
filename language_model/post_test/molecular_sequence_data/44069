zzso analysis of a zzso protein from the zzso zzso reveals that it is zzso to the zzso zzso protein zzso which is a candidate for one of the zzso products that cause the extreme transmission ratio distortion zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is extracted from the zzso with zzso M zzso and zzso with the outer zzso arm in zzso density zzso This protein also is specifically missing in zzso prepared from a zzso that does not assemble the outer zzso These data raise the possibility that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso Combined with the recent identification of zzso (another zzso zzso as a light chain of zzso zzso these results lead to a zzso model for how differential defects in zzso that result in the phenomenon of zzso drive might be generated in zzso vs zzso zzso
