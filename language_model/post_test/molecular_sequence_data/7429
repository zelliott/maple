zzso zzso chain reaction zzso products of the partial sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene from 10 zzso species were zzso and zzso These products contained the zzso three zzso of zzso 4 and whole sequences of zzso zzso They varied extensively in length due to the differences in length of zzso zzso A total of 10 long insertions were flanked by direct repeats of 5 to 12 zzso zzso indicating inserted zzso These inserted elements were classified into the following five categories based on zzso sequence characteristics and zzso zzso a region zzso to that of zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso structure at the 3' zzso short zzso elements zzso in animals, zzso a sequence of 280 zzso with no characteristic features, zzso a sequence of 125 zzso with no characteristic features, zzso zzso of 11 zzso zzso repeats flanked by 5 zzso sequence of direct repeats characteristics of a zzso
