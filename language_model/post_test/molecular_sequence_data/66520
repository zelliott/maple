While genes zzso zzso and other highly zzso proteins are commonly found in zzso it is unusual to find a small family of zzso genes in these zzso We found that in the species zzso zzso only, a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has expanded into a family of duplicated genes mainly located in the zzso of the zzso We identified the putative parent of the duplicated family by analysis of zzso and zzso relative to other zzso zzso zzso All ten zzso zzso are transcribed in zzso stages of laboratory and field zzso We identified and confirmed a recent double gene conversion event involving zzso genes on three different zzso of isolate zzso resulting in the creation of a new hybrid zzso Southern zzso analysis of geographically diverse zzso zzso zzso provides evidence for the zzso global conservation of the zzso gene family, but also for some zzso events, including deletion and zzso involving the duplicated zzso We found a dramatically higher rate of zzso zzso per zzso site than synonymous zzso per synonymous site in the closely related zzso zzso we zzso suggesting that these genes are under a form of selection that favors change in the state of the zzso We also found that the gene zzso zzso binding protein has expanded and diversified in zzso zzso We have described a new class of zzso gene family with a unique capacity for diversity in zzso zzso
