Regulatory motifs describe sets of related zzso factor binding sites zzso and can be represented as position frequency zzso zzso De zzso identification of zzso is a crucial problem in zzso biology which includes the issue of comparing putative motifs with one another and with motifs that are already zzso The relative importance of each zzso within a given position in the zzso should be considered in order to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, biological data are inherently noisy and zzso zzso set theory is particularly suitable for modeling imprecise data, whereas fuzzy zzso are highly appropriate for representing the interaction among different information zzso 

We propose zzso a new similarity measure between zzso based on the fuzzy integral of the distance of the zzso with respect to the information content of the zzso Unlike existing methods, zzso is designed to consider the higher contribution of better zzso positions to the binding zzso zzso provides excellent results when dealing with sets of randomly generated zzso and zzso the remaining methods when handling real zzso of related zzso Furthermore, we propose a new cluster methodology based on kernel theory together with zzso to obtain groups of related motifs potentially bound by the same zzso providing more robust results than existing zzso 

zzso zzso a design flaw of the most popular methods, whose measures zzso similarity of low information content zzso We use our measure to successfully identify motifs that describe binding sites for the same zzso and to solve real-life zzso In this study the reliability of fuzzy technology for motif comparison tasks is zzso
