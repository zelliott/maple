Ebola virus zzso belongs to the zzso family of viruses that causes severe and fatal zzso zzso zzso by zzso involves fusion between the virus and host cell zzso zzso by the envelope zzso zzso of the zzso Similar to the envelope zzso of other zzso the central feature of the zzso zzso zzso structure is a zzso bundle formed by the zzso zzso and zzso repeat regions zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this zzso bundle provides the energetic driving force for membrane zzso in other zzso designed agents that disrupt formation of the zzso bundle act as potent fusion zzso To interrogate zzso of zzso zzso membrane fusion, we designed model proteins that consist of the zzso and zzso segments linked by short protein zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso studies indicate that these proteins adopt stable zzso folds consistent with zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso bundle is highly stable at pH zzso zzso temperature, zzso , of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso , of zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparable in stability to other viral membrane fusion zzso zzso We found that the stability of our designed zzso bundle proteins was dependent on zzso conditions with increasing stability at lower zzso Small pH differences zzso had dramatic effects zzso zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism for zzso control that is dependent on environmental zzso These results suggest a role for low pH in stabilizing zzso bundle formation during the process of zzso viral membrane zzso
