zzso delta virus zzso is a circular zzso zzso pathogen whose zzso form results from zzso Although studies have examined minimal zzso zzso activities, the mechanism for forming the circular virus remains zzso and the trans zzso properties of zzso forms of zzso zzso have not been zzso In addition, zzso zzso have not previously been engineered to cleave a zzso zzso 

Long repeating zzso have been produced from in zzso zzso zzso of synthetic circular zzso zzso zzso active zzso of the entire zzso zzso zzso Like full-length zzso these zzso zzso undergo zzso to zzso zzso importantly, zzso is found to occur zzso but only in the presence of the circular zzso Linear and circular zzso zzso and engineered zzso are shown to be active in zzso zzso and zzso zzso targets in zzso despite having zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso replication zzso for zzso replication has led to a new proposal for zzso of zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso is zzso by the complementary circular zzso In addition, it has been shown that zzso zzso zzso can be zzso active in trans despite the presence of zzso sequences built into their zzso
