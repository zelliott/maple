Members of the zzso zzso candidate class zzso have predominantly been found at sites of zzso zzso iron zzso in marine environments around the Pacific zzso zzso full-length zzso and 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences from five novel clone libraries, one novel zzso zzso and the zzso database were analyzed to assess the zzso of this burgeoning class of the zzso and to investigate its zzso between three major sampling regions in the Pacific zzso zzso zzso the Southern zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were grouped into operational zzso units zzso on the basis of a zzso minimum zzso Of the 28 zzso zzso 13 were found to be endemic to one of the three main sampling regions and 2 were ubiquitous throughout the Pacific zzso Additionally, two deeply rooted zzso that potentially dominate communities of iron zzso originating in the deep subsurface were zzso zzso zzso analysis and analysis of molecular zzso zzso showed that geographic distance played a significant role in the distribution of zzso zzso whereas environmental zzso such as temperature, zzso or total zzso zzso did not have a significant zzso These results, detected using the coarse resolution of the zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso have a strong zzso zzso
