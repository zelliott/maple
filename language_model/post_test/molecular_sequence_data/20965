zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The reaction zzso by zzso is the first committed step in the synthesis of zzso sugar chains and provides a link between zzso metabolism and zzso In this study, the zzso gene was identified to zzso zzso in the human zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli revealed that this zzso mainly zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and that its binding affinity for zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso but different to those of zzso from bacteria or zzso Loss of zzso was lethal unless Man was provided in the growth zzso However, a zzso zzso cell showed a significantly reduced growth rate at a high concentration of zzso zzso analysis revealed that both inadequate and replete Man led to an zzso of zzso zzso and a reduction in the amount of zzso in the cell zzso zzso of the link between energy production and zzso by deletion of the zzso gene led to zzso such as defects in cell wall integrity, abnormal zzso and reduced zzso Our results reveal that zzso activity is essential for viability and plays a central regulatory role in both cell wall synthesis and energy production in zzso zzso
