zzso of zzso zzso were recovered after zzso selection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was further characterized and shown to have ice nucleation activity zzso a property that allows the zzso of ice at temperatures close to the melting point, effectively preventing the zzso of zzso zzso was zzso detected after zzso at temperatures consistent with zzso zzso The sequence zzso the zzso zzso ice nucleation protein zzso was obtained using both zzso and zzso zzso When expressed in zzso coli, the resulting zzso zzso had zzso The zzso zzso zzso dubbed zzso is clearly related to previously cloned zzso zzso but it shows greater zzso zzso analysis suggests that there are two opposite flat surfaces, one relatively zzso that likely serves as an ice template, and the other that could function as a complementary face to facilitate zzso interaction for zzso zzso
