zzso cell zzso molecules zzso play crucial roles in the formation, zzso and plasticity of functional zzso zzso We report here a molecular cloning of a novel zzso zzso zzso is a member of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with six zzso zzso four zzso type zzso repeats, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein had a zzso zzso activity when used as a zzso for zzso in zzso To survey the spatial expression pattern of zzso in comparison with other zzso zzso members, an in zzso zzso analysis was performed in adult and developing rat brain sections with zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The four zzso transcripts displayed cell zzso expression patterns with overlapping and distinct zzso In adult zzso for example, we observed zzso zzso specifically in zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso highly in the zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso zzso cells, and F3 zzso in zzso in all of these zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and F3 may play important roles in the formation and maintenance of specific zzso networks in the zzso
