zzso genes are highly zzso zzso identity genes well known for their complex expression patterns and divergent zzso Here we present an analysis of zzso elements in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which is expressed in multiple zzso in the zzso region of the zzso We have zzso zzso zzso to efficiently identify zzso elements and have characterized these with zzso reporters and zzso rescue zzso We have found that the complex expression pattern of zzso is the cumulative result of the activities of multiple tissue or local zzso zzso sequences that are zzso both in sequence and near-perfect order in the related zzso zzso zzso Two zzso regulatory blocks analyzed in detail contain multiple sites for both positively and zzso acting zzso One of these regions may promote zzso of zzso in certain cells via the zzso zzso zzso acting regions are zzso in inappropriate zzso by additional negative pathways acting at other sites within the zzso Our analysis has allowed us to zzso several new regulatory factors significant to the control of zzso zzso
