Using a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids, we have previously mapped the gene zzso previously called zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso half of the long arm of human zzso 12, region zzso To obtain a zzso probe useful for zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis we screened a human zzso zzso library and isolated a zzso zzso zzso which by restriction zzso and sequence analyses was shown to contain zzso zzso of zzso and approximately zzso upstream zzso We now report the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso based on two color FISH analysis employing this zzso
