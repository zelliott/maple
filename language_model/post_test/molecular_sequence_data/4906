We have cloned and characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso This zzso belongs to the gene family of intermediate filaments and it is a component of the zzso of zzso zzso Gene expression analysis during embryonic development and at adult stages presented here revealed that zzso zzso is inherited zzso and that it is present in the zzso the zzso and in the zzso stage zzso After mid zzso transition this gene is expressed in all surface cells, notably in those of the enveloping layer zzso and of the zzso as well as in a zzso of the deep cells zzso presumed to be zzso zzso During later embryonic stage zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the developing zzso zzso In adult zzso the zzso gene is not only expressed in simple zzso such as the zzso zzso but also, in contrast to other zzso it is present in zzso skin and differentiated zzso These observations suggest that the zzso gene is an appropriate zzso marker during zzso zzso
