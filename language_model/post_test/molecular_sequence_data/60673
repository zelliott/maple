The zzso cadmium factor zzso is a zzso protein involved in resistance to zzso and to zzso zzso zzso precursors in zzso It belongs to the zzso of zzso binding cassette zzso which includes the human zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator and the zzso zzso zzso To examine the functional significance of zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso we performed an extensive zzso zzso Twenty-two single zzso acid zzso or deletions were generated by zzso zzso in the zzso binding zzso the proposed regulatory domain, and the fourth zzso zzso zzso were analyzed zzso by measuring their ability to grow in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso proteins were examined by zzso in zzso zzso For functional characterization of the zzso zzso the kinetic parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso transport were zzso Our analysis shows that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso Five other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso function, and two zzso zzso and zzso are unnecessary for zzso zzso and zzso We also identify several regulatory domain zzso in which zzso tolerance of the zzso strain and transport activity of the protein are zzso
