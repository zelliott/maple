The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso proteins subjected to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso This leads to release of soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso region identified similar zzso sequences in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso sequence is situated next to the previously established zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the sequences harbor essential information for efficient zzso of the two proteins upon zzso zzso This was further evidenced by analysis of mouse zzso that, like zzso in other zzso does not contain the zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso Mouse zzso resisted zzso and zzso zzso zzso and ex zzso analysis of zzso of the zzso sequence in mouse zzso revealed a zzso shedding comparable with that of human zzso In conclusion, we have identified an essential zzso motif for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In addition, the present data indicate that zzso by incorporation of this motif in late evolution, underwent a modification that allows for an instant zzso of surface zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso This regulatory zzso seems to have coincided with the evolution of an enhanced zzso role of the zzso system in zzso
