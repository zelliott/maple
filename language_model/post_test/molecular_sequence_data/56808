The insulin zzso zzso region zzso located zzso zzso upstream of the human insulin zzso is composed of tandem repeats of the consensus sequence zzso It has previously been shown that an insulin gene zzso containing the zzso adopts an altered DNA structure in zzso Furthermore, zzso containing the consensus repeat sequence exhibit multiple zzso DNA zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether such altered DNA structures existed within the zzso when the insulin gene was assembled into zzso in zzso zzso assembly was achieved using zzso and an extract from zzso eggs from zzso zzso The presence of altered DNA zzso within the zzso region of the human insulin gene was investigated using the structural probe zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized multiple distinct sites in the zzso zzso region of the human insulin gene in naked zzso Most of these sites disappeared when the zzso zzso DNA was treated with zzso and zzso egg zzso In the assembled DNA, the zzso appeared as the major site of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the multiple zzso sites within the zzso showed a pattern characteristic of zzso zzso structures similar to those that have been observed for zzso zzso
