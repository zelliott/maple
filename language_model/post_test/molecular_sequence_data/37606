We isolated a quail class III zzso domain zzso zzso which was cloned from a zzso library of zzso zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso was expressed in developing central nervous system and adult zzso Moreover, zzso transcripts showed a dynamic distribution in embryonic central nervous zzso Its transcripts were zzso detected in the zzso zone of the developing brain and spinal cord, but rarely in the differentiated region of mantle zone as well as the zzso roof plate and floor zzso This suggests that zzso is involved in proliferation and differentiation of the zzso cells of quail central nervous zzso
