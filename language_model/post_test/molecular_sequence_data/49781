In previously published studies, zzso zzso zzso protein expression systems have been employed to express the malaria zzso zzso zzso a candidate zzso vaccine zzso against zzso zzso zzso However, despite having been in two Phase 1 trials, the zzso zzso so produced zzso called zzso exists as a mixture of two zzso protein zzso forms, zzso and zzso In this study, we zzso the expression and zzso of the two zzso zzso in zzso zzso and characterized their zzso and zzso properties, zzso and zzso zzso zzso is apparently zzso and has the correct zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso It is, however, expressed at a low yield of only zzso By contrast, zzso is produced as a zzso population of molecules that do not seem to have the correct zzso Nonetheless, both forms appear equally effective in their ability to produce zzso zzso in zzso To address the low yield seen with zzso zzso we also expressed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is apparently superior to zzso zzso in producing higher yield, zzso more zzso biologically more active zzso
