The novel mouse zzso zzso protein zzso D zzso is activated in intact Swiss zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth factors via a zzso mechanism requiring protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso comparison of the zzso zzso domain with other zzso reveals a close similarity with zzso family zzso which are activated upon zzso of key zzso and zzso zzso in a region termed the zzso zzso To study the regulation of zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso in which putative zzso loop zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to either zzso or zzso acid into zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso prevented zzso of the zzso zzso form upon zzso zzso treatment of cells, whereas replacement with zzso acid results in full zzso zzso Single zzso to zzso acid replacement zzso were partially zzso In zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso mapping of zzso and zzso inactive zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso or at both zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso could be selectively eliminated from patterns observed as a result of these zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso also prevented the appearance of zzso spots zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso becomes activated in zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso These results support our view of zzso as an important zzso in zzso signal zzso
