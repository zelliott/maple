Although many cancer vaccines have been developed against zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso to their shared zzso expression properties, studies about their expression and functions are relatively zzso In the present study, we first identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family B zzso Mouse zzso is also expressed in zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and its expression in zzso is zzso zzso is expressed in many zzso cell lines, and DNA zzso and zzso zzso mediate the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also show that mouse zzso encodes a zzso protein which is predominantly localized in the zzso In zzso the zzso zzso protein is mainly expressed in zzso zzso and primary and secondary zzso but less so in zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso the growth of zzso cells and zzso zzso which zzso with increased levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of the present study thus uncover an important phenomenon that the expression of certain zzso zzso zzso at least for zzso is zzso Although they can regulate various zzso zzso of cancer cells, it is necessary to study further their expression pattern in normal zzso before using them to develop more effective and safer cancer zzso
