zzso compose a zzso family coding for a zzso of zzso zzso which are involved in the processing of zzso zzso Two rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 7) and zzso have been cloned and their sequences zzso zzso is approximately zzso bases in length and consists of five zzso and four zzso The zzso end region contains the zzso zzso box and zzso zzso the 3' end region contains the zzso signal zzso This gene encodes a putative zzso zzso of 261 zzso acids zzso The active zzso consists of 237 zzso and is preceded by a deduced signal zzso of 18 zzso and a zzso of 6 zzso zzso is highly zzso to zzso in terms of its sequence and zzso it encodes a zzso zzso consisting of a signal zzso of 18 zzso a zzso of 6 zzso and an active zzso of 235 zzso zzso comparisons of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso reveal the key zzso acid zzso needed for both zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso specificity at basic zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses using specific zzso zzso demonstrate that, among the 12 zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the rat kidney and zzso zzso zzso of male rats results in a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be restored to the normal level by treatment with zzso or zzso On the other hand, neither zzso nor hormonal manipulation affects zzso zzso levels in the zzso
