An zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso protein zzso zzso was obtained by means of differential reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The full-length clone zzso was isolated from a zzso library constructed using zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This clone contained the 11 zzso zzso present in all zzso and a highly zzso domain in the zzso By expressing zzso in zzso coli as a His tag fusion zzso we obtained direct zzso evidence supporting zzso zzso activity of this zzso The expression of zzso increased after zzso treatment or warm zzso when seeds are maintained zzso but decreased and tended to disappear when dormancy was released by zzso or under zzso acid zzso treatment, and when seeds were artificially zzso Further, zzso transcript expression is tissue specific, and was found to accumulate in zzso seeds rather than in other zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the expression of the corresponding protein could be more closely related with the maintenance of seed dormancy than with responses to drought stress zzso by zzso
