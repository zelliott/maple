zzso defined by variation in the outer membrane protein zzso are an integral part of the characterization scheme for zzso zzso Identification of these zzso remains important as the zzso protein is a major zzso component of several zzso vaccines under development, and characteristics of zzso are used to provide detailed zzso zzso Historically, zzso have been defined by zzso with a set of zzso zzso However, zzso sequence analyses of zzso genes have established that the panel of zzso zzso zzso is not zzso and many zzso zzso cannot be zzso In addition, the nomenclature system used to define zzso is zzso We examined all available zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso regions to identify and define zzso zzso A revised nomenclature zzso compatible with the previous zzso nomenclature zzso was zzso A zzso database describing this nomenclature and its relationship to previous schemes was established (available zzso zzso
