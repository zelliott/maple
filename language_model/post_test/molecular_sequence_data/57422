In previous studies aimed at the sequencing of peptides and proteins from the zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso to a zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso and subsequently zzso it to form a shortened zzso capable of further degradation and an zzso acid zzso which can be identified by zzso zzso Current limitations to this chemistry include an inability to zzso zzso and low yields with zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso et zzso zzso In an attempt to solve some of these problems, we have investigated the use of zzso other than zzso zzso for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to peptides activated by the zzso zzso formed the expected zzso but in addition formed a zzso chemically modified at the zzso which was blocked to zzso sequence zzso This zzso was not obtained when either zzso zzso or zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso of this zzso was found to require the presence of an zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a new zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso were all found to be capable of forming this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso modified zzso acid revealed it to be a zzso zzso zzso of this zzso blocked zzso could be minimized by the use of the zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso and by performing the reaction at a temperature of 50 degrees C or zzso The zzso zzso offer potential advantages over the use of zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These include: milder reaction conditions, faster reaction times, and the ability to sequence through zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to be comparable to zzso for formation of zzso
