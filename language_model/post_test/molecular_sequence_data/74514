The zzso family of zzso factors play a critical role in regulating expression of genes that control cell fate, including the small heat shock protein zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso and zzso and zzso expression in the developing zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected from embryonic days zzso zzso in the mouse heart, with significant increases seen later during zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso of each protein were detected during zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein were localized by zzso to the zzso zzso valve cushions and zzso zzso tract zzso zzso and cardiac zzso By zzso zzso was also zzso to the zzso and compact zzso zzso An increase in expression of the long zzso zzso between zzso and adult coincided with a decrease in expression of zzso and a marked increase in expression of zzso Hearts from zzso mice displayed a partially zzso zzso marked by zzso of the zzso cushions and zzso valve leaflets and zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso was correlated with a zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso but no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso demonstrated that both zzso and zzso activate the zzso promoter via a consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors may play an important role in the development and maintenance of critical cell types and structures within the heart, in part via zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso may be necessary for correct valve and zzso zzso and zzso
