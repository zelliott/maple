Two zzso human leukemia syndromes are severe zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso in the gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and familial zzso disorder with acute zzso leukemia zzso caused by zzso in the gene zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso factor alpha zzso In mice, zzso regulates the expression of zzso suggesting a common link for both zzso However, zzso mouse models have failed to reproduce either human disease, thus prohibiting further in zzso studies in zzso Here we investigate zzso regulation of the human zzso promoter, taking advantage of bone zzso obtained from patients with either zzso In particular, we have identified novel zzso promoter zzso zzso C to zzso within a potential motif for zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso motif lies adjacent to a potential zzso binding site that is in a different position in human compared with mouse zzso We find that zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the high mobility group domain of zzso interacts with the zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso transcript levels are zzso in bone zzso of an zzso patient with the zzso C to A zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso domain, found in a patient with familial zzso disorder with zzso fails to stimulate the zzso promoter in zzso and bone zzso zzso demonstrates reduced zzso zzso Observations in these complementary patients indicate that zzso zzso with zzso to activate zzso in zzso and also suggest the possibility that zzso promoter zzso can contribute to zzso Two zzso zzso predisposition syndromes may therefore intersect via zzso potentially linking them to more generalized cancer zzso
