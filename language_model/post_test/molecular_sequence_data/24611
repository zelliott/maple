zzso and zzso are zzso of a zzso zzso protein that differ in their zzso end and were each identified by binding to human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also bind and zzso the function of the zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso Both proteins increase long terminal repeat expression in human and zzso cells, and their gene has been mapped to human zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized the complete zzso gene zzso zzso coding for the two zzso zzso Two adjacent promoters initiate zzso of alternative first zzso for zzso and zzso zzso that are spliced onto common downstream zzso zzso zzso and translation start sites are localized within the first zzso of zzso zzso promoters are zzso but have zzso boxes, a zzso island, and several potential binding sites for zzso zzso zzso deletion analysis identified two regions from position zzso to zzso for zzso and from position zzso to zzso for zzso that are important for promoter zzso zzso promoter activity was expressed at a higher level compared with zzso zzso In addition, a specific zzso of zzso and zzso promoter activity was identified in human zzso cell line zzso compared with zzso zzso This minimal zzso promoter activity may account for minimal zzso replication in zzso
