zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso 167 cells zzso the multiple zzso of a zzso zzso zzso as judged by its decreased zzso mobility on two-dimensional zzso zzso The extent to which insulin zzso this response is zzso by zzso and blocked by zzso with zzso Isolation and mass zzso analysis revealed that the multiply zzso protein was the larger of two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso termed here zzso zzso zzso of zzso derived from zzso zzso 167 cells with the zzso zzso released a number of zzso one of which contained all the putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso with zzso showed that the sites of zzso reside at the zzso zzso of zzso The sites of zzso were identified by zzso degradation after conversion of the zzso zzso to zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso mapping of individual zzso isolated from two-dimensional zzso gels, indicated that zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso appears to proceed in an ordered zzso The importance of these observations in cell growth and development is zzso
