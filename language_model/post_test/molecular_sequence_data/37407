zzso is a member of the zzso protein family zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso activity and binding of zzso Here, the crystal structure of zzso has been determined by molecular replacement to zzso zzso zzso is defined by a zzso zzso zzso wrapping with a right-handed twist around a short zzso an architecture similar to that of zzso zzso is able to bind zzso in a similar way to zzso The zzso in two loop regions zzso zzso and zzso is the principal reason for the specificity differences between zzso and zzso The zzso change corresponding to zzso in zzso limits the zzso adaptation between the loop zzso zzso and zzso and decreases the zzso zzso while the zzso substitution corresponding to zzso of zzso destroys a key interaction between zzso and zzso It can be zzso from the locations of strictly zzso zzso acids in the zzso chain that the maintenance of the overall zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso is essential for the zzso zzso The zzso region and zzso of zzso forms a zzso patch which may be responsible for the binding of target proteins such as zzso or zzso
