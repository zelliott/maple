zzso are zzso proteins of zzso bacteria that are zzso via an zzso zzso extension, the zzso zzso This domain supposedly is sufficient for the transport of the zzso passenger domain across the outer zzso We present here the crystal structure of the in zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso which reveals a zzso zzso with a zzso pore of 10 zzso zzso A that is filled by an zzso zzso The domain has pore activity in zzso and in zzso Our data are consistent with the model of zzso transport through the zzso channel within the zzso and inconsistent with a model for transport through a central channel formed by an zzso of zzso zzso However, the dimensions of the pore imply zzso of the zzso domain in an unfolded zzso An alternative model, possibly covering the transport of folded zzso is that zzso transport involves the zzso complex, the machinery required for membrane zzso of zzso zzso on which zzso are zzso
