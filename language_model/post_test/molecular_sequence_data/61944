zzso a major protein of the zzso outer zzso forms zzso zzso channels permeable to most zzso Although multiple zzso of zzso have been found in different organisms, only one zzso zzso has been previously reported for zzso zzso We have examined the zzso properties of three other zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso whose primary sequences have significant zzso to zzso A comparison of their zzso profiles zzso with known zzso sequences indicates the same fundamental folding pattern but with major insertions and zzso The ability of these proteins to form channels was tested on zzso zzso and zzso Channel activity was observed with varying degrees of similarity to zzso Two of these proteins zzso and zzso produced channels with zzso selectivity in the open zzso Sometimes channels exhibited closure and zzso zzso but for zzso this occurred at much higher zzso than is typical for zzso zzso was not able to form zzso zzso and zzso were able to rescue the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso demonstrated no zzso Similar structure and channel formation indicate that zzso proteins are part of the larger zzso family but the modifications are indicative of specialized zzso
