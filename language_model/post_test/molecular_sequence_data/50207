The zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso binds and carries out zzso at a 34 zzso lox zzso The lox site consists of two 13 zzso zzso repeats, separated by an 8 zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso nature of the site and the results of zzso and band shift experiments suggest that a minimum of two zzso molecules bind to a lox zzso We report here experiments that demonstrate the absolute zzso of the zzso complex to be one zzso of zzso bound per zzso zzso or two molecules per lox zzso
