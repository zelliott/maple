The T zzso immune response of infectious zzso zzso patients to five zzso virus zzso nuclear zzso zzso and to the membrane zzso associated with zzso cells zzso membrane zzso zzso was measured by the zzso migration zzso zzso zzso Two different zzso sources were zzso extracts from cells that only expressed zzso zzso or zzso after zzso with the corresponding zzso fragment, and synthetic peptides deduced from the corresponding zzso Patients in the acute phase of the disease failed to respond to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but became responsive during zzso The majority of the patients responded to zzso and/or zzso in the acute phase zzso and zzso zzso The response to zzso and/or zzso in the acute phase zzso and zzso zzso The response to zzso disappeared more often in zzso than the response to zzso 6 of 15 patients were negative to zzso and 12 of 15 to zzso during zzso In addition to its value in the assessment of host zzso to virus zzso zzso these studies and the derived hypotheses also provide certain predictions about the zzso zzso expression in the zzso host under normal and pathological conditions that can be subjected to direct experimental zzso
