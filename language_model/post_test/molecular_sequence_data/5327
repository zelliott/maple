The zzso bond pattern of the long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 zzso was established using structural information gathered by zzso acid analysis, zzso sequencing, and molecular mass determination of fragments isolated by zzso zzso after zzso degradation with zzso and zzso zzso A computer program was used to calculate all possible combinations of zzso peptides matching the mass zzso data, and the output was filtered using compositional and sequence zzso zzso bonds between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso and the two zzso zzso at positions 5 and 24 found in zzso but not in other zzso molecules are zzso This linkage creates an zzso large loop, which, depending on whether the zzso structure of zzso or zzso is used for zzso the structure of zzso lies opposite or nearly zzso respectively, to the biologically active zzso zzso
