The combination of zzso and zzso zzso within a hairpin structure can form a functional DNA zzso The activities of both zzso (as zzso zzso and zzso (as signal amplification zzso are blocked via base pairing in the hairpin zzso The presence of target triggers the opening of the hairpin to form zzso complex and releases zzso sequence which can generate amplified zzso zzso In this work, we elaborated a universal and simple procedure to design an efficient and sensitive hairpin probe with suitable functional DNA zzso A zzso process was developed for sequence design, and two key points including the zzso of the hairpin probe and the selection of suitable signal zzso sequence were proved to enhance the detection zzso zzso was chosen as a model target for a proof of zzso A series of zzso with different numbers of base pairs in the stem region were zzso zzso with ten base pairs was screened out and a lowest zzso cocaine concentration of 5 zzso by zzso was zzso The proposed functional DNA hairpin showed good selectivity and satisfactory analysis in spiked zzso zzso The whole zzso detection based on DNA hairpin without the need of zzso and labeling was indicated to be time and labor zzso The strategy has potential to be transplanted into more smart zzso toward other targets for general application in zzso zzso
