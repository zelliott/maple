zzso zzso employs the specialized type III zzso system zzso in zzso island 1 zzso to zzso zzso proteins into host cells and to zzso host cell signal zzso The zzso type III system and the zzso proteins are zzso among all zzso and are thought to be acquired by horizontal gene zzso The genetic mechanisms zzso this horizontal transfer are zzso Here, we describe that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in relatively few zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a temperate zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso as well as partial sequence information, suggest that this zzso zzso is a new member of the zzso family of zzso By zzso conversion this zzso can zzso transfer genes between different zzso zzso zzso zzso most of the zzso harboring zzso belong to the small group of epidemic strains of zzso zzso that have been responsible for a large percentage of human and animal zzso and have persisted for a long period of zzso Our data suggest that horizontal transfer of type III dependent zzso proteins by zzso infection with zzso zzso zzso may provide an efficient mechanism for zzso the interaction of zzso zzso with their zzso
