zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that zzso food intake and body weight in zzso and zzso These studies used zzso zzso to study aspects of structure and function of zzso and the sensitivity of parts of the zzso sequence to zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and studied using zzso binding and degradation studies in zzso Their effects on food intake and zzso taste avoidance were measured in zzso in zzso zzso breakdown by the zzso zzso zzso IV zzso was demonstrated in zzso and in zzso In zzso degradation was reduced and in zzso zzso increased by zzso of zzso zzso to the N zzso of zzso modulated binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation by zzso zzso to the midsection of zzso modulated binding to the zzso zzso and degradation by neutral zzso These modifications also altered zzso in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was shown to contribute to the properties of zzso in zzso and in zzso but was not alone sufficient for the effects of the zzso zzso and zzso of the C zzso of zzso altered zzso zzso binding and duration of action in zzso which may be due to changes in zzso zzso An zzso analog was developed with enhanced pharmaceutical zzso with greater potency and longevity with respect to effects on food zzso These studies suggest that zzso is a potential target for zzso drug zzso
