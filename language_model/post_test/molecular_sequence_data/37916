Three distinct regions, designated zzso b and c from zzso to zzso zzso are required for normal zzso in zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to occur less frequently in zzso men and to be associated with a more severe zzso zzso with almost complete absence of germ zzso zzso contains three zzso named zzso zzso and zzso and presents high zzso with the mouse Delta zzso zzso zzso deletion of which causes a severe zzso zzso However, the specific role of these genes in human zzso is still unknown and it is not clear which of them is responsible for the zzso zzso Here we describe a complete sequence map of the zzso region, the zzso structure of zzso genes and their deletion analysis in a large number of zzso men characterized by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso may cause severe zzso but zzso appears to be the major zzso zzso zzso is frequently deleted in zzso patients and its absence produces severe zzso damage leading to a significant reduction of germ cells or even to their complete zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes and their zzso revealed ubiquitous expression for all of them except zzso this gene produces a long transcript which is zzso expressed in addition to a shorter transcript which is only expressed in the zzso suggesting a specific role for zzso in the zzso zzso This hypothesis is further supported by the high similarity of zzso to other DEAD box proteins belonging to the zzso zzso
