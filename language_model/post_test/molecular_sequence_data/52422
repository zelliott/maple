zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the zzso response to zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso In addition, clinical administration of zzso zzso zzso recovery in states of natural and zzso zzso zzso zzso acts by binding to high affinity cell surface receptors present on zzso zzso To determine the zzso at which zzso binds to it zzso we analyzed a series of zzso zzso of the growth factor for zzso zzso binding and biological zzso The results suggest that zzso binds to its zzso and triggers a zzso stimulus through two zzso zzso zzso located near the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso To corroborate these findings, we have also mapped the binding zzso of 10 zzso of human or zzso zzso and have defined four distinct zzso Two of these zzso comprise the zzso zzso binding zzso A third zzso zzso to the zzso zzso interactive domain, and the fourth zzso apparently not involved in the interaction of zzso and its zzso lies between these zzso And on the basis of sandwich zzso using pairs of these zzso the two zzso interactive regions appear to reside in close juxtaposition in the zzso structure of the zzso These results provide a correlation of the zzso relationships of zzso that should prove useful in evaluating the details of zzso zzso interaction and in the rational design of clinically useful derivatives of this growth zzso
