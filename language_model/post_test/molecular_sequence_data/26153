The zzso domain of the human zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli either as a fusion protein with protein A or under control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins were found to bind steroids with the normal specificity for a zzso zzso but with reduced affinity zzso for zzso zzso approximately 70 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso coli zzso containing the zzso protein indicated no interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and heat shock zzso However, synthesis of the corresponding fragments of zzso zzso in zzso using rabbit zzso zzso resulted in the formation of proteins that bound zzso zzso with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso with and without zzso indicated that the in zzso zzso zzso fragments formed complexes with zzso as previously shown for the full-length rat zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso domain expressed in zzso coli and affinity zzso with zzso zzso identified binding of the steroid to zzso zzso However, all zzso zzso within the zzso domain were affinity zzso to a certain degree indicating that the zzso protein has a structure similar to the native zzso but more open and zzso
