zzso zzso 1 zzso is a multiply zzso zzso zzso plasma membrane protein originally identified by its capacity to accelerate zzso movement of membrane zzso We recently reported that when zzso of zzso does not occur, it is localized to the nucleus rather than the plasma zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was also observed upon induction of its de zzso synthesis by zzso such as zzso alpha that activate the zzso zzso Despite its capacity to enter the nucleus, its sequence does not predict a nuclear zzso zzso To gain insight into the mechanism and potential significance of nuclear zzso we investigated the conditions required for its import and retention in the zzso We show that nuclear zzso of zzso is dependent on zzso factors and zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is specifically transported into the nucleus by the zzso zzso import pathway, and binds directly and with high affinity to zzso zzso Analysis of deletion zzso suggested that the zzso of zzso is between zzso 242 and 290 and, zzso that a zzso within this region encompassing zzso zzso is sufficient for nuclear import when zzso to zzso In addition, in intact cells, zzso of positively charged zzso acids within this putative zzso in the full-length protein completely blocked its entry into the nucleus, consistent with its role in targeting zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso from the nucleus was only observed after treatment of cells with both zzso and an elevated zzso zzso or following zzso treatment of the nucleus, suggesting zzso interactions of zzso with a nuclear component bound to zzso DNA or directly with zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to bind directly to a zzso zzso zzso and its zzso from DNA also required an elevated zzso zzso These data support a mechanism of zzso nuclear import of zzso and suggest a potential nuclear function for this plasma membrane zzso
