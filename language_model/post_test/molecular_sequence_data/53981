The vascular diameter of the zzso spiral zzso artery has been shown to depend on the presence of zzso zzso but it remained unknown whether the smooth muscle cells of this zzso contain a zzso sensing zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration zzso was monitored as zzso 3 zzso and the vascular diameter was measured by zzso in isolated in zzso zzso spiral zzso zzso zzso was used to probe for the presence of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso concentration zzso from 1 to 10 zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso that was paralleled by a zzso The initial rate of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited when zzso zzso stores were presumably depleted with zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 26) or zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25) or when zzso was inhibited by zzso m zzso zzso zzso zzso The initial rate of this zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso channel blocker zzso m zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso m zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the inactive analogue of zzso by the zzso zzso channel blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) or the zzso zzso blocker zzso m zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rank potency order was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso isolated from the zzso revealed a zzso product of the appropriate size for the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the amplified zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso acid identity compared to other zzso These results demonstrate that the spiral zzso artery contains a zzso which is most likely located in the vascular smooth muscle zzso
