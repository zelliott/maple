Over the last decade, zzso have emerged as attractive therapeutic targets for a number of different diseases, and numerous high zzso screening efforts in the pharmaceutical community are directed towards discovery of compounds that regulate zzso zzso The emerging utility of systems biology approaches has necessitated the development of multiplex tools suitable for zzso experiments to replace lower zzso technologies such as mass zzso for the study of protein zzso Recently, a new approach for identifying zzso of protein zzso has applied the zzso format of functional protein zzso to characterize zzso for thousands of candidate protein zzso in a single zzso This method involves the addition of protein zzso in solution to zzso of immobilized proteins to identify zzso using highly sensitive radioactive detection and hit identification zzso 

To date, the factors required for optimal performance of protein zzso zzso zzso identification have not been zzso In the current study, we have carried out a detailed characterization of the protein zzso method for zzso zzso zzso including an examination of the effects of time, buffer compositions, and protein concentration on the zzso The protein array approach was compared to standard zzso zzso for assessing zzso zzso and a correlation of greater than zzso was zzso The results presented here demonstrate how novel zzso for protein zzso can be quickly identified from zzso containing thousands of human proteins to provide new clues to protein zzso zzso In addition, a zzso strategy was developed and applied that enhances characterization of specific zzso relationships and decreases zzso zzso 

zzso protein zzso are an important new tool that enables multiplex analysis of protein zzso and thus can be zzso to identify novel zzso zzso zzso this technology with a systems biology approach to cell zzso will help uncover new layers in our understanding of this essential class of zzso
