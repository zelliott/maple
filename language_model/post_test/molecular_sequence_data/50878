zzso synthesis and cloning in zzso coli of an artificial gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso alpha 1 have been carried zzso zzso plasmids were constructed which contain fusion genes coding for hybrids of human zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso alpha 1 as zzso or zzso part of the hybrid zzso In the zzso hybrid zzso zzso and zzso alpha 1 are linked through a zzso zzso thus allowing for zzso alpha 1 to be zzso off the rest of the hybrid protein with zzso zzso In case of the zzso hybrid zzso the zzso between the zzso alpha 1 and zzso sequences is the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the hybrid genes in zzso coli and properties of the zzso proteins were zzso The zzso hybrid protein was zzso into zzso space, in contrast with the zzso hybrid zzso which formed zzso zzso inside bacterial zzso zzso for the isolation of both hybrid proteins were zzso The zzso hybrid protein displayed full biological activity in the zzso zzso on the mouse zzso zzso whereas the zzso hybrid protein proved to be much less zzso Treatment of the hybrid protein zzso alpha 1 with zzso zzso lead to a mixture of two zzso from which zzso alpha 1 was zzso to zzso by simple zzso zzso
