Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is widely used in the molecular zzso few zzso zzso zzso gene sequences are known from zzso animals, and the value of the zzso gene for zzso zzso has not been zzso The goal of this study is to test whether combined zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences support the division of zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso as was proposed by Aguinaldo et zzso (1997) zzso zzso based on zzso zzso sequences zzso Nearly complete zzso gene sequences were zzso and combined zzso + zzso sequences were zzso for 15 zzso related zzso zzso plus five zzso zzso When the aligned zzso + zzso sequences were analyzed by zzso methods zzso evolution analysis of zzso zzso maximum likelihood, and maximum zzso and by spectral analysis of zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were indeed strongly supported zzso zzso values zzso with higher support than from the zzso sequences zzso Furthermore, with the zzso methods, the zzso + zzso sequences resolved some accepted zzso within zzso and zzso zzso the zzso sequence grouped with the zzso and the zzso sequences grouped with the zzso and zzso that zzso studies do not zzso Also, the zzso sequence grouped with the sequences from zzso zzso and zzso Like zzso zzso our zzso + zzso sequences contradict older hypotheses that grouped zzso with zzso as zzso that said zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and considered zzso zzso and zzso to be zzso The position of zzso within zzso remains zzso our zzso sequence associated with that of an zzso but this was unstable and probably zzso Finally, the benefits of combining zzso with zzso sequences for zzso analyses are zzso zzso adds zzso it can be used at lower zzso levels, and its core region is easy to align across distant zzso its base zzso tend to be zzso across such zzso We conclude that molecular zzso should use combined zzso + zzso zzso genes rather than zzso zzso
