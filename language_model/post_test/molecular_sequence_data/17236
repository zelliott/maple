A critical step in zzso action is the recognition of zzso responsive elements zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our current studies were designed to determine whether an extended zzso response element zzso zzso contributes to the differential zzso responses of the human and mouse zzso overlapping chicken zzso upstream zzso sequences zzso response zzso zzso in the context of their natural zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells show that zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso activates zzso of the human zzso zzso fourfold higher than the mouse zzso zzso in the context of their natural zzso Since the zzso of the human zzso gene naturally occurs 18 zzso upstream from the zzso and is absent in the mouse zzso gene promoter, we created a zzso mouse zzso zzso reporter, which now encodes the zzso in the identical location as in the human zzso zzso The addition of the zzso in the mouse zzso gene rendered this reporter extremely responsive to zzso zzso Using limited zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso we showed that the binding and zzso sensitivity of zzso bound to the mouse zzso with or without the zzso zzso zzso occupancy of additional nuclear receptors at the zzso may contribute to zzso binding and zzso Furthermore, the presence of zzso influences the selectivity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso is bound to human and mouse plus zzso which contain the zzso steroid zzso zzso zzso was zzso while zzso and zzso zzso selectively enhanced the mouse zzso gene zzso Moreover, zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso robustly increase the zzso function of zzso in the presence of the zzso In conclusion, these data show that the context of the zzso gene influences the zzso zzso zzso
