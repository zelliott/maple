One of the most fascinating zzso transitions in the animal kingdom was the invention of insect wings, a change that also contributed to the success and enormous diversity of this animal zzso However, the origin of insect flight and the relationships of zzso winged insect orders are still zzso Three hypotheses have been proposed to explain the zzso of winged zzso 1) the traditional zzso hypothesis zzso + zzso zzso 2) the zzso hypothesis zzso zzso + zzso and 3) the zzso hypothesis zzso zzso + zzso Neither zzso analyses of single genes nor even multiple marker systems zzso molecular markers + zzso zzso have yet been able to zzso resolve zzso zzso zzso A possible explanation for the lack of resolution is that the zzso took place in the zzso within a short period of time and attempts to solve this problem have been zzso by the major challenge of finding molecular markers to accurately track these short ancient zzso Although zzso data are available for zzso and some wingless zzso orders, they are lacking for the crucial zzso and zzso zzso We adopt a zzso approach including data from two new expressed sequence tag zzso the orders zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso evaluate the potential of zzso analyses in clarifying this unresolved zzso We analyzed two data sets that differed in represented zzso zzso and overall sequence zzso zzso (15 zzso 125 zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso (8 zzso 150 zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso likelihood and zzso zzso analyses both place the zzso at the base of the winged zzso Furthermore, statistical hypotheses testing rejected both the zzso and the zzso zzso The comprehensive molecular data set developed here provides conclusive support for zzso as the most zzso winged insect order zzso zzso Data quality assessment indicates that proteins involved in cellular processes and signaling harbor the most zzso zzso zzso
