To identify expressed sequences from the candidate zzso region of the zzso zzso cell zzso syndrome zzso the zzso island rescue zzso methodology was employed on the zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso that contains zzso marker zzso A positive clone zzso size 350 zzso was isolated by screening a human zzso zzso library with the island rescue zzso products and mapped back to the zzso zzso To obtain additional sequence information from zzso the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso methodology was zzso Within the longest zzso zzso product, two segments having similarities with zzso a zzso and zzso protein of zzso zzso as well as with zzso a recently cloned human zzso zzso were zzso In fact, these two segments have properties of typical zzso suggesting that the zzso products and clone zzso represent zzso zzso Using the zzso methodology with zzso originating from these two zzso it was shown that they zzso together and the sequences corresponding to the processed zzso zzso were zzso This zzso maps back to zzso and zzso was found to code for a novel protein composed of 525 zzso acids and containing five zzso zzso The presence of the zzso repeat zzso considered to function in zzso zzso implies that the new protein might have a role in zzso zzso Moreover, Northern analysis indicated that, in addition to zzso the brain is a tissue with relatively high levels of expression of this zzso Finally, Southern analysis showed a functional conservation of the zzso repeat protein in various zzso
