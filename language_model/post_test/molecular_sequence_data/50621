The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of the gene 4 of bovine zzso strain zzso is zzso The open reading frame is predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso shorter than described for any other zzso strain zzso to zzso zzso zzso shows 70 to zzso similarity to other zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the presence of a unique zzso type, and confirming a third zzso zzso in the bovine zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment with several other zzso strains created gaps in the sequence to account for a shorter zzso The alignment shows a two zzso zzso acid deletions within the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso Comparisons of two regions zzso the zzso zzso site, zzso 224 to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso which show high zzso between zzso demonstrate that the region zzso to the zzso cut site has a low zzso zzso to other zzso zzso although the region 3' to the zzso zzso site shows high zzso zzso to zzso with other zzso zzso The lack of a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso region suggests a possible altered local zzso of this site in zzso zzso A second gap inserted into the zzso of zzso on multiple sequence alignment is a three zzso zzso acid deletion at position zzso in the zzso zzso Previously defined zzso properties of this strain in relation to the determination of the zzso acid composition of zzso are zzso
