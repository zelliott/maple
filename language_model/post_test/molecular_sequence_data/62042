In zzso zzso genes are crucial for specifying zzso cell zzso Six zzso genes have been identified in zzso but only one, zzso has been identified in the zzso The zzso zzso gene 3 zzso however, lacks the zzso activity of the other five zzso genes in zzso and can directly induce neural tissue in animal caps by zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated three clones of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 3 zzso and analyzed their zzso The zzso genes show high zzso to zzso and have the same zzso Southern zzso and zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso zzso has zzso in the zzso gene sequences and our three clones represent separate gene zzso We also found a partial clone of zzso that coded for the zzso part of its zzso Surprisingly, this sequence also induced neural tissue by zzso zzso signals, and its coded protein physically associated with zzso mature zzso Furthermore, we showed that the zzso of zzso has the same zzso Together, these findings indicate that the zzso of zzso genes acts zzso towards zzso signals, which identifies a novel mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso
