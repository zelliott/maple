Numerous experiments with peptides related to zzso and involving tests such as zzso approach, discrimination and rewarded behavior indicate that these peptides possess zzso effects on learning, zzso attention, and zzso In addition, zzso zzso affect social behavior, interact with zzso binding sites, and possess zzso zzso Other zzso effects which can be demonstrated after zzso administration only are grooming behavior, zzso yawning and sexual zzso The effects reside mainly in the zzso part of zzso zzso zzso and are zzso from the peripheral zzso zzso Several zzso in the sequence zzso led to a highly selective, potent and orally active zzso with a marked loss of zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso appeared to be 1,000 times more active on avoidance behavior than zzso but to contain 1,000 times less zzso zzso It also had a markedly reduced zzso fat zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides also possess zzso activities as derived from studies on zzso of damaged nerve zzso Animal studies show beneficial effects of zzso treatment of the zzso analogue zzso zzso on nerve crush zzso in zzso The activity for this effect resides in the sequence zzso The zzso influence is evident both at the sensory and the motor function zzso The protective effect of zzso zzso is also found in other zzso as a result of diabetes zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
