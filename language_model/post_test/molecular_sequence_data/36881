A DNA zzso has been isolated from calf zzso zzso The zzso was enriched from crude zzso extracts by zzso zzso on zzso followed by zzso ammonium zzso zzso and subsequent zzso on zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso 44 gel zzso The DNA zzso had a zzso radius of about 45 A and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The most zzso zzso contained three zzso with apparent molecular weights of zzso 65, and 34 zzso zzso zzso with radioactive zzso stained all three major zzso The zzso zzso the unwinding of a DNA primer from a zzso DNA template in an zzso or zzso zzso DNA unwinding was also observed with zzso or zzso but with reduced zzso The zzso zzso from 3' to zzso on the zzso template it was bound zzso zzso between this DNA zzso and other calf zzso zzso will be zzso
