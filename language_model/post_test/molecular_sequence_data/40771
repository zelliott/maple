Considering that zzso repeat region may be involved in the zzso binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso it is possible that the zzso against zzso zzso repeat may have a crucial action on zzso zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of zzso against zzso repeat zzso designated as zzso on zzso zzso The zzso against the zzso zzso was prepared and zzso zzso patch clamp technique was used to study the change of zzso exchange current zzso in adult rat zzso To evaluate the functional specificity of this zzso its effects on zzso zzso current zzso zzso zzso current zzso and delayed zzso zzso current zzso were also zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso channel were compared using zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that outward and inward zzso were decreased by the zzso against zzso zzso in the concentration range from 10 to 160 zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso also decreased zzso in a zzso manner with zzso of zzso zzso No obvious effects of the zzso on zzso and zzso were zzso Moreover, comparison of the zzso acid sequences showed there was zzso sequence similarity between zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso against zzso is a blocking zzso to zzso and can also decrease zzso in a zzso manner, while it does not have obvious effects on zzso and zzso
