A zzso zzso expressing a zzso zzso protein zzso from the oral zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The gene was initially identified as an open reading frame immediately upstream from the previously characterized zzso zzso gene of strain zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene revealed a potential zzso protein product with extensive zzso with the signaling regions of zzso from a variety of zzso The protein expressed in zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso coli zzso serum, confirming its zzso with zzso Northern zzso and primer extension analyses identified the zzso start site of the zzso zzso zzso By utilizing a zzso zzso gene zzso system recently developed in this laboratory, a zzso defective in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso was demonstrated to be defective in zzso toward zzso In addition, the zzso profiles of cellular proteins indicated altered zzso in the zzso relative to those of the parental zzso These results indicate that we have identified an zzso gene in the oral zzso which plays a significant role in the zzso response of the zzso
