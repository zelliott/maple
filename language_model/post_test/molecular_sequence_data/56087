We report here on the cloning of a human zzso gene zzso a member of the zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso Based on the deduced zzso acid zzso this gene encodes a zzso zzso acid protein displaying sequence zzso particularly within putative zzso zzso with the recently cloned human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso cells zzso expressing the human zzso gene bound zzso zzso in a zzso manner with high affinity zzso 200 zzso and with rank order of potency zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicative of a zzso selective zzso The pharmacological profile of the expressed human zzso zzso is similar but not identical to that reported for the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where the zzso selectivity is zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals the presence of an zzso zzso species of approximately 5 zzso in various regions of the monkey brain, including the frontal cortex, zzso zzso amygdala, with little or no zzso zzso zzso in brain regions such as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene maps to human zzso zzso The existence of at least four distinct human genes zzso zzso selective receptors with diverse pharmacological zzso may help to account for some of the multiple biological actions of zzso under normal and pathological zzso
