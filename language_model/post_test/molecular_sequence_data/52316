We have previously reported that zzso zzso was remarkably increased during zzso differentiation of human zzso leukemia cell line zzso cells and that zzso series zzso zzso were enriched during zzso zzso In addition, zzso was differentiated into zzso lineage by zzso zzso and into zzso by zzso In the present report, the zzso bases of zzso zzso in zzso during differentiation induced by zzso and zzso acid were zzso The following results were of particular zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso was remarkably zzso during zzso zzso while the zzso zzso level did not change in zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso beta zzso zzso zzso was zzso during zzso zzso while the activity of zzso zzso was found to increase in zzso zzso zzso The activities of four downstream zzso (for synthesis of zzso were found to increase or to remain unchanged during zzso and zzso zzso These results strongly suggested the zzso The dramatic zzso increase and the decrease of zzso during zzso differentiation are the consequences of the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso although the downstream zzso are ready to catalyze their zzso zzso The notable increase of zzso and the relative decrease of zzso during zzso differentiation are the results of the unchanged level of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso together with the zzso of the downstream zzso These results suggest that these two key upstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play critical roles in regulating the zzso zzso in zzso cells during zzso This switching mechanism of these two zzso together with our previous findings, might be one of the most important parts of the determining system of differentiation direction in human zzso cells into zzso or zzso zzso
