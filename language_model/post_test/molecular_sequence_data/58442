The zzso protein of zzso has been considered highly zzso showing greater than zzso conservation within strains of a given zzso We determined the zzso sequence of the N gene and the 3' untranslated region zzso of eight naturally occurring strains of zzso which differed in zzso and tissue zzso In zzso zzso the deduced zzso acid sequences of N of five strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I) shared zzso zzso The three strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso shared zzso identity with each other, but only zzso identity with viruses of group zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and insertions occurred throughout the N protein and involved regions previously identified as being zzso Despite the considerable variation observed between the two virus groups, all N proteins contained a high proportion of basic zzso zzso of which were zzso in zzso In addition, all strains contained approximately 30 zzso zzso of which 10 were zzso the majority occurring between positions zzso and zzso As for all other zzso the region between positions 92 and 103 was highly zzso zzso a large number of zzso acid changes can be tolerated within the N protein without affecting its integrity or zzso The 3' zzso immediately downstream from the N gene was highly zzso with extensive deletions occurring in the group II zzso
