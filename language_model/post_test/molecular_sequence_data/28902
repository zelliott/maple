The zzso gene product of zzso zzso is responsible for the reduction of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso here, we show that this zzso also zzso the reduction of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, we demonstrate that a newly identified zzso of this gene in zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso capable of reducing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso and that an zzso zzso may have been the initial cause of a partial loss of zzso zzso zzso function can be restored to zzso zzso creating a new zzso strain possessing zzso zzso with zzso We speculate on the requirement of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and on a potential link between the absence of zzso and of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The identification of a second role for the fully functional zzso in catalyzing the synthesis of zzso zzso strongly suggests that zzso of this zzso may be similarly responsible for the synthesis of zzso zzso in organisms possessing zzso zzso In addition to zzso other members of a photosynthesis gene cluster were identified in zzso zzso including a zzso zzso demonstrated to zzso a functional zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso
