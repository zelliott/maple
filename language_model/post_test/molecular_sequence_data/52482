We studied the detection of the zzso gene of human influenza viruses in throat zzso obtained from the outbreaks of influenza in school children utilizing the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and specificity of the zzso method was compared to conventional virus isolation using zzso zzso Three pairs of zzso for zzso in detecting the zzso genes of zzso zzso and B influenza viruses showed both zzso and type zzso The dilution experiments showed that influenza zzso as few as zzso zzso units per 50 zzso were sufficient for the detection of zzso genes by zzso method and the detection rate by zzso method was 2-3 fold higher than that by conventional zzso Our results showed that the zzso method was a fast, sensitive and reliable method for the diagnosis of influenza zzso
