A simple and zzso zzso method based on zzso has been developed to cleave peptides and zzso zzso zzso was found to be specific and rapid as it induced a zzso at the zzso side of zzso acid in the temperature range of zzso degrees C in 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to characterize and identify zzso zzso products, confirming that sequence information is zzso after the zzso process in both peptides and protein zzso This suggests that zzso zzso at zzso zzso can be used as a rapid protein zzso procedure for the generation of zzso protein zzso
