The three genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are distinguished mostly by their individual zzso tail zzso zzso of these sequences beyond the last zzso zzso zzso increases zzso filament association for all three zzso indicating a negative regulatory role for the unique tail zzso We have tested this hypothesis by constructing a series of deletion and substitution zzso for all three zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso sequences regulate zzso association by altering the function of the second zzso site, zzso in zzso comprised of the three zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tail resulted in an increased binding and bundling activity, and caused a prominent zzso of zzso zzso from the peripheral zzso network to the central zzso stress fibers in zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the tail sequence of zzso zzso can zzso zzso association efficiently in all three zzso zzso whereas the tail of the zzso zzso zzso zzso had little zzso zzso zzso further revealed that the zzso charged zzso within the tail region are essential for this regulatory zzso Finally we demonstrate that the tail sequences regulate the second zzso site zzso and not the strong zzso zzso region in zzso
