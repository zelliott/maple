An intermediate zzso zzso zzso channel, zzso was cloned from human zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence is related to, but distinct from, the small zzso zzso zzso channel zzso which is approximately 50% zzso zzso zzso was detected in peripheral zzso but not in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso gave rise to inwardly zzso zzso zzso which were activated by zzso zzso of zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso for calcium was similar to that of small zzso zzso zzso channels, the slope factor derived from the Hill equation was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso current zzso reflected the zzso inward zzso and revealed a zzso level of 39 zzso in the inward zzso zzso currents were zzso blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but were minimally affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso (10 zzso These zzso and pharmacological properties are consistent with native intermediate zzso zzso zzso channels, including the zzso zzso zzso
