zzso is a key innovation underlying the evolution of advanced snakes zzso Despite this, very little is known about zzso system structural diversification, toxin recruitment event zzso or toxin molecular zzso A multidisciplinary approach was used to examine the diversification of the zzso system and associated toxins across the full range of the approximately 100 zzso advanced snake zzso with a particular emphasis upon families that have not zzso evolved a zzso zzso system ( approximately zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso libraries revealed complex zzso zzso containing multiple toxin types including three finger zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso snake zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso High levels of sequence diversity were observed, including zzso in structural and functional zzso changes in zzso zzso and major zzso zzso analysis zzso gross zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging also demonstrated extensive modification of the zzso system architecture in zzso snakes in contrast to the zzso structure of the zzso system within the independently evolved zzso zzso or zzso zzso Further, a reduction in the size and complexity of the zzso system was observed in species in which zzso has been zzso evolved as the preferred method of prey capture or dietary preference has switched from live prey to eggs or to zzso Investigation of the timing of toxin recruitment events across the entire advanced snake radiation indicates that the evolution of advanced zzso systems in three zzso lineages is associated with recruitment of new toxin types or explosive diversification of existing toxin zzso These results support the role of zzso as a key evolutionary innovation in the diversification of advanced snakes and identify a potential role for zzso zzso toxins as a rich source for lead compounds for drug design and zzso
