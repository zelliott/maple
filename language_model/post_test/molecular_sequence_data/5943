zzso is a hormone produced in zzso cells that regulates energy zzso food zzso and zzso In mice, we observed that circulating zzso levels increase zzso during zzso zzso zzso females had no zzso serum zzso demonstrating that the zzso zzso was not the source of the zzso However, zzso zzso and protein levels in maternal zzso tissue were not zzso The circulating zzso was in a high molecular weight complex, suggesting that the rise in zzso was due to expression of a binding zzso Indeed, quantitative zzso of serum zzso binding capacity revealed a zzso increase, zzso with the rise in serum zzso zzso binding activity reached a capacity of zzso zzso 15 zzso of serum at day 18 of zzso and zzso binding was observed with approximately 3 zzso zzso The binding protein was zzso and partially zzso revealing sequence identity to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso We found that the zzso produces large amounts of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which encodes a soluble binding zzso Thus, the extreme zzso of late pregnancy is attributable to binding of the zzso by a zzso form of the zzso zzso made by the zzso
