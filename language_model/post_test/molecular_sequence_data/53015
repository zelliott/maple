zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso of 64 zzso zzso Previous studies have emphasized the high sensitivity of the zzso region to zzso zzso leading to truncated species that have lost the first zzso zzso but that retain zzso activity and zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrate that the zzso extension in zzso zzso zzso in zzso binding and we zzso this finding to zzso class zzso zzso zzso By gel zzso studies and zzso experiments on zzso zzso we show that the extension, connected to the zzso module of the zzso contacts zzso on the minor groove side of its zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso class zzso zzso identifies a zzso 11 zzso sequence zzso in zzso zzso with the consensus zzso in class zzso zzso that is important for this zzso zzso proof of the role of this sequence comes from a zzso analysis and from binding studies using the isolated zzso
