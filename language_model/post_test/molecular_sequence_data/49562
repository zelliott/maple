zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is known to specifically zzso the zzso forms of zzso receptors zzso This strict specificity is due at least partly to zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in which basic zzso in zzso regions adjacent to zzso segments are thought to be zzso zzso was found to be zzso by zzso but it remains unknown if zzso can also serve as both a zzso and an zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was subjected to zzso analysis, and the zzso sites in zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso in beta zzso was also indicated to be zzso by zzso The zzso sites in zzso for zzso reside in the zzso domain of zzso which is on the outer surface of zzso zzso of zzso with protein zzso zzso zzso resulted in a twofold increase in the zzso of zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso in zzso probably by zzso and that the zzso may affect the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso A zzso fusion protein of a zzso region of beta zzso zzso zzso containing 19 zzso zzso but only one basic zzso was found to be a good zzso for zzso like full-length zzso These results, together with the finding that zzso may zzso zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso indicate that some proteins with very zzso regions but without basic zzso zzso could serve as zzso for zzso
