The protein zzso zzso is activated by zzso to zzso zzso zzso translation zzso Long zzso activates zzso via interactions with the zzso domain zzso zzso structured zzso also activates zzso and does so in a zzso zzso fashion, however relatively little is known about this zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso to incorporate all four zzso zzso into the first position of a largely zzso zzso and found absence of zzso in that all four transcripts activate zzso zzso of zzso but not the zzso at the zzso position, makes this zzso innate immune response sensitive to a broad array of zzso zzso was neither activated in the presence of zzso nor recognized zzso other than zzso in zzso competition and zzso binding zzso This indicates that the binding site for zzso is selective, which contrasts with the site for the zzso end of zzso zzso experiments reveal that short zzso compete with zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and likewise zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso and zzso compete with short zzso for binding to zzso zzso The zzso thus plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso by zzso and even zzso At the same time, zzso experiments indicate that zzso interacts with zzso outside of the zzso as zzso Overall, zzso zzso structured zzso activate zzso via interactions with both the zzso and a distinct zzso binding site that lacks zzso zzso allowing the innate immune response to provide zzso protection from zzso
