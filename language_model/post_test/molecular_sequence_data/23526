Type II fatty acid zzso systems are essential for membrane formation in bacteria, making the constituent proteins of this zzso attractive targets for zzso drug zzso The third step in the zzso cycle of the type II fatty acid zzso is zzso by zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso There are two zzso zzso which zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso is a universally expressed component of the bacterial type II zzso zzso the second zzso as has more limited distribution in nature and, in addition to dehydration, also carries out the zzso of zzso to zzso as an essential step in zzso fatty acid zzso We report the structure of zzso from the important human pathogen zzso zzso at zzso A of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso located within a deep, narrow tunnel formed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the obvious differences in the active site zzso that distinguish the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso do not account for the unique ability of zzso to catalyze zzso Because the zzso machinery of the two zzso is practically zzso the structural differences observed in the shape of the zzso binding channels of zzso and zzso lead us to zzso that the different shapes of the tunnels control the zzso and positioning of the bound zzso allowing zzso but not zzso to catalyze the zzso zzso
