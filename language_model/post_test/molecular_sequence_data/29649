The zzso activity and zzso variation of the zzso outer membrane protein gene zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed to determine the mechanism of the zzso variation of the zzso outer membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso indicated that 16 of the 22 members of the zzso zzso family were zzso zzso acid sequence analysis indicated that the zzso protein was produced in zzso in the Arkansas zzso The zzso gene and its promoter region were zzso and compared in 12 clinical zzso of zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso The variation of the zzso gene among the zzso is limited to three types represented by strains Arkansas, zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that the majority of the zzso genes are active genes and that zzso variation of the zzso zzso zzso proteins may result from differential expression of the zzso gene family members rather than gene zzso
