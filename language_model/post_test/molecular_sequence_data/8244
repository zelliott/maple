The small zzso protein zzso and the protein zzso zzso contain zzso groups zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso linked to a zzso zzso which is zzso on its zzso zzso These zzso like many other zzso zzso also have a string of basic zzso near their zzso A series of zzso peptides based on the zzso sequences of human brain zzso and human zzso zzso were zzso and analyzed for their membrane binding zzso zzso peptides containing an zzso zzso group were studied because their binding to zzso containing a trace of zzso zzso could be detected by zzso resonance energy zzso The zzso zzso lacking a zzso group and a zzso zzso zzso did not zzso bind to zzso and binding was enhanced by more than zzso if the zzso was zzso For the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso increased membrane affinity by at least zzso if the zzso contained zzso and by zzso if they lacked this zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso remains zzso attached to zzso over several minutes only if the zzso contain zzso whereas the corresponding zzso or zzso and zzso peptides zzso rapidly (less than a few zzso from neutral or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances its affinity to zzso containing zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso and zzso leads to an additional dramatic zzso increase in membrane zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
