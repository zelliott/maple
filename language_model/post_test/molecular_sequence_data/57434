A series of zzso modified zzso were zzso that contained either of the two known zzso zzso zzso In zzso DNA synthesis was carried out on some of these templates using a modified zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso and two different varieties of zzso coli DNA zzso I zzso zzso that carries the normal zzso zzso activity and a zzso protein that lacks this zzso zzso Regardless of the type of DNA zzso being used, DNA synthesis was terminated nearly zzso at the zzso 3' to each of these two zzso sites, although primer extension to full length of the template was noted with the unmodified control zzso zzso of zzso for zzso at a high concentration of the zzso zzso resulted in incorporation of zzso opposite the zzso in the zzso with zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso however, primer extension beyond the zzso site did not take zzso These studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso are strong blocks of replication and are likely to be toxic zzso in zzso Since previous molecular modeling studies and molecular mechanical calculations indicated that the zzso zzso does not induce severe zzso at the site of zzso a lack of zzso ability of the modified base in the extended product is unlikely to be the reason for the zzso zzso Instead, zzso structural models indicated that additional zzso interactions have been introduced by the zzso zzso and perhaps this increased zzso stabilization of a distorted structure of the replication fork, in turn, may block the replication zzso Experimental evidence of increased zzso stability was provided by zzso melting of a zzso complex that presumably a zzso encounters in a typical replication zzso zzso higher zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was noted when compared to its unmodified zzso
