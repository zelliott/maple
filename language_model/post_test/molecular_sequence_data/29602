We have used systematic zzso resonance energy transfer and zzso zzso to define the three-dimensional structures of bacterial zzso zzso zzso and the bacterial zzso zzso open complex in zzso The structures provide a framework for understanding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The positions of zzso regions zzso 2, 3, and 4 are similar in zzso and open zzso In contrast, the position of zzso region zzso differs dramatically in zzso and open zzso In zzso region zzso is located within the zzso zzso apparently serving as a zzso zzso of DNA, but, in open complex, region zzso is located outside the active center zzso The approach described here should be zzso to the analysis of other zzso zzso
