zzso data support the idea that zzso membrane fusion involves a zzso machinery containing the zzso zzso zzso assembled in zzso form a stable zzso bundle and it has been suggested that formation of this complex provides the driving force for zzso zzso We have tested this possibility in zzso of zzso in cells expressing a zzso zzso E zzso zzso of zzso in which additional disruptive zzso have been zzso Single or double zzso of zzso to zzso or to zzso in the central zero layer zzso of zzso did not impair the extent, time course or zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Using adrenal zzso cells, we found that zzso could be zzso in cells zzso to express zzso A double zzso zzso did not prevent zzso and the zzso of single zzso release events were indistinguishable from control zzso This shows a high level of tolerance of changes in the zero layer indicating that the conservation of these zzso is not due to an essential requirement in zzso zzso or fusion and suggests that formation of a fully stable zzso complex may not be required to drive membrane zzso
