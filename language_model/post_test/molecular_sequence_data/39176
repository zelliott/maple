Using an zzso primer based on a partial goldfish zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso a complete carp zzso zzso was isolated from an activated carp zzso zzso zzso zzso and predicted zzso acid sequence analysis indicate that carp zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with 57% sequence identity to human zzso Like zzso zzso carp zzso protein contains putative binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis, using neighbor joining, showed that the carp zzso protein clustered together with the other zzso zzso zzso zzso of carp zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso chain reaction after stimulation of carp zzso with zzso or the zzso blood flagellate zzso zzso These zzso produced high amounts of zzso oxide that were toxic for zzso zzso in zzso The nuclear zzso factor zzso was shown to play a role in the induction of zzso zzso
