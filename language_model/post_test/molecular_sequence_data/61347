zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso plays essential roles in DNA zzso In this report, we examined the functional role of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso The deletion or Ala substitution of the last 9 zzso zzso as well as Ala replacement of only 4 zzso zzso at the C zzso failed to substitute for the zzso zzso protein for cell growth in zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited zzso zzso Several zzso strains harboring zzso including those at the zzso zzso region, showed elevated sensitivity to DNA zzso The ability of the zzso zzso proteins to stimulate DNA synthesis by zzso and zzso also was studied in zzso The zzso proteins that did not support cell growth and a zzso protein containing a single zzso acid substitution at position zzso where Pro is replaced by Ala, zzso zzso and zzso activities zzso All zzso zzso zzso however, were assembled around DNA by the clamp zzso replication factor C, zzso Thus, the zzso region of zzso is important for interactions with both zzso and zzso and for cell survival after DNA zzso The C zzso of sliding zzso from other organisms has been shown to be important for clamp loading as well as zzso zzso The relationship between the zzso sequence in this region in different organisms is zzso
