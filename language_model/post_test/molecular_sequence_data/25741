We have cloned and characterized a chick zzso of the human zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso whose primary sequence is zzso identical with its human counterpart but less than zzso identical with any other known zzso alpha zzso zzso of the chick and human sequences reveals several highly zzso regions, including the zzso zzso The putative zzso binding domain contains alpha zzso zzso that may contribute to zzso binding zzso These are concentrated in three regions that are located before and between the first three zzso binding zzso zzso zzso raised against two peptides deduced from the putative zzso and zzso zzso of the chick alpha v sequence recognize specifically zzso zzso in chick zzso zzso At least three putative beta zzso zzso with the chick alpha v zzso In addition to a protein with the same molecular weight as beta 3 zzso protein bands of Mr zzso and zzso are also zzso By successive zzso we demonstrate that this latter Mr zzso zzso is beta 1, which appears to be one of the alpha zzso zzso in chick zzso zzso
