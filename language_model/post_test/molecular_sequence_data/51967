zzso of inherited variations within tandem zzso of zzso repeats has substantially advanced the construction of genetic maps using linkage approaches over the last several zzso Using a backbone of 10 newly identified zzso repeats on human zzso 4 and 6 previously identified short tandem repeat element zzso we have constructed several genetic maps and a physical map of human zzso zzso The genetic and physical maps are in complete zzso with each zzso The genetic maps include a zzso zzso linkage map, a framework map of high support incorporating a total of 39 independent zzso a zzso zzso easily used index map, and a zzso comprehensive map that provides the best genetic location for 35 genes mapped to zzso zzso The 16 zzso markers are each localized to one of nine regions of zzso 4, delineated by a panel of zzso cell zzso These results demonstrate the utility of zzso repeat elements for the construction of genetic maps and provide a valuable resource for continued high-resolution mapping of zzso 4 and of genetic disorders to this zzso
