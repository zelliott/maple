zzso are an important cause of zzso in humans and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has demonstrated a broad range of genetic diversity but information on their epidemiology and zzso role in pigs is zzso In this study, zzso zzso samples were obtained from 4-5 to zzso week old zzso pigs from four zzso zzso in Ireland during zzso and were screened by zzso using zzso zzso Only seven samples from two zzso zzso tested positive for zzso zzso By sequence analysis of the partial zzso zzso zzso zzso fragment, six samples from one such zzso were closely related to each other zzso zzso zzso and were zzso as zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso These viruses demonstrated an zzso acid zzso identity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso one zzso strain, zzso zzso from a different zzso in 2007), was zzso related to zzso zzso and displayed zzso zzso identity to rare zzso zzso zzso representatives of a potential novel zzso zzso zzso described previously in Japan and the zzso Circulation of zzso in zzso animals might be a mechanism of virus persistence in zzso populations and should be considered with respect to understanding the epidemiology of these viruses in zzso zzso
