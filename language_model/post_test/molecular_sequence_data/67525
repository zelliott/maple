The first zzso acid of mature native zzso 2 is zzso acid, and when expressed in zzso coli, the zzso gene of the mature protein retains the zzso which is produced by translation of the start zzso This form of zzso zzso has been found to have different properties from its zzso zzso for which the zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso Berry, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zhang, zzso zzso Walker, zzso 2007, 46, zzso Native zzso zzso 2 zzso has been prepared by employing zzso expression of zzso in zzso coli using the zzso leader sequence from zzso zzso which is present in the zzso expression zzso zzso This paper details the similarities and differences between the three different zzso forms of zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso It is found that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are essentially identical to those of zzso but the rate and equilibrium zzso for zzso and NO zzso of the two are zzso
