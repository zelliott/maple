We have identified a human zzso zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso zzso zzso integral protein of the zzso zzso whose zzso zzso region contains overlapping predicted zzso zzso and weak death zzso zzso zzso flanked on either side by identical zzso recognition zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso is part of a complex that includes zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso member of the zzso family, does not associate with the complex; however, it prevents zzso from doing zzso In the absence (but not zzso of elevated zzso levels, zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso promote zzso of zzso at the two zzso recognition zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso efficiently catalyze this reaction in zzso The resulting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when expressed zzso in otherwise normal zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso zzso is part of a complex in the zzso zzso that mechanically bridges an zzso zzso like zzso with the zzso regulator zzso or zzso This raises the possibility that the zzso complex contributes to the regulation of zzso or a related zzso in response to zzso dependent on the status of the zzso zzso within the zzso
