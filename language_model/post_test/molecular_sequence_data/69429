zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso detected in most zzso zzso zzso zzso is detected in normal zzso and tumors such as zzso zzso with zzso against zzso is therefore used to detect zzso cells invading bone zzso Since zzso of normal zzso has been reported we asked whether bona fide zzso is in fact expressed in normal blood and zzso 

We designed zzso coding region specific zzso for zzso and zzso and, after reverse zzso of zzso we amplified the coding region between these zzso in a zzso zzso chain zzso In order to distinguish both zzso from each other, we amplified a long zzso zzso template in a first round of 30 cycles with zzso specific for zzso or zzso One percent of this product was used in a second round of 30 cycles in which both sense zzso and two zzso zzso zzso of alternate zzso yielding shorter products of discernible sizes zzso zzso or 619 zzso were added together in the same reaction zzso With this combination of four zzso only that shorter product was amplified to zzso the specificity of which was zzso to the template produced in the first 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the amplified products was used to verify this zzso chain zzso approach for the distinction of zzso of zzso 

This zzso zzso chain reaction clearly allows for the distinction of zzso for zzso or zzso and shows the presence of transcripts for zzso in normal human zzso from blood and bone zzso 

This method exploiting short stretches of zzso differences in the coding regions for zzso can more generally be applied to the distinction of all zzso of zzso where zzso specific zzso can be zzso However, the presence of zzso specific transcripts in normal human zzso zzso the use of this highly sensitive method as a disease marker in zzso
