Nine zzso patients who had had previous diagnoses of functional protein S zzso were zzso The functional protein S zzso gave zzso zzso that were not parallel to those of the reference zzso The same pattern was true for approximately half of the first-degree relatives of the zzso When protein S was extracted from the plasma of the patients by zzso it had a normal ratio of functional activity to zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis, zzso in one family, showed no linkage between the protein S gene marker and the abnormal behavior of the protein S functional zzso All the zzso and zzso first-degree relatives were resistant to the zzso of activated partial zzso time induced by activated protein zzso Furthermore, there was striking zzso in all patients and relatives between the abnormal pattern of the protein S functional zzso and resistance to activated protein zzso We conclude that a zzso functional protein S zzso is sensitive to activated protein C resistance and this may lead to zzso low results in the zzso In agreement with the results of others, this study indicates that resistance to activated protein C is a frequent zzso zzso in selected zzso zzso
