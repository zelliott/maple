In order to clarify the zzso potential of zzso zzso for insect zzso control, the role of the temperature as one environmental constraint was investigated on the pattern of zzso of zzso zzso by two distinct lineages of a zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso populations collected on zzso of hosts zzso under 20 zzso ranging from 13 to 35 degrees C, was zzso The apparent temperature tolerance of both zzso zzso was related to their in zzso colony growth and their in zzso zzso zzso The zzso populations were characterized by molecular markers based on restriction zzso length zzso of the internal transcribed zzso zzso and random amplified zzso DNA zzso contrasting profiles in combination with the zzso zzso This study allowed a different temperature profile was identified for each zzso Under most temperature zzso only one lineage prevailed upon the infected zzso whereas both lineages zzso at zzso and zzso degrees zzso When one zzso zzso the displacement of the other one depended on its temperature zzso These results suggest that more consideration should be given to zzso analyses for evaluating the zzso of microbial control agents to targeted zzso
