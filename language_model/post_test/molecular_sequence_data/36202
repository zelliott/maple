A method is described for the absolute zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso of zzso acids present in low zzso The method zzso the addition to the sample of competitor DNA molecules that share the same sequence as the amplified target (including primer recognition zzso except for a zzso zzso in the middle, which allows easy resolution by gel zzso zzso zzso Among the advantages of competitive zzso is that any predictable or unpredictable variable that affects amplification has the same effect on both target and competitor species and that the final ratio of amplified products reflects exactly the initial rate of targets, rendering the reaction independent of the number of amplification zzso An easy and reliable method for the construction and zzso of competitive templates obtained as zzso zzso products was zzso The technique was used for the absolute zzso of human zzso DNA with zzso from a single zzso zzso region of zzso zzso
