zzso zzso B zzso also known as zzso is activated rapidly when zzso cells are zzso with insulin and growth factors, and much of the current interest in this zzso stems from the observation that it lies zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso We recently showed that insulin or zzso growth factor 1 induce the zzso of zzso at two zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of both zzso is required for zzso zzso of zzso The zzso that zzso zzso are, however, zzso 

We have zzso 500 zzso from rabbit skeletal muscle extracts a protein zzso which zzso zzso at zzso and increases its activity over zzso We tested the zzso in the presence of several zzso zzso and found that only low zzso zzso of the D zzso of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso were effective in zzso zzso the zzso which has been named zzso protein zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso tested activated or inhibited zzso or induced its zzso under the conditions zzso zzso activity was not affected by zzso indicating that it is not likely to be a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely to be one of the protein zzso that mediate the zzso of zzso by insulin and growth zzso zzso may, therefore, play a key role in zzso many of the actions of the second zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso
