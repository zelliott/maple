zzso reverse zzso involves several zzso acid zzso which are zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso response element zzso DNA hairpin to a complementary zzso zzso zzso resulting in the formation of an extended zzso duplex, is an essential step in the zzso transfer step of reverse zzso To zzso the zzso zzso zzso reaction pathway, zzso zzso were studied systematically by zzso zzso performed in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso were used in this zzso In the absence of NC, the zzso is slow, and involves the fast formation of an unstable extended zzso loop zzso followed by a slower strand exchange between the terminal zzso This zzso is very sensitive to zzso zzso as well as to zzso acid zzso zzso strength and zzso NC stimulates the zzso approximately zzso by stabilizing the zzso intermediate approximately 100 to zzso and promoting the subsequent strand exchange reaction approximately 10 to zzso NC concentration dependence studies suggest that there is a direct correlation between the amount of NC required to stabilize the intermediate and the amount needed to induce zzso zzso Whereas zzso levels of NC are required to efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso NC is sufficient to significantly enhance duplex zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were also measured under a variety of zzso Taken together, the results presented here provide a quantitative accounting of zzso zzso zzso and duplex zzso activity, and provide insights into the universal zzso acid zzso activity of this essential viral zzso
