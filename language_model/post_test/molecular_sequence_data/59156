The downstream DNA region of the zzso gene zzso which encodes the major zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso was fully zzso Gene products, expressed from this region in zzso coli, were zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and their partial zzso acid sequences were determined to verify open reading frames zzso found in the region by DNA zzso Four zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso downstream from zzso which was previously cloned and partially characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Dickinson zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The direction of zzso of all the zzso was the same as that of zzso The 50 and 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, have been reported to be minor components associated with zzso The 15 and 19 zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, have been expressed in zzso coli but not identified in zzso zzso However, all the gene products of the zzso expressed in zzso coli, appeared to contain intact signal peptides based on their zzso zzso acid zzso
