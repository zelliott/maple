A zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was constructed, in which 111 zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso from the central region of the gamma zzso were replaced by the 148 zzso acid zzso of the zzso region from spinach zzso zzso gamma zzso including the regulatory stretch, and were designated as zzso zzso By the zzso of this regulatory region into the gamma zzso of zzso zzso we could zzso the zzso zzso property to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was easily zzso in large scale, and the zzso zzso activity of the obtained complex was shown to increase up to zzso upon treatment with zzso zzso and zzso No loss of zzso compared with the wild type zzso was found, and zzso by zzso was functional at temperatures up to 80 degrees zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso from zzso zzso but not by the one from the zzso zzso indicating that the introduced zzso acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso are important for functional interaction with the zzso zzso
