zzso is a region of zzso zzso zzso where zzso of lung zzso show loss of zzso zzso Clinical and cell biological studies suggest that zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso We have mapped this region zzso zzso using overlapping zzso zzso zzso and one of the genes that we have identified is zzso This gene encodes the large zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso that zzso the zzso step in zzso zzso By comparing our zzso sequences with the previously published zzso we have found that the human gene is composed of 19 zzso It is oriented zzso to zzso and is zzso zzso In order to verify that zzso maps within the boundaries of zzso we assessed the frequency of zzso at a zzso zzso within zzso IX of the zzso We observed zzso in zzso zzso of zzso lung tumor zzso To determine whether zzso was zzso in tumors, zzso analysis of the 19 zzso zzso was zzso No zzso were revealed in 12 pairs of normal and tumor DNA zzso zzso on protein extracts from zzso pairs indicated that a protein of the expected size was present in zzso Our conclusion is that zzso lies within the zzso region, but that its zzso are not zzso in zzso The potential for zzso to act as a tumor zzso is zzso
