zzso T zzso zzso expressing the zzso surface marker recognize peptides in association with major zzso complex zzso class I zzso Although most peptides expressed on zzso class I molecules are derived from zzso or zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso proteins to the zzso can result in their being processed for presentation to zzso on zzso class I zzso We describe two fusion proteins zzso and zzso consisting of the binding and zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso fused to zzso zzso from influenza A zzso protein and zzso zzso These fusion proteins were zzso and processed by zzso class zzso target cells, resulting in zzso of target cells for zzso by zzso zzso A point zzso known to interfere with intoxication by zzso zzso also reduced the ability of zzso to sensitize target zzso Fusion of zzso or zzso zzso with zzso provides a potential means of zzso zzso without the use of zzso agents, as well as a useful probe for studying zzso class zzso zzso zzso
