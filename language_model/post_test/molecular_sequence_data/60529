Previous work has shown that chicken strains selected for growth zzso degrade muscle proteins less rapidly than those selected for egg zzso They also have decreased zzso and increased zzso content in breast zzso This study aimed to test the hypothesis that these differences correlate with changes in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a broiler strain zzso 1) and a layer strain zzso were reared to the age of 4 zzso under identical conditions with ad zzso access to feed and zzso Mean fractional growth rates were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Feed intake measured in the last week of the trial was slightly greater in layer birds zzso and zzso g zzso g body zzso zzso zzso for zzso and layers zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was abundant in the muscles of these zzso birds, but it showed little difference between zzso Muscle did not significantly express the zzso zzso zzso The zzso system zzso zzso to zzso proteins had greatest activity in the zzso muscle of broiler birds but was not significantly different between zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso human zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1; zzso and zzso zzso binding protein 1; zzso were present in muscle zzso from both strains of zzso The chick equivalent of zzso was more abundant in breast muscle of broiler birds than in leg muscle, or in either muscle of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso temperature sensitive gene 2; zzso did not react with any protein of the expected size but detected a zzso zzso that was not associated with the zzso zzso this was found only in muscle from the layer zzso zzso during normal growth of zzso rates of protein degradation are not controlled by the expression of zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso However, the composition of the zzso zzso may be a regulatory zzso
