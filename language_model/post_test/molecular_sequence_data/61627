In zzso the zzso zzso repair of double strand breaks in DNA is executed by a series of proteins that bring about the zzso preparation and zzso of the broken DNA zzso The mechanism of this process appears to be initiated by the zzso zzso zzso protein complex zzso that has affinity for DNA zzso zzso then recruits the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structures of the major part of the zzso zzso representing the zzso core, both free and bound to DNA are known from X-ray zzso However, these structures lack a region of ca 190 zzso from the zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso (also known as Lupus zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso that includes the extreme zzso tail that is reported to be sufficient for zzso We have examined the structural characteristics of the zzso protein expressed in zzso By deletion zzso and zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso domain consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso additional zzso either to the zzso side zzso zzso or the zzso side zzso zzso which includes the putative zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso consistent with these extra regions lacking ordered zzso The three-dimensional solution structure of the core zzso domain of the zzso region of zzso zzso has been determined using zzso zzso zzso and zzso simulated zzso using structural restraints from nuclear zzso effect zzso and zzso and residual zzso zzso The zzso fold comprises six regions of zzso secondary structure that has an overall zzso zzso remotely zzso to the zzso zzso domain of the human nuclear cap binding protein 80 zzso zzso and the VHS domain of the zzso protein zzso though strict analysis of the structures suggests that these zzso are not functionally zzso Two prominent zzso pockets in the gap between zzso zzso and zzso suggest a potential zzso characteristic for this zzso zzso
