zzso of zzso zzso identified a novel zzso with high frequency in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript 1, also called zzso matched a mouse zzso and many bovine and mouse zzso but no human transcripts or zzso However, the zzso zzso matched several putative zzso within a human zzso DNA zzso on zzso zzso This human locus is in a region of zzso zzso with pig zzso 9, to which the zzso gene was subsequently zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that this gene had high expression in zzso and mouse zzso and throughout zzso zzso In zzso zzso using mouse zzso showed zzso expression in zzso cells of the zzso as well as in zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, no expression of zzso was detected by zzso zzso analysis of human zzso although zzso analysis detected very small amounts of partially spliced zzso that were significantly less abundant than the zzso levels in mouse zzso zzso and zzso zzso site sequences in the zzso of the human gene are poorly zzso and may be the cause of inefficient zzso found specifically in human zzso Our data correct zzso zzso of this region of the human zzso and describe functional gene discovery in zzso not recognized in human zzso zzso
