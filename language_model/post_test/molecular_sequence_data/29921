zzso of the viral zzso into the nuclear DNA of a host cell plays a pivotal role in the replication of zzso We have developed an in zzso method for studying the zzso of human zzso virus zzso integration by using extracts from zzso zzso Analysis of the reaction products showed that zzso integration in zzso accurately reproduces the in zzso zzso zzso occurred without apparent specificity for the target zzso and the integrated zzso was directly flanked by a zzso zzso of DNA from the target zzso zzso integration did not require a zzso zzso and the zzso activities required for integration were recovered with the viral DNA when cell extracts were zzso by gel exclusion zzso
