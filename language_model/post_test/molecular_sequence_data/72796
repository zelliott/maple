The long terminal repeats of zzso zzso virus strain zzso contain a consensus zzso binding site which has been shown to be important in controlling virus zzso However, this consensus site is absent in strain zzso Here, we have compared the ability of zzso corresponding to zzso sequences from zzso with those from zzso to bind zzso factors in competitive gel zzso zzso and activate reporter gene zzso The experiments demonstrated no zzso binding of zzso to the zzso sequences and significant differences in the abilities of the zzso and zzso sequences to activate zzso However, both viral sequences zzso with a second, previously zzso zzso zzso This factor gave specific gel shifts which were zzso by an zzso containing the consensus sequence for the zzso family of zzso factors, but not by control zzso or zzso zzso The factor was therefore zzso zzso zzso A second zzso zzso site, noted upstream of the zzso box zzso zzso site, gave single shifts which were zzso by the downstream zzso zzso zzso Both sites were functional in zzso zzso In gel shift zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against known zzso domain proteins were able to zzso part of the zzso zzso binding activity in nuclear extracts from zzso relevant cell zzso The results thus suggest that the zzso zzso binding factor belongs to the zzso family of zzso factors and may be important in controlling virus replication in these and other strains of zzso zzso
