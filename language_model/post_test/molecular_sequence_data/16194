We previously described the isolation of a human zzso which had acquired transforming potential by a DNA zzso accompanying zzso of zzso zzso cells with human tumor DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Loveless, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now term this zzso the zzso zzso since it specifies the fifth documented protein related to zzso growth factors zzso Two regions of the zzso zzso containing 122 of its 267 zzso acid zzso were 40 to 50% zzso to the sequences of zzso and basic zzso as well as to the sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene bears the three zzso structures typical for members of this zzso zzso was found to be expressed in the zzso brain and in 3 of the 13 human tumor cell lines zzso Several experiments strongly suggested that zzso is a growth factor with properties common to those of zzso and basic zzso The zzso which activated the zzso gene during DNA zzso had juxtaposed a zzso zzso zzso just upstream from the native promoter of the zzso
