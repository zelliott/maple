The zzso gene is implicated in spinal muscular zzso zzso and its product has been shown to interact with zzso protein to enhance its zzso zzso In this study, we determined the regions that were essential for the interaction of zzso and zzso by zzso of deletion zzso zzso lacking its zzso 20 zzso acid zzso or its zzso zzso domain showed no or greatly reduced binding with zzso zzso However, zzso lacking other regions could still bind to zzso Because zzso lacking the zzso domain could bind to zzso in a zzso zzso system, the zzso region of zzso seems to be the most important domain for binding with zzso A zzso of zzso zzso by zzso 6 could bind to zzso but zzso lacking this region could zzso From these results, we concluded that zzso and zzso proteins bound with each other at the zzso region near the zzso domain of zzso and the region zzso by zzso 6 of zzso both regions known to be important for their zzso
