Here we report DNA sequences from zzso zzso b gene segments zzso base pairs per zzso for the extinct zzso mammoth zzso zzso and zzso sea cow zzso zzso and the extant Asian elephant zzso zzso the Western Indian zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These molecular data have allowed us to construct the zzso for the zzso Our molecular data resolve the zzso between the two species of living zzso and the mammoth and confirm that the mammoth was more closely related to the Asian elephant than to the African zzso Our data also suggest that the sea zzso divergence was likely as ancient as the zzso split, and it appears to have been much earlier zzso million years zzso than had been previously estimated zzso million years zzso by zzso zzso
