The zzso and 3' ends of N and zzso zzso transcribed from the S segment of zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso primer extension and zzso zzso mapping zzso The results showed that both zzso acquired, at their zzso end, approximately zzso zzso not present in the viral template, suggesting an initiation zzso mechanism similar to the one described for influenza zzso Furthermore, the 3' ends of the two zzso were located in a sequence motif zzso in the S segment of two other zzso the zzso Valley zzso and zzso zzso Sicilian zzso This finding suggests the possible involvement of this sequence in the mechanism of zzso zzso
