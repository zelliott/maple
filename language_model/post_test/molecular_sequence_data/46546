We have constructed a zzso library of zzso zzso rabbit DNA in the zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso sequences were screened with a b4 zzso probe and were characterized by restriction zzso One of the clones contained a zzso sequence different from the b4 zzso normally expressed by the zzso We report here the zzso sequence of this gene and show that it probably zzso to a zzso form of the zzso zzso It appears to be a structurally complete gene without any stop zzso within the coding region and containing the zzso AG as a zzso site zzso for the zzso zzso just zzso of the coding zzso zzso with the b4 zzso zzso sequence shows a separate evolution of the zzso and zzso zzso since the zzso regions are more zzso than the coding zzso zzso zzso analysis would suggest that the zzso gene is zzso in the domestic rabbit population, since it lies within a zzso zzso or zzso restriction fragment, which was shown to be common to all zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso rabbit zzso
