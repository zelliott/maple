The zzso for a human zzso zzso of bacterial zzso and zzso zzso translation initiation factor two zzso has been identified during a screen for proteins which interact with zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with a predicted relative molecular mass of 139 zzso though zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso at 180 zzso zzso has an extended zzso compared with its zzso although its central zzso domain and zzso are highly zzso with zzso sequence identity with zzso We have confirmed that zzso is required for general translation in human cells by generation of a point zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso protein behaves in a zzso manner in transient zzso and leads to a significant decrease in the translation of a reporter zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and the protein complex can be zzso from human zzso This interaction appears to block zzso function, since zzso zzso protein zzso translation in a zzso zzso zzso does not zzso to any of the previously characterized translation initiation factors identified in zzso but its essential role in translation appears to have been zzso from bacteria to zzso
