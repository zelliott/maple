Two cellular zzso acid binding zzso zzso I and II, which behaved differently on a zzso column, were zzso from zzso chick zzso Their molecular weights were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso acid sequence of zzso I was identical to that of bovine zzso which was reported zzso zzso II was a novel cellular zzso acid binding zzso in which the zzso acids at 6 positions of the zzso terminal sequence are different from those in zzso zzso The zzso between zzso I and II was more than zzso
