zzso peptides combine two activities in a single zzso that work in an independent fashion like many other zzso zzso zzso We zzso that emergent functions may result from the combination of two or more activities in a single protein domain and that could be a mechanism selected in nature to form zzso zzso We designed zzso peptides using the two mechanisms proposed to be involved in the evolution of such molecules zzso to mutate zzso zzso and the use of zzso unfolded zzso We observed that our zzso peptides exhibited two activities that together rendered a new function that zzso cell death in zzso Thus, we propose that zzso in proteins promotes emergent properties providing a further level of complexity in living organisms so far zzso
