In the G zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso motif connects the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The less zzso constrained retinal analogue zzso prevents efficient transformation of zzso to signaling zzso zzso II after retinal zzso Here, we demonstrate that Ala replacement zzso within the zzso domain, which eliminate an interaction between aromatic zzso zzso and zzso allow formation of zzso II despite the presence of zzso Also a zzso bond linking zzso zzso and 313 in the zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso II formation, whereas the reduced form of the zzso readily transformed to zzso II after zzso These observations suggest that the interaction between zzso zzso and 313 is disrupted during the zzso zzso II zzso However, this enhancement in zzso II formation is not reflected in the G protein zzso which is dramatically reduced for these zzso suggesting that changes in the zzso interaction also lead to a proper realigning of zzso 8 after zzso The zzso zzso located in the second zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso to different degrees, depending on the position of the Ala replacement in the zzso zzso thus revealing distinct roles for the zzso and zzso zzso Our studies underscore the importance of the zzso and zzso motifs in providing structural constraints in zzso that rearrange in response to zzso during formation of the G zzso zzso zzso The dual control of the structural zzso zzso reliable transformation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
