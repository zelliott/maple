The zzso zzso zzso zzso releasing zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso in an zzso the sea zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso precursor is the first identified in an ancient lineage of zzso and has the same overall zzso structure as other zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and the processing site zzso are highly zzso during 500 million years of evolution with zzso identity compared with those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso associated zzso regions are markedly zzso with less than zzso identity compared with all identified zzso zzso Unlike all other known zzso zzso zzso which typically have one and in a single case two zzso three distinct transcripts were isolated and zzso in zzso These zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso differed in the length of the GAP coding sequence and were demonstrated to be the products of a single zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso junction demonstrated that alternate zzso produces the different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso gene demonstrated to zzso zzso sequence zzso to produce multiple zzso which may reflect an ancestral gene regulatory zzso
