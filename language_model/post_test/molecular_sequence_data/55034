zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from human malaria zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli, zzso to zzso and characterized for the first time as a biological target for zzso agents against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso heat stability corresponding to the highest level of activity was observed at zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso activity in the presence of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the values of zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Comparative protein modeling indicated an additional space in the zzso binding site of the zzso zzso compared with that of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso acid zzso zzso forming the additional space revealed a zzso increase in the zzso zzso value when replaced by a smaller zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was markedly affected by introducing a larger zzso zzso thus creating the potential to develop a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso
