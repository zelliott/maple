The available zzso DNA zzso data do not point to clear genetic relationships between current zzso and the zzso inhabitants of zzso the zzso To understand how and when such a genetic zzso may have zzso we extracted and typed the zzso of 27 medieval zzso from an initial sample of 61, spanning a period between the 10th and 15th century zzso We then tested by serial zzso simulation various models describing the zzso relationships among past and current inhabitants of zzso the latter including three samples (from zzso zzso and zzso that were recently claimed to be of zzso zzso zzso and medieval zzso share three zzso zzso but fall in distinct branches of the zzso zzso in the only model that proved compatible with the zzso Under that model, contemporary people of Tuscany show clear genetic relationships with zzso people, but not with the zzso along the female zzso No evidence of excess zzso was found in the zzso zzso by a zzso test, and so there is no reason to suspect that these results are biased by systematic contamination of the ancient sequences or laboratory zzso zzso demographic changes before zzso 1000 are thus the simplest explanation for the differences between the contemporary and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso continuity between ancient and modern populations of the same area does not seem a safe general zzso but rather a hypothesis that, when possible, should be tested using ancient DNA zzso
