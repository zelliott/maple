An unconventional zzso beta zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the decision between zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have studied the zzso zzso which, along with the zzso zzso zzso is antagonized by upstream receptors and zzso zzso We show that zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso that binds to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso like zzso is a regulator of zzso in a zzso beta zzso signaling zzso However, we present evidence that zzso is an unconventional zzso zzso because zzso acts as a zzso rather than an zzso of a zzso zzso We show that expressing zzso in the nervous system zzso a zzso zzso whereas muscle or zzso expression does zzso Previous work suggested that zzso and zzso function in zzso muscle to regulate gene zzso but our analysis of regulation of a zzso specific promoter suggests zzso We present a model in which zzso and zzso control the production or release of a hormone from the nervous system by either regulating the expression of zzso genes or by altering the connectivity or the differentiated state of zzso
