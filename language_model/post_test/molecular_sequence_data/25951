We have obtained low frequency (less than 200 zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA and zzso as a function of water content and zzso species and of zzso and zzso zzso We have found that the zzso scattering from water in the first and second zzso shells does not contribute directly to the zzso zzso of zzso We have determined the number of strong zzso active modes by comparing zzso for different sample zzso and zzso and by obtaining fits to the zzso We have found at least five zzso active modes in the zzso of A- and zzso The zzso of the modes above 40 zzso do not vary with zzso species, and there are only relatively small changes upon zzso These modes are, therefore, almost completely zzso The mode near 34 zzso in zzso is mostly zzso whereas the mode near 25 zzso is dominated by zzso zzso The observed intensity changes upon zzso were found to be due to the decrease in zzso zzso zzso length appears to play a role in the lowest frequency zzso
