During zzso DNA synthesis in zzso the human zzso virus, type 1 zzso reverse zzso encounters template zzso positions at which continued synthesis is zzso At these positions, the zzso has a relatively high probability of zzso from the template, and product molecules of corresponding length accumulate as the incubation zzso These positions, which are known as termination sites, could be associated with template secondary structures in some cases, but many termination sites appear to be template zzso rather than secondary zzso zzso producing these blocks in zzso DNA synthesis are not well zzso In this study, to examine further the effects of template sequence on zzso we engineered selected zzso changes in the zzso template, and we found that such changes can influence zzso Several general trends emerged from the zzso First, strong termination sites rarely zzso to zzso as the zzso zzso opposite template zzso Second, the sequence of the zzso stem is more important for termination than the sequence of the zzso template ahead of the zzso Thus, we note the phenomenon of action at a zzso changing sequence at one zzso position in the zzso stem alters termination at other positions, a few zzso distant at the primer 3' zzso A and C as template bases in the zzso stem have opposite zzso A is the strongest zzso zzso and C is the weakest zzso zzso followed by zzso Since termination sites are produced by reverse zzso zzso from the zzso the results suggest that the zzso reverse zzso has properties reminiscent of a zzso zzso zzso protein in that its binding mechanism can distinguish both base zzso and positions in the zzso DNA zzso zzso
