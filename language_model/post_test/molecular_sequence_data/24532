zzso of the zzso gene was investigated in lung zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso in male zzso zzso Animals at 6 weeks of age were given 2000 zzso of zzso in drinking water for 12 weeks, then maintained without further treatment until killed at the end of week zzso A total of 25 lung zzso were obtained and total zzso were extracted from each for assessment of zzso zzso of the zzso gene by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected in 15 zzso zzso as absence in the regions of zzso zzso -9 to 279, zzso to 279, zzso to 348 or zzso to zzso zzso zzso were also extracted from all 25 zzso and zzso zzso were examined for zzso using zzso strand zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso A zzso was detected in only one zzso zzso an zzso to zzso zzso to zzso transition at zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of eight tumors did not show any evidence of gross zzso or deletion of the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed reduced expression of zzso protein in six out of 10 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso gene may be involved in the development of lung zzso induced by zzso in zzso
