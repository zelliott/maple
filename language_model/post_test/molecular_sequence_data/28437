All zzso of the human zzso zzso gene were cloned from zzso and zzso libraries and zzso including zzso base pairs of upstream zzso The gene contains 17 zzso and covers at least 150 zzso pairs of zzso zzso The zzso start site was identified by both zzso mapping and primer zzso a typical zzso box was found 25 bases upstream of the putative start zzso A comparison of the gene structures of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso revealed that the positions of the 3rd through 11th zzso junctions in zzso zzso coincide exactly with those of the 2nd through 11th zzso junctions in zzso except the 7th zzso zzso that does not have any counterpart in zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso separation pattern in each junction is well zzso between both zzso Four zzso unique to zzso zzso are located at the 3' end of the gene zzso zzso each of which encompasses a different protein zzso Three of these zzso representing zzso 13, 14, and 15, bear significant similarities to zzso 2 zzso the zzso zzso and a typical zzso domain, zzso The genes coding for these zzso were probably fused to an ancestral zzso gene to generate the present zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso loss, and/or zzso and zzso zzso have played important roles in the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso
