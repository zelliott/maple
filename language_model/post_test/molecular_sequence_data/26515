G protein coupled receptors are responsible for a wide variety of signaling responses in diverse cell zzso Despite major advances in the determination of structures of this class of zzso the underlying mechanisms by which binding of different types of zzso specifically elicits particular signaling responses remain zzso The use of zzso zzso can provide important information about the process of zzso binding and zzso dependent zzso changes in zzso especially kinetic aspects of these processes that can be difficult to extract from X-ray zzso We present an overview of the extensive array of fluorescent zzso that have been used in studies of G protein coupled receptors and describe zzso approaches for zzso binding and probing the environment of zzso zzso with particular attention to examples involving zzso zzso zzso In addition, we discuss the use of zzso zzso for detecting and characterizing zzso changes in receptors induced by the binding of zzso Such studies have provided strong evidence for diversity of zzso zzso zzso by different zzso consistent with the idea that zzso are not simple on and off zzso This diversity of states constitutes an underlying zzso basis for biased zzso the observation that different stimuli can produce different responses from a single zzso It is likely that continued technical advances will allow zzso zzso to play an important role in continued probing of structural transitions in G protein coupled zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of membrane zzso zzso
