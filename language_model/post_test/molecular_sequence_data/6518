The zzso zzso is a basic zzso zzso protein and functions as a zzso DNA binding protein directly interacting with target genes by binding to zzso responsive zzso We have sought to identify possible cellular proteins that can interact with the zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso was fused to zzso zzso and the resulting fusion protein was used as a probe to help us to identify zzso associated zzso At least one such zzso zzso zzso was detected in mouse liver zzso but it does not bind to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso nor to the zzso domain of zzso zzso or zzso zzso
