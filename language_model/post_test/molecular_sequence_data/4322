A method to zzso zzso proteins for structural studies with zzso is zzso The technique is based on in zzso translation of zzso zzso zzso starts with zzso zzso acids from the initiation zzso of the zzso and continues to the beginning of the region of zzso Here, the zzso pause while the zzso charged with zzso zzso acids are replaced with zzso charged with zzso zzso zzso zzso then proceeds through the region of interest until the zzso pause at its zzso At this point zzso are changed zzso zzso is resumed with zzso zzso acids and continues to the STOP zzso of the zzso where the zzso zzso In the final step the complete, zzso protein is zzso from the column in almost pure zzso The method is demonstrated for small scale synthesis of the DNA binding domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso where the zzso zzso is zzso but the rest of zzso is zzso The new technique can be zzso to allow a desired region in a protein to be zzso
