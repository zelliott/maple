We have cloned the B zzso in zzso zzso using DNA from a zzso zzso of B, which has a P element inserted at the B zzso The analysis of the B DNA reveals that there is a zzso element, zzso right at the zzso This suggests that this element may have been involved in the generation of the B zzso and the associated tandem zzso One possible mechanism to generate the B zzso is a zzso event between two zzso zzso one at zzso and the other at zzso DNA sequencing data of the junctions of the zzso element support this zzso Four partial zzso of B are the result of insertions of zzso elements very close to the B zzso This supports the hypothesis that the zzso is the cause of the B zzso The clones from B were used to isolate zzso clones from zzso the location of the Bar zzso Four zzso zzso associated with various Bar zzso map within a zzso region, suggesting that the Bar gene is very zzso
