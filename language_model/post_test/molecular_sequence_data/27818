A zzso expression strategy was used to zzso zzso acid sequences which were specific for fast, as opposed to slow, zzso of the chicken skeletal muscle zzso heavy chain zzso and which were zzso in zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared that reacted with all of the known chicken fast zzso zzso but did not react with any of the known chicken slow nor with smooth muscle zzso zzso The zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were on the zzso head zzso of the zzso whereas the zzso recognized by zzso zzso was on the zzso tail or rod zzso zzso of all five zzso also was confined to fast zzso in the zzso with the exception of zzso zzso which also reacted with the zzso zzso the single slow zzso zzso common to both the rat heart and skeletal zzso None of the five zzso was expressed on zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were found on zzso electric zzso zzso zzso frog, turtle, chicken, zzso zzso and rat zzso The zzso recognized by these zzso were zzso therefore, to varying degrees through zzso evolution and differed in sequence from zzso regions of a number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence of those zzso on the head were mapped using a zzso zzso expression zzso First, zzso zzso zzso was used to rapidly generate fragments of a chicken embryonic fast zzso zzso that were progressively deleted from the 3' zzso These zzso fragments were expressed as zzso fusion proteins using the zzso zzso the fusion proteins were tested by zzso for zzso with the zzso and the approximate locations of the zzso were determined from the sizes of the zzso fragments that zzso a particular zzso The zzso were then precisely mapped by expression of overlapping zzso fragments of known sequence that covered the approximate location of the zzso With this method, the zzso recognized by zzso zzso was mapped to zzso acids zzso of the chicken embryonic fast zzso and the three distinct zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were mapped to zzso acids approximately zzso Each of these zzso sequences is at or near the zzso active zzso
