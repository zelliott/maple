The zzso zzso a protein complex consisting of a zzso zzso and a pair of zzso regulatory particles zzso is involved in zzso zzso in zzso In zzso the zzso contains six different zzso zzso and, at least, 11 zzso zzso In this study, we identified the rice zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes from the rice expressed sequence tag zzso zzso The complete zzso sequences of the zzso for five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the partial sequences of one zzso zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Gene zzso of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso by duplicated zzso The rice zzso was zzso by zzso zzso with a zzso A column immobilized zzso against rice zzso zzso and the zzso composition was zzso The zzso obtained from the rice zzso library were identified as genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso from rice, including the both products of duplicated genes by using zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso modifications and processing in rice zzso zzso were also zzso Various types of zzso complex with different zzso compositions are present in rice cells, suggesting the multiple functions of rice zzso
