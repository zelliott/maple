A novel protein target of mouse zzso zzso was detected by a gel overlay method with zzso zzso zzso of zzso with its 30 zzso target protein zzso present in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells depended on the presence of zzso zzso The binding of zzso evidenced by the reaction with zzso zzso was found to be of higher affinity than the binding between mouse zzso and zzso II or zzso zzso zzso of tissue extracts by the gel overlay method has shown that zzso is present not only in the EAT cells but also in mouse brain and zzso This novel target protein of mouse zzso was zzso to zzso from EAT cells by means of zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and a partial zzso acid sequence of one of the resulting peptides was zzso A database search analysis revealed that the sequence is unique, with a similarity of less than zzso to any other known protein zzso
