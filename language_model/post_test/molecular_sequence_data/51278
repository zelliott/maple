Nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso zzso the expression of numerous genes via interaction with a specific DNA sequence termed the zzso B zzso Its activity is modulated by a zzso inhibitor protein termed I zzso B, and its zzso occurs in response to a variety of agents in a variety of cell types, most notably B and T zzso Data presented here show that an activity zzso complex I) that binds specifically to the zzso B site is induced in zzso zzso mouse zzso by zzso growth factor zzso a potent zzso for these zzso Increased levels of complex I, as evaluated by zzso mobility shift zzso of nuclear zzso were observed in cells treated for zzso h (but not 15 zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the AA zzso of zzso also zzso this response and both zzso but not zzso were effective in cells depleted of protein zzso zzso Complex I most likely is authentic zzso B, a zzso zzso or a closely related factor because it exhibited properties characteristic of those previously described for zzso B including zzso by zzso and zzso and sensitivity to I zzso zzso A second zzso B binding activity zzso zzso which apparently contained zzso zzso displayed limited induction by zzso whereas a third complex zzso zzso migrated faster than but behaved similarly to complex zzso These studies suggest that zzso B or an zzso zzso factor may participate in the expression of zzso zzso
