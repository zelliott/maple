A full-length zzso zzso chicken tumor necrosis factor zzso 15 zzso was isolated and its functional role was zzso zzso transcripts were primarily expressed in zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso and zzso In zzso infection of zzso zzso with three species of zzso zzso induced zzso gene zzso In zzso experiments revealed that zzso gene was highly increased following primary infections with zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, no consistent changes in transcript levels were seen following primary infection with zzso zzso or following secondary infection with any of the three zzso zzso Following infection with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts were primarily expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso protein was observed on zzso and zzso tumor zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an important role in local inflammatory response to zzso
