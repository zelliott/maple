Sea turtle zzso zzso is a disease marked by proliferation of benign but debilitating zzso zzso and occasional visceral zzso zzso experiments have implicated a zzso transforming agent present in filtered zzso tumor zzso in the zzso of zzso In this study, consensus primer zzso methodology was used to test the association of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso and skin samples were obtained from 17 green and 2 zzso zzso affected with zzso stranded along the Florida zzso zzso zzso and visceral tumors from the 19 zzso and 33 skin samples from 16 of the zzso were zzso All zzso affected with zzso had zzso associated with their tumors as detected by zzso zzso percent zzso of the tumors, but only zzso zzso of the skin samples, from affected zzso contained zzso zzso The skin samples that contained zzso were all within 2 zzso of a zzso Also, 1 of 11 zzso tissue samples from sites where zzso had been removed 2 to 51 zzso earlier from 5 green zzso contained zzso zzso None of 18 normal skin samples from 2 green and 2 zzso zzso stranded without zzso contained zzso The data indicated that zzso was zzso only within or close to zzso To determine if the same virus infected both turtle species, partial zzso sequences of the zzso DNA zzso gene were determined from 6 zzso and 2 green turtle zzso The sequences predicted that zzso of zzso zzso differed from those of green zzso by only 1 of 60 zzso acids in the sequence zzso indicating that a zzso zzso exhibiting minor zzso variation was the only zzso present in tumors of both green and zzso zzso The zzso zzso resisted zzso on zzso cell lines which support the replication of other zzso zzso These results lead to the conclusion that a zzso zzso is regularly associated with zzso and is not merely an incidental finding in affected zzso
