The sequence of a cloned zzso zzso gene showed zzso zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso with its putative zzso in zzso zzso zzso is the reported but zzso disputed structural locus for zzso zzso zzso Database searches identified zzso related gene sequences from 15 zzso species from diverse zzso zzso trees based on alignments of zzso protein zzso DNA, and protein motif searches and protein secondary structure predictions produced results consistent with expectations for genes that are zzso The only inconsistency was that the zzso appears to be more primitive in the zzso than in zzso In zzso plants, and zzso these genes have been shown to code for a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regulatory complex of zzso zzso The analyses indicated that the insect genes contain no divergent structural features, which taken within an appraisal of all available data, makes the reported alternative function highly zzso A plausible additional role, in which the zzso zzso is implicated in regulation of zzso zzso would also apply to at least the zzso zzso No function has yet been reported for the other included zzso These were from zzso projects and included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A consensus of the results predicts a protein containing exceptionally long stretches of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso site motifs were identified at two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding motifs were found at zzso positions upstream of the zzso zzso The location of zzso zzso zzso was determined by in zzso zzso at zzso on zzso arm zzso It is in a zzso gene cluster with respect to the other zzso However, the zzso zzso cluster contains a gene showing significant sequence identity to human and pigeon zzso zzso zzso therefore showing divergence with the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso
