zzso zzso of zzso fatty acids provides the majority of the energy required for cardiac zzso Several zzso including the integral membrane protein zzso zzso zzso zzso are being implicated in the process of zzso fatty acid zzso To further characterize the role of zzso in rat zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso rat zzso was zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence indicates that rat zzso is highly zzso zzso with its zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso share several zzso regions with putative counterparts found in zzso and zzso Given the large evolutionary distance between these species, these regions might be important for protein zzso The predicted membrane zzso of rat zzso is zzso
