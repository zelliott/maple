zzso zzso zzso zzso were proposed as scaffolds for selection of zzso with potential zzso zzso We tested the feasibility of this approach by constructing a large zzso 5 zzso zzso library where all zzso acids in two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to four zzso zzso A, D, or zzso Three zzso were selected from this library by panning against a zzso zzso The strongest zzso zzso recognized specifically a highly zzso zzso zzso and inhibited to various zzso seven out of nine zzso zzso from different zzso The loop BC and the zzso state of the scaffold are critical for its zzso These results provide a proof of concept for the potential of zzso as a scaffold for construction of libraries containing potentially useful zzso The newly identified zzso zzso could be further improved to candidate zzso and/or used as research zzso for exploration of zzso zzso zzso
