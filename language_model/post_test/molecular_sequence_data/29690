In this study, we have investigated the diversity of current zzso strains circulating in the metropolitan area of zzso zzso A total of 217 zzso blood samples, collected between October 1998 and December 2000, was genetically characterized in the zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso or part of the zzso zzso segment zzso zzso zzso by zzso mobility zzso zzso and/or DNA zzso The zzso zzso efficiency zzso of samples zzso zzso by zzso divided by the total number of samples zzso was zzso zzso of zzso with indeterminate migration patterns of zzso A and G strains contributing significantly to this zzso On the overall, zzso B was the most prevalent zzso followed by zzso G zzso A zzso and F zzso whereas zzso C, D, zzso and J accounted altogether for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were responsible for zzso and zzso of the infections among African immigrants and Portuguese subjects, zzso Angolan individuals zzso zzso 25) were the only ones infected with all the zzso zzso zzso probably reflecting a high degree of viral genetic diversification in their country of zzso zzso analysis showed a predominance of zzso viruses among zzso A sequences and two new major zzso within zzso G zzso and zzso The majority of the Portuguese G sequences described formed a zzso zzso zzso supported by zzso values zzso zzso distant from zzso G sequences in zzso gag zzso sequence analysis of these zzso confirmed the maintenance of the zzso G zzso The multiple zzso observed for the major zzso A, B, D, and G, as well as the variety of zzso found, indicate a high diversity of zzso zzso circulating in zzso and suggest a need for continuous zzso zzso
