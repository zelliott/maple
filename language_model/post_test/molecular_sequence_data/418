zzso has been proposed to be the zzso sensor in hair cell zzso zzso for the classical synaptic fusion proteins zzso and zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso reveal zzso VI as a novel zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggest an interaction of both proteins within the zzso part of inner hair cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso VI zzso mice indicates zzso and complementary roles of zzso VI and zzso for synaptic zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso mice exhibited a decoupling of zzso and zzso and severe reduction of zzso zzso zzso VI zzso zzso failed to transport BK channels to the membrane of the zzso cell regions, and the zzso zzso efficiency did not zzso zzso zzso and zzso VI zzso zzso showed a reduced zzso synaptic surface area and altered active zone zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicated disturbed transport of zzso zzso and link the above zzso changes to a complementary role of zzso and zzso VI in transport of zzso compartments to the zzso zzso zzso
