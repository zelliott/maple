The zzso virus DR promoter is located upstream of the zzso repeats, and in addition to the zzso box, it contains an upstream region zzso zzso to zzso responsive to zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso with two functionally distinct zzso A and zzso zzso B has been described as a zzso zzso element zzso zzso Lieberman, zzso zzso Hardwick, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso by zzso and zzso an zzso early product zzso by the open reading frame zzso zzso zzso Cox, zzso Leahy, and zzso zzso Hardwick, zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that domain B is an zzso element in zzso cells and is therefore not an zzso zzso zzso However, there is an zzso site zzso located within the zzso zzso zzso zzso can be deleted without affecting the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, there is no cooperation or zzso between R and zzso when zzso the B domain zzso plus the zzso zzso positioned as an zzso zzso is therefore not part of the zzso zzso We have tested several zzso of the DR zzso B domain, either alone or in zzso for their capacity to transmit the zzso signal to the rabbit zzso zzso We found that the zzso element is composed of four zzso that span the whole B zzso These zzso alone are zzso or not responsive to zzso One of the zzso contains the overlapping zzso zzso However, one zzso either alone or zzso or the overlapping zzso did not respond to zzso
