A zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso S zzso gives rise to cell division and DNA replication defects in zzso zzso The zzso gene is transcribed throughout the zzso and is transcribed at similar rates in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but in the zzso the zzso S zzso is unstable leading to lower zzso S zzso zzso The zzso zzso results from a single base change in one of the zzso stems of the mature zzso and is completely rescued by a zzso zzso in the opposite zzso providing confirmation of the predicted secondary structure of the zzso S zzso The zzso zzso gene was shown to be functionally comparable to the zzso coli zzso gene by zzso zzso of the zzso strain to a zzso zzso strain of zzso also having zzso and DNA replication zzso showed that both exhibit a permanent induction of a heat shock response at the restrictive zzso To explain the zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso we propose that a zzso checkpoint prevents further progression through the zzso in response to increased zzso levels of heat shock and zzso zzso
