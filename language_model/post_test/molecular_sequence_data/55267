zzso is a specific zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso specifically enhances association of zzso zzso and provides a significant advantage for bacteria in zzso and zzso zzso Here, the crystal structure of zzso in complex with zzso and its structure in solution were zzso The structure of zzso is similar to that of the zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso in the recognition and binding of the zzso and the zzso domain zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso However, there are distinct positively charged zzso and a distribution of zzso zzso contributing to the charged surface patch, especially in the zzso of zzso for direct binding of zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso and zzso characterized by both gel zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could bind zzso independently and zzso binding was achieved by the zzso accomplished by a zzso role of the zzso The model of the zzso complex suggested that zzso may unfold its zzso zzso in the positively charged zzso between the zzso and zzso and then zzso zzso from its zzso pairing with zzso and flips out to insert into the active zzso Our structure and zzso studies provide novel insights into the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso
