Natural products produced by zzso are important starting compounds for drug zzso Secondary zzso including zzso have been isolated from different zzso zzso The production of these zzso depends on the culture zzso zzso the development of a new culture method can facilitate the discovery of new natural zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso bacteria can influence the zzso of cryptic natural products in zzso zzso The production of red zzso by zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso with zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso Only living cells induced this zzso production, which was not zzso by any zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso synthesis in other zzso strains too: it altered zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso strains isolated from zzso The other zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso and zzso zzso altered zzso in zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso broth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contained a novel antibiotic, which we named zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso acid localized in the outer cell layer of the zzso zzso influences secondary metabolism in zzso and this activity is a result of the direct interaction between the zzso zzso bacteria and zzso We used these results to develop a new zzso method, called the zzso method, which zzso the screening of natural zzso
