zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zinc zzso which converts zzso into the zzso zzso zzso and also exhibits an zzso zzso zzso In the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are found at the entrance of the active zzso Here we report that replacement of zzso but not zzso leads to complete zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso do not seem to affect zzso binding strength, because values of zzso for zzso are almost identical for wild type and zzso zzso These results are supported by the zzso crystal structure of zzso zzso which does not reveal structural changes that can explain the complete loss of zzso zzso For the zzso reaction, zzso of zzso reduce the zzso activity zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso have limited effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking a positive charge, values of the zzso constant for zzso increase significantly zzso zzso zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso plays an unexpected, critical role in the zzso zzso reaction, presumably in the positioning of the zzso tail to ensure perfect zzso alignment along the zzso elements of the active zzso In the zzso reaction, zzso and zzso seem to cooperate to provide sufficient binding strength and productive alignment of the zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso possess distinct roles as zzso recognition sites for two chemically different zzso each of which is turned over in separate zzso reactions zzso by zzso zzso
