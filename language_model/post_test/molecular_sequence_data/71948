A viral zzso of the late kinetic class expressed by zzso zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso whose predicted zzso designated zzso has zzso to beta zzso zzso zzso MacDonald, zzso Li, and zzso zzso Virgin IV, zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study analyzed further the structure of the transcript in infected zzso zzso A zzso event removed the zzso stop zzso bringing a downstream zzso into frame with the zzso zzso and demonstrating that the zzso zzso was an zzso of a larger zzso The predicted zzso zzso designated zzso contains a putative zzso signal sequence and a beta zzso domain, followed by a zzso domain without significant zzso to known zzso zzso analysis of zzso forms in zzso zzso cells at late times after infection indicated that the viral zzso zzso was predominantly zzso There was no evidence for expression of zzso zzso either zzso or zzso at immediate early or early times after infection with zzso zzso zzso generated against zzso expressed zzso recognized multiple proteins in the range of approximately 30 to approximately 45 zzso in Western zzso analysis of zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a similar group of proteins in zzso zzso cells metabolically labeled with radioactive zzso zzso protein of apparent higher molecular mass was zzso from culture medium zzso the zzso cells, suggesting that zzso modified zzso can be zzso Two proteins with apparent molecular mass suggestive of zzso modification were detected by Western zzso analysis of cells harvested at late times after infection with zzso These studies show that zzso encodes and expresses a beta zzso zzso with a novel predicted zzso
