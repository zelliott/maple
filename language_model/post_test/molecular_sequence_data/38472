zzso changes in B zzso migration are important for normal immune function, yet the mechanisms by which these changes occur are poorly zzso Because zzso direct many zzso movements, molecules that regulate signaling by G zzso zzso receptors are likely to participate in zzso zzso changes in cell zzso In this study, we have investigated the expression pattern and activity in zzso B cells of members of the regulators of G protein signaling zzso family of zzso We present the sequence of mouse zzso and describe a novel short zzso of zzso that we term zzso Following in zzso zzso by zzso B cells rapidly zzso expression of zzso and zzso while simultaneously decreasing expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso egg zzso zzso B cells are also shown to have slightly elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by contrast, fails to cause rapid zzso of zzso or zzso Using a transient zzso approach in a mature B cell line, zzso we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are effective zzso of zzso toward the zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso whereas zzso has a minimal effect on migration to these zzso Together these findings support the conclusion that zzso changes in zzso zzso expression are part of the mechanism by which zzso zzso signaling regulates B cell migration within zzso zzso The findings also suggest important roles for additional G zzso events in B cell zzso and zzso
