A full-length zzso clone zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows high zzso to both the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and to different zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso expression system, we have expressed and zzso the protein with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange of zzso in the zzso exchange zzso zzso of zzso in both human and insect cells leads to high levels of zzso zzso to the zzso and in insect cells the first 18 zzso acids constitute the zzso zzso signal zzso Until now the human zzso zzso zzso zzso was thought to function as the zzso possibly in the form of a zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso signal sequence was ever detected and the present identification of a different zzso almost certainly rules out that zzso The zzso shows kinetic properties similar to human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is not induced by zzso as is zzso
