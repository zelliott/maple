zzso is a classical zzso of the drug zzso zzso zzso zzso but the molecular mechanism of induction has not been zzso zzso analyses have identified a zzso unit in the rat zzso and mouse zzso genes about zzso zzso pairs from the zzso start site, but little or no changes in protein binding to this region were observed in zzso To examine the role of zzso structure, protein binding to the zzso unit assessed by in zzso zzso I zzso was compared with that assessed by zzso I in zzso zzso in native zzso A region centered on a putative nuclear zzso site was the major protected region in in zzso zzso and there were no zzso differences in binding between extracts from control and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment dramatically altered the protection pattern in native zzso In control samples a core region of about 25 base pairs zzso centered on the nuclear zzso site was zzso However, after zzso treatment, the protection of this core region was increased, and more dramatically the region of protection was extended 20 zzso to either side so that a total of about 60 zzso were zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso treatment alters the composition or architecture of proteins binding to the zzso unit region and indicate that zzso structure is important in this zzso Because proteins are bound to the region in the zzso animal, the mechanism of induction involves the zzso of proteins bound to the region and possibly recruitment of additional regulatory proteins rather than conversion of a closed zzso structure to an open one that can bind regulatory zzso
