zzso zzso in genes zzso several components of the zzso zzso have been linked with inherited predisposition to zzso Most commonly, such zzso involve zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor of two zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the zzso protein zzso and thereby promote passage through the zzso zzso restriction zzso Less zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene have also been linked with an increased risk of zzso Despite the sequence and functional zzso between zzso and zzso the role of zzso zzso in zzso in melanoma predisposition is zzso We detected no zzso zzso within the zzso zzso binding domain in index cases from 60 zzso zzso that lacked zzso zzso in the coding regions of either zzso or within the entire zzso coding zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in zzso do not make a significant contribution to melanoma zzso
