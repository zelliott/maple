A complementary zzso acid zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso was isolated and its transport properties characterized by zzso techniques after expression in zzso zzso zzso A zzso inward movement of positive charges zzso zzso was observed upon zzso with zzso (and with zzso zzso the Na concentration led to a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the apparent zzso constant, zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso was increased by lowering the pH of the zzso but was not influenced by altering the zzso zzso zzso the zzso (and zzso concentration led to a zzso zzso in zzso zzso current zzso zzso for zzso at 100 zzso Na was around zzso zzso apparent zzso for zzso was around 1 zzso lowering the Na concentration decreased the apparent affinity for zzso The zzso zzso current was lower at more zzso pH values (at pH zzso it was about 50% of the value at pH zzso this pH dependence was similar if the zzso concentration was calculated in total, or if distinction was made between its zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the pH dependence of zzso zzso transport zzso zzso may not be related primarily to a zzso zzso in the availability of zzso zzso but includes also a competitive interaction of Na with zzso The effect of zzso and Na concentration on the apparent zzso values for Na or zzso respectively, provides evidence for an ordered interaction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso
