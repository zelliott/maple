zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso of zzso protein 1 zzso have been shown to function as zzso zzso To define a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed using an zzso zzso of a zzso zzso and plasma zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso reaction was monitored by zzso using zzso zzso The zzso proteins were isolated by zzso gel zzso and identified by mass zzso zzso Further, the zzso forms of these proteins were also zzso Two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 73 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1, zzso and 35 zzso zzso were specifically linked with the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that consists of two zzso zzso that are characteristic of a zzso zzso zzso zzso remained in the zzso particles and was released from the particles by the addition of zzso such as zzso zzso was released from the zzso by treatment with zzso zzso C, indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso was found to be a zzso zzso and is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso that contributes to directional root growth zzso Further, it is similar to zzso zzso zzso that contributes to zzso vascular patterning and to zzso zzso zzso that contributes to zzso tube zzso The present results indicate that zzso may contribute to directional cell growth processes via the zzso plasma membrane protein zzso and its family zzso
