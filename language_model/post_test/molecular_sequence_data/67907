zzso with a single zzso zzso domain are essential for the signal zzso across the cell zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool to study structure of the single TM zzso The expression and zzso of a TM domain in zzso coli zzso is challenging due to its small molecular zzso Although zzso zzso zzso is a commonly used affinity tag for expression and zzso of short zzso zzso tag needs to be removed with the toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of the TM domain of zzso zzso zzso using a zzso tag with the introduction of a zzso zzso site is described zzso The zzso fusion protein was zzso into zzso and was zzso with zzso Studies showed that zzso protein could be used for structural study using zzso zzso 

These results provide another strategy for obtaining a single TM domain for structural studies without using toxic chemical zzso or acid to remove the fusion zzso The zzso TM domain of zzso zzso zzso will be useful for structural zzso
