zzso is the zzso gene involved in the acute zzso leukemia associated zzso where it forms a fusion gene with zzso In order to gain insight into zzso role in zzso we have studied its functional zzso and expression pattern during zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso half of zzso encodes a region with zzso zzso activity which is disrupted by the zzso in human zzso We have also localized the zzso zzso protein to the nucleus supporting a role for zzso in zzso The zzso expression pattern of zzso was determined in zzso zzso and suggests zzso plays an important role in the development of the zzso zzso skeletal and central nervous zzso A repeating pattern of zzso expression in development is zzso with differentiation of a zzso Among the cell types where this pattern of zzso is noted are zzso These findings raise the possibility that the disruption of normal zzso function by the zzso may contribute to zzso
