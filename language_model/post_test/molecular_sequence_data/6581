The zzso gene was originally identified as a zzso primary response zzso However, in contrast to genes such as zzso and zzso zzso is also expressed at significant levels before and after the transient zzso induced by zzso We have zzso a zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso which includes 931 zzso upstream of the zzso start site identified by zzso zzso A zzso zzso fragment, including this zzso zzso directed the expression of the reporter gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Progressive zzso deletion indicated that an element located between zzso and zzso was responsible for most of this zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso showed that the sequence between zzso and zzso contained binding sites for cellular zzso the principal complexes involving zzso between zzso and zzso We conclude that these complexes may represent the zzso zzso element interactions that determine zzso zzso zzso
