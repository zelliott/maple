The zzso zzso zzso zzso is both the zzso zzso zzso channel and the target for the zzso zzso in the human zzso disease zzso zzso zzso In cloning and sequencing its components in man, we found that the zzso was transcribed in two zzso with zzso or without zzso a 75 base pair zzso that had not been described in other zzso While studying the human T zzso response to zzso zzso we found that part of this zzso insert was recognized by one T cell line (from an zzso zzso whereas another line only recognized the uninterrupted zzso zzso To establish whether this zzso is also translated in normal human muscle, we initially raised zzso zzso to the relevant zzso acid zzso but these failed to bind native zzso zzso from muscle on zzso zzso We therefore exploited the great sensitivity and specificity of these T cells to detect the two zzso after unfolding by zzso cells, and have been able to show that both are expressed in zzso human muscle zzso
