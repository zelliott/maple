The gene for mouse zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso family of hormones, appears to be predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso Mice deficient in zzso have revealed a role for this zzso in zzso zzso but the regulatory mechanisms of its function are still insufficiently zzso In the present study we showed that the zzso promoter was active in both zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso Interestingly, the activity of the zzso promoter as well as the expression of zzso zzso correlated with the amount of zzso factor 1 zzso expression in the four cell lines zzso The highest zzso activity zzso over zzso zzso was detected in zzso using the zzso promoter zzso immediately zzso of the zzso site, containing three consensus sequences for zzso zzso However, the promoter fragments including the zzso promoter also showed significant zzso promoter activity in both zzso and zzso cells, zzso induced over the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that all three zzso sites were needed to obtain zzso zzso zzso The most zzso zzso site at position zzso to zzso showed the highest affinity toward zzso but the promoter fragments, including the zzso site at position zzso to zzso showed the strongest response to zzso in terms of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso tumor cells and totally abolished zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso especially inhibited binding of zzso to the binding motifs locating at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso whereas no decrease was seen in the expression of zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that the zzso zzso promoter includes elements for both zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso zzso The data, zzso indicate differential binding affinities for the three zzso binding motifs toward zzso of which the motif locating at position zzso to zzso was the most critical for the promoter zzso
