The most time-consuming and problematic step in the overall zzso technique is the confirmation that the isolated zzso clone represents a zzso expressed zzso We have previously suggested that the majority of apparent false zzso generated by zzso do in fact result from the zzso zzso of zzso species which zzso with the zzso of interest, and we have outlined a procedure to effectively eliminate these from further zzso However, in situations where zzso is limiting, it is still desirable to confirm that a zzso zzso zzso does, in fact, represent the originally observed zzso expressed gene prior to embarking on expression zzso
