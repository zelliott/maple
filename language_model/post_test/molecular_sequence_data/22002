Cell zzso in the nervous system requires patterning genes dictating zzso coordinates as well as fate zzso In the case of zzso which are controlled by the family of zzso zzso factors, binding specificity and patterned expression trigger both differentiation and zzso In contrast, a single zzso glide cell zzso cell missing zzso is sufficient for all fly lateral zzso zzso How can different types of cells develop in the presence of a single fate zzso that is, how do differentiation and zzso pathways integrate and produce distinct zzso populations is not zzso By following an identified zzso we here show that zzso zzso is triggered by high zzso expression levels, zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor, provides a molecular link between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso does not activate zzso rather, it physically interacts with zzso thereby triggering its zzso These data emphasize the importance of fate zzso zzso quantitative regulation in the establishment of cell zzso
