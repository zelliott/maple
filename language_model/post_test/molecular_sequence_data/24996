We have cloned from zzso zzso zzso a repeated zzso the zzso repeated zzso which consists of zzso arranged zzso units and which is highly abundant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso By these features, the zzso repeat is similar to the zzso sequence of zzso zzso previously described by zzso However, their zzso sequences are profoundly zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were designed on the basis of the zzso sequence information and were used in a zzso zzso by which as little as 10 zzso of zzso DNA as well as individual zzso were zzso The zzso repeat zzso with DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not with DNA from zzso zzso nor from zzso zzso and zzso zzso A potential value of this zzso zzso is suggested for monitoring zzso zzso and infected snails only in bodies free of zzso zzso
