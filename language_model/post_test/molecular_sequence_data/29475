The zzso complex from zzso zzso is a general zzso regulatory zzso The proteins of this complex are involved in several aspects of zzso zzso including zzso initiation and zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which is part of the zzso zzso contains a zzso domain that displays zzso to an zzso zzso family of zzso We have analyzed the putative zzso properties of zzso and have found that it contains both zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a preference for zzso and for 3' zzso zzso implicating it as the zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso in the key, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain abolished both its in zzso activities and its in zzso zzso zzso zzso was active as a zzso and remained active in the absence of zzso which links zzso to the remainder of the zzso complex zzso These results establish that zzso and most probably other members of a widely distributed zzso family of proteins constitute a novel class of zzso zzso The various regulatory effects of the zzso complex on gene expression may be executed in part through these zzso zzso zzso
