zzso is the major zzso protein specifically expressed to a level as high as zzso of the total cellular protein within the first hour when zzso coli cell culture is shifted from 37 to 15 degrees C zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 87, zzso It consists of 70 zzso acid zzso with a very high content of aromatic zzso zzso was zzso and zzso to zzso Its secondary structure was analyzed by examining circular zzso at both the far and zzso zzso the results suggest that the protein is largely zzso in zzso The predominance of zzso structure in the protein was confirmed by using zzso infrared zzso A folded compact zzso was also verified by zzso zzso zzso We evaluated zzso delta zzso and delta S from the zzso zzso profile of the zzso zzso spectral features observed in the zzso region are attributed to the high content of aromatic zzso The protein is relatively small and contains no zzso zzso However, it is surprisingly stable to heat zzso
