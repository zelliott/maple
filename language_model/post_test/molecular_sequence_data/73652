zzso experiments involving the human zzso gene zzso and zzso nuclear extracts revealed a protected region called zzso containing an incomplete zzso element zzso zzso experiments identified two binding activities recognizing the zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso factor zzso relative that binds the half zzso motif and a second factor that interacts with a zzso motif located just upstream from the zzso The first factor appears to be zzso itself, as indicated by the zzso when using an zzso directed against zzso and the second zzso activity involved was shown to be zzso and exhibited an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This factor may represent a novel entity, which we named zzso for zzso Associated zzso Three copies of zzso sequence zzso a strong zzso zzso zzso to a zzso promoter in transient zzso zzso in zzso primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso containing the zzso element zzso in either the zzso or the zzso site showed that both motifs were required for this zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the combination of several individual zzso elements zzso in either the zzso or the zzso motif did not exhibit full zzso zzso This suggests that, in the context of the zzso element, zzso requires a close interaction with zzso to achieve both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
