zzso growth factor zzso a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the cell growth, migration and zzso of a wide variety of cells, and plays important roles in zzso in zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso is structurally zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene is expressed in zzso and zzso zzso In the present work, we cloned complementary DNA for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed its expression during zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso is zzso base pairs long and encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso and human Met proteins are zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regions showing particular zzso over zzso identity in the zzso acid sequences between zzso and zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a high level from the zzso to the zzso stage, while zzso zzso expression was seen from the early zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was specifically localized in the zzso region, zzso tissue of the zzso and neural zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a highly zzso zzso in a wide range of species, as is its zzso zzso The zzso system may be involved in early multiple zzso in zzso zzso
