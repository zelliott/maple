During bacterial zzso the binding of zzso zzso to zzso at the cell periphery leads to a response at the zzso zzso Three proteins appear to be required for zzso control of swimming behavior, the products of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we present the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene together with the zzso and characterization of its protein zzso The protein is a 73,000 Mr zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate that it belongs to a family of bacterial regulatory proteins including the products of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each member of this family has a zzso domain of approximately equal to 200 zzso within its C zzso We have previously shown that another zzso zzso zzso represents a domain of protein structure that has been zzso within a second large family of bacterial regulatory zzso Each protein of the zzso family seems to function as a regulator of a different zzso zzso Although each pair of proteins appears to produce a specialized response to a distinct type of zzso the relationships in primary structure suggest that a similar molecular mechanism may be zzso
