zzso is an essential factor for zzso zzso In this study, we identified a human zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso ORF, carrying 186 zzso zzso covered the entire 180 zzso acids of the zzso zzso domain of human zzso with zzso identity and zzso zzso FISH determined that human zzso gene was located at zzso 6 region zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso were expressed in various human zzso zzso We found that the zzso proteins exist in multiple zzso cells and chicken zzso Although the zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso factor, expression of zzso was nearly constant throughout the neural differentiation of zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso did not bind to the zzso nor direct zzso initiation in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was considerably lower (35 in alignment zzso than that between zzso zzso and human zzso zzso in alignment zzso Multiple zzso acids critical for the zzso function were deleted or zzso in zzso We suggest that zzso is not a bona fide zzso counterpart nor a direct descendant of zzso
