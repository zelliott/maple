The origin of zzso in zzso zzso represents a major transition in the zzso history of zzso This key zzso a zzso sieve that enables zzso permitted exploitation of a new ecological niche and heralded the evolution of modern zzso zzso the largest animals on zzso To date, all formally described zzso fossils conform to two zzso zzso species from zzso rocks ( approximately 24 to 34 million years old) and toothless species that presumably zzso zzso to feed zzso to approximately 30 million years zzso Here, we show that several zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso and associated zzso on the lateral portions of their zzso zzso structures in extant zzso house vessels that nourish zzso The simultaneous occurrence of teeth and zzso zzso implies that both teeth and zzso were present in these early zzso zzso analyses of a zzso that includes extinct zzso and new data for 11 nuclear genes consistently resolve relationships at the base of zzso The combined data set of zzso characters supports a zzso transition from a zzso zzso to a mosaic intermediate with both teeth and zzso to modern zzso zzso that lack an adult zzso but retain zzso and genetic evidence of their ancestral zzso zzso Comparative sequence data for zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso are present in zzso but have zzso to zzso in this zzso The dramatic transformation in zzso feeding anatomy documents an apparently rare, zzso mode of evolution in which a composite zzso bridged the gap between primitive and derived zzso a combination of fossil and molecular evidence provides a multifaceted record of this zzso zzso
