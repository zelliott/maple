zzso are carrier proteins that bind to lipids to form zzso particles and have been shown to play an important role in zzso zzso In this study, a full-length zzso for zzso zzso named zzso was cloned from the Chinese sturgeon zzso zzso This zzso sequence is zzso zzso in zzso and codes for a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso which is zzso and zzso identical to that of the rainbow trout and zzso respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso identical to frog, zzso and human zzso The predicted zzso protein has a zzso zzso zzso region with the potential to bind to zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso is expressed in all zzso examined with a preferential expression in the kidney and zzso During the zzso development stage, zzso zzso is low but still zzso at zzso stage zzso then zzso zzso reach a higher level in muscle contraction stage zzso this relatively stable expression persists during the following zzso stages and declines 1 day after zzso These results will serve as a basis for comparative studies on zzso zzso zzso
