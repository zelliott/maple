The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso plus a total of about 90 zzso pairs of zzso DNA, have been cloned and maps of restriction zzso zzso sites have been zzso Like their zzso from zzso zzso the rye genes are closely linked and are part of a zzso family of zzso repeats (the zzso zzso The rye repeat probably also contains a zzso zzso zzso which the wheat repeat is known to zzso However, despite the overall organizational similarity between the wheat and rye zzso repeats in the immediate vicinity of their coding regions, extensive zzso of zzso sequences has taken place during evolutionary divergence of the two zzso Our data provide additional support for an emerging picture of plant zzso zzso as evolving much more rapidly in structure than in zzso
