zzso is a zzso zzso produced by a zzso forest zzso with structural similarity to the zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso and genetic studies suggested that there are common steps in the zzso pathways for these zzso and showed similarities between some of the zzso A zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso by zzso with an zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso of this gene in zzso zzso resulted in zzso that could not produce zzso but that could convert zzso zzso zzso including zzso acid, into zzso The zzso also had reduced asexual zzso compared to the wild zzso So far four other genes are known to be clustered immediately alongside zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso are predicted to be zzso of zzso zzso zzso The other gene zzso located between zzso and zzso is predicted to zzso an zzso zzso for which there is no zzso in either the zzso or zzso gene zzso The zzso gene is located on a small zzso of approximately zzso zzso in size, along with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
