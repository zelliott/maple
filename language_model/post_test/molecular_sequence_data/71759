zzso zzso are a family of engineered dual zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso that are superior in comparison to the single zzso in their ability to promote the growth and maturation of zzso cells of the zzso zzso A series of zzso molecules were created which incorporated zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attached at locations that zzso to the zzso that connect the zzso of the zzso zzso bundle zzso The zzso linkage sites zzso the original sequence zzso were zzso 39, which is at the beginning of the first loop connecting zzso 1 and 2; zzso 97, which is in the turn connecting zzso 2 and 3; and zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are at the beginning, middle, and end, respectively, of the loop connecting zzso 3 and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of each zzso domain were zzso either by direct linkage of the zzso zzso or by replacement of the zzso zzso segment with a zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso All of the zzso molecules zzso the proliferation of both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso with the zzso zzso domain linked to zzso in the first zzso zzso or second zzso zzso long zzso zzso were found by CD zzso to have zzso contents similar to that expected for a protein comprised of two linked zzso zzso The zzso retained the ability to bind to the zzso with affinities similar to that of the parental zzso Using both a cell surface competitive binding zzso and surface zzso resonance detection of binding zzso the zzso were found to bind to the zzso zzso with low zzso zzso similar to that of zzso In a study of isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso 38, zzso zzso with the zzso zzso had lower zzso zzso zzso activities and zzso zzso than those which had the zzso zzso A similar trend was found for the zzso in which the zzso zzso activity is mostly a property of the zzso zzso Important exceptions were found in which the linkage to the zzso zzso domain either restored zzso attachment at zzso zzso or further decreased zzso at zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso domain is attached to the zzso domain was shown to be more potent than the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso in stimulating the production of zzso colonies in a human bone zzso zzso zzso unit zzso Several zzso also had decreased zzso activity in a zzso C4 release zzso using zzso human zzso It was found that circular zzso of the zzso domain can alter the ratio of zzso zzso activities, demonstrating that it is a useful tool in engineering zzso proteins with therapeutic zzso
