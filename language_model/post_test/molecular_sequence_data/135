zzso zzso is the second most abundant zzso zzso protein produced by the zzso cells called zzso and is found mainly in forming dental zzso zzso of its expression by gene knockout results in absence of the zzso layer and its replacement by a thin layer of zzso zzso zzso The objective of this study was to further characterize the zzso organ and zzso zzso produced in the zzso knockout zzso However, in the course of our study, we unexpectedly found that this mouse is in fact a zzso that does not express the full-length protein but that produces a truncated form of zzso zzso from wild type and zzso mice were processed for zzso analyses and zzso zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso were also prepared for molecular and zzso zzso In zzso from zzso zzso lost their polarized organization and the zzso organ detached from the tooth surface and became zzso A thin layer of zzso zzso material was deposited onto zzso and zzso masses were present within the zzso zzso These zzso materials generated lower zzso electron contrast than normal zzso and zzso with zzso gold revealed the presence of zzso bone zzso and zzso In addition, the height of the zzso bone was reduced, and the zzso zzso lost its zzso zzso and zzso results revealed that the altered zzso organ in the zzso mice produced a shorter zzso protein that is translated from truncated zzso missing zzso 5 and zzso These results indicate that absence of full-length protein and/or expression of an incomplete protein have zzso effects beyond structuring of mineral during zzso formation, and highlight potential functional regions on the zzso zzso
