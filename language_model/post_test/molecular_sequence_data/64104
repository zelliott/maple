From the time of DNA replication until zzso zzso sister zzso remain tightly paired along their zzso zzso is essential to establish zzso pairing during zzso and associates with DNA replication zzso DNA zzso zzso the DNA replication fork and thus will first encounter zzso sites destined for zzso In this study, I provide the first evidence that a DNA zzso is required for proper zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells reveal that zzso interacts genetically with both zzso and zzso two genes that function in zzso zzso zzso with genetic zzso zzso physically associates with zzso both in zzso and in zzso Finally, a functional zzso reveals that zzso is critical for zzso zzso Within the budding zzso zzso zzso exhibits the highest degree of sequence similarity to human zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies revealed that human zzso exhibits DNA zzso activities and that zzso is a zzso protein that associates with the tumor zzso zzso to maintain zzso zzso Our findings document a novel role for zzso in zzso cohesion and provide new insights into the possible mechanisms through which DNA zzso may contribute to cancer progression when zzso
