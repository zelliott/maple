zzso zzso I zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the sequential removal of zzso from the zzso zzso of various protein zzso We have isolated a zzso coding for zzso zzso from mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence codes for a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso comparison of this deduced sequence with that of rat and human zzso revealed zzso and zzso identity, zzso Using zzso zzso we obtained two zzso zzso zzso zzso clones that contained the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of seven zzso and 6 zzso and spans approximately 20 zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso zzso we localized zzso zzso to zzso zzso We determined that zzso protein is widely distributed in mouse zzso although its relative abundance varies from tissue to zzso In contrast to previous reports, we show here that zzso zzso and protein levels and zzso activity are unchanged during in zzso T cell zzso zzso that this zzso is not zzso for zzso zzso
