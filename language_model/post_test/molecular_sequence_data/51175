zzso of unstable zzso by protein analysis is often zzso However, it is facilitated by DNA analysis, especially in the case of zzso zzso zzso which produce a zzso zzso We have applied an efficient strategy to the detection of such zzso at the DNA level, based on zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of amplified DNA zzso This approach makes it possible to detect any anomaly in the zzso zzso We describe the use of the zzso method for rapid characterization of zzso zzso and report a new zzso zzso in the zzso gene third zzso beta zzso zzso which is responsible for the synthesis of a highly unstable zzso
