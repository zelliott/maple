In the ABC model of flower development, B function zzso genes act in the second and third whorls of the flower to control zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso has male, female, and zzso flowers and is an ideal system for testing the zzso gene expression patterns in zzso zzso We cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso box gene specific zzso zzso followed by zzso library screening and sequencing of positive zzso While zzso analyses show that zzso is the zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are representatives of the zzso zzso lineage that contain zzso motifs unlike the zzso gene observed in zzso These two zzso appeared to have originated from a tandem zzso occurred approximately zzso million year ago zzso zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that the zzso zzso genes were highly expressed in young flowers across all floral organ zzso As the flower zzso developed, all three zzso genes were highly expressed in petals of all zzso types and in zzso of zzso and male zzso zzso expressed at low levels in zzso and zzso whereas zzso expressed at a low level in zzso and at a high level in zzso Our results showed that zzso gene zzso could function as predicted by the ABC model in zzso flowers but differential expressions of zzso and zzso and zzso suggested the diversification of their functions after the zzso zzso
