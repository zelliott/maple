The zzso zzso gene encodes an essential zzso protein of the zzso recognition motif zzso class that is required during embryonic zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that it also functions as a molecular element of a zzso clock output pathway, zzso the zzso regulation of adult emergence in the zzso We now report the molecular characterization of a human gene with significant similarity to zzso Based on zzso in zzso zzso and radiation hybrid zzso the human gene has been localized to zzso region zzso it is closely linked to several identified genes including the locus of zzso syndrome type zzso The zzso human gene expresses a single zzso size class of zzso in most or all zzso including zzso Additional database searches have identified a mouse counterpart that is virtually identical to the human zzso Similar to zzso zzso both zzso proteins contain two copies of the zzso consensus zzso zzso Unlike most zzso family members, however, the zzso and zzso proteins also contain a zzso zzso zinc finger that is situated 43 zzso zzso to the second zzso zzso Within a zzso segment spanning the zzso elements and the zzso zinc finger, the human and mouse proteins are zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso These common sequence features and comparisons among a large collection of zzso proteins suggest that the human and mouse proteins represent zzso of zzso zzso
