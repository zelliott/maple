A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was obtained from the zzso of pigs with zzso zzso disease, was grown in pure zzso with tissue cultures of rat zzso An examination of the zzso zzso DNA gene sequence revealed that the zzso which we obtained are members of the delta subdivision of the zzso and that the sequences of these organisms exhibit a level of similarly of zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were homogeneous and differed in cellular zzso acid zzso zzso zzso protein profile, and habitat from zzso zzso On the basis of the results of an integrated study of the zzso and zzso of a consistent zzso entity found in particular zzso cells and associated with a zzso clinical condition, we concluded that these bacteria belong to a previously zzso zzso and species, for which we propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso DNA probe was cloned zzso and this probe was used to identify the zzso in tissue culture cells and in the zzso zzso of pigs with zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with a rat zzso cell line allowed us to designate strain zzso zzso the type strain and to describe the new zzso and zzso The zzso which we cultured is zzso for pigs and causes zzso zzso zzso in their zzso and zzso and Koch's zzso were fulfilled for this zzso
