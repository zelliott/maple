The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence is zzso to the sequences of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso The high degree of zzso acid identity between the zzso and zzso proteins suggests that a zzso gene may have been zzso transferred between zzso and zzso sometime after the zzso of atmospheric zzso Consensus elements of zzso promoters are found upstream of the coding region, however, the spacing between them and the zzso start site is greater than in other zzso zzso of zzso occurs in five consecutive T zzso that are preceded by a zzso sequence that has short zzso zzso In addition to the authentic zzso zzso zzso zzso also contains a putative zzso The zzso levels and growth rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested in response to treatment by zzso an zzso generator of zzso In zzso zzso the growth rate slowed, and zzso was strongly induced throughout prolonged treatment with zzso In zzso zzso the same effects were noticed initially, but after 48 h exposure to the drug, the growth rate increased and the zzso level zzso zzso of zzso resistant zzso of zzso zzso may play a part in this process, however, some type of zzso adaptation is also probably zzso
