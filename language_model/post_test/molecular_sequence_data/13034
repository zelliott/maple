The zzso gene of zzso coli has been shown previously to be essential for cell viability zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yet it encodes a protein of unknown zzso zzso of strains harboring the zzso zzso zzso display zzso reductions in zzso zzso specific zzso The zzso is the second zzso step of zzso A zzso The structural gene coding for the zzso has not been zzso In order to determine if the zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso was cloned into an zzso zzso expression zzso Upon zzso a protein of the size of zzso was highly zzso as judged by zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso revealed a zzso approximately zzso overproduction of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein demonstrated a further approximately zzso increase in specific zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso protein showed that the first 20 zzso acids matched the predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso species were present at less than zzso of the level of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is the structural gene for zzso zzso Based on its function in zzso A zzso we propose the new designation zzso for this zzso
