We have used a novel T cell selection strategy to isolate a zzso of an zzso zzso zzso line defective in its ability to present zzso to some zzso helper T zzso This zzso has an zzso acid substitution in the alpha 2 domain of the Ed zzso The zzso changes the sequence at zzso 177 from zzso to zzso which results in a zzso to zzso substitution and appears to be the first in zzso zzso to have arisen by genetic zzso Even though the zzso is zzso to the proposed zzso groove, it affects zzso zzso presumably by altering the scaffolding for the zzso zzso This type of zzso might not be readily isolated using other selection zzso
