People with zzso syndrome have mild, chronic zzso zzso in the absence of liver disease or overt zzso zzso zzso activity, essential for efficient zzso zzso of zzso is reduced to about 30 percent of zzso 

We zzso the coding and promoter regions of the gene for zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso only zzso that contributes substantially to zzso zzso 10 unrelated patients with zzso syndrome, 16 members of a zzso with a history of zzso syndrome type II, and 55 normal zzso 

The coding region of the gene for the zzso was normal in the 10 patients with zzso zzso These patients were zzso for two extra bases zzso in the zzso element of the zzso promoter region of the gene zzso rather than the normal zzso The presence of the longer zzso element resulted in the reduced expression of a reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso in a human zzso cell zzso The frequency of the abnormal zzso was 40 percent among the normal zzso The 3 men in the control group who were zzso for the longer zzso element had significantly higher serum zzso levels than the other 52 normal subjects zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso with a history of zzso syndrome type II, only the six zzso carriers who had a longer zzso element on the structurally normal zzso had mild zzso characteristic of zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso zzso 1 due to an zzso in the promoter region of the gene for this zzso appears to be necessary for zzso syndrome but not sufficient for the complete manifestation of the zzso
