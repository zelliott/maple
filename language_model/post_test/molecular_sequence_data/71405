zzso zzso zzso involves two members of the zzso family of zzso regulators, both activated via zzso zzso in the corresponding zzso zzso is expressed in the disease induced by the original zzso virus zzso complex in adult zzso In contrast, zzso is zzso in about zzso of the zzso induced by the zzso helper virus in newborn zzso To zzso the consequences of the enforced expression of zzso on zzso differentiation and proliferation and to compare its activity to that of zzso we used a zzso system of avian primary zzso previously described to study the cooperation between zzso and the other molecular zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso to inhibit the zzso cell death program normally activated in zzso following zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the terminal differentiation program induced in these cells in response to zzso zzso zzso to induce their zzso However, in contrast to zzso the effects of zzso on zzso differentiation and proliferation did not require its cooperation with an zzso activated form of the zzso zzso survival of zzso expressing zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso also prevented the rapid zzso of zzso zzso and D3 expression normally observed during zzso differentiation and delayed the zzso of several other genes involved in cell cycle or cell proliferation zzso Our results show that zzso of zzso profoundly zzso the normal balance between differentiation and proliferation in primary zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso expression observed at the onset of zzso zzso may provide a zzso advantage to virus infected cells that would otherwise undergo terminal differentiation or cell zzso
