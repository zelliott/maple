zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso b) is a zzso zzso acid zzso isolated from pea seeds zzso zzso zzso by three zzso zzso bridges, signature of the zzso zzso zzso zzso It acts as an zzso factor against major insect zzso in stored crops and vegetables, making it a promising zzso Here we report an efficient and simple protocol for the production of large quantities of highly zzso biologically active synthetic zzso The features of zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso products and competitive zzso zzso The efficiency of the zzso folding can be significantly improved by using zzso alcoholic zzso and decreasing the zzso The zzso of the synthetic oxidized zzso was established by zzso zzso The correct pairing of the three zzso bridges, as well as the three-dimensional structure of synthetic zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso proteins from zzso zzso with a zzso of 8 zzso a figure quite similar to that determined for zzso extracted from its natural zzso Moreover, the synthetic zzso was as potent as the extracted one towards the sensitive strains of zzso Our findings will open the way to the production of zzso zzso by chemical means to an in-depth understanding of the zzso mechanism of zzso
