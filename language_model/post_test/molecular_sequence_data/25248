By zzso screening of a rat brain zzso library we have identified a novel alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso The deduced protein exhibits zzso zzso acid identity to the previously characterized rat and human alpha 1 and alpha 2 zzso zzso Upon zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso the alpha 3 zzso formed functional zzso zzso channels which displayed a low affinity for zzso and only small responses to zzso zzso of alpha 3 transcripts by zzso chain reaction revealed high levels in spinal zzso at later zzso stages of zzso These data indicate alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in adult rats that may result in zzso distinct zzso zzso
