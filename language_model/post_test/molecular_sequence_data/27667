A zzso zzso was isolated that causes an increase in zzso between short repeated delta sequences surrounding the zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso copy of this gene was cloned by zzso of one of its zzso zzso slow zzso DNA sequence of the clone revealed a 656 zzso acid open reading frame capable of zzso a protein zzso to the bacterial type I zzso No zzso was detected with previously identified zzso zzso Construction of double zzso with either of the two known zzso zzso genes revealed synergistic effects on growth suggesting overlapping zzso zzso of bacterial zzso I in zzso can fully complement the slow growth zzso of a zzso zzso We have named this locus zzso and suggest that it defines a novel zzso zzso zzso
