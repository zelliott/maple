The zzso zzso is universally and specifically expressed in zzso zzso zzso contains a unique array of motifs allowing the protein to function as a signal zzso and possibly as a zzso zzso Under certain in zzso culture conditions zzso embryonic stem cells develop into colonies containing multiple zzso zzso In embryonic stem cell lines, zzso expressing high levels of zzso zzso transcripts through a zzso integrated zzso differentiation into zzso cells is zzso This observation presents the first evidence that zzso has a critical role in the development of zzso cells from zzso zzso
