zzso zzso cells require two zzso zzso and zzso for growth in 50 zzso zzso but not 50 zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to be required for the zzso of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is both genetically and zzso related to zzso Like zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso A zzso acid stretch of zzso shows zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso gene is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but zzso of zzso does not suppress the zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso display normal growth in zzso indicating that zzso of zzso is not zzso Increased zzso of the growth medium increases the zzso tolerance of zzso and zzso zzso cells, suggesting that altered cell wall synthesis causes zzso zzso zzso of zzso to form zzso requires zzso a gene zzso an zzso zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso or increased zzso concentration in the growth medium enhances the zzso tolerance of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso renders zzso cells zzso zzso
