zzso and zzso family proteins are zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that bind similar sites on the promoters of zzso and cholesterol 7 alpha zzso zzso However, zzso proteins have a more relaxed binding specificity than zzso zzso in that they recognize many sites within promoter or randomly selected rat zzso DNA sequences that are ignored by zzso zzso Thus, zzso I protection experiments suggest that zzso recognizes a binding site with an affinity similar to the one of the cholesterol 7 alpha zzso gene promoter every 200 to 300 zzso The frequency of zzso protein binding sites with comparable affinities is about zzso lower in the rat zzso By using a zzso amplification zzso we selected high affinity zzso sites for zzso beta and the zzso protein zzso from a pool of zzso Both proteins indeed recognize similar sequences with the optimal core binding sequences zzso However, as expected, zzso is considerably less tolerant to zzso from the consensus zzso Here we have characterized a single zzso acid substitution zzso of zzso beta that increases its target site zzso This zzso zzso beta V zzso A, contains a zzso to zzso substitution at position 13 of the basic domain zzso 216 of zzso zzso zzso beta V zzso A selectively binds only the subset of zzso sites that are also zzso sites, both as zzso and within the natural contexts of the zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso
