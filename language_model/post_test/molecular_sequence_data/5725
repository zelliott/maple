In zzso the zzso zzso constitute a family of proteins with diverse functions which all appear to involve the zzso activity of zzso Here, we report the molecular characterization of zzso a gene located at zzso on the right arm of the second zzso of zzso zzso and zzso a putative protein of 217 zzso acids with a molecular mass of zzso and a zzso of zzso The zzso region of the zzso protein displays a significant sequence similarity with the J domain of zzso proteins and contains a centrally located zzso segment suggesting the occurrence of a membrane spanning zzso Northern zzso analysis detected a zzso transcript which is zzso expressed in zzso larvae and females but zzso expressed in adult zzso In zzso zzso revealed that the zzso transcript is highly expressed in male zzso and the zzso bulb but at an zzso level in zzso suggesting that the zzso protein may play an important function during zzso and/or in the male zzso zzso
