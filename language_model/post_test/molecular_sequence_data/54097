In North America, the raccoon rabies virus zzso is an endemic wildlife disease which causes acute zzso and is a strong selective force on zzso zzso zzso with estimates of zzso of the population zzso to the disease when zzso zzso is regarded as a lethal disease if zzso therefore, no evolutionary response would be expected of raccoon zzso However, variable immune responses to zzso have been observed in zzso indicating a potential for evolutionary zzso Studies of variation within the zzso important major zzso complex zzso have revealed relationships between zzso zzso and diseases in humans and other wildlife zzso This enhances our understanding of how hosts and pathogens adapt and zzso In this study, we used zzso as a model system to study zzso interaction in zzso from a challenge study and from four wild populations that differ in exposure times and viral zzso We investigated the potential role of zzso zzso in relation to zzso to zzso in 113 zzso positive and 143 zzso negative zzso Six zzso were found to be associated with zzso negative status and five zzso with zzso positive zzso We found variable patterns of zzso associations given the relative number of selective zzso sweeps in the studied regions and correlations between zzso diversity and zzso zzso The zzso associations established provide insight into how the genetic variation of zzso may affect the disease outcome and this can be used to examine similar associations between other rabies zzso and their zzso
