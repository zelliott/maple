The complete zzso sequence of the Nile zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain was cloned using zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the Nile zzso zzso zzso chain contains four zzso zzso zzso involved in the formation of zzso bridges and a zzso zzso acid motif believed to be important for assembly and zzso of the zzso zzso complex, both of which are normally found in the zzso zzso chain of other zzso As detected using zzso and quantitative zzso the highest expression level of zzso zzso was detected in the zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso significantly induced the zzso of the zzso zzso chain, and the strongest zzso was detected in the brain and peripheral blood zzso zzso In in zzso experiments, zzso A and zzso zzso were found to significantly increase the expression of the zzso zzso chain in zzso after 48 h zzso zzso zzso and 72 h zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, real-time zzso analysis showed that zzso injection zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso could induce zzso zzso expression that was greater than the expression observed following administration of zzso zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso chain in fish detected in this study suggests the presence of zzso populations that have been found in higher zzso which may play a crucial functional role in the response to fish zzso
