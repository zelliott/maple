The zzso complex zzso is a zzso complex that spans the muscle plasma membrane and forms a link between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The proteins of the zzso are structurally organized into distinct zzso and genetic zzso in many individual components are zzso as muscular zzso We recently identified a unique zzso zzso zzso which we have named zzso zzso for its multiple zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To probe molecular associations of zzso within the zzso we investigated zzso expression in normal muscle as a baseline for comparison to zzso expression in animal models of muscular zzso We show that, in addition to its zzso zzso zzso is enriched at the zzso junction zzso and zzso junction zzso where it is a component of both the zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso associated with the zzso zzso zzso and this interaction is critical for stable zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso Our experiments indicate that assembly of the zzso zzso is a prerequisite for targeting zzso to the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso functions to stabilize zzso to the muscle plasma zzso Taken together, our data provide important information about assembly and function of the zzso zzso
