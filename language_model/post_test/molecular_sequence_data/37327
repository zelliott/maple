In the present study we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in rat zzso fluid and in zzso extracts by two-dimensional zzso Western zzso using rat zzso zzso raised against rat zzso The zzso spot of approximately 28 zzso with an zzso point zzso of zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso by tandem mass zzso and database searches revealed several peptides to be novel zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the novel peptides were used in rapid amplification of zzso ends and zzso chain reaction to clone zzso from a rat zzso zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso sequence was subsequently obtained consisting of a complete open reading frame zzso of 111 zzso zzso which showed similarity to the zzso and zzso zzso The first 21 zzso acids constituted a putative signal zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein corresponding to zzso acids zzso was expressed in zzso coli, and chickens were zzso with zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso as well as a zzso protein of 28 zzso zzso zzso in both zzso fluid and in zzso extracts on zzso Western zzso Northern zzso indicated that zzso zzso was present in the zzso but not in zzso or other zzso and that zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in the corpus and zzso of the zzso but not in the initial segment or zzso Similarly, Western blots detected the zzso protein only in the zzso fluid and zzso from the corpus and zzso zzso Finally, indirect zzso localized zzso on the entire tail, and with less intensity on the head of the zzso These observations indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso protein that becomes associated with the zzso as it transits through the corpus and zzso The presence of a zzso motif suggests that zzso may play a role in protecting the zzso from microbial infections in the zzso and in the female zzso zzso
