Signal zzso anchor zzso zzso of type II membrane proteins initiate the zzso of downstream zzso across the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast with signal zzso however, zzso zzso are not zzso by signal zzso and thus anchor the protein in the zzso In the present study we have introduced zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify structural elements that would zzso the processing of zzso zzso by signal zzso zzso of full-length and truncated (without zzso zzso protein were constructed by substitution of the sequences zzso zzso or zzso for zzso starting at position 15 of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, a Pro zzso was zzso for zzso at position 16 of the zzso zzso The rationale for the use of these sequences was decided from our previous observation that substitution in the zzso zzso domain of the sequence zzso which is polar and has zzso potential, could promote zzso domain processing under certain conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence is polar but, according to secondary structure predictions, is compatible with the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence and single Pro zzso are less polar and have zzso zzso The predicted effects of these zzso on the structure of the zzso zzso domain were confirmed by CD analysis of zzso peptides encompassing the zzso segment and zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were expressed in zzso cells and their fate zzso or zzso was determined by zzso and by zzso zzso Our zzso and structural data indicate that: zzso the zzso domain of zzso restricts the zzso of the zzso domain because zzso not zzso in their full-length form are zzso in their truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso are not a prerequisite for zzso zzso the presence, in close proximity to a putative signal zzso zzso site, of a polar sequence that maintains the zzso structure of the zzso domain is sufficient to promote zzso zzso pulse chase studies suggest that zzso is performed in the zzso by signal zzso and indicate that zzso is not a limiting step in the zzso of the soluble form of the zzso
