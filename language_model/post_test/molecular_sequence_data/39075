zzso plays a role in regulating the body weight in zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso expressed in zzso coli reduced the food intake and body weight in normal, zzso and zzso obesity zzso zzso zzso and zzso can also be corrected in zzso mice after zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso 167 zzso acids produced in zzso tissue and is zzso to blood zzso In this study, a zzso mouse zzso was generated and zzso from a zzso expression zzso This protein was used to identify putative zzso using a zzso library of random zzso Three zzso zzso clones were found, which were characterized by DNA sequencing and zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso peptides are: zzso zzso and zzso All three clones bound to zzso human and mouse zzso These peptides may be useful tools to study zzso interaction, food intake and body weight zzso
