In a previous study, we have demonstrated that primary human zzso in culture are susceptible for zzso zzso zzso invasion and for development of zzso into zzso zzso In a separate study we demonstrated the involvement of two human liver plasma membrane proteins (55 zzso and 20 zzso in the invasion of zzso zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we have zzso the nature of the 55 zzso zzso 

For the identification of this zzso a zzso zzso membrane protein fraction from human liver was isolated, zzso zzso incubated with zzso and zzso After reduction of the zzso the released proteins were mixed with zzso zzso zzso protein fraction and separated on two-dimensional zzso zzso showed a single spot corresponding to a protein of 55 zzso and zzso of zzso 

zzso acid sequencing revealed the 55 zzso protein as zzso The biological activity of zzso human liver zzso and of an zzso against zzso on zzso invasion in zzso was zzso Human zzso as well as a rabbit zzso against zzso inhibited the invasion of zzso zzso zzso into primary human zzso in zzso A number of zzso zzso clones were isolated from a human liver zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed two different zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso was shown also to inhibit the invasion of zzso into primary human zzso zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso in primary cultures of human zzso using specific zzso showed its presence inside the zzso and on the zzso 

zzso plays a role in the invasion process of zzso zzso zzso into human zzso in zzso The implications of these findings are further zzso
