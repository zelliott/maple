zzso are structural proteins expressed by zzso zzso zzso 30 different zzso proteins have been identified, each with a specific expression pattern in different zzso zzso The zzso promoter of several zzso genes have been used to direct the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in differentiated and zzso zzso zzso although the relative expression of each appears to vary between zzso We targeted the mouse zzso zzso gene in order to develop a zzso promoter that could be zzso to study the functions of genes of interest expressed in the zzso zzso Three zzso truncated fragments of the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed higher functional and zzso promoter activity in a human zzso zzso cell line than other cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso was also active in cultured rabbit zzso zzso zzso Thus, increased expression in zzso zzso cells directed by fragments of the mouse zzso promoter extended across species zzso The paired box zzso gene 6 zzso which is involved in controlling eye development, zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso
