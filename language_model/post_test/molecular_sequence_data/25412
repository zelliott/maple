The zzso properties of the zzso zzso d less than zzso greater than were studied by means of molecular mechanics calculations in which a zzso analysis was combined with minimum energy zzso In this approach models of possible zzso are built by varying the zzso angles of the zzso zzso These models are then subjected to energy zzso in the present investigation use was made of the zzso Force zzso It followed that the lowest energy zzso has a zzso axis of zzso In this zzso the zzso zzso adopt a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso backbone is determined by the following zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso zzso to the structure derived earlier by means of zzso zzso and X-ray zzso The observation of a preference for zzso sugar zzso in this zzso can be explained by the zzso hindrance induced between opposite zzso atoms when one sugar is switched from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso can in principle switch from zzso to zzso zzso but this requires at least the transition of gamma + to gamma zzso In this process the zzso zzso an extended shape in which the bases switch from a zzso to a zzso zzso The calculations demonstrate that, apart from the results obtained for the lowest energy zzso the 180 degrees change in the propagation direction of the zzso backbone can be achieved by several different combinations of the backbone zzso zzso It appeared that in the low energy zzso five higher order correlations are zzso The combination of zzso angles which are involved in changes in the propagation direction of the zzso backbone in zzso zzso and in zzso are found in the zzso obtained for zzso d less than zzso greater zzso It turns out, that in the available examples, 180 degrees changes in the backbone direction are localized between two adjacent zzso
