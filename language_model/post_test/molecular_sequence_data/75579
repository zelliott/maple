zzso and zzso genes have been modified in their third zzso zzso zzso by using in zzso zzso In this method zzso coli are zzso with a zzso which contains two highly zzso sequences zzso the third zzso of zzso and zzso and has been zzso by zzso between these two zzso zzso takes place in the bacteria by zzso zzso leading to hybrid zzso zzso The analysis by DNA sequencing of a number of such zzso shows that they indeed occur by zzso zzso (no insertions or zzso and that the probability of crossing over decreases as the distance from the free end of DNA in the zzso region zzso No double zzso were zzso These hybrid zzso were zzso into either zzso or zzso zzso thus generating a panel of functional hybrid genes containing one or several zzso specific zzso in an zzso background or vice zzso These genes were expressed by zzso into zzso zzso zzso efficiency recipient zzso zzso analysis leads to the conclusion that expression of zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso is linked to the presence of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is correlated with the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso But zzso zzso 161 contributes with zzso acid zzso 152 in the formation of the A3 zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso
