The zzso domain (named after zzso zzso protein 8, zzso and zzso is a zzso zinc binding zzso It is defined by seven zzso zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso that are arranged in a zzso zzso zzso zzso exist in a large number of proteins that play important roles in development or are associated with zzso and have been shown to mediate zzso zzso mainly in the context of zzso zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain from human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals a novel zinc binding fold, in which the zzso motif forms two sequential zinc binding zzso The first and second zinc binding zzso comprise a small beta hairpin and two short alpha zzso zzso The sequential zzso of the two zinc binding sites is distinct from the zzso zzso and zzso finger folds but has some resemblance to zzso zzso The structure reveals that the zzso domain is a novel member of the zzso family of zinc binding zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso bind zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the solution structure of the zzso zzso domain we calculated a zzso model of the zzso domain of the zzso tumor zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso zzso domain indicates that positively charged zzso located on one face of its zzso domain are crucial for the molecular interactions of zzso Different binding zzso of zzso zzso may depend on distinct surface charge zzso
