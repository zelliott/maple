The zzso protein is a zzso zzso specified by plasmids of the zzso group, that mediates serum resistance and surface zzso The structure and function of the zzso protein determined by zzso zzso was zzso by genetic zzso of a foreign zzso zzso the zzso zzso of polio virus, at zzso 61, zzso 180, 200 or 216 of the zzso The zzso proteins were transported to the outer membrane and, in three cases, zzso with an zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso was exposed on the cell zzso Three of the hybrids, with insertions at zzso zzso 180 and zzso assembled into the zzso zzso form characteristic of the zzso zzso which suggested that these regions are not involved in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the hybrid protein carrying the zzso zzso at position 180 functioned in a genetic suppression zzso and retained partial zzso zzso Thus, its zzso folding and organization does not appear to be zzso altered from that of the zzso zzso zzso of the protein for the transport of foreign zzso zzso to the cell surface are zzso
