zzso features of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso are zzso These zzso zzso contain zzso zzso acid insertions in their zzso binding zzso a remarkably long zzso appendix that varies in size from 110 to 165 zzso acids and two potential initiation zzso This article focuses on the zzso functional and structural properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso This species encodes a zzso or 577 zzso acids zzso depending on whether initiation starts on the first or second zzso initiation zzso The longer protein has poor zzso and a propensity to zzso zzso of the short version was favored as shown by the comparison of the zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with those of zzso and human zzso revealed unique zzso The zzso extension contains a motif that provides unexpectedly strong zzso binding to zzso zzso Furthermore, experiments demonstrated the requirement of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and, therefore, zzso zzso and other putative zzso zzso for the zzso biology are zzso These data provide a robust background for unraveling the precise functional properties of the zzso zzso and for developing novel lead compounds against malaria, targeting its idiosyncratic zzso
