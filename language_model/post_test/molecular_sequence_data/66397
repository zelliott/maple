The zzso zzso of zzso locus was first characterized with regard to the activity of zzso zzso promoter in the plasma cells, where both of zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter were found to be opened simultaneously to drive the zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso was also found to be opened in the zzso zzso However, this opening of zzso zzso in the zzso cells could not be related to the zzso gene zzso because neither the zzso promoter was opened nor its gene was expressed at the zzso cell stage of B cell zzso Instead, it was zzso that the opened zzso zzso might act on some other nearby promoter in zzso cells, which is now guessed to be the zzso promoter located at zzso zzso from zzso In zzso with this zzso zzso opening of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso footprint on a sequence similar to the zzso consensus was detected within the zzso In this paper, we show that the protein causing the zzso zzso in zzso footprint on a sequence similar to the zzso consensus is truly zzso as judged by zzso using various zzso competitors and zzso zzso Also, as expected from other previous reports, zzso was shown to be expressed highly in zzso cells, but very little or not in immature B, mature B and plasma cells using both the cell lines and zzso normal primary zzso zzso zzso within the zzso site of zzso zzso were shown to significantly impair the zzso zzso activity in the zzso cells, but not in the plasma zzso
