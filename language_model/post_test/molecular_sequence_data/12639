zzso zzso of DNA molecules in solution results from zzso motion and intrinsic zzso related to the DNA zzso In order to measure directly the contribution of zzso motion we constructed zzso straight DNA molecules and measured their persistence length by zzso zzso The persistence length of such zzso straight DNA molecules suspended in thin layers of zzso solutions is about 80 zzso In order to test our experimental approach, we measured the apparent persistence length of DNA molecules with natural zzso zzso The result of about 45 zzso is consistent with the generally accepted value of the apparent persistence length of natural DNA zzso By comparing the apparent persistence length to zzso straight DNA with that of natural DNA, it is possible to determine both the dynamic and the zzso contributions to the apparent persistence zzso
