The protein zzso C zzso family of zzso is broadly distributed and has been implicated in a diverse array of cellular zzso Recent evidence supporting zzso involvement in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso prompted us to clone zzso from a zzso central nervous system zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso calcium independent zzso zzso zzso zzso probe was used to screen the library and zzso zzso SMART zzso was used to obtain the full-length zzso The resulting zzso which included zzso and 3' zzso regions, was zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso sequence using the zzso database revealed at least zzso identity to zzso zzso A commercial zzso zzso against zzso zzso was used in Western blots to positively label a 30 zzso protein from zzso zzso and the expressed fusion protein of the zzso zzso These data support the presence of a newly identified zzso zzso in zzso which likely represents a zzso zzso zzso
