We have developed a zzso zzso screening test enabling the simultaneous analysis of three zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso which together account for familial zzso zzso in approximately zzso of the South African zzso zzso The zzso is designed so that FH patients, negative for these zzso zzso zzso in descendants of European zzso subsequently can be screened for unknown zzso in the zzso zzso 4 of the zzso zzso Our screening zzso consists of two steps: zzso multiplex zzso zzso amplification of zzso 4 and 9, and zzso simultaneous analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 4 by vertical zzso on low zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and versatility of the multiplex zzso makes it an ideal system for routine screening of FH zzso in large population zzso
