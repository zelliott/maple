zzso regulatory T cells zzso play pivotal roles in the host response to zzso However, their exact location in zzso is largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso is specifically expressed in naturally occurring zzso zzso and programs their development and zzso In this study, we produced a rabbit zzso zzso zzso which can detect mouse zzso protein in zzso zzso using this zzso revealed that zzso zzso cells occur in direct contact with zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in the T cell regions of zzso zzso from normal and zzso zzso The numbers of zzso zzso cells are significantly increased in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, a small number of zzso could be also found at the tumor zzso These observations support the notion that the numbers of zzso zzso are increased by tumors and may contribute to the zzso observed in zzso hosts at secondary zzso zzso and also possibly at the tumor zzso
