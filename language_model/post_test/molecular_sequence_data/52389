We report a fast method for the isolation of homogeneous zzso from bovine skeletal zzso In electron zzso zzso appears as short rods with a relatively uniform length of about 50 zzso zzso sequencing shows a single zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso II and zzso rods but not zzso zzso zzso to zzso II is retained in preparations lacking zzso zzso zzso to bovine zzso were used to screen a zzso zzso zzso library constructed from fetal human skeletal zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso long and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso The start of the predicted sequence fits the zzso sequence of the bovine zzso All partial sequences obtained from the bovine protein zzso zzso and the sequence deduced from a partial chicken zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be aligned along the human zzso The sequences of human and chicken zzso share 50% identity and zzso zzso Along the repeat patterns of the human protein the zzso zzso zzso are better zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso of strong divergence between chicken fast zzso and human slow zzso may represent differences in zzso zzso
