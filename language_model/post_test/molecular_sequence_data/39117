The zzso enhancers of split are a family of zzso proteins that share sequence zzso with the zzso protein zzso Using zzso difference analysis, we isolated the zzso for a previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of split zzso as a sequence induced by zzso and zzso but not by zzso or growth factors, in zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the protein zzso a zzso acid zzso of mouse and human zzso zzso the gene zzso the closest related rat zzso is not induced by any of the four treatments in zzso zzso zzso and zzso have different patterns of expression in the adult rat zzso and other zzso After systemic administration of zzso acid, zzso is induced specifically in the zzso zzso of the zzso We propose that members of the zzso zzso of split family of proteins may have distinct functions in the mature zzso in addition to their functions during zzso
