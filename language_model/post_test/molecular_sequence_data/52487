A zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method for the rapid detection of the zzso zzso zzso in a mixture of pooled blood samples is zzso In the first step zzso a short gene zzso surrounding zzso zzso is zzso zzso the reaction product is subjected to a second amplification in which a zzso primer is zzso A zzso product is generated only if the zzso sequence is present in the DNA zzso zzso carrying the zzso can then be identified by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso restriction zzso essentially as described by Hansen et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
