Small zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso and zzso which are highly tissue zzso are being investigated for zzso production as conventional zzso consisting of zzso or zzso zzso fragments do not effectively neutralize zzso toxins located in deep zzso However, zzso composed entirely of small zzso fragments may have poor therapeutic efficacy due to their short serum zzso To increase serum persistence and maintain tissue zzso we prepared low and high molecular mass zzso zzso Four zzso zzso were isolated from an immune zzso zzso library and were shown to have high zzso in the low zzso range, for zzso zzso the most lethal component of zzso zzso zzso zzso our highest affinity zzso zzso was fused to a human zzso zzso to create a zzso zzso that would offer prolonged serum zzso After in zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso we show that our zzso zzso retained high affinity binding to zzso Mouse zzso challenge studies showed that our highest affinity zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso effectively neutralized zzso induced by zzso at an zzso zzso ratio as low as zzso zzso Further research towards the development of an zzso therapeutic involving these zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules should involve testing them as a zzso to determine whether they maintain tissue penetration capability and low zzso and whether they exhibit improved serum persistence and therapeutic zzso
