The binding of aromatic donor molecules to plant zzso has been investigated by examining the complex formed between zzso zzso zzso C and zzso acid using two-dimensional zzso zzso Despite the relatively high molecular mass and zzso of the zzso this technique can be successfully applied to provide new information on the structure of the zzso A number of relatively zzso zzso in certain regions of the one-dimensional spectrum are assigned to zzso acid type on the basis of the two-dimensional zzso Two zzso side chains are found to interact at positions close to the zzso group as shown by nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso spectrum of the complex reveals distinct interactions between these zzso zzso and the zzso ring of the donor zzso The binding site is found to comprise of these zzso side chains and also the zzso group of a zzso or zzso zzso On the basis of the model structure of zzso zzso zzso C proposed by zzso and zzso and information from previous studies of the related zzso zzso possible locations for this binding site are zzso The zzso methods adopted here may be generally zzso to the study of zzso zzso
