A marine, zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from mud and water from a salt zzso in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, USA, after enrichment in defined zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso capable of zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth occurred at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth occurred with zzso as the electron donor and zzso carbon fixation was via the zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso with shapes that ranged from that of a zzso bean to fully zzso zzso were zzso by means of a single zzso at each end of the cell zzso Regardless of whether grown in liquid or zzso cultures, strain zzso displayed only polar zzso and possessed a single chain of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso of zzso positioned along the long axis of the zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that strain zzso belongs to the family zzso within the zzso and is zzso related to species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore considered to represent a novel species of a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
