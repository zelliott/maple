By using the zzso chain reaction zzso we detected zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso obtained from autopsy zzso A pair of zzso which were specific for a part of the zzso zzso zzso domain were used for detection of zzso zzso We also examined the zzso transcript zzso known as zzso zzso by means of reverse zzso with a pair of zzso zzso zzso DNA was detected in 16 of 17 zzso zzso zzso and in 15 to 17 zzso zzso zzso of zzso We also demonstrated zzso zzso derived from the zzso in both types of zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso the majority of zzso and zzso zzso of adults, and that zzso and reverse zzso are useful tools for analysis of zzso zzso
