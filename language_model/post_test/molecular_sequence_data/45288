zzso D3 has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of cell cycle progression in zzso It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this zzso We have previously shown that both zzso and zzso degradation of zzso D3 in zzso cells is dependent on zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso We now provide evidence of an alternative mechanism being involved in the regulation of zzso D3 zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso acid zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso 1 and 2A zzso and zzso zzso rapid zzso and zzso degradation of zzso zzso This degradation is not inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso or by substitution of zzso with Ala on zzso zzso indicating that zzso D3 can be zzso independently of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, in zzso experiments revealed that zzso but not zzso was able to zzso zzso D3 zzso and zzso was found to associate with zzso zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso keeps zzso D3 in a stable, zzso state, and that treatment of cells with zzso leads to zzso and degradation of zzso D3 through zzso of zzso
