The type I and type II regulatory zzso of zzso protein zzso can be distinguished by zzso The type II regulatory zzso have an zzso site at a zzso sensitive hinge region, while the type I regulatory zzso have a zzso zzso Only zzso formed with type I regulatory zzso has a high affinity binding site for zzso In order to determine the functional consequences of regulatory zzso zzso on interaction with the zzso zzso an zzso site was introduced into the type I regulatory zzso using zzso DNA zzso When zzso at the hinge region of the type I regulatory zzso was replaced with zzso the regulatory zzso became a good zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred exclusively at zzso zzso was incorporated primarily into the zzso regulatory zzso when zzso zzso and zzso were added to the total bacterial zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso also occurred readily following zzso gel zzso and zzso transfer to zzso zzso occurred as an zzso event in the absence of zzso indicating that the hinge region of the regulatory zzso occupies the zzso recognition site of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso formed with both the wild type and zzso regulatory zzso was susceptible to zzso in the presence of high zzso however, only the native zzso was stabilized by zzso In contrast to the wild type zzso the affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso was not reduced in the presence of zzso zzso formation also was not facilitated by zzso
