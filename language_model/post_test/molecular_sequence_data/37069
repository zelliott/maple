The major surface protein zzso zzso of the zzso type species zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to mediate zzso infection and transmission of the zzso as well as to contribute to protective immunity in zzso zzso contains a variable number of zzso repeated peptides in the zzso region, while the remainder of the protein is highly zzso among zzso The number of repeats varies among geographic zzso of zzso zzso but is constant within an isolate and has been used as a stable genetic marker of isolate zzso Because the sequence of the tandem repeats is the most variable part of the protein among zzso this region of the protein is most likely to be involved in zzso to host cells, a prerequisite to zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize the organization and function of the zzso tandem repeats of zzso zzso in zzso to host zzso We demonstrated by use of zzso zzso proteins that the zzso repeated region of zzso was necessary and sufficient to mediate zzso of zzso to tick cells and bovine zzso zzso peptides representing the zzso sequences of individual repeats were tested for their adhesive capacity for tick cell extract zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acids D or E at position 20 bound to zzso while peptides with a G as the 20th zzso acid were not adhesive to zzso zzso produced in rabbits against a synthetic repeat zzso neutralized zzso zzso infection of cultured tick cells, and the zzso observed was similar to that zzso by zzso produced against the whole zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso repeated zzso peptides of several geographic zzso of zzso zzso revealed a complex relationship between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the isolate and suggested that both the sequence and zzso of the repeated peptides influenced the adhesive properties of zzso These studies demonstrated that the zzso repeated region of the protein mediates the adhesive function of zzso
