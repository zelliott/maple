A previously unknown nuclear gene zzso from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The gene was isolated as a zzso zzso of a disruption of the zzso gene coding for a zzso box protein involved in processing and turnover of zzso zzso The zzso gene codes for a 970 zzso protein of molecular weight 111 zzso and is necessary for zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis indicates the presence of motifs characteristic for zzso coli zzso II, the zzso protein from zzso zzso the zzso protein participating in zzso processing and turnover in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein from zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso protein may be a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
