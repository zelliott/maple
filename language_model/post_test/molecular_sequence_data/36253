To study the molecular mechanisms involved in formation of cell zzso we have zzso cultured cells with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of beta 1 zzso and the zzso region of zzso and determined the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso associates zzso with zzso focal zzso suggesting that its distribution is directed by its beta 1 zzso segment, presumably via interactions of the zzso domain with zzso elements characteristic of focal zzso zzso cells which expressed relatively high levels of the zzso zzso underwent an apparent zzso and contained the zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso contacts indicates competence of the zzso zzso domain to participate in formation of zzso junctions using a foreign zzso zzso zzso of these cultures for zzso which is normally associated only with zzso zzso revealed specific labeling along the newly formed zzso zzso This suggests that the local association of zzso with these sites is induced by the zzso tail of beta 1 zzso zzso presented by the zzso zzso These results suggest that the formation of zzso junctions is driven by the cooperative interactions of the relevant zzso molecules zzso and zzso both with the respective zzso zzso and with the zzso
