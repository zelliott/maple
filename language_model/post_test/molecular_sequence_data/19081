The development of zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently still a great zzso In the present study, zzso complex structures were obtained by zzso zzso with zzso zzso as the only inhibitor zzso into the binding pockets of human zzso CA I, II, IV, zzso IX, zzso and zzso To make the spatial structures of complexes comparable, the zzso for CA zzso were reassigned based on structural zzso With preferred zzso poses of zzso been reduced to seed structures, the zzso was used to build up inhibitor zzso The results suggested that zzso derivatives with zzso zzso and zzso as the scaffold structures can be the potential zzso zzso especially for zzso CA II, IV, and zzso
