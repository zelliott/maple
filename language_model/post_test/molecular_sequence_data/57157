The zzso crystal structure of pea zzso in complex with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso core, zzso zzso has been solved by molecular replacement and refined at zzso zzso The R factor is zzso for all data in the zzso to zzso A resolution range with an average atomic temperature factor of zzso zzso Strong electron density for a single zzso zzso is found in the zzso site suggesting that the zzso binds primarily through one of the terminal zzso zzso zzso The complex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds involving the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso oxygen atoms zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso makes van der zzso contacts with the zzso involving zzso in zzso These interactions are very similar to those found in the zzso complexes with zzso A and zzso 1 of zzso zzso confirming the structural zzso of this family of zzso zzso of the pea zzso complex with the zzso pea zzso and zzso A structures indicates differences in the zzso and water structure of the zzso binding sites of these two zzso Furthermore, a correlation between the position of the zzso oxygen atoms in the complex and the bound water molecules in the zzso binding sites is zzso zzso of the zzso core through a single terminal zzso zzso strongly argues that an additional zzso site is responsible for the high affinity pea zzso zzso
