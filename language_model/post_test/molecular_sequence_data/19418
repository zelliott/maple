Among the group of zzso acid bacteria, zzso zzso has found a wide application in industrial processes used for the manufacture of dairy zzso Taking advantage of different zzso extraction and zzso zzso bacterial zzso and membrane proteins were isolated and resolved by independent zzso and zzso separation zzso Whole zzso fraction and its acid, basic and low molecular mass protein components were separated by different zzso zzso and zzso zzso gels and identified by zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso proteins were resolved by zzso and zzso gels and similarly identified by zzso and zzso zzso In zzso whole extract was zzso and resulting peptides were identified by shotgun zzso zzso zzso Using this combined approach, expression products corresponding to zzso different genes were identified, which cover almost a third of the predicted zzso zzso Relative protein concentration and zzso affected protein zzso Broad recognition was obtained for zzso involved in zzso fatty acid, zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso transcription, translation, cell wall zzso as well as for proteins affecting bacterial functions important for industrial applications, zzso milk sugar import and zzso zzso By providing detailed reference zzso maps to be used in future comparative zzso investigations on bacteria grown under various experimental conditions or on different bacterial zzso our results will zzso dedicated studies on zzso zzso metabolism and its regulation or on detection of zzso for selection of optimal strains for industrial zzso
