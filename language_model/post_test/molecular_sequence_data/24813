The human zzso is comprised of a large number of cell types with highly specialized functions that depend on the action of countless zzso many of which are exclusively expressed in the zzso We have isolated a novel retinal zzso termed zzso The transcript was initially identified as a cluster of zzso derived predominantly from retinal zzso libraries and its retinal zzso confirmed by Northern zzso and zzso zzso of retinal zzso libraries yielded four clones that were assembled into a zzso zzso consensus zzso The putative open reading frame includes an unusual zzso of zzso and zzso repeats and encodes a putative 85 zzso zzso with no significant zzso to any known protein sequence outside of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequence determined that zzso consists of three zzso and maps to multiple locations throughout the zzso a finding confirmed by zzso screening of a zzso cell hybrid mapping zzso zzso appears to be contained within a region of zzso DNA that is duplicated in a zzso distribution to multiple zzso zzso of zzso sequence variation with the sequences of expressed transcripts suggests that the gene is transcribed in the human zzso from at least four different zzso
