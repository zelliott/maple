In this study a comparison was made between type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso in improving lycopene production in zzso zzso The corresponding genes of zzso zzso and the host zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in lycopene producing zzso coli strains by zzso and zzso zzso under the control of zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso of zzso improved the lycopene production from 33 zzso 1 in zzso coli zzso to 68 zzso 3 zzso in zzso coli zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso increased the lycopene production more efficiently up to 80 zzso 9 zzso in zzso coli zzso The introduction of a zzso zzso zzso to elevate the zzso abundance resulted in a lycopene production up to 132 zzso 5 zzso with zzso in zzso coli zzso and 181 zzso 9 zzso with zzso in zzso coli zzso that is, 4 and zzso times zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso were each used as an auxiliary zzso with zzso lycopene production was inhibited by different zzso Among auxiliary zzso tested, only zzso was an improving one for lycopene production in all strains with a maximum of 198 zzso 3 zzso in zzso coli zzso It may be concluded that the type 2 zzso performs better than the type 1 in zzso engineering attempts for zzso production in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso engineering of zzso zzso seems a promising approach to have more zzso zzso in zzso zzso
