zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two major zzso zzso proteins that are zzso on a single zzso transcript whose expression is tightly regulated during tooth zzso The recent identification of this gene transcript in other zzso including inner ear and jaw zzso suggests that zzso and zzso may have zzso effects on other zzso besides zzso To identify candidate regulatory elements that control zzso zzso and spatial zzso we constructed a -5 zzso upstream region rat zzso promoter into the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and used this construct to prepare zzso transgenic zzso Multiple mouse zzso including teeth, bone, and kidney obtained from the six resulting transgenic mouse lines displayed strong zzso zzso This spatial distribution was confirmed in several of these zzso by in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso expressed in zzso and continuously expressed in zzso demonstrating that this -5 zzso rat zzso zzso expression mimics reported zzso zzso expression zzso Interestingly, this -5 zzso rat promoter construct drives zzso expression according to the rat zzso zzso Based on identified zzso factors present in this -5 zzso promoter region, we have identified several probable zzso zzso whose interaction with one another could account for the spatial and zzso distribution of zzso transcripts in developing zzso
