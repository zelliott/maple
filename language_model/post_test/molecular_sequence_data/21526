The sequencing of the human zzso holds out the hope for personalized medicine, but it is clear that analysis of DNA or zzso content alone is not sufficient to understand most disease zzso zzso strategies that allow unbiased identification of proteins and their zzso and zzso modifications are an essential complement to zzso zzso However, the enormity of the zzso and limitations in zzso methods make it difficult to determine the targets that are particularly relevant to human zzso zzso are therefore needed that allow rational identification of targets based on function and relevance to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso display, zzso and zzso zzso chemistry have been widely used to discover specific zzso for cells or zzso of interest, such as zzso Those zzso can be used in turn as affinity zzso to identify their zzso molecular targets when they are not known in zzso Here we report an easy, robust and generally zzso approach in which zzso particles bearing zzso or zzso peptides serve directly as the affinity zzso for their molecular zzso For proof of principle, the method successfully identified molecular binding partners, three of them novel, for 15 peptides specific for pancreatic zzso
