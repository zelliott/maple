We examined the effect of zzso acids 222 and 254 on zzso of the zzso zzso strain of infectious zzso disease virus zzso Using molecular zzso we identified a virus designated as zzso that was identical to zzso except for zzso at position zzso A second virus was generated using reverse zzso of the zzso backbone to create zzso that contained an zzso at zzso acid zzso The zzso and zzso viruses were tested for their ability to escape zzso immunity provided by zzso zzso The zzso from birds vaccinated with parental zzso and challenged with zzso or zzso had zzso zzso typical of an zzso infection, and their zzso ratios were significantly smaller than the zzso zzso zzso included zzso depletion and confirmed the ability of zzso and zzso to break through the immunity induced by the parental zzso virus zzso Both zzso appear to be contributing to zzso zzso
