A region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and cloned by using as a probe the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso The cloned region consisted of zzso zzso and carried a complete zzso zzso zzso as well as a gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the partially zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a preference for zzso of short to medium chain zzso zzso of zzso was completely dependent on the presence of zzso and occurred from a single promoter similar to the zzso promoters of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These three zzso zzso promoters have zzso zzso and zzso regions, as well as additional zzso sequences upstream of the zzso region, which could function as targets for zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are related to other bacterial regulators of a similar size, zzso a previously unidentified family of proteins that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso five zzso proteins of unknown function and some zzso regulators in zzso synthesis zzso A zzso strain of zzso zzso was constructed and found to be slightly affected in production of the zzso zzso zzso
