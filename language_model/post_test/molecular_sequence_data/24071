zzso zzso is theorized to exist in all zzso zzso and some zzso however, extensive comparative analysis of animals aside from humans and mice remains zzso Here we report conservation of zzso zzso in the bovine at the X zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso growth factor 2 zzso and gene trap locus 2 zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have previously been identified as imprinted in either humans, mice, or zzso zzso patterns of parental zzso in F1 hybrids indicated preferential paternal expression at the zzso locus solely in the zzso of zzso whereas analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso indicated preferential paternal and maternal expression of zzso respectively, in both fetal and zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis of the zzso locus and adjacent regions suggests that repression of the maternal zzso in the bovine is controlled by a different mechanism than in mice, further reinforcing the importance of comparative analysis of zzso
