Using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso with zzso zzso followed by 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso we have isolated a new fish steroid zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso from rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso This sequence has clear zzso with various zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso human, African zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and encompasses the second part of DNA binding domain zzso zzso the whole hinge region zzso zzso and the steroid binding domain zzso zzso plus 726 zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso containing the whole E domain zzso showed high affinity binding for cortisol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso which could not be detected in zzso zzso zzso displaced zzso zzso though was less effective by than zzso cortisol zzso Competition experiments with other steroids gave the following hierarchy for the displacement of the zzso zzso whereas 17, zzso and zzso zzso zzso fish specific zzso did not show any specific zzso These results strongly suggest that this zzso sequence encodes a rainbow trout zzso zzso and represent the first description of such a zzso in zzso fish where zzso the classic zzso is believed to be zzso
