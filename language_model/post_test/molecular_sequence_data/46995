zzso tumor zzso protein contains two zzso alpha and zzso The zzso is involved in the formation of a large protein complex suggested to be involved in zzso protein zzso However, the role of the zzso which may recognize the target proteins for protein degradation, remains zzso Here we report that the zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, the regulatory domain of zzso is sufficient for this direct zzso zzso Since zzso zzso have been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso are potential direct target of the zzso zzso
