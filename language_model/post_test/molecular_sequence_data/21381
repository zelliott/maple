zzso anemia is one of the most common inherited zzso To identify candidate proteins involved in zzso anemia zzso we zzso a zzso comparative zzso approach to detect differences in zzso from normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso We detected 7 proteins that were decreased and 48 proteins that were increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso are characterized by zzso we compared zzso samples from zzso mice with mature zzso from zzso zzso zzso analysis identified 47 proteins that were increased in the zzso samples and 21 proteins that were zzso Among the proteins increased in zzso knockout zzso only 11 were also found increased in zzso Among the proteins decreased in zzso knockout zzso zzso and zzso showed the greatest intensity difference, followed by zzso zzso the zzso zzso We verified these mass zzso results by zzso This is the first example of a zzso of zzso in zzso anemia and suggests new insights into the mechanisms leading to fragile zzso Our use of zzso comparative zzso to make this discovery demonstrates the usefulness of this approach as opposed to zzso or chemical zzso labeling of zzso
