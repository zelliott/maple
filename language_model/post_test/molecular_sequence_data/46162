zzso exposure to ultraviolet zzso light generates substantial damage, and in zzso visual sensitivity to zzso is restricted to short-lived zzso zzso and certain zzso In humans, the cornea and lens absorb all zzso and most of the zzso zzso radiation, preventing the zzso and damaging shorter zzso from reaching the zzso This is not the case in certain species of zzso zzso birds, which possess zzso zzso visual zzso zzso sensitive below 400 zzso The Order zzso contains some of the longest lived bird species, and the two species examined so far have been shown to possess zzso zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of zzso zzso across zzso zzso zzso and zzso and therefore assess whether they need to cope with the accumulated effects of exposure to zzso and zzso over a long period of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso gene revealed that all 14 species investigated possess a key substitution that has been shown to determine a zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso data, and lens zzso corroborate the molecular findings of zzso zzso Our findings thus support the claim that the zzso are the only avian Order in which zzso zzso are zzso and indicate that these zzso birds have zzso sensitivity, despite the risks of zzso
