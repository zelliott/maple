Competition between zzso zzso and suppression at the zzso site in the release zzso zzso zzso was determined in zzso using a coupled zzso system by adding a zzso zzso zzso The expression system was programmed with a zzso containing a zzso fusion gene so that each of the products of the competing events could be zzso With increasing zzso of zzso zzso the zzso product increased at the expense of both the termination and the zzso product indicating all three processes are in direct zzso The zzso at the internal zzso termination zzso was greater than that at the natural zzso termination zzso at the end of the coding zzso The results suggest that this enhanced suppression may reflect slower decoding of the internal stop zzso by the release factor giving suppression a competitive zzso The internal zzso stop signal at the zzso site has been proposed to be a relatively poor zzso but in addition the release factor may be less able to zzso the signal with the zzso in such a constrained zzso zzso the zzso event itself will be more competitive with termination in zzso because of this longer pause as the release factor is decoding the stop zzso
