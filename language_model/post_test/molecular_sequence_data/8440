To investigate the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso stem cell factor zzso in T cell development, we analyzed zzso zzso and zzso zzso deficient zzso We also zzso zzso or zzso fetal zzso onto zzso recipient mice and analyzed the rate of proliferation by in zzso zzso zzso The results show that the most immature zzso compartment defined as zzso is significantly reduced in zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Also, the expansion rate of these immature zzso in zzso graft is reduced by zzso These experiments provide direct evidence for an important role for zzso interactions in expansion of very early zzso
