We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso a human zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein consists of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and contains the highly zzso zzso and His boxes present in all members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity and zzso sequence similarity with the human zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso activity against engineered linear zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso can also cleave the zzso bond, a property previously unique to zzso zzso mapping by zzso in zzso zzso and radiation hybrid analyses localized the zzso gene to zzso band zzso a different location than that of zzso zzso Analysis of expressed sequence tag databases reveals evidence of alternate zzso sites in the zzso gene and also indicates that the gene may possess an zzso structure similar to that of the zzso zzso suggesting they have descended from a common zzso A systematic nomenclature for the human zzso is zzso
