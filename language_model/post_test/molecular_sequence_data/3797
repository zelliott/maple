The zzso zzso zzso in regulating transition from the zzso phase of the cell cycle to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso as part of zzso checkpoint zzso zzso of zzso zzso during the cell cycle with no expression in resting cells and maximum zzso in zzso We had identified earlier a new mechanism of cell zzso zzso that is regulated by a cell zzso element zzso in conjunction with a cell cycle genes zzso region zzso The human zzso gene was the first zzso zzso tandem elements have since been found in promoters of many cell cycle zzso Here we show that the mouse zzso gene is regulated by a zzso but does not hold a zzso zzso it is the first identified gene with zzso zzso regulation during the cell cycle not relying on a zzso located upstream of zzso The zzso leads to repression of zzso zzso early in the cell cycle and directs a release of this repression in zzso Furthermore, we find that this zzso can cooperate in cell zzso zzso with elements placed directly upstream of it binding zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
