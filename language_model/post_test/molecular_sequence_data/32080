To obtain more information on the elements of chemical communication in the migratory locust zzso zzso zzso zzso we have searched for additional zzso proteins zzso and for zzso in the feces that could represent potential zzso for this zzso A two-dimensional zzso zzso analysis of an zzso extract showed only three closely positioned spots that were recognized by the zzso against locust zzso Three genes were also identified using zzso and zzso approaches, zzso zzso differing from each other for a single zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso zzso analysis of a feces sample revealed the presence of several compounds that zzso zzso zzso responses in the antennae of both zzso Most of these compounds are different from those identified in the feces of the desert locust zzso zzso and reported to be zzso zzso zzso experiments performed with such zzso and zzso zzso did not show zzso thus indicating that the binding pocket of zzso requires larger molecules than those so far zzso
