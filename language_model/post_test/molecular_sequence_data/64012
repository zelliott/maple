zzso field zzso of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso have recently emerged in North zzso The full-length zzso sequence of an index isolate characterized in 1999, strain zzso served as the reference strain for further studies of the evolution and epidemiology of zzso zzso zzso 1) in the United zzso zzso zzso shared zzso to zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso European strain, zzso within the structural and zzso open reading frames zzso and zzso overall zzso zzso The zzso untranslated region and two zzso regions within zzso 1 were closely examined due to significant divergence from strain zzso A zzso deletion in a region within zzso zzso coding for zzso protein 2 zzso was zzso zzso analysis of the structural zzso 2 to 7 of additional zzso zzso indicated that these zzso share zzso zzso identity with one another and 95 to zzso identity with the zzso strain but only zzso identity with the North American reference strain zzso zzso analysis with published zzso zzso 3, 5, and 7 zzso sequences indicated that these newly emerging zzso form a zzso with the zzso and United Kingdom zzso zzso zzso analysis of four of these zzso with a panel of 60 zzso zzso directed against the structural proteins confirmed a recognition pattern that was more consistent with strain zzso than with other North American zzso
