The zzso Cox protein is known to repress the zzso promoter, which controls the expression of the zzso immunity zzso zzso It has also been shown that Cox can activate the late promoter zzso of the unrelated zzso zzso By this process, a zzso zzso infecting a zzso zzso is capable of inducing replication of the zzso zzso an example of viral zzso In this report, we present evidence that Cox is also directly involved in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso Cox, in addition to zzso zzso and zzso coli integration host factor, was required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso it was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same amounts of zzso and integration host factor which zzso optimal zzso zzso in zzso also zzso optimal zzso zzso We zzso and compared the relative efficiencies of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso and discuss the functional implications of the zzso zzso I protection experiments revealed an extended zzso zzso region on the right arm of zzso centered at about zzso zzso from the center of the core zzso zzso shift zzso suggest that there are two Cox binding sites within this zzso Together, these data support the theory that in zzso zzso can exert control over the direction of zzso by either expressing zzso alone or zzso and Cox zzso
