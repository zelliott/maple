zzso zzso a potent rat liver zzso binds primarily to the zzso position of zzso zzso In a bacterial forward zzso zzso more than zzso of the zzso induced by zzso zzso are zzso zzso located at specific sites: the so-called zzso hot zzso We are particularly interested in a class of zzso zzso zzso occurring within a specific zzso the zzso zzso The zzso site, zzso contains three zzso zzso that are approximately equally zzso toward zzso zzso To study further the mechanism by which zzso are induced by zzso zzso at this site, we designed a new zzso zzso In this paper we describe the construction and the effectiveness of this probe, zzso which provides a simple zzso test for detecting zzso zzso within the zzso zzso The construction and the characterization of plasmids with a single zzso zzso in each of the three positions of the zzso site are also zzso The strategy of construction that was used involves the zzso of zzso containing a single zzso in a zzso site into a zzso zzso zzso zzso that have successfully integrated the zzso by zzso at both the zzso and the 3' ends were zzso by zzso on zzso zzso These zzso have been used in single zzso zzso zzso
