To isolate and identify bacteria from a sand filter column capable of degrading the taste and zzso compound, zzso In doing so, to investigate if these organisms degrade zzso either individually or if an alternative mechanism is zzso 

zzso bacteria from a biologically active sand filter column were enriched by their growth in a minimal medium supplemented with zzso as the sole carbon zzso By day 51, zzso zzso zzso of zzso had been zzso as determined by zzso zzso gas zzso zzso and was accompanied by a zzso zzso increase in active bacterial numbers as measured using the zzso bacterial viability kit and flow zzso zzso During the onset of zzso degradation, the predominance of three bacteria, most similar to previously cultured species of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso gene sequences was detected by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso isolation of these organisms revealed that degradation of zzso when present as either the sole carbon source zzso from 40 zzso zzso to 20 zzso zzso or when spiked into sterile zzso water zzso and 131 zzso zzso occurred only when all three zzso were zzso None of the zzso was shown to be capable of degrading zzso either individually or in any combination of zzso 

This study has reported, for the first time, the cooperative degradation of zzso by a consortium zzso three zzso bacteria isolated from a biologically active sand filter zzso 

These results are important for researchers currently employing zzso approaches to further understand the zzso of zzso by bacteria, as such studies may be complicated by the discovery of zzso degradation occurring by a zzso This study also advances the knowledge surrounding the types of bacteria capable of degrading the taste and zzso compound, as investigations to date regarding this are zzso
