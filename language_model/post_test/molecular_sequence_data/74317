Two zzso fragments zzso zzso number zzso and zzso with high zzso accumulated in the zzso flower buds of Chinese cabbage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are isolated and zzso By rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso the full length zzso of the two fragments were zzso The alignment of their zzso sequence showed that they are identical except for differences in a few zzso and should belong to the same zzso zzso B zzso zzso M ale F zzso 5 zzso The zzso gene consists of 252 zzso zzso a protein of 83 zzso acids and is interrupted by an zzso of 256 zzso zzso blast analysis revealed that zzso is a member of the zzso coat protein zzso gene family and shared a high zzso to zzso In the process of zzso eight different lengths of zzso sequence are found from the wild type of the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso could be a zzso gene in the Chinese cabbage zzso zzso that eight different lengths of zzso sequences might come from the same gene and could be a result of multiple sites zzso of zzso of zzso Based on sequence analysis, southern zzso combined with zzso and northern zzso it was discovered that zzso of zzso contained some functional elements and their zzso and spatial expression patterns were different, but all strongly expressed in the stage IV and stage V flower buds of wild zzso This indicate that different lengths of zzso may be involved in a regulation mechanism during the zzso of zzso
