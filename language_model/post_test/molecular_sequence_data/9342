A gene zzso a zzso zzso was isolated from a marine zzso library and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso shows very low similarity to full-length sequences of known zzso although a zzso domain correlated with the zzso zzso was zzso Based on the range of zzso zzso and the product profile, the protein was clearly defined as a zzso zzso zzso comparison indicated that zzso was related to four putative zzso previously identified only in bacterial zzso zzso They were all from marine bacteria and formed a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso was closely related to the probable genuine bacterial zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso may be an independent zzso of ancestral marine bacterial zzso
