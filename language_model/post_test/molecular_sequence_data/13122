At present, chemotherapy is not very effective against common solid zzso especially once they have zzso However, laboratory experiments and studies on dose zzso in humans have indicated that some zzso agents might be zzso but only if the dose given was very much higher than that zzso zzso zzso activated by zzso expressed at a high level in tumors can deliver at least zzso the normal dose and can cure animals with tumors normally resistant to zzso The approach is not zzso clinically because of the rarity of human tumors expressing a high level of an zzso zzso However, new therapies have been proposed that overcome this limitation of zzso zzso zzso that activate zzso can be directed to human tumor zzso by zzso them to zzso zzso After allowing for the zzso to clear from the blood a zzso is administered which is normally inert, but which is activated by the zzso delivered to the zzso This procedure is referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using different combinations of zzso zzso and zzso many classes of human tumor zzso have been shown to be very sensitive to this procedure although in most cases they are quite resistant to conventional zzso Early clinical trials are promising and indicate that zzso may become an effective treatment for all solid zzso for which zzso or zzso zzso are zzso zzso have also been targeted with the genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso This approach has been called zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso or more generally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and has shown good results in laboratory zzso These new therapies may finally realize the potential of zzso in cancer zzso
