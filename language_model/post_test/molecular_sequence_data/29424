The zzso protein of human zzso virus type 1 zzso has been reported to enhance zzso release from infected cells and to zzso the expression of zzso on infected zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso and the envelope zzso precursor zzso are translated from different reading frames of the same zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to assess the effect of the zzso sequences zzso to the zzso open reading frame on zzso zzso and zzso we have constructed a deletion zzso of a zzso cloned zzso zzso zzso virus zzso in which the entire coding region of zzso upstream of zzso had been deleted zzso While both zzso and zzso zzso comparable amounts of zzso zzso in infected cells, the zzso cells zzso more zzso precursor when standardized against the zzso zzso precursor zzso While more zzso was zzso than zzso in zzso cells, zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso protein was released from infected cells with delayed zzso a reflection of the lack of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso into two zzso zzso resulted in no loss of circulating zzso T zzso However, replicating virus could be detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 year after zzso and the zzso of one of the zzso exhibited severe zzso The results of these studies indicate that the zzso coding sequences upstream of zzso may zzso the level of zzso precursor zzso but significantly contribute to the zzso of this zzso in zzso zzso
