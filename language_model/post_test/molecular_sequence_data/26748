We examine the systematic position of the zzso family zzso Epstein and Brown, 2003, which includes the single species zzso zzso zzso We provide details on a zzso trait of the adult male zzso that appears to link zzso with zzso This putative relationship is consistent with molecular data derived from five zzso Based on zzso and molecular evidence, we place zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso of the zzso zzso is similarly modified in these families and in zzso This modification is unknown in other zzso and may prove to be a zzso linking zzso and zzso As the latter is not fully zzso with published molecular studies, we refrain from suggesting sister group position for zzso and zzso
