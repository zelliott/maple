Several genes of zzso zzso are positively selected due to the pressure from the host immune zzso This is a pattern completely opposite to that found in most zzso zzso which have few synonymous zzso The zzso is an important topic in zzso zzso We searched for unique zzso patterns in zzso zzso and identified a repetitive zzso motif in zzso which was recently grouped as a gene in the zzso zzso The repeat has a zzso zzso pattern in the otherwise highly zzso zzso Its zzso are limited to only one small region, and they are not consistent with replication zzso or gene conversion commonly found in low complexity zzso The repeat variation was analyzed in different strains of zzso zzso The zzso zzso motif can be a model to study gene diversification and used as a tool for strain zzso
