A bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a marine sponge in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with tapered ends, slowly zzso by gliding and strictly zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0 zzso zzso : 0 zzso zzso : zzso and summed feature 3, zzso zzso : 0 zzso and/or 16 : zzso zzso was the only respiratory zzso zzso zzso were not zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences placed zzso within a distinct lineage in the family zzso with zzso % sequence similarity to the nearest zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso was zzso zzso and was much higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be distinguished from other members of the zzso by means of a number of zzso and zzso zzso It is proposed, therefore, that zzso represents a novel zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso and an zzso description is therefore zzso
