A collection of lethal and zzso zzso insertions in the zzso region of zzso 3 of zzso zzso was used to investigate genes and gene arrangements by a combination of zzso zzso functional and molecular zzso The 12 lethal insertions studied fall into seven zzso groups of six zzso zzso zzso expression patterns and other zzso aspects of these genes were zzso The genes and additional available sequences were placed on cloned zzso DNA fragments and arranged in an zzso map of zzso that covers approximately the bands zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso links the zzso physical and molecular zzso The sequences adjacent to seven independent zzso insertions were established after zzso rescue or zzso chain zzso zzso searches allowed the assignment of the zzso insertions to known zzso expressed sequence zzso sequence zzso sites, or zzso genes of other zzso Among these were identified a putative zzso a putative cell cycle zzso and the gene responsible for the dominant zzso zzso of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene reveals a novel heat shock protein zzso zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso family and its coding sequence was zzso
