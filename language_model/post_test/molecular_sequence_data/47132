From a human zzso zzso library, we isolated a novel gene whose predicted product is highly zzso in zzso acid sequence to human zzso and zzso zzso proteins (about zzso and zzso identity, zzso The zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso contained a zzso open reading frame zzso 159 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed strong expression of a zzso transcript in heart, zzso liver, skeletal muscle, zzso zzso and zzso A zzso additional transcript was detected in zzso We assigned the zzso gene to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso
