We have isolated several zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso In zzso this zzso protein is zzso by a small zzso family, at least three members of which are zzso zzso transcript levels are highest in zzso active zzso such as zzso shoot, developing zzso and zzso zzso and lowest in zzso with little cell division, such as mature leaf and zzso Very little zzso zzso is present in zzso suggesting that translation of zzso zzso during zzso zzso uses zzso zzso During kernel development, the highest levels of zzso transcripts in zzso tissue are found at zzso days zzso zzso zzso levels decline continuously from this point zzso The period of zzso expression of the zzso zzso protein gene appears to zzso the onset of storage protein synthesis and does not correlate with the reported times of increased zzso volume or zzso zzso
