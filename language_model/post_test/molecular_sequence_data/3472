zzso gap junctions are composed of proteins called zzso and eight zzso zzso zzso have been identified in the now complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso channels formed by these proteins are zzso and previous studies have shown that, in a zzso expression system, zzso and zzso channels can form, each combination possessing different gating zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso exhibit complex overlapping expression patterns during zzso zzso zzso wing disc development and central nervous system development and show that only certain combinations of zzso zzso are possible in zzso This work forms an essential basis for future studies of zzso interactions in zzso and outlines the potential extent of zzso involvement in zzso
