The emergence of new technologies from the zzso revolution will transform the potential application of zzso to assess how pollutants impact people, animals, and zzso zzso databases provide a huge resource from which candidate molecular zzso can be identified and, zzso exploited to address these zzso However, a major challenge is to link these novel molecular zzso to ecologically relevant zzso zzso traits (such as reproduction and zzso Such a functional link is provided by zzso previously characterized as a member of the zzso zzso of zzso It is expressed in zzso worms within the zzso of the central nervous system and has been shown to be involved in the induction of zzso zzso This paper outlines the validation of zzso as a novel zzso of zzso fitness in the earthworm zzso zzso The design of primer pairs targeted toward zzso zzso has facilitated the isolation of a full-length zzso zzso from this zzso zzso of a real-time quantitative zzso procedure exploiting the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso Green, has allowed the measurement of zzso transcript levels over a range covering six orders of zzso Using this approach, gene expression was measured in zzso exposed to zzso zzso with high zzso of zinc and zzso Traditional growth and zzso zzso including cocoon production, were also recorded and related to the molecular zzso The future use of zzso as a molecular genetic zzso in zzso zzso is zzso
