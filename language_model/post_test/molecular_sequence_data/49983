The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso complex, a counterpart to the zzso complexes that participate in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene reveal its essential role in zzso zzso We identified new zzso zzso and zzso expressed deleted forms to dissect the specific functions of zzso zzso and germ cell clone analyses confirmed its requirement in a continuous and widespread fashion for proper cell fate determination and zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed unexpected roles in wing zzso abdomen development, zzso and sustained adult zzso A widespread distribution of zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso complex associated with many zzso but not always at transcribed zzso consistent with genetic data suggesting roles in both gene zzso and zzso Despite essential zzso complex functions in leg development, genetic and protein zzso studies revealed that zzso was not required or expressed in all zzso dependent on zzso complex zzso Thus, zzso is essential for some, but not all zzso functions, and it likely serves as an optional zzso directing zzso complex activity to specific gene zzso or cellular zzso
