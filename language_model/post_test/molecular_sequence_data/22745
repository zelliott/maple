zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso of neutral zzso to the corresponding zzso or zzso with the production of zzso and zzso The zzso is a new member of the zzso zzso zzso family, but it does not react with zzso zzso We present the zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso trapped during the turnover of zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso was solved by MAD phasing with 52 zzso sites in an zzso space zzso The electron density for the zzso zzso intermediate is clearly zzso The structure of zzso was used to solve the crystal structure of oxidized zzso at zzso A zzso The c axis for the zzso space group of oxidized zzso is zzso A, and there are six zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Four of the active sites contain zzso zzso a weak competitive zzso and two do not contain zzso zzso The zzso structures of zzso zzso and zzso reveal a zzso channel that extends from the exterior of the protein and zzso at zzso and the zzso position on the zzso face of the zzso Thus, zzso is in the correct position to serve as the zzso base, where it is proposed to abstract the alpha zzso from neutral zzso zzso The structures for zzso and various members of the zzso family overlay with zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region typically spans more than 325 zzso and includes zzso which is the zzso base in the zzso member of the zzso zzso However, zzso and the zzso exhibit differences in zzso patterns between the respective zzso base, zzso zzso and zzso These likely differentiate zzso from the zzso and, consequently, are proposed to result in the unique reaction mechanism of zzso
