In zzso zzso zzso alpha proteins are zzso by a zzso family of four zzso Three of them are clustered at the same zzso which was positioned 24 zzso from the top of zzso zzso A region of DNA spanning 63 zzso around these locus was zzso and zzso One main characteristic of the locus is the mosaic organization of both genes and zzso zzso Fourteen genes were identified, among which only four were already zzso and other unidentified are most likely zzso zzso diverse genes are found at close zzso zzso and zzso distribution is highly variable at this zzso one gene being split into at least 20 zzso Several zzso were found within the zzso segment both in coding and zzso regions, including two gene zzso Moreover, a sequence corresponding to the zzso zzso region of the zzso alpha genes and harboring a zzso intervening sequence is duplicated and found upstream of several zzso suggesting that zzso regions can be shuffled during zzso
