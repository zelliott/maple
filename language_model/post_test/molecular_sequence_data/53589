A search for the presence of zzso elements in the zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction led to the amplification of a partial DNA sequence coding for a putative zzso domain of zzso hormone zzso The amplified DNA sequence shows a high degree of zzso to the available turkey and human zzso and zzso stimulating hormone zzso coding zzso This is the first report on cloning such sequences of zzso zzso
