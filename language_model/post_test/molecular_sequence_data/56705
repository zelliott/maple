Recently, zzso techniques in which DNA zzso are introduced directly into zzso tissue in zzso have been zzso In theory, gene zzso should result in the production of zzso proteins in a natural form in the zzso zzso Here we present the use of such a technique for the zzso of mice with a human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope DNA construct zzso Mice were injected zzso with zzso and were subsequently analyzed for their zzso envelope immune zzso zzso collected from zzso animals reacted with the zzso zzso envelope in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso also contained zzso that were able to neutralize zzso infection and inhibit zzso zzso formation in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso derived from zzso animals demonstrated zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso technique mimics features of vaccination with live attenuated viruses and, therefore, may ultimately prove useful in the rapid development of safe and zzso vaccines as it provides for production of relevant zzso in zzso without the use of infectious zzso
