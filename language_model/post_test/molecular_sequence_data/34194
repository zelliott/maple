zzso is a rare genetic zzso disorder in which the eyes of affected individuals are zzso zzso Patients suffer from severe zzso as a result of their markedly reduced zzso zzso but otherwise are capable of seeing well unlike other more general forms of zzso To date one gene for zzso has been identified, zzso the zzso zzso related protein zzso Identification of additional genes for zzso will improve our understanding of normal zzso regulation of eye zzso 

We zzso a cohort of families from eastern Canada and Mexico with familial zzso We performed high density zzso and high density single zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify potential zzso regions of zzso We zzso coding regions of genes in the linked zzso by traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned and zzso a novel zzso from a putative zzso gene to verify gene zzso 

We identified a linked locus on zzso zzso with a peak zzso zzso 10) of odds zzso score of zzso zzso of coding zzso of all genes in the region identified multiple segregating zzso in one zzso recently zzso as zzso zzso gene zzso coding for a predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso One of our families was zzso for a predicted zzso zzso zzso one family was compound zzso for two predicted zzso zzso zzso and one family was compound zzso for a predicted zzso zzso zzso plus a zzso leading to obligatory zzso of the predicted zzso The zzso gene structure in public databases is based on a virtual transcript assembled from overlapping incomplete zzso zzso we have now validated the structure of a full-length transcript from embryonic mouse brain zzso 

zzso is a good candidate for the zzso gene for zzso in our zzso
