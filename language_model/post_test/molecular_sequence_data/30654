zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein under its own zzso control gave 5 to 10 times the level of protein observed when the zzso gene was on a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by a procedure including affinity zzso on a zzso DNA column yielded not only zzso but also a second zzso shown to be zzso by its reaction with an zzso zzso zzso comparisons of zzso and other members of a family of proteins sharing zzso zzso finger motifs identified an additional region of zzso in the middle of these proteins shown by genetic analysis to be important for zzso zzso zzso could be zzso zzso at the boundary of the zzso region, defining internal and zzso folded zzso
