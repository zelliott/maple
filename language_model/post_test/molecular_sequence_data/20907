zzso zzso avian influenza zzso H5N1 viruses were introduced to Hungary during zzso in three separate zzso This study aimed at determining the full-length zzso coding regions of the index strains from these zzso in order to: zzso understand the zzso relationship to other European H5N1 zzso zzso zzso the possible connection between the different outbreaks and zzso determine the putative origin and way of introduction of the different virus zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene of Hungarian zzso zzso obtained from wild birds during the first introduction revealed two groups designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the whole coding region of the two index viruses zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggests the role of wild birds in the introduction of zzso and zzso zzso the most similar zzso to zzso and zzso group were found in wild avian species in Croatia and zzso zzso The second introduction of zzso H5N1 led to the largest zzso in domestic waterfowl in zzso The index strain of the zzso zzso clustered to zzso zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso A common ancestry of zzso zzso with Bavarian strains is suggested as the most likely scenario of zzso zzso zzso viruses isolated from the third introduction clustered with isolate zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso The origin and way of introduction of zzso viruses is still obscure, thus further zzso zzso ecological and zzso data are required in order to zzso zzso
