A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a mixed zzso sample from a hot spring zzso Spring zzso at Yellowstone National zzso The zzso cells of this zzso were straight zzso zzso to zzso by zzso to zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso and exhibited a slight tumbling zzso They formed round zzso zzso in terminal swollen zzso zzso stained gram zzso The temperature range for growth at pH zzso was 43 to 65 degrees C, with optimum growth at 58 degrees zzso The range for growth at 60 degrees C zzso with the pH meter zzso at 60 degrees zzso was zzso to zzso with an optimum zzso of zzso to zzso The zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso was the only organic product from zzso and zzso zzso No zzso was produced during zzso The strain was not able to grow zzso at the expense of zzso however, suspensions of cells in the exponential growth phase consumed zzso The zzso reduced zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Growth was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso (as determined by zzso liquid zzso The zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis placed the isolate in the Gram zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso properties and zzso analysis we propose that the isolated strain constitutes a new species, zzso zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
