To determine the prevalence of human zzso zzso infections in children with lower respiratory disease in Thailand and monitor the association between species of zzso and clinical presentation in hospitalized zzso zzso 

Two hundred and zzso zzso zzso zzso specimens were collected from hospitalized zzso patients admitted to King zzso Memorial Hospital, Thailand during February zzso zzso acids were extracted from each sample with subsequent amplification of zzso by zzso zzso for zzso zzso Other viral respiratory pathogens were also detected by zzso zzso or real time zzso zzso sequences of the zzso region were used for zzso and zzso tree zzso 

In total, 87 of zzso specimens were positive for zzso indicating an annual prevalence of zzso zzso or asthma zzso was the most common clinical presentation observed in infected zzso zzso analysis and zzso tree showed that 29 zzso and 8 zzso specimens belonged to zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso positive samples were zzso zzso Moreover, species C was predominantly found in the zzso population of Thailand in raining season zzso The frequency of zzso of zzso with other respiratory viral pathogens was approximately zzso 

zzso represents the zzso species and is one of the zzso agents in acute lower respiratory tract infection, causes of zzso and asthma zzso in infants and young children in zzso
