The zzso occurrence of zzso zzso a snake zzso zzso under strong evolutionary control, was investigated in the pulmonary diffuse neuroendocrine system zzso of newborn cats and zzso By applying the zzso complex method on serial lung zzso we have demonstrated its distribution and zzso with different zzso zzso zzso A light microscopic study revealed apparent zzso for zzso in zzso components and smooth muscle tissue and in zzso bodies zzso while isolated neuroendocrine cells zzso remain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pattern with that of different zzso peptides on adjacent lung sections showed zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and nerve zzso on the one hand, and with zzso in airway and vascular smooth muscle cells, on the zzso These findings, in addition to the remarkable functional and structural similarities between zzso and zzso zzso suggest a common evolutionary origin and biological significance of zzso and zzso Moreover, this is the first time that a toxic zzso has been demonstrated in the zzso
