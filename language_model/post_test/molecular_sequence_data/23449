In order to identify genes zzso the outer membrane proteins zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression library of the zzso was screened by using rabbit zzso developed against its zzso Positive colonies of zzso coli zzso containing fragments zzso the bacterial zzso were selected for cloning the relevant genes by zzso walking zzso Two genes zzso a zzso zinc zzso and zzso zzso are reported in this zzso The zzso zinc zzso gene zzso is zzso zzso in zzso coding for 449 zzso acids zzso Despite the presence of a zzso motif zzso for all zzso the special zzso approximately 32 zzso approximately E motif of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its low level of identity with other reported zzso zzso may imply that the zzso zinc zzso of zzso zzso zzso represents a new family of zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the Pop is also novel as it has zzso 50% identity with other reported zzso zzso family zzso The present study represents the first to employ zzso bacterial zzso zzso to screen genes of zzso zzso of fish zzso bacteria, and to provide necessary information for the examination of the role of the two genes in the infection and zzso of zzso zzso
