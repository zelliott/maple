zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso not only zzso zzso factor zzso but also an inactive zzso comparable to zzso zzso zzso in its molecular size and zzso with zzso the zzso acid sequence of the inactive zzso is identical to that of the zzso zzso The inactive zzso zzso in culture zzso of both the zzso cells and a stable zzso of human zzso zzso in the zzso zzso T zzso selectively bound to zzso 10, whereas zzso zzso peptides from the same sources failed to bind to the zzso The inactive zzso human zzso from the stable zzso and zzso zzso zzso human zzso also had affinity for zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso T zzso and zzso zzso human zzso from the stable zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso However, zzso zzso produced by a stable zzso of human zzso zzso in zzso cells failed to be retained in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso specificity is determined by the cell source of the zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso does not represent a part of the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso It appears that the zzso is generated by a zzso modification of the zzso
