Four zzso of the natural zzso zzso zzso were tested for their ability to bind and inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso transfers the zzso group from zzso to the second zzso in the zzso DNA sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complexes obtained in the absence of DNA with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso 43, greater than zzso and greater than 1000 zzso zzso In the presence of a DNA zzso all four zzso show simple competitive zzso with respect to zzso The product of the zzso reaction, zzso is a poor inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two synthetic zzso zzso and zzso were also shown to be poor zzso with zzso values of 50 and greater than 1000 zzso zzso In contrast, the naturally occurring analog zzso was shown to be a highly potent inhibitor zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso confirm that the zzso complex is zzso The zzso complex is the first zzso complex detected for any DNA zzso Potential applications to structural studies of zzso interactions are zzso
