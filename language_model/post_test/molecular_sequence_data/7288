zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex, derived from the zzso system of zzso leukemia developed in China, was carried zzso The initial stock contained zzso zzso virus (and possibly other zzso and induced several zzso diseases in zzso zzso zzso Swiss zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (both zzso and zzso In addition, approximately zzso of zzso animals developed central nervous system zzso paralysis or zzso zzso zzso of virus from the zzso of an animal with combined zzso zzso followed by zzso dilution gave two stocks: 19-6 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both stocks induced zzso and zzso zzso and 19-6 induced zzso symptoms as zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso viruses from the 19-6 and the zzso cultures were zzso but different in the zzso zzso An infectious virus molecular clone of zzso from 19-6 cells was zzso The resulting cloned virus zzso 19-6 zzso leukemia virus zzso induced four kinds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in many cases, more than one tumor type was identified in the same zzso Such a broad spectrum of zzso induced by a cloned zzso is zzso zzso zzso paralysis induced by zzso 19-6 zzso could be attributed to zzso zzso zzso zzso with a panel of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the 19-6 and zzso viral stocks contained different zzso which differed from previously characterized zzso The viruses of the zzso complex may provide interesting zzso for investigations of zzso zzso
