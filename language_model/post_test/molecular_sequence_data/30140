The effective zzso of factor X by factor zzso requires the zzso activity of activated factor VIII zzso Factor zzso formation is also dependent on the presence of zzso charged zzso A zzso binding domain of zzso has been reported to be present on the zzso light zzso Recent observations on a subset of human zzso zzso have implicated the zzso C2 domain of zzso as containing a possible zzso binding zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate directly the role of the C2 domain in zzso zzso Twenty-six overlapping zzso which span the entire C2 domain of zzso were zzso The ability of these peptides to inhibit the binding of zzso human zzso to immobilized zzso was evaluated in an zzso zzso zzso Three overlapping synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso binding to zzso by greater than zzso when tested at a concentration of 100 zzso A fourth partially overlapping zzso zzso inhibited zzso binding by zzso These results suggest that the area described by these zzso zzso zzso to zzso may play an important role in the mediation of zzso binding to zzso
