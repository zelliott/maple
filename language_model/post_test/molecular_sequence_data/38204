zzso genes with sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso sine zzso zzso constitute the SIX zzso There is notable expression of members of this family in anterior neural structures, and several SIX genes have been shown to play roles in zzso and insect development, or have been implicated in maintenance of the differentiated state of zzso zzso in three of these genes in man zzso zzso and zzso are associated with severe zzso and therefore, the cloning of other human genes from this family is of zzso We have cloned and zzso the gene that encodes human zzso zzso its gene structure and conducted expression studies in a range of zzso zzso is widely expressed in the late zzso zzso but has a limited range of expression sites in the zzso The expression pattern of zzso and its zzso to zzso zzso will be of use in assessing its candidacy in human zzso zzso
