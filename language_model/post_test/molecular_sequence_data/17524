Heat zzso of zzso zzso bonds was used to probe the primary structures of the zzso T4 major zzso protein zzso zzso its mature zzso form zzso and a zzso zzso called zzso This analysis suggests that zzso is a zzso resulting from the zzso processing found in zzso as well as zzso at the zzso zzso labeling with zzso and zzso followed by heat zzso suggests binding sites for these compounds toward the zzso of zzso suggesting zzso of functions within the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso experiments were targeted therefore to the zzso end of zzso as well as to its processing zzso zzso processing site modification supports the consensus zzso zzso zzso rule, whereas zzso at the zzso suggests that the zzso zzso is unlikely to result from a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid replacements in zzso at newly introduced amber sites reveal a new zzso zzso zzso defective partially zzso heads, in support of the hypothesis that zzso and its products function directly in the DNA packaging zzso
