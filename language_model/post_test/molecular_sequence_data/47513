zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso forms a secondary structure that includes five sequence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the five zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso kinetic analysis in zzso with different zzso in the presence and absence of the protein zzso reveal that zzso certain zzso exhibit defects that vary in a zzso manner, and that zzso the protein zzso can correct the zzso zzso in zzso a phenomenon that is also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso that exhibit kinetic defects differ from those of zzso zzso zzso Although the data collected in zzso underscore the importance of the zzso motif to zzso zzso function and structure, three of the five zzso we examined in zzso are essential for the function of zzso coli zzso zzso The kinetic data in zzso are not in total agreement with previous zzso predictions but the data in zzso are, as only zzso in those zzso proposed to be involved in zzso interactions fail to complement in zzso zzso the zzso motif is critical for the stabilization of the structure of zzso zzso and essential to zzso P function in the zzso
