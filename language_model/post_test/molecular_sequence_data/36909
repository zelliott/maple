Using the sequence conservation in the G zzso zzso zzso we have isolated an zzso A1 zzso zzso from a human zzso zzso library by zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso cells, the protein zzso by this zzso binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso with high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and, zzso is able to inhibit zzso production upon zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso M zzso The binding and functional characteristics of the expressed zzso demonstrate that we have isolated a human brain zzso zzso zzso of the A1 zzso
