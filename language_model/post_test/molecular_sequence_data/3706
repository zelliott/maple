zzso a leaf zzso zzso was cloned from an zzso leaf zzso zzso trap line and functionally zzso zzso gene and zzso gel zzso analyses revealed that zzso was not expressed until the onset of zzso in zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein zzso in zzso coli displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interference in transgenic plants delayed the onset of leaf zzso for approximately 4 zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso caused precocious zzso in both attached and detached leaves of transgenic zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso plays a significant role in leaf zzso
