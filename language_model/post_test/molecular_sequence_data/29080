The zzso 2 zzso of the zzso complex is known to be zzso in zzso by a zzso zzso and it has been demonstrated recently that zzso 2 zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Andrews, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the identity of the zzso zzso responsible for this zzso is zzso Here we identify and characterize a novel member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso with zzso protein zzso and that it directly binds the ear domain of zzso in zzso and in zzso In zzso cells, zzso is enriched at zzso zzso whereas in zzso cells it zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso pits and at the leading edge of zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso for zzso show that zzso zzso by zzso results in a decrease in zzso zzso zzso Together, these results provide strong evidence that zzso is the zzso zzso 2 zzso and plays a regulatory role in zzso zzso These results also lend support to the idea that zzso zzso is controlled by cycles of zzso
