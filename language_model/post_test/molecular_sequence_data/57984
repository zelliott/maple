D1 and zzso zzso receptors are zzso coupled receptors and have seven zzso spanning regions zzso typical of this zzso zzso Although zzso binds equally to D1 and zzso zzso many compounds are highly zzso To probe the receptors for regions that determine zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for the D1 or a zzso zzso zzso were made and zzso into cells to study the binding and zzso properties of zzso or zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso gains much of its selectivity by binding to within TM VI and zzso of the zzso zzso
