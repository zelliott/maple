The gene zzso which is localized in the zzso puff zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes the major zzso glue protein zzso The gene consists of two zzso interrupted by a short zzso In the zzso zzso region of zzso we find putative zzso zzso binding sites and two zzso zzso sequence motifs which are possibly involved in gene zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the DNA sequence reveals a relationship to the zzso glue protein family of zzso zzso The size of the zzso transcripts decreases in late third zzso larvae zzso with their zzso This is caused by zzso followed by distinct zzso attacks in the 3' untranslated zzso zzso data suggest the presence of another glue protein gene in the zzso puff region which is related to the zzso zzso
