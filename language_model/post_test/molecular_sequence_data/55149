Identification and characterization of protein zzso sites often requires mass zzso analysis, which is not trivial or accessible to many zzso Here, a targeted strategy to zzso putative zzso sites within zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is zzso This employs a combination of standard type II with type zzso restriction zzso to rapidly create individual or multiple zzso site zzso versions of zzso zzso with high efficiency, thereby reducing the cost for screening zzso zzso
