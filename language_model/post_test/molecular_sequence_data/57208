The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso are zzso off zzso and have been implicated in feedback regulation of their own zzso Recently, we showed that a zzso of the zzso zzso of type I collagen zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso This stimulation of type I zzso type III zzso and zzso production occurred in a zzso and zzso manner with no effect on total protein synthesis or on the ratio of zzso proteins to zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso In the present report, we have extensively dissected this zzso of the zzso and found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the minimum sequence necessary for potent stimulation of collagen and zzso production in a variety of zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso production in zzso may be subject to either positive or negative feedback regulation depending on the repertoire of specific zzso during zzso tissue zzso and zzso
