The zzso genes zzso are essential for iron acquisition via the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the open reading frame corresponding to the zzso gene possesses zzso that are characteristic of zzso proteins that bind the zzso zzso In this work, a zzso zzso against an zzso containing the last 27 zzso acids of the zzso region from this open reading frame was used to demonstrate that zzso encodes a 35 zzso protein that is essential for iron zzso By using this zzso we were able to demonstrate that expression of the zzso gene is zzso regulated by the zzso protein at high iron zzso zzso its expression was positively regulated by the combined action of the zzso protein and products of the zzso zzso zzso the product of the zzso zzso is isolated with the membrane zzso In accordance with these findings is the fact that the first 23 zzso acid zzso of this protein have the properties of a zzso signal zzso The zzso nature of zzso is supported by the fact that treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso an inhibitor of the zzso signal zzso results in the zzso of a 38 zzso zzso precursor zzso
