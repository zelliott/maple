zzso zzso zzso zzso form small communities within zzso and zzso zzso zzso The species show differences in galling habits and exhibit zzso winged or zzso zzso The large zzso zzso zzso early in zzso development and lay few zzso the small zzso zzso lay more eggs soon after zzso the zzso zzso enter the zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso induced by other zzso zzso The zzso of the group remains unclear and only one zzso based on limited sampling has been published to zzso Here we present an expanded zzso for zzso zzso zzso including about zzso times the number of described zzso We zzso zzso and nuclear markers zzso zzso on 73 species and 145 individuals and conducted maximum likelihood and zzso zzso zzso We then used this zzso to reconstruct the evolution of zzso zzso strategies and test if the presence of winged males and small zzso size may be zzso 

The resulting trees are well resolved and strongly zzso With the exception of zzso which is zzso with respect to zzso all zzso are zzso The zzso are divided into three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The ancestral states for galling habits and male zzso remain ambiguous and our reconstructions show that the two traits are evolutionary zzso 

The three main zzso could be considered as tribes and we list some zzso characters that define zzso The same zzso zzso several times zzso which make zzso an interesting model to test predictions on what factors will zzso the evolution of a particular zzso The zzso zzso are the only zzso zzso In 15 zzso they evolved several zzso adaptations to enter the zzso that make them strongly divergent from their sister zzso zzso appears to be another example where sexual selection on male mating opportunities favored winged males in species with small zzso and wingless males in species with large zzso However, some species are exceptional in that they lay few eggs but exhibit zzso zzso which we zzso could be due to other selective pressures selecting against the zzso of winged zzso
