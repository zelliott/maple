The zzso zzso zzso was originally isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but there is evidence that zzso peptides also occur in other zzso Here we report the discovery of a gene in the sea zzso zzso zzso that encodes two copies of an zzso zzso zzso or zzso Interestingly, the zzso region of the zzso precursor shares sequence similarity with zzso carrier proteins zzso uniquely associated with precursors of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso precursor is the first zzso zzso precursor to be discovered that does not contain a zzso zzso However, it remains to be determined whether zzso acts as a carrier protein for zzso The zzso zzso zzso also contains a gene zzso a precursor zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso - the first zzso zzso to be identified in an zzso zzso in zzso zzso there are two genes zzso precursors that have a zzso domain but which zzso zzso that are structurally zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso cause contraction of tube foot and zzso preparations from the sea zzso zzso zzso consistent with the zzso of zzso in sea cucumbers and the zzso of zzso peptides in other animal zzso Presumably the zzso precursor acquired its zzso domain following partial or complete zzso of a gene zzso a zzso zzso but it remains to be determined when in evolutionary history this zzso
