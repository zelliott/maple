Many different zzso result from the zzso zzso in the zzso One of these interesting zzso is a zzso which produces temperature sensitive zzso and the basis of this sensitivity remains zzso We cultured Himalayan mouse zzso from the skin and constructed a zzso zzso then, we isolated the Himalayan zzso zzso and determined the zzso zzso The zzso gene in the Himalayan mouse contains an zzso change at zzso zzso that alters a zzso zzso to an zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso This zzso zzso and the surrounding zzso acids are zzso in their evolution from mouse to zzso Interestingly, the zzso with its surrounding eight zzso acids are aligned between mouse zzso and human zzso These results indicate the possibility that the altered zzso at zzso acid zzso of mouse zzso may be important in stabilization of the zzso zzso or in interaction with other zzso such as zzso zzso
