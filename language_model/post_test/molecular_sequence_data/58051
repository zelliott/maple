Sea zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are characterized by zzso zzso zzso regions consisting largely of multiple clustered zzso zzso zzso adjacent to two basic zzso zzso This report presents data showing differences in DNA affinities between peptides containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were produced by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and two forms of zzso differing in zzso content were zzso by zzso zzso The DNA affinities of the peptides were compared using several zzso zzso was bound more tightly by zzso than zzso zzso zzso DNA under a broad range of zzso zzso zzso did zzso Both zzso and zzso protected DNA against zzso zzso but zzso created a more stable zzso zzso Thirty to sixty times more zzso than zzso was required to obtain equivalent zzso of zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso did not behave as a competitive inhibitor of DNA binding by zzso zzso binding to zzso We conclude that during zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region increases its zzso and thus its affinity for zzso
