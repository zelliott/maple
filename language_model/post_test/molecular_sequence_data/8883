zzso infectious zzso virus zzso was presumed to arise from zzso in the zzso of a ubiquitous and largely zzso zzso enteric coronavirus zzso However, a recent study found that one-third of zzso zzso have an intact zzso and suggested that it is not solely involved in zzso but is essential for zzso zzso In order to confirm these zzso 27 zzso and 32 zzso coronavirus zzso were obtained from resident or adopted cats from a large metropolitan shelter during zzso and their zzso zzso and M genes zzso Forty percent of coronavirus zzso from zzso zzso had an intact zzso zzso while zzso had zzso that truncated the gene zzso The zzso genes of zzso zzso from healthy cats were always zzso zzso from zzso diseased zzso consistently induced zzso when given either zzso or zzso zzso regardless of the functional status of their zzso zzso thus confirming them to be zzso In contrast, zzso zzso from healthy cats were infectious following zzso infection and shed at high levels in feces without causing disease, as expected for zzso Only one in three cats shed zzso in the feces following zzso infection, indicating that zzso can replicate zzso but with zzso zzso having a zzso zzso were not shed in the feces following either zzso or zzso zzso while zzso with intact zzso genes were shed in the feces following zzso but not zzso zzso zzso an intact zzso appears to be essential for zzso zzso Although zzso with an intact zzso were shed in the feces following zzso zzso zzso virus from these cats was not infectious for other zzso Attempts to identify potential zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and M were zzso However, the zzso gene of zzso even though appearing intact, contained many more zzso zzso acid changes in the 3' one-third of the zzso protein than zzso An attempt to trace zzso zzso back to enteric strains existing in the shelter was only partially successful due to the large region over which shelter cats and kittens zzso housing conditions prior to zzso and rapid movement through the zzso No evidence could be found to support a recent theory that zzso and zzso are genetically zzso
