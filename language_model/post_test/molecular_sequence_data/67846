zzso zzso a zzso zzso is found in all tight zzso zzso motifs are comprised of four zzso zzso associated with the zzso to or formation of diverse membrane zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso The functions of the zzso zzso motif are zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso family proteins has distinct zzso zzso sequence features that are consistent with its zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to analyze the zzso distribution and zzso of zzso full-length human zzso or the zzso zzso motif excluding the zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso efficiently arrived at the plasma membrane zzso and was sorted to the zzso PM in zzso polarized zzso zzso A series of zzso aromatic zzso acids within the zzso domain were found to be associated with zzso zzso using zzso zzso inhibited membrane pore growth during zzso zzso and was shown to increase the zzso state using zzso a zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain mediates zzso and correct sorting to the zzso zzso
