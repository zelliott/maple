A new zzso repeated zzso DNA family namely zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso zzso is found in the above two species, as well as two other representatives of the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso did not reveal it in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso - the other zzso of the family zzso The results suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso specific family of tandem DNA zzso However, a comparison between sequences of zzso and zzso repeat units revealed 60 zzso regions zzso zzso The latter is a satellite DNA family typical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of some species of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso tandem repeats share several common features zzso the same AT content and distribution of multiple short zzso runs, internal structure of repeated units, the presence of conservative zzso These data are indicative of their common origin and a possibly strong selective pressure upon zzso both zzso A comparative analysis of structure, organization, and abundance of these two families of zzso reveals evolutionary pathways that led to their formation and zzso The data are consistent with the hypotheses of the concerted evolution of satellite DNA zzso The possibility of use of zzso as a zzso zzso defining relationships within zzso zzso zzso as well as within the whole family of zzso is zzso
