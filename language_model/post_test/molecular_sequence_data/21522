zzso are small zzso antibiotics that contain the characteristic zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso As zzso zzso zzso zzso possess zzso gene clusters which contain the structural gene zzso as well as the other genes which are involved in zzso modification zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation zzso zzso export zzso and immunity zzso The zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not naturally zzso 

The aim of these studies was to test if the production of zzso could be transferred to a naturally competent zzso strain employing zzso DNA of the producer zzso zzso zzso zzso was chosen for these experiments because it already harbors the zzso immunity zzso After transfer of the zzso part of the gene cluster by competence zzso production of active zzso was obtained from a zzso in zzso Furthermore, comparison of several DNA sequences and zzso testing of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the producer strain of zzso is a member of the species zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso can be produced in zzso zzso zzso which is closely related to the wild type producer strain of zzso The new zzso producer strain enables us to use the full potential of the zzso gene cluster for genetic manipulation and downstream modification zzso
