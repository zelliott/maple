zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) is a new program that can identify DNA motifs occurring with a high zzso from the expected zzso The program generates families of patterns, each family having a common set of defined zzso zzso bases are inserted amongst the defined bases in different ways, thus generating the diverse patterns of each zzso The zzso of the different patterns are then compared and zzso within each family, assuming that all patterns should have the same probability of zzso An extensive use of computer memory, combined with the immediate sorting of counts by address calculation allow a complete counting of all DNA motifs on a single pass on the DNA zzso This approach offers a very fast way to search for unusually distributed patterns and can identify zzso patterns as well as exact zzso
