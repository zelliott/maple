The zzso zzso zzso module of human zzso zzso zzso was obtained in native form by zzso production in zzso cell culture and thus shown to represent an independently folding zzso This module showed a large loss in zzso upon calcium zzso Apparently only one of the two zzso hands binds zzso with a moderate affinity zzso zzso zzso about zzso lower than in the zzso zzso zzso No clear evidence was obtained for collagen zzso indicating that zzso zzso found in different proteins may not share similar zzso
