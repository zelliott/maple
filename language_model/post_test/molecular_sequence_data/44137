The zzso sequence of clone zzso zzso zzso containing the gene for zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso It contains an zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso The central part of the protein is zzso to the complete zzso domain of bacterial and some zzso zzso and belongs to family 16 of zzso zzso This domain is flanked on both sides by one copy on each side of a zzso binding domain zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso from zzso coli host cells in two forms, a 73 zzso and a processed 52 zzso zzso both having high specific activity towards zzso zzso and zzso U zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Limited activity on zzso zzso was detected (90 U zzso zzso was zzso in an zzso zzso yielding zzso zzso and zzso as end zzso Thus zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso The optimum temperature of the zzso was 95 degrees C zzso zzso and 85 degrees C zzso zzso at an optimum pH of zzso The superior zzso of the 73 zzso zzso is demonstrated by incubation without zzso at 100 degrees C, where 57% of the initial activity remained after 30 zzso zzso at 95 degrees zzso Thus, zzso is the most zzso zzso described to zzso
