zzso and membrane damage play a central role in the life-threatening effects of the zzso zzso zzso are an important part of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the most zzso snake in Europe, was zzso and its three-dimensional structure zzso The toxin is devoid of zzso zzso The structure demonstrates a formation of zzso In the zzso functionally important zzso zzso located on the protein surface, point in the same direction which can strengthen the pharmacological zzso This supports the hypothesis about the zzso importance of the toxin zzso for the zzso and membrane zzso The zzso model revealed that the structural zzso of zzso (a positively charged zzso region and a zzso zzso are fully exposed on the protein surface and accessible for interactions with target zzso zzso of the zzso site region explains the absence of zzso zzso The structure reveals zzso sites which can be considered as possible sites of interactions of the toxin with a zzso charged membrane zzso The high structural similarity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the same zzso suggests an evolutionary zzso probably, the zzso zzso is a product of evolution of the zzso active zzso zzso The first toxin lost the zzso activity which is not necessary for the zzso but preserved the zzso and membrane damaging activity as important components of the zzso zzso
