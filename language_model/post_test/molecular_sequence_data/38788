Fish losses from infectious diseases are a significant problem in aquaculture zzso zzso we investigated the ability of zzso zzso peptides to protect against infection caused by the fish pathogen zzso zzso To identify effective peptides for fish, the zzso of certain zzso peptides against fish pathogens were determined in zzso Two of the most effective zzso zzso zzso a zzso hybrid zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso form of the natural zzso zzso were selected for in zzso zzso A single zzso injection of zzso did not affect mortality rates in juvenile zzso salmon infected with zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso zzso the peptides were delivered continuously using zzso pumps placed in the zzso zzso Twelve days after pump zzso the fish received zzso injections of zzso zzso at a dose that would kill 50 to zzso of the zzso Fish receiving 200 zzso of zzso per day survived longer and had significantly lower accumulated zzso zzso than the control groups zzso to zzso Fish receiving zzso zzso at 250 zzso per day also survived longer and had significantly lower accumulated zzso zzso than the control groups zzso to zzso This clearly shows the potential for zzso peptides to protect fish against infections and indicates that the strategy of zzso the peptides in transgenic fish may provide a method of decreasing bacterial disease zzso
