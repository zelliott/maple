zzso members of family zzso are a major cause of acute zzso of infants and young zzso The zzso zzso consists of 11 segments of zzso zzso and the zzso is an zzso composed of multiple layers of zzso The zzso core is formed by a layer of zzso and contains multiple copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso particles zzso representing zzso surrounded by a layer of zzso direct the synthesis of viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso replication zzso zzso catalyze the synthesis of zzso from viral template zzso coincidentally with the packaging of the zzso into the zzso structures of zzso In addition to structural zzso the zzso proteins zzso and zzso are components of zzso with zzso zzso zzso self assembles into zzso structures that have affinity for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Its interaction with zzso zzso a zzso shift in the zzso to a more condensed zzso zzso zzso generated by the zzso activity are believed to be transferred from zzso to zzso leading to the zzso of the latter zzso It is suspected that the transfer of the zzso group to zzso allows zzso to return to its zzso state and, thus, to accept another zzso zzso The zzso cycling of zzso from condensed to zzso combined with its zzso binding and zzso activities are consistent with zzso functioning as a molecular motor to facilitate the packaging of template zzso into the zzso structures of zzso zzso with the zzso virus protein zzso and the zzso proteins zzso and zzso suggest that they may be functional zzso of zzso zzso and zzso
