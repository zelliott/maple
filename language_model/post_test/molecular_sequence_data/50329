The zzso zzso zzso located at the brown zzso in zzso encodes the protein that determines the type of zzso zzso This protein is known as zzso zzso but here we tentatively term it zzso protein to avoid zzso with the related sequence zzso to the zzso zzso In order to identify the zzso at the zzso we have cloned and characterized the zzso protein gene of zzso mouse zzso zzso The gene is about 18 zzso long and organized into 8 zzso and 7 zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein gene reveals four base changes within the zzso zzso two zzso zzso and two silent zzso Two zzso zzso result in the zzso to zzso substitution at position 86 zzso zzso and the zzso to His substitution at position zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein zzso Using zzso amplification, we confirmed that these zzso zzso are actually present in the zzso DNA of two zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice, suggesting that these zzso are specific for the zzso mice at the zzso Moreover, we are able to show that the zzso protein containing zzso 86 is not zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in transient expression zzso
