To detect the zzso and expression of zzso in Chinese patients of zzso and to investigate the possible relationship of gene zzso and zzso giant cells in zzso 

zzso DNA was extracted from zzso zzso and peripheral blood samples of 10 cases of zzso (6 familial zzso and 4 sporadic zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso The nature of zzso giant cells in zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was detected by zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 9 of zzso were identified which led to 3 transitions zzso zzso zzso There were no abnormalities in zzso 3 of zzso except 1 case which had not zzso zzso The protein zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso were detected in the zzso of all zzso giant cells and parts of zzso zzso cells in 8 zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso may participate in the differentiation and maturation of zzso cells in the zzso of zzso
