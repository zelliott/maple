The highly zzso zzso protein zzso is a common feature of zzso zzso zzso sites for zzso so-called zzso zzso are present in the otherwise unrelated zzso satellite zzso of humans, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso giant zzso tree zzso and zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso and its binding sites are not detected at the zzso of zzso Y zzso and few, if any, binding sites seem present on African green monkey zzso There is extensive sequence similarity between zzso and zzso proteins zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which includes the human zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 has an almost perfect match to the zzso site within its terminal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of zzso with related proteins raises the possibility that zzso might share the ability to cause zzso DNA zzso Such nicks could promote zzso as has been suggested for the zzso disease zzso where a zzso hotspot exists close to a zzso zzso We suggest that by promoting nicks adjacent to zzso boxes, zzso might facilitate the evolution and maintenance of satellite sequence zzso rather than have a direct role in zzso zzso
