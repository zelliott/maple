In order to study the molecular mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso of potato zzso a novel zzso of zzso h group, zzso which was zzso early in the 4 zzso storage of zzso potato zzso zzso zzso was cloned in present zzso The genetic transformation of zzso zzso and zzso interference zzso of zzso into potato zzso zzso 3 zzso was carried out to clarify its function in zzso zzso The results showed that the transcripts of zzso in either zzso or zzso were strongly induced in 4 zzso storage and zzso related to the reducing sugar zzso zzso indicating that zzso is involved in the zzso process of potato zzso zzso analysis between the transcripts and protein contents of zzso showed a very significant zzso relationship zzso that the expression of zzso may be mainly regulated at zzso zzso Further monitoring the variation of the sugar contents in zzso zzso demonstrated a linear relationship between zzso and zzso zzso Thus, it can be zzso that zzso may function in the zzso zzso for zzso regulation of potato zzso 

zzso is primarily demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of potato zzso and it may function in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
