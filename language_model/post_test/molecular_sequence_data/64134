The aim of this study was to determine whether drug-resistant virus persists in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso after long-term suppression of virus zzso zzso DNA was extracted from the zzso of 11 patients on long-term highly active zzso therapy zzso zzso of the reverse zzso zzso and zzso gene of several zzso zzso was performed using limiting dilution zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso All patients were on successful zzso for a mean period of 59 months but had a history of zzso therapy and zzso drug resistance zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence of the zzso and zzso gene in the different zzso zzso with that of the plasma virus isolated before zzso treatment, revealed that the different drug-resistant viral zzso that evolved during the process of gradually building up resistance were still zzso in the zzso in 10 of the 11 patients zzso The proportion of resistant zzso was found to correlate with the time that the resistant zzso had been able to zzso These data clearly show that virus zzso that are able to replicate for a certain period enter the zzso zzso and remain zzso in the zzso for a very long zzso
