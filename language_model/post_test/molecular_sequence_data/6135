A second zzso of bovine viral zzso virus, zzso zzso 2 or zzso 2, has been identified based on zzso analysis of sequences from the zzso untranslated region of the viral zzso In this study, we derived the complete zzso acid sequence of a virulent zzso 2 virus, zzso isolated from an animal that died of an acute uncomplicated zzso zzso zzso is zzso in cell culture and does not produce a zzso viral zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso zzso bases long and codes for zzso zzso zzso In comparison, the zzso of other zzso zzso are shorter by about 250 zzso The sequence identity at the zzso acid level, between zzso and published sequences for other zzso is zzso or zzso The most zzso zzso and zzso acid sequences between zzso and other zzso are located in the region coding for the zzso protein zzso The least zzso are in the regions coding for the structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso The larger size of the zzso zzso is due to a zzso zzso in the portion of the zzso coding for the viral zzso zzso The location of this zzso was upstream from those reported in zzso zzso This zzso was not characteristic of all of the zzso 2 viruses or all of the virulent zzso 2 zzso
