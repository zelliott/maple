Many snake zzso contain toxins which produce profound cardiovascular zzso The site of action of these toxins includes cardiac muscle, vascular smooth muscle and the zzso vascular zzso Some snake zzso for example, contain peptides that inhibit zzso converting zzso and zzso the biological actions of zzso Other snake zzso contain structural and functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are short zzso toxins found in the zzso of snakes from zzso zzso which display potent zzso zzso These zzso which share a high degree of sequence identity with zzso recognize and bind to zzso zzso Snakes have also evolved toxins which block zzso zzso currents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins have also been shown to increase vascular zzso One such zzso increasing zzso zzso protein zzso has recently been isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is an extremely potent zzso factor with a structure similar to vascular zzso growth factor zzso Thus there is a vast array of snake toxins with potent cardiovascular zzso Some of these proteins and peptides have proven to be highly selective tools in the study of zzso zzso Others have been used as zzso of potential therapeutic targets or as lead compounds in the development of therapeutic zzso Therefore these and other related snake zzso proteins hold great promise in the future understanding and treatment of cardiovascular zzso
