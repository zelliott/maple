Chemical and zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso protein has been used to zzso the zzso site for the zzso agent zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the partial zzso acid sequence of the zzso 18 zzso zzso zzso with the known zzso acid sequence for the zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the binding site for zzso is between the zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso with zzso suggests that this site is within the membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso generated a major zzso zzso of Mr approximately zzso zzso identified as zzso zzso zzso focusing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified two peptides which likely zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso The common region for these zzso peptides is the tenth putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Additional support for this conclusion comes from studies in which zzso was zzso into the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso of this transport protein was protected by both zzso B and zzso The region of the zzso zzso zzso thought to be zzso with zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in the sequence of the zzso coli zzso zzso
