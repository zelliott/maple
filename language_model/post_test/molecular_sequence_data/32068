The zzso virus zzso gene product exhibits some sequence similarity to the zzso host range zzso zzso of zzso zzso To address the potential host range function of the zzso gene product in zzso a deletion zzso of zzso virus zzso was generated and zzso zzso zzso to normal zzso levels and produced zzso that were indistinguishable from those produced by zzso in zzso in a monkey kidney cell line zzso that are zzso for wild type zzso However, zzso failed to replicate in all rabbit cell lines tested, including both primary and established cells lines, as well as cells derived from a variety of zzso zzso expression was not required for zzso virus zzso entry or early gene zzso whereas DNA replication was aborted and late genes were not expressed in zzso infected rabbit zzso Thus, the replication block for zzso in rabbit cells preceded the stage of late gene expression and DNA zzso Finally, an in zzso zzso study indicated that zzso failed to cause any signs of classic zzso in infected zzso but functioned as a zzso vaccine and provided protection for subsequent challenge by wild type zzso zzso Altogether, these observations demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in determining the host specificity of zzso virus in rabbit zzso
