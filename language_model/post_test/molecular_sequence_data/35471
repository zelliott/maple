zzso comprise one of the major groups of zzso in zzso Because zzso are zzso indispensable zzso for all zzso plants, their zzso must be zzso regulated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as petals or zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso leading to a white zzso zzso was recently identified as a new member of the zzso family, but its detailed expression profile in plant zzso has not yet been zzso In this study, we zzso a zzso region upstream of zzso and assessed its zzso promoter zzso To evaluate the activity of this zzso we constructed two types of transgenic zzso zzso that zzso respectively, a fusion gene of a zzso or zzso segment of the upstream region plus the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso activity in the zzso strain was observed mainly in the zzso in flower zzso whereas zzso activity of the zzso strain was observed in immature petals of the flower zzso Among the zzso elements located between positions zzso and zzso no elements that have previously been reported to enhance the expression in petals or to suppress it in zzso were detected by PLACE analysis, indicating the existence of unknown zzso A zzso reverse zzso chain reaction analysis revealed that zzso zzso was prominent in petals but was zzso in roots, stems and zzso
