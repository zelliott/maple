A more efficient zzso isolation and zzso method for zzso zzso zzso c zzso produced in zzso coli is zzso Two types of zzso zzso zzso have been produced and zzso the zzso nuclear gene sequence and the zzso original protein zzso These two sequences constitute the majority of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso currently in production and from which all zzso zzso now zzso The zzso have been subjected to extensive physical zzso including sequencing, zzso zzso zzso gel zzso kinetic zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso Less extensive characterization data are also presented for zzso zzso zzso an zzso produced in zzso zzso zzso All of these results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso are functionally and zzso identical to the native, zzso zzso zzso This improved method uses standard zzso to produce highly zzso zzso in a more efficient manner than previously zzso Two methods for assembling the zzso are zzso In one, zzso zzso is added at zzso while in the other zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso A primary reason for developing this method has been the need to minimize loss of zzso zzso zzso and, so, this method has also been used to produce both the zzso and the zzso zzso as well as several zzso
