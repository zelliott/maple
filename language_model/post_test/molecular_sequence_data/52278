Despite years of study, a comprehensive picture of the binding of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso A, to carbohydrates remains zzso We report here studies on the interaction of zzso A with zzso zzso the minimum zzso zzso that completely fills the zzso binding site, and the two conceptual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso In all cases the interaction of protein and zzso is zzso driven, with an zzso zzso zzso The choice of concentration scales has an important impact on both the magnitude and, in some cases, the sign of the zzso component of the free energy of zzso The zzso data suggest binding of the two zzso may take place in distinct sites, as opposed to binding in a single high affinity zzso In contrast to zzso zzso delta zzso values were small and negative, pointing to possible differences in the motifs used by the two groups of proteins to bind zzso The zzso data are interpreted in terms of zzso zzso zzso during zzso binding was also zzso zzso zzso was observed only for binding of the zzso and gave a Hill plot zzso of zzso for zzso zzso
