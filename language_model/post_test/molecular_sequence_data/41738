The zzso zzso zzso binding domain of zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso part of the gene from spinach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to two zzso peptides common to both the full-length zzso zzso zzso and an zzso form that zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso were used in a zzso chain reaction to isolate a partial zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of spinach zzso with the sequences of potato zzso zzso showed that the partial zzso included one region that was highly zzso between the zzso zzso of the partial zzso clone of zzso in zzso coli produced a zzso fusion protein that zzso labeled with zzso zzso labeling of the zzso fusion protein was specific, indicating that this portion of the zzso protein harbors the zzso zzso Isolation of a modified zzso from the zzso protein provided tentative identification of zzso acid zzso that make up the zzso domain of zzso
