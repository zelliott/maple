The zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso are often interrupted by zzso defined as either group I or group zzso Some of the zzso contained within the precursor zzso of these genes will self zzso in zzso The fourth zzso of zzso b zzso and zzso zzso zzso are group I zzso that do not self zzso in zzso even though they can fold into the same zzso secondary structures that are characteristic of the zzso zzso They require an zzso zzso protein and a zzso protein (a zzso zzso for zzso in zzso We have divided these zzso into several sequence or structural elements and zzso them individually for their ability to support zzso zzso This was done by replacing the equivalent elements from the zzso zzso from zzso zzso with the zzso zzso These zzso zzso show that peripheral sequences and the elements that define the zzso sites are adequate for zzso activity but that the central portions containing the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso these zzso are the likely targets of the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso activity of the zzso zzso is remarkably resistant to the structural zzso that we have zzso this suggests that this technique will be of general utility for studying the structural and functional relationships of elements contained within different zzso
