A highly active zzso c zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso 2 zzso was isolated and zzso to apparent zzso zzso The zzso zzso reductive conversion of zzso and zzso to zzso without release of any zzso as well as reduction of zzso to zzso zzso also possesses zzso zzso In solution zzso exists as a stable zzso with molecular mass of about zzso Each zzso zzso with molecular mass of zzso zzso as defined from spectral properties and sequence analysis, eight zzso zzso Seven of them are coordinated by the characteristic zzso motifs for zzso c zzso while one is bonded by the unique zzso zzso So far, this motif zzso the zzso zzso was found only in bacterial zzso c zzso zzso zzso All the zzso essential for zzso in the known zzso were also identified in zzso However, zzso is only zzso related to known bacterial zzso zzso zzso sharing no more than zzso zzso
