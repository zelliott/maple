zzso among individuals of the same species may be linked to zzso zzso into different zzso in different zzso Here we add to recent reports indicating that individual zzso occurs due to the integration of zzso zzso zzso into the host zzso via zzso zzso followed by zzso We report that in bees zzso zzso approximately zzso of all tested populations carry a segment of a zzso in their zzso and have thus become zzso zzso segments of host sequences have been found within zzso sequences of a zzso Similarly, host sequences were found fused to zzso zzso previously described integrated into their host zzso A potential, continuous zzso exchange leading to divergence is zzso
