The gene coding for the zzso zzso II of the zzso zzso zzso zzso system, zzso has been isolated by molecular cloning and expressed in zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso gene and the deduced zzso acid sequence are zzso The putative translation product comprises a zzso protein of 577 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso has a high degree of sequence similarity with the corresponding zzso zzso II of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence surrounding zzso zzso was strongly zzso in the three zzso The identity of the zzso product as the zzso zzso was demonstrated by in zzso zzso zzso zzso using the protein expressed in zzso zzso Single replacement of each of the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso pointed to zzso zzso as an zzso acid zzso essential for the zzso group transfer zzso
