The classic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso basic protein zzso has been shown to bind zzso zzso strongly and specifically in zzso Here, we have used zzso spin zzso zzso and electron zzso resonance zzso zzso to map more precisely the sites of interaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso On the basis of these and previous experimental data, and the predictions of zzso motifs using the zzso Target Database zzso three main segments of zzso were suggested for the zzso The first site is located at the zzso the second one lies in the central portion of the protein and forms an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the third is quite close to the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been shown to bind zzso in zzso and an interaction site was predicted in the zzso zzso portion of the zzso From these four zzso we selected zzso fragments of zzso zzso in zzso chosen on the bases of their zzso and zzso zzso We zzso each of these peptides as zzso and performed zzso simulations to investigate their interactions with the zzso zzso zzso Different yet almost equally zzso zzso modes were found for each of zzso The experimental zzso and theoretical zzso results were in good agreement, and supported the conjecture that there are several plausible zzso sites in zzso that could be induced into an zzso zzso by their interaction with zzso and account for strong zzso of zzso zzso in all three zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso and simulated for known sites of zzso zzso zzso The results obtained confirmed the appropriate zzso of simple zzso zzso to mimic the natural zzso and demonstrated molecular mechanisms by which zzso interactions could be modulated in zzso
