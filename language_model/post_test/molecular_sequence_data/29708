zzso growth factor zzso is the original member of the zzso family of zzso which contains a zzso zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso signals zzso in zzso regions other than the zzso zzso In addition to a zzso zzso in a zzso region, an zzso sequence is also found in the zzso zzso In cells expressing green zzso protein zzso green zzso was observed in the nucleus, whereas it was detected in the zzso of cells expressing zzso with both zzso zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso was distributed mainly in the nucleus, although some was present in the zzso whereas zzso with a deleted zzso region zzso was found only in the zzso zzso supplied zzso was zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso was zzso whereas zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA synthesis and cellular zzso although zzso with both zzso deleted did zzso zzso of zzso caused a significant stimulation of DNA zzso whereas that of zzso protein did zzso zzso containing the zzso sequence of zzso instead of the zzso zzso did not stimulate DNA zzso and truncated forms without the zzso or zzso side of zzso did zzso These findings suggest that the zzso region, at least the zzso zzso sequence and the zzso and zzso neighboring portions, is essential for the zzso activity of zzso after nuclear zzso
