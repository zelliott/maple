zzso zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso result in familial zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso inherited disorder zzso to zzso zzso Typical zzso is characterized by hundreds to thousands of zzso zzso zzso and by several zzso zzso An attenuated form of zzso zzso is characterized by less than 100 zzso and later onset of the zzso 

Here, we analyzed the zzso gene for zzso zzso in 59 Czech and 15 Slovak zzso zzso In addition, 50 apparently zzso zzso negative Czech zzso and 3 zzso of Slovak origin were screened for large deletions encompassing the zzso zzso zzso screening was performed using zzso zzso gel zzso and/or protein zzso zzso DNA fragments showing an zzso zzso zzso pattern were zzso zzso for large deletions was performed by multiplex zzso dependent probe zzso The extent of deletions was analyzed using following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

In the set of Czech and Slovak patients, we identified 46 zzso zzso among 74 unrelated zzso Total zzso capture is zzso including large zzso Thirty seven zzso were detected in 49 patients presenting a classical zzso zzso zzso and 9 zzso in 25 patients with attenuated zzso zzso We report 20 novel zzso zzso zzso and 3 large deletions zzso encompassing the zzso deletions and/or zzso 14 zzso In the patients with novel zzso correlations of the zzso zzso are discussed in context of the classical and/or attenuated zzso of the zzso 

The results of the molecular genetic testing are used both in the establishment of the zzso diagnosis and in the clinical management of zzso In some cases this study has also shown the difficulty to zzso clinically between the classical and the attenuated form of zzso according to the established zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso was also confirmed in some cases which did not fit well with predicted zzso zzso All these findings have to be taken into consideration both in the genetic zzso and in the patient zzso
