zzso zzso zzso are important for gene regulation and the maintenance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was used as a model system to investigate the functional divergence within this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has three zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in these genes have previously been shown to display zzso different zzso when zzso for zzso zzso loss, and zzso Here, zzso differences in the zzso binding pocket identify zzso and zzso as class I zzso while zzso belongs in the class II zzso Furthermore, these zzso were shown to have zzso different zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso while most of zzso resided throughout the zzso Finally, zzso was localized exclusively on the zzso in a spotted zzso Interestingly, zzso the only zzso present in the zzso was required for zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso presumably acts directly on zzso since it zzso with the zzso zzso region, and zzso as zzso by in zzso zzso In addition, zzso could be zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso Western analysis of bulk zzso preparations indicated that zzso zzso I) had a generally low level of activity in zzso and zzso zzso I) had a high level of activity and broad in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso displayed its main activity on zzso zzso 14 of zzso zzso Thus, the distinct functions of the zzso zzso zzso are likely explained by their distinct cellular zzso and their different in zzso zzso
