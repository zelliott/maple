The zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind with high affinity and modest sequence specificity to DNA containing an zzso zzso This similarity of the in zzso DNA binding specificity is in sharp contrast to the high zzso specificity displayed by these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induce cells to differentiate along a zzso pathway, while zzso promotes the differentiation of zzso precursor zzso We show here that zzso can be converted into a protein capable of inducing zzso in zzso by replacing zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and introducing an additional turn into its basic recognition zzso These changes do not significantly alter the DNA binding properties of the proteins in cell free zzso zzso data for the DNA complexes of zzso and zzso suggest that zzso zzso points away from the DNA into the zzso We zzso that the identity of the zzso acid in position 130 is important for zzso interactions that might affect the DNA binding zzso displayed by zzso in zzso and form the molecular basis of the different zzso properties of the zzso and zzso zzso
