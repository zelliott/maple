zzso alpha 4 beta 1 is a zzso for vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The alpha 4 beta zzso interaction is involved in the zzso of diseases and is, therefore, a therapeutic zzso Here, we identified critical zzso of alpha 4 for zzso binding using zzso zzso of the previously localized putative zzso binding sites zzso zzso Among 43 zzso tested, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited cell zzso to both zzso and zzso This zzso was not due to any gross structural changes of alpha 4 beta zzso These critical zzso are clustered in a predicted zzso structure zzso zzso of the third zzso repeat in alpha zzso The repeat does not contain zzso zzso binding zzso zzso the zzso within the corresponding region of alpha 5 significantly reduced zzso 5 beta 1 zzso These findings suggest that the predicted zzso structure could be zzso involved in zzso binding of zzso domain zzso
