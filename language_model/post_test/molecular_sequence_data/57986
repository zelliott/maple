A point zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso protein of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso has been shown to decrease the sensitivity of the virus to the zzso effect of human zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso 64, zzso Here zzso peptides with the parental and zzso sequences were zzso the parental zzso bound zzso of zzso from zzso infected persons more frequently and with higher affinity than the zzso zzso However, according to circular zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso the peptides have indistinguishable backbone zzso under a variety of experimental zzso These techniques showed for both peptides that no ordered zzso was present in water zzso However, for both peptides in zzso solutions approximately zzso zzso could be zzso The three-dimensional structures of these peptides provide a basis for understanding how this zzso in the zzso protein may affect the interaction with both the outer envelope zzso and with zzso
