A zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso was obtained by zzso with a synthetic zzso which mimics the structure of the zzso site of zzso This zzso zzso to the zzso sequence zzso and was chemically modified by the addition of two zzso units at zzso The specificity of zzso was zzso by direct and competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso and several synthetic peptides differing either by the structure of the added zzso chain or by their zzso acid zzso Further characterization was carried out by zzso detection after one- or two-dimensional sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso appears to be formed by at least two zzso a basic motif of zzso which is retained in the zzso forms independent of their degree of zzso and some elements of the zzso chain close to the site of zzso Given the specificity of zzso and the zzso of its zzso our results indicate that, in addition to alpha and zzso zzso zzso other zzso zzso are also zzso This zzso has been used to analyze the cell and tissue zzso of zzso zzso In mouse brain zzso zzso zzso strongly with zzso and, to a lesser extent, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The same zzso is also observed with cultured zzso whereas zzso cells exhibit only low levels of zzso zzso In zzso mouse zzso such as zzso lung or zzso zzso was shown to involve only zzso but at far lower levels than in zzso
