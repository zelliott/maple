zzso chain reaction zzso and restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis were used to detect and differentiate four zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and ten zzso species of avian zzso A sequence of zzso base pairs within the gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from avian zzso was successfully amplified by zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso common to all avian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with unique restriction sites, selected by zzso analysis of known sequences of the amplified segment of avian mycoplasma, were then used to digest the zzso zzso After zzso of the resulting zzso fragments, the zzso patterns were zzso zzso of up to six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced unique zzso patterns by which the 14 species of avian zzso could be zzso The newly classified avian species zzso zzso was also investigated by this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gave identical zzso patterns with the zzso used in this zzso The results obtained by the zzso and zzso analysis were in agreement with current methods for species identification of avian zzso
