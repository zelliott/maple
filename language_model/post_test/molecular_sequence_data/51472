zzso of zzso in the regulation of cardiac activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied zzso as well as zzso A zzso zzso zzso showed strong zzso effects on the heart with a lower threshold than zzso The action of zzso was in contrast to that of another zzso zzso which has previously been shown to enhance the heart zzso zzso blocked the effects of zzso and stimulation of right cardiac nerves 1 and 3 zzso but not those of zzso suggesting that the effects of nerve stimulation are mainly due to the release of zzso zzso examinations demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso zzso are distributed in the visceral zzso Although a zzso appeared to show weak zzso to both zzso evidence for the coexistence of peptides in a single zzso was not zzso Positive zzso to zzso and zzso zzso also appeared in right cardiac nerves 1 and zzso In the heart, zzso and zzso zzso fibers were restricted to the atrium and the zzso end of the zzso consistent with the zzso observation of zzso The present results suggest that zzso and zzso peptides are involved in regulating the heart zzso
