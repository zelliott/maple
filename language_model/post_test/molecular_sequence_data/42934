The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso localized zzso DNA sequence analysis indicates that this gene encodes a zzso protein of about zzso zzso containing a zzso signal zzso zzso is zzso to a partially zzso open reading frame adjacent to the zzso gene of the zzso zzso a zzso known to zzso an zzso similar to that of zzso A partially zzso zzso gene directly upstream of zzso is zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso We have partially zzso the zzso zzso by zzso shock and zzso exchange zzso and used this zzso preparation to sequence the zzso zzso zzso The first 13 zzso acids of the mature protein match zzso acids 23 to 35 of the predicted zzso indicating that the protein is zzso processed to a molecular mass of approximately 17 zzso probably during export to the zzso zzso The zzso was able to attack many sites along an end zzso duplex DNA zzso but showed clearly preferred zzso sites, and may cleave zzso at zzso zzso
