zzso is one of the most zzso zzso of zzso whose zzso is well supported by zzso and molecular zzso We present the first description of the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso b gene and the partial sequence of the control region of the 14 species of zzso We used these data in zzso analyses to investigate their evolutionary zzso Extremely low levels of sequence divergence indicated a recent ancestry of these species, suggesting a very rapid radiation within the last million zzso The molecular data revealed two main zzso within zzso each with species of different affinities that invaded new zzso from the zzso center of zzso The rapid zzso in this lineage was zzso in the poor resolution of some zzso in the zzso Internal zzso and zzso in zzso may have played an important role in the sudden acquisition of zzso barriers during its zzso The zzso DNA data suggest that prolific zzso in zzso may have been associated with rapid lineage sorting punctuated by zzso zzso isolation subsequent to zzso events and, perhaps, by zzso zzso isolation associated with internal zzso
