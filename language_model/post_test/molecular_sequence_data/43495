The regulation of the zzso II zzso system from zzso zzso was studied in zzso and in zzso zzso In zzso fusion experiments, zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to repress its own synthesis but stimulate expression of the zzso restriction zzso zzso The zzso 72 zzso acids of zzso zzso II, predicted to form a zzso zzso zzso was found to be responsible for the specific zzso and regulatory function of zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso motifs are predicted in the zzso of a number of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I, of which the ability to regulate zzso has been zzso In zzso the binding of zzso zzso II to its target DNA was investigated using a mobility shift zzso zzso zzso II forms a specific and stable complex with a 140 zzso DNA zzso containing the promoter region of zzso II zzso zzso The zzso constant zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso zzso II protects a zzso zzso region immediately upstream of the zzso zzso II coding sequence which includes the predicted zzso promoter sequence of zzso zzso II and the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso
