DNA extracted from the skeletons of five zzso discovered in a Pompeii stable and of a horse found in zzso was zzso zzso acid zzso level was consistent with the presence of zzso zzso base modifications were excluded by sequencing a 146 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a 370 zzso zzso of zzso zzso control region allowed the construction of a zzso tree that, along with sequencing of nuclear genes zzso zzso gamma zzso and zzso fragments, gave us the possibility to address some questions puzzling zzso What zzso horses, or zzso they? And, given they had been evidently assigned to one specific job, were they all akin or were they animals with different zzso zzso The conclusions provided by molecular analysis show that the Pompeii remains are those of horses and zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso seems to belong to a zzso which is either not yet documented in the zzso or has since zzso As its characteristics closely recall those of zzso which is the out group chosen to construct the tree, that appears to have evolved within the zzso family much earlier than horses, this assumption seems to be zzso the zzso
