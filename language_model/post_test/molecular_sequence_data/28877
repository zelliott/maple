zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso CBS zzso zzso DNA by using zzso designed against zzso zzso zzso of zzso eliminated zzso activity, but zzso activity was still zzso Southern analysis of zzso zzso zzso DNA with zzso as a probe confirmed the disruption and did not reveal additional related zzso zzso of zzso stopped ethanol production from zzso but the resulting zzso still assimilated zzso slowly and formed zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso is critical for ethanol production from zzso but that zzso zzso has another zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso using its zzso zzso promoter increased zzso zzso zzso consumption zzso and enabled the zzso to produce ethanol from a mixture of zzso and zzso whereas the parental strain only accumulated zzso In zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso was zzso higher with a zzso than with a zzso zzso zzso but ethanol production decreased with increased copy zzso These results confirmed the function of zzso in zzso zzso
