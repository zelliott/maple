zzso zzso is the most common cause of sporadic and epidemic zzso zzso This study aimed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of zzso acute zzso in Singapore by zzso circulating zzso zzso and zzso II, zzso 4 zzso zzso between September 2004 and February zzso The zzso dominance and zzso variation within the circulating epidemic zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in order to compare the trends in Singapore to those observed globally during the same zzso A total of 312 of 1,060 zzso specimens were positive for zzso zzso using a quantitative zzso In a subset zzso of zzso of zzso positive samples, the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso was amplified and zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso was the most commonly identified zzso representing zzso zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso The zzso zzso zzso in circulation during the zzso epidemic periods were Hunter 2004 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and New Orleans 2009 zzso zzso acid variation within the zzso domain of the major zzso zzso zzso was followed zzso within the zzso zzso A constant turnover of zzso zzso acid change was observed, particularly within the zzso zzso A, C and zzso In conclusion, this study has characterized the zzso strains in circulation in Singapore between 2004 and zzso The molecular epidemiology and persistence of zzso pandemic zzso lineages in Singapore was similar to trends seen globally, with a noted absence of the Asia 2003 zzso
