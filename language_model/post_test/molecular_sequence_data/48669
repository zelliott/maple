The importance of plant secondary zzso for both mankind and the plant itself has long been zzso However, despite extensive research on plant secondary zzso plant secondary metabolism and its regulation still remained poorly zzso In this present study, zzso zzso length zzso zzso transcript profiling was applied to generate the expression profiles of zzso minus in response to salicylic acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This study reveals two different sets of genes induced by zzso and zzso respectively where stress-related genes were proved to lead to the expression of genes involved in plant secondary zzso zzso zzso A total of 98 zzso fragments zzso were zzso including 46 from zzso and 52 from zzso zzso The zzso transcripts generated using 64 different zzso primer combinations showed that treatments with zzso and zzso induced genes mostly involved in scavenging zzso oxygen species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso Of these stress-related zzso 15 % of other zzso zzso are involved mainly in secondary zzso processes where among these, two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso
