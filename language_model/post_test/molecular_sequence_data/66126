The previously determined crystal structure of the bacterial zzso zzso module in complex with human serum zzso zzso suggested the possibility of utilizing the complex in the study of zzso binding to zzso As a continuation of these studies, the crystal structure of the zzso complex with the drug zzso zzso and the fatty acid zzso bound to zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso zzso In terms of drug zzso the structure suggests that the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso may play a role in making the zzso site in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso available for the binding of zzso In addition, structure comparisons with solved structures of zzso and of the zzso complex show that the zzso module is capable of binding to different zzso of zzso The zzso complex therefore emerges as a possible platform for the zzso study of specific zzso interactions and of the influence exerted by the presence of fatty zzso
