It has been suggested that zzso positive selection operates to maintain the zzso zzso on the third variable zzso loop of the zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso Here we present evidence, on the basis of sequencing 147 independently cloned zzso zzso segments from a single family zzso mother, and their zzso that the intensity of positive selection is related to the zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso acid comparison of zzso zzso and gag zzso regions indicated that a single zzso zzso E source had infected the zzso The analyses of unique zzso zzso clones revealed that two zzso lineage groups had evolved in the zzso Group 1 was maintained with low variation in all three family members regardless of the clinical state or the length of infection, whereas group 2 was only present in symptomatic individuals and was more positively charged and diverse than group zzso Only virus zzso carrying the group 2 zzso sequences infected and induced zzso in zzso cells, a transformed zzso zzso A statistically significant excess of zzso zzso versus synonymous zzso was demonstrated only for the group 2 zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso possessing the more homogeneous group 1 zzso element and exhibiting the zzso zzso persist in infected individuals independent of clinical status and appear to be more resistant to positive selection zzso
