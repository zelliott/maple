The X-ray structure analysis of a crystal of pig pancreatic zzso soaked with a zzso zzso zzso showed a pattern of electron density corresponding to the binding of a zzso unit at zzso zzso of the active zzso zzso of the product to zzso zzso after zzso of the zzso zzso may explain the low zzso efficiency of the zzso of zzso by zzso Except a small movement of the segment from zzso zzso the typical zzso changes of the zzso zzso zzso that constitutes the surface edge of the zzso binding zzso were not observed in the present complex zzso This result supports the hypothesis that significant movement of the loop may depend on zzso site being filled zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses have shown that pancreatic zzso undergo an induced zzso change of the zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso in the present complex the zzso zzso is observed in its zzso zzso The results suggest that the induced zzso is likely due to the presence of a sugar unit at zzso zzso and not linked to the closure of the flexible surface zzso The crystal structure was refined at zzso A resolution to an R factor of zzso zzso factor of zzso
