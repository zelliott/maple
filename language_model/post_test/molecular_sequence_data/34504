The zzso occurrence of molecular hydrogen zzso and organic acids along the zzso canal of the earthworm is indicative of ongoing zzso during gut zzso zzso zzso production is zzso by zzso and group 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, functional groups that might respond differently to contrasting zzso zzso Thus, the objectives of this study were to assess the zzso zzso of the zzso canal of zzso zzso and analyze the zzso transcript zzso of zzso producers in zzso gut content zzso Although zzso zzso in the core of the zzso canal were variable on an individual zzso basis, average zzso zzso were zzso The lowest zzso zzso occurred in the zzso and zzso regions, averaging 40 and 110 zzso zzso zzso plots between zzso zzso acid sequences and zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that closely related zzso belonged to closely related zzso whereas zzso related zzso did not necessarily belong to zzso related zzso Of 178 zzso gene zzso 177 clustered in 12 zzso operational zzso units, the majority of which were indicative of zzso unknown zzso Of 86 group 4 zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso were affiliated with organisms in the zzso and zzso zzso The collective results zzso suggest that zzso must cope with variable and moderately zzso zzso conditions along the zzso canal, zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are present in the earthworm gut, and zzso corroborate previous findings implicating zzso and zzso as active zzso zzso in earthworm gut zzso
