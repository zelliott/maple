In patients with zzso infection, severe lung involvement requiring admission to intensive care units zzso has been zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso binding site zzso have been associated with increased zzso and disease severity, representing a potential marker of critical zzso 

To assess the contribution of zzso zzso in critically ill patients, zzso virus from adult patients with severe infection admitted to zzso for zzso membrane zzso support zzso during influenza season zzso in zzso zzso million zzso northwestern Italy, was zzso 

We zzso analyzed zzso zzso in zzso patients and compared with those from randomly selected zzso with mild zzso disease and zzso with influenza from the local surveillance zzso 

By zzso direct sequencing of respiratory zzso zzso and zzso viral zzso were identified in a higher proportion in zzso patients zzso zzso than in patients with mild disease zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso exact test zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso Eleven zzso patients died zzso three of them carrying the zzso zzso which was associated with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified in upper and lower respiratory zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in a significantly higher proportion by patients with acute respiratory distress for zzso severe infection requiring zzso admission and zzso These data emphasize the importance of monitoring viral evolution for understanding zzso adaptation aimed at the surveillance of strain circulation and the study of viral zzso of disease zzso
