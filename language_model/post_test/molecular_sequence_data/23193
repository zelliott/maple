zzso zzso was determined by zzso in 226 Caucasian zzso patients and 197 racially matched controls from two geographical areas, zzso UK and zzso zzso zzso 144 zzso 105 controls, zzso 82 zzso 92 zzso 

When the two series were zzso zzso there were no significant differences in the zzso distribution comparing patients and controls zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso However, when the data for the two series were pooled and zzso we found an increase in the zzso zzso in zzso patients vs controls zzso vs zzso zzso zzso but there was no evidence that this zzso zzso is associated with less severe zzso 

Although this zzso genetic association study is large compared with others performed in zzso taken zzso each geographically based cohort of patients and controls is zzso to detect a small effect of this functional zzso This zzso the need for far larger zzso collections to address which zzso markers or zzso might modify the zzso and clinical course of zzso We propose that zzso collaboration on an international scale in zzso complex liver diseases such as zzso is supported by the International Association for the Study of the Liver and promoted via their journal with development of a brief format for zzso publication of zzso
