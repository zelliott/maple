Two zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso Y zzso and its zzso mimic were designed in an attempt to improve the binding affinity by increasing the zzso of binding relative to the original zzso mimic of the zzso The design was based on the X-ray crystal structures of a zzso zzso zzso in complex with its zzso zzso a zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso Y zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso molecules consist of a zzso zzso linked through an zzso or zzso linkage to a zzso zzso in which the W unit has been zzso We predicted that omission of the zzso zzso would zzso the bound water molecules that provided zzso with the zzso site, and the zzso restriction resulting from imposition of an zzso at the zzso of the zzso The zzso were then zzso into the active site of zzso using the program zzso zzso and the structures were zzso The best models obtained in each case showed that the zzso zzso with either an zzso or zzso linkage, might be reasonable surrogate zzso for the zzso We report here the synthesis of the zzso employing solution and zzso zzso zzso characterization indicated that the zzso zzso did not inhibit binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Y zzso
