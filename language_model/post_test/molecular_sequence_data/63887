zzso is a zinc finger protein specific to zzso zzso and germ zzso In zzso zzso behaves as a stem cell marker and is thought to be a zzso factor that maintains zzso capacity and prevents terminal zzso The human gene is located on zzso zzso We have discovered in the chicken the existence of zzso 2, a zzso zzso We also report the entire sequence of mouse and human zzso 2; the corresponding genes are located on mouse zzso 4 and human zzso zzso Although the zzso acid sequence of zzso 2 differs extensively from that of zzso 1, the two proteins share essential zzso Both contain three paired zinc fingers, a nuclear zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso 2 zzso has a wider tissue distribution than the zzso 1 zzso it is particularly abundant in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The extreme conservation of the zzso 2 zzso acid sequence across zzso suggests that zzso 2 serves an important function, presumably as a regulatory protein of DNA zzso
