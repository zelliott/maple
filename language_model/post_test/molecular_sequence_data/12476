The zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso 1 zzso 1) binds to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with an affinity zzso approximately zzso zzso and specificity comparable to those of the native zzso zzso 1 and its zzso domain also bind zzso zzso the polar head group of zzso with comparable affinity and approximately zzso zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso of the zzso 1 zzso domain contains several basic zzso predicted to bind zzso but binds zzso and with little specificity for zzso hence the zzso structure of the isolated zzso domain is required for high affinity zzso zzso Our zzso binding results support the hypothesis that the intact zzso domain, serving as a specific zzso directs zzso 1 to zzso enriched in zzso and permits the active site, located elsewhere in the zzso to zzso multiple zzso molecules before this zzso zzso from the membrane zzso
