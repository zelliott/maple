A test system for growth regulators based on the time course of liver zzso in male zzso mice injected zzso zzso with 50 zzso zzso at 12 is zzso zzso DNA synthesis zzso zzso peaked at 36 h after zzso injury, and the zzso zzso rate zzso at 42 zzso zzso 6 h zzso This response pattern was used to assess the effects of factors in liver extracts that regulate or zzso zzso zzso The effect of one, two, four or eight zzso injections of an zzso mouse liver extract on MR was tested at 48 zzso A zzso zzso was seen only after single injections at 12 zzso 29 h or 44 h after zzso zzso A zzso stimulation was observed after a single injection of the liver extract at 0, 5 or 24 zzso and after two or four zzso The zzso system could thus detect the presence of growth zzso in the zzso The experiments also showed that the timing was zzso We recently isolated and characterized a growth zzso zzso from mouse liver zzso Using a synthetic zzso with the same structure we zzso the timing for growth zzso seen with the liver zzso The following test system for growth zzso seemed most zzso inhibitor administration at 29 h to affect zzso transition, measured as reduced DNA synthesis at 36 zzso or inhibitor administration at 44 h to affect zzso transition, measured as reduced MR at 48 zzso
