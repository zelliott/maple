A new alpha chain zzso alpha zzso was detected because of zzso zzso during the determination of the zzso zzso by automated zzso exchange high performance liquid zzso The abnormal zzso overlapped the zzso edge of the band of zzso A in zzso It was slightly unstable in the zzso test and had a slightly increased oxygen zzso The abnormal alpha chain zzso slightly faster than the normal alpha chain in reversed phase high performance liquid zzso The zzso acid substitution was determined by zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of an zzso alpha zzso The abnormal alpha chain comprised about zzso of the total alpha zzso A zzso study did not suggest selective loss of the abnormal chain in zzso
