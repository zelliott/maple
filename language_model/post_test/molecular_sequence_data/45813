House flies were collected from four zzso in Maine, New York, North Carolina, and Florida, where high levels of resistance to zzso have been zzso zzso of two zzso zzso and zzso having zzso that zzso resistance to zzso (and other zzso were zzso from individuals at each collection zzso The combinations of resistance zzso for zzso and zzso were highly variable between each zzso The resistance zzso zzso was found at a high frequency zzso at all zzso zzso zzso susceptible for zzso were very rare and detected only at the dairy in zzso In addition to the typical zzso zzso responsible for resistance, zzso zzso we also identified individuals with a zzso zzso Although house flies zzso for the zzso zzso had a lower level of resistance to zzso compared to zzso the zzso resistance zzso was frequently zzso No individuals with the zzso zzso zzso + zzso were detected from the field zzso The zzso 3 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso was found to be extremely zzso providing an opportunity to reconstruct a zzso of zzso zzso Based on this analysis it appears the zzso zzso had multiple evolutionary origins, but that the zzso zzso may have had a single zzso The impacts of these findings on resistance management are zzso
