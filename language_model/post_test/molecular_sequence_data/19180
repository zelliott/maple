The zzso family of zzso repeat zzso zzso proteins bears structural similarity to the zzso and the zzso zzso families, which exert well-established roles in directing nervous system zzso zzso are less well zzso although they are highly expressed in the developing zzso nervous zzso Moreover, zzso zzso are associated with several sensory and zzso disorders, including zzso deafness, obsessive-compulsive disorder zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies in mice show that zzso zzso zzso outgrowth and zzso zzso formation, although the molecular mechanisms of zzso function remain poorly zzso 

As a prelude to examining the functional roles of zzso we identified eight zzso zzso in zzso and observed that seven of the eight zzso were actively transcribed in the nervous system at zzso zzso and adult zzso Similar to previous findings in mice and humans, zzso zzso exhibited unique but overlapping spatial and zzso expression patterns in the developing brain, zzso and spinal zzso 

zzso express zzso in the developing central nervous system at times and locations important to zzso zzso and zzso Future studies will use zzso as a convenient, cost-effective model zzso to characterize the functional roles of zzso in nervous system zzso
