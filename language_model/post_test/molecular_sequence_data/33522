Among the heat shock proteins zzso of higher plants, those belonging to the small zzso zzso family remain the least characterized in functional zzso To improve our understanding of zzso we have characterized zzso from Rosa zzso zzso alignments and zzso analysis reveal this to be a zzso class I zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso was induced by heat, cold, salt, drought, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to study its possible function under stress zzso The zzso zzso coli and zzso cells that accumulated zzso showed improved viability under zzso salt and zzso stress conditions compared with control zzso We also produced transgenic zzso zzso that zzso expressed zzso These plants exhibited increased tolerance to heat, salt, zzso and drought zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso has the ability to zzso stress resistance not only to zzso coli and zzso but also to plants grown under a wide variety of zzso environmental zzso
