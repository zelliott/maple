During zzso zzso in zzso coli the zzso B and C proteins interact specifically with the Holliday junction formed by the action of zzso to promote the zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein of molecular weight 88 zzso has been zzso in zzso coli, zzso and zzso with a synthetic Holliday junction zzso made from four zzso zzso zzso were grown using the zzso zzso method with sodium zzso as the zzso The zzso zzso to a resolution of 6 A and belong to the zzso system, space group zzso with cell parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso 106 A and beta zzso 123 zzso The X-ray analysis of these zzso should reveal the structure of the Holliday junction and its mode of binding to zzso providing new insights into the molecular mechanism of genetic zzso
