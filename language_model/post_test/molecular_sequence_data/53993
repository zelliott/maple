zzso of G protein signaling zzso proteins are responsible for the rapid zzso of G zzso zzso signaling zzso The major mechanism zzso zzso proteins zzso regulate G proteins is via the zzso zzso protein activity of their zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses have characterized the zzso alpha interaction in detail, explaining the molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso protein activity of zzso zzso More than 20 zzso proteins have been isolated, and there are indications that specific zzso proteins regulate specific G zzso zzso zzso This specificity is probably created by a combination of cell zzso zzso tissue distribution, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso other than the zzso domain that link them to other signaling zzso In this review we discuss what has been learned so far about the role of zzso proteins in regulating G zzso zzso signaling and point out areas that may be fruitful for future zzso
