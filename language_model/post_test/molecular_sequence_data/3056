The zzso zzso located on human zzso (at the zzso zzso encodes a zzso factor containing a zzso tract and a zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a severe zzso form of speech and language zzso segregating within a single large pedigree, and is also disrupted by a zzso in an isolated zzso Several studies of zzso disorder have demonstrated linkage to a similar region of zzso (the zzso zzso leading to the proposal that a single genetic factor on zzso contributes to both zzso and language zzso In the present study, we directly evaluate the impact of the zzso gene with regard to both complex language zzso and zzso through use of association and zzso screening zzso We conclude that zzso zzso in zzso do not zzso the zzso linkage and that the gene is unlikely to play a role in zzso or more common forms of language zzso
