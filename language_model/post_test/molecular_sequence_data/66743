A novel software tool named zzso has been applied to zzso zzso acquired within the Human zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso Project zzso zzso enables automatic identification of zzso zzso zzso that were not explained in typical sequence database zzso The main focus was detection of zzso but zzso detects also unspecific zzso zzso mass measurement zzso experimental zzso zzso acid zzso zzso products and unknown mass zzso To avoid a zzso problem the search is restricted to a set of selected protein zzso which stem from previous protein identifications using a common sequence database zzso Prior to application to the zzso zzso data, zzso was evaluated on zzso manually characterized and evaluated zzso data sets from zzso gel spots obtained from mouse eye zzso Besides various zzso including zzso a wealth of experimental modifications and unspecific zzso products were successfully zzso completing the primary structure information of the measured zzso Our results indicate that a large amount of zzso zzso that currently remain unidentified in standard database searches contain valuable information that can only be zzso using suitable software zzso
