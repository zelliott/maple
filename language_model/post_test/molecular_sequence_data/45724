Potential B zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso were theoretically calculated in order to reveal peptides that can induce the formation of specific zzso to this zzso Four peptides structurally corresponding to four zzso regions containing zzso zzso and three of their truncated zzso were zzso zzso were zzso with both free peptides and protein zzso of their truncated zzso and a panel of zzso to various exposed regions of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso was zzso All of the four predicted peptides were shown to induce the production of zzso zzso in free form, without zzso with any protein zzso The free peptides and the protein zzso of truncated zzso induced the formation of almost equal levels of zzso Most of the obtained zzso contained zzso that bind to the zzso zzso zzso domain of the rat zzso zzso and do not react with the analogous domain of the zzso of the ray zzso zzso zzso
