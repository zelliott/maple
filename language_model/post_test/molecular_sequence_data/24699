The AT zzso factor 1 zzso is a large zzso factor containing four zzso and 23 zinc finger zzso It has a number of motifs involved in zzso regulation, and in addition, several motifs found in zzso such as zzso and zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso activity is associated with the zzso zzso A zzso acid segment of the zzso zzso termed zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso IV and zinc finger 21, was expressed in zzso coli in the form of zzso zzso fusion protein and analyzed for zzso zzso We found that zzso was able to zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 5 zzso zzso and pH zzso zzso retained bacterial DNA and removal of the DNA resulted in zzso decrease in zzso zzso The addition of double- or zzso zzso restored zzso zzso activity and that of zzso restored zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso resulted in zzso reduction of zzso activity with no significant loss of bound zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso IV and zinc finger 21 resulted in 90 and zzso reduction of zzso respectively, with the loss of the ability to bind to DNA and zzso These results show that zzso has at least one zzso activity in addition to regulation of DNA zzso The zzso activity associated with zzso is zzso and unique in that it requires both zzso and zinc finger zzso
