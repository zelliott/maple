zzso are a family of proteins characterized by a zzso zzso zzso structure with a zzso zzso They perform a wide range of biological functions and this functional zzso must relate to the zzso partner zzso zzso D zzso and its insect zzso zzso zzso and neural zzso zzso share common ancestral functions like zzso stress resistance and zzso metabolism regulation, zzso with very specialized functions, like courtship zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we screened the binding of 15 potential zzso partners for zzso zzso and zzso and uncovered several novel zzso with apparent zzso zzso in the low zzso zzso zzso acid zzso retinol, fatty acids and zzso are shared zzso zzso however, showed a zzso binding zzso cholesterol did not show strong binding to human zzso whereas zzso and zzso did bind zzso Among the zzso zzso we found that zzso selectively binds the zzso zzso but not zzso and that zzso binds the zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso To test the functional relevance of zzso zzso binding at the cellular level, we analyzed the effect of zzso zzso and zzso preloaded with zzso on zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is necessary and sufficient to allow for zzso zzso zzso Both human zzso and zzso zzso successfully deliver zzso to immature zzso driving zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso bind selectively to a different but overlapping set of zzso zzso This zzso can explain their varied zzso zzso
