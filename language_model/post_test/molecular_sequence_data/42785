To determine viral characteristics and the protective effect of virus zzso zzso in zzso transmission of zzso 

Ten zzso zzso pairs were sampled within 4 months of zzso zzso region 3 of the viral envelope was amplified by zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso directly and/or after zzso by zzso DNA zzso The zzso acid sequence of variable region 3 from all 10 children was zzso whereas the mothers showed varying degrees of zzso Apparently, selection of an zzso zzso occurs either at transmission or during initial virus replication in the infected zzso No characteristic molecular features of the transmitted virus were zzso 

zzso zzso from 13 zzso pairs were characterized for zzso capacity in a variety of cell zzso Eight mothers from whom a virus with a zzso zzso pattern was isolated transmitted the zzso virus to their children, whereas mothers with a zzso virus transmitted either a zzso or a zzso virus zzso cases zzso This indicates that viruses with zzso zzso capacity do not have a selective advantage during zzso 

zzso from 20 mothers were characterized for the ability to neutralize their own virus zzso zzso and virus from other mothers zzso zzso The results showed that zzso mothers had zzso zzso against zzso virus more frequently than zzso zzso In addition, all mothers with zzso zzso zzso also neutralized at least two zzso primary zzso This indicates that a broad zzso zzso response may be linked to a lower risk of zzso zzso 

On the basis of the variable region 3 loop zzso zzso infants zzso zzso virus zzso Despite this, no molecular or biological markers for selective transmission could be zzso A maternal zzso zzso response with broad specificity may protect the child from zzso zzso
