zzso zzso zzso is an Old World zzso with a zzso distribution among four major centers of species zzso A zzso analysis of zzso sequences of the internal transcribed zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso repeat was conducted with 27 species of zzso and 18 related zzso zzso analyses using weighted and zzso zzso support zzso as a zzso zzso with three major zzso The first comprises those zzso endemic to the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso Mediterranean distribution form the second zzso and a zzso between east Africa zzso zzso and the Mediterranean zzso zzso occurs in this zzso The third lineage includes all zzso zzso and zzso zzso a species from the zzso of east zzso A zzso zzso split between east Africa and zzso is present in the third zzso The patterns of relationships in the ITS tree are zzso with known zzso events in northern Africa and southwestern Asia since the middle zzso The ITS trees are zzso with the current zzso zzso except for a few members of sections zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Low levels of support in the zzso branches do not allow resolution of which zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso are sister to zzso Both zzso appear to be highly zzso in the ITS zzso
