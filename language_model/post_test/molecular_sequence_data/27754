zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso were zzso and compared to the previously zzso genes zzso and zzso The genes are between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and each includes one or two short zzso The zzso promoter regions contain sequences similar to the zzso zzso promoter zzso Two zzso zzso sequences were found in the zzso promoter regions of, respectively, the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and the primarily zzso genes zzso and zzso The domain structures of the collagen zzso are zzso each zzso contains two zzso forming zzso zzso one of zzso zzso acids zzso and the other of zzso zzso The latter domain is interrupted by one to three short zzso zzso zzso segments that occur at relatively zzso locations in each zzso zzso of zzso zzso flank the zzso zzso in all of the zzso The genes can be placed into three families based upon zzso acid sequence zzso Genes within a family do not always exhibit similar zzso expression programs, suggesting that structural and regulatory regions of the genes have evolved zzso The zzso usage in the genes is highly zzso with zzso appearing in the third position of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso
