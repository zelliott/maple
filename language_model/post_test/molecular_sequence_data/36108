DNA damage induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso drug, was studied in zzso by monitoring the drug-induced zzso change of zzso zzso DNA, the sensitivity to some restriction zzso of the damaged DNA and the zzso termination of DNA synthesis caused by zzso Closed zzso zzso zzso DNA was treated at 37 degrees C for 16 h with various zzso of zzso zzso zzso change due to unwinding of the treated DNA was detected by zzso gel zzso To analyze the zzso of the zzso damage, the measurement for sensitivity of zzso DNA to various types of restriction zzso and sequence gel analysis of the treated DNA were zzso The results suggested that zzso attacked zzso the sequence of zzso zzso AG zzso zzso in the zzso In the present zzso condition, the zzso zzso ratios required for the DNA damage detection were roughly zzso for the zzso analysis, zzso or more for the restriction zzso analysis, and less than zzso for the sequence gel zzso By using the present method, it was demonstrated that the zzso DNA damage was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso or zzso at their nearly zzso zzso and by reducing agents such as zzso and zzso in the reaction zzso
