zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso was studied using the zzso zzso expression zzso Mouse and cat zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso more slowly than zzso zzso zzso of the mouse gamma zzso into the zzso zzso reduced the rate of zzso making it similar to the mouse zzso Likewise, substitution of the zzso gamma zzso into the mouse zzso zzso increased the rate of zzso making it similar to the zzso zzso Furthermore, mouse zzso zzso in which the gamma zzso was replaced by the zzso zzso zzso more rapidly than either mouse or cat zzso zzso and resembled zzso zzso Thus, in addition to other properties, zzso and zzso zzso differ with respect to zzso suggesting a possible role of zzso in normal development of zzso zzso
