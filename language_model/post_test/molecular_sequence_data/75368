The highly zzso avian zzso zzso virus strain T zzso contains a substitution of the zzso zzso for much of zzso and a deletion of gag and pol relative to the helper virus zzso Replacement of gag and pol sequences in zzso suppresses transformation by reducing the zzso of spliced viral zzso and zzso protein in infected cells zzso zzso Miller and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After infection of zzso cells with viruses containing gag and pol zzso zzso viruses that are strongly transforming were zzso zzso three-fourths of the zzso viruses appeared structurally the same as the parental virus, and approximately zzso of the zzso viruses had large deletions zzso in size and location to the deletion in zzso Two zzso viruses that appeared structurally the same as the parental virus were zzso zzso The regions sufficient to change the parental virus to a strongly transforming virus were determined by construction of zzso zzso In one zzso virus, the region sufficient for transformation contained a zzso zzso zzso of the 3' zzso site used by zzso In the other zzso virus, the region sufficient for transformation contained a zzso transition and a deletion of one copy of a zzso direct zzso both 3' of the 3' zzso site used by zzso These differences resulted in the zzso of increased levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso ultimately leading to zzso
