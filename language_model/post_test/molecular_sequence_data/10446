Several gene products, including three zzso systems, make up a signal zzso network that controls the zzso zzso response in zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso a response regulator, is furthest downstream of the known regulators in the signaling zzso that regulates zzso zzso zzso We report the zzso zzso and use of zzso in investigating its role in zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was a zzso for both the zzso and zzso activities of its zzso sensor zzso zzso It was not zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso of approximately zzso zzso which was reduced to about 15 zzso by addition of the same zzso amount of zzso (the zzso region of zzso zzso significantly increased zzso activity of zzso on zzso In gel zzso and zzso studies, both zzso and zzso were shown to be zzso The zzso domain was located within the 135 zzso acids at the N zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso bound to one of the alkaline zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso bound exclusively to the zzso to zzso region zzso to the zzso start site zzso of the zzso zzso promoter zzso but not to the adjacent zzso regulated promoter zzso These data corroborate the genetic data for zzso regulation and suggest that zzso of zzso is via direct interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso Studies of the zzso zzso and DNA binding activity of the zzso protein demonstrate that its zzso zzso and zzso domain and its zzso DNA binding domain function independently of one another, distinguishing zzso from other response regulators, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso
