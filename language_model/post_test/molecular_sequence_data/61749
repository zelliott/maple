A zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of 70 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso showed high zzso with other zzso zzso and zzso core zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso by heat zzso and affinity zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that the zzso zzso has high affinity to zzso The complex of the zzso and DNA allows DNA to be protected from zzso by the restriction zzso zzso at 65 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso becomes looser when temperatures increase from 25 to 90 degrees zzso The zzso has inherited a remarkable zzso especially in the presence of zzso zzso and retained DNA binding activity at extreme temperature, which is consistent with our previous report about its structure stability analyzed by X-ray zzso
