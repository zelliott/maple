zzso is a zzso that regulates social and zzso behaviors in a variety of animals including zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed by cells in the zzso zzso and zzso areas in the zzso during zzso in zzso suggesting that zzso might mediate other functions within the zzso prior to the development of social and zzso zzso In order to examine potential early roles for zzso we cloned two zzso zzso receptors zzso to zzso The receptors are expressed primarily in the zzso in similar but generally zzso zzso Both receptors are expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Of note, zzso zzso in the zzso appear to be contacted by the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso that include zzso zzso and sensory zzso in the lateral zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso extend zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains zzso of many zzso thought to be involved in locomotor responses to sensory zzso One hypothesis consistent with this anatomy is that zzso signaling mediates or gates sensory input to motor circuits in the zzso and spinal zzso
