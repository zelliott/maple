The connection between zzso animal waste and the dissemination of zzso resistance in soil microbial communities, via mobile genetic zzso remains zzso In this study, electromagnetic induction zzso surveying of a broiler chicken farm assisted soil sampling from a zzso site and a marginally affected zzso zzso with the EMI survey, a disparity existed between the two sites with regard to soil zzso zzso resistance zzso levels among zzso soil bacteria, and the zzso and prevalence of several zzso and zzso genes in the zzso No significant difference was observed in these aspects between the marginally affected site and several sites in a relatively pristine regional zzso When the farm was in operation, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were detected in the zzso zzso Two years after all waste was removed from the farm, zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were still zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were measured using quantitative zzso and the copy numbers of each were zzso to zzso zzso zzso gene copy zzso zzso was the most prevalent zzso whereas zzso was the most persistent, although all declined over the zzso zzso A zzso zzso carrying zzso was identified in seven of 14 zzso soil zzso The zzso hosts were identified as species of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso to estimate its prevalence in the soil, and the ratio of zzso to mob was shown to have changed from zzso to zzso over the zzso sampling zzso
