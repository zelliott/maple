zzso 

zzso zzso is an herb with wide distribution and zzso variation, presenting three known zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is naturally occurring from Mexico to zzso The development of zzso markers for this species is important to provide molecular tools to investigate zzso origin, as well as its relationship with zzso and genetic zzso zzso 

Nine zzso markers were isolated using an enriched zzso library and characterized in a zzso zzso Eight markers generated zzso zzso in 27 plants of a population from southern zzso The number of zzso per locus ranged from two to nine, and the observed and expected zzso varied from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

These zzso DNA markers may be useful for further investigations of the involved zzso process and the population zzso of zzso zzso
