zzso zzso like a number of other large DNA zzso and the zzso produces zzso DNA during DNA zzso The zzso DNA is processed to produce zzso zzso DNA by cutting at specific sites along the zzso DNA cutting is zzso with DNA packaging, the process of zzso of the cut DNA into the zzso zzso zzso the zzso A key player in the zzso DNA packaging process is the zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso recognition of the zzso zzso zzso zzso initiation of packaging, which includes the introduction of staggered nicks at zzso to generate the cohesive ends of zzso DNA and the binding of the zzso zzso DNA packaging, possibly including the zzso DNA zzso and zzso following zzso the cutting of the terminal zzso to complete DNA zzso To one side of zzso is the site zzso which plays a role in the initiation of zzso along with zzso zzso stimulates the efficiency and adds zzso to the zzso activity of zzso in cutting zzso zzso is essential for the formation of a zzso complex with zzso complex I, that binds the zzso forming a zzso zzso complex zzso zzso interacts with zzso through its large zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso Packaging follows complex II zzso zzso is flanked on the other side by the site zzso which is needed for zzso but not zzso of DNA zzso zzso is required for cutting of the second zzso zzso the zzso at which termination zzso DNA packaging in zzso has aspects that differ from other zzso DNA zzso Unlike the zzso zzso system of zzso for DNA packaging the initial zzso protein zzso gives way to a mobile, zzso complex, and unlike the DNA replication system of zzso the same protein machinery is used for both initiation and zzso during zzso DNA zzso
