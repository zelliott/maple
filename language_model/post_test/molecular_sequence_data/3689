The major zzso protein zzso in sea urchins has historically been classified as a zzso based on its abundance in the zzso zzso zzso it is found in both sexes of sea urchins where it is presumed to play a zzso role in zzso zzso or zzso Here we present the primary structure of zzso as predicted from zzso of two sea urchins species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence from these two species share identity to one another, but bear no resemblance to other known zzso Instead the sequence shares identity to members of the zzso zzso of zzso In zzso iron binding zzso including both zzso overlay zzso of zzso enriched zzso fluid and zzso of native zzso zzso from zzso fluid, support this zzso We suggest that one of zzso zzso properties is to shuttle iron to developing germ zzso
