Through zzso zzso analysis and zzso studies, we have identified a novel cellular zzso zzso interaction partner located predominantly in the zzso In public databases, it has been assigned as zzso because of a region of high similarity to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso interaction relied on the region surrounding the zzso nuclear zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso was not zzso zzso zzso proteins induced the zzso of large portions of zzso into the nucleus pointing to functional interactions both in the zzso and the zzso In line with an anticipated functional interference in the zzso zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso driven zzso reporter zzso Our study expands the panel of already identified nuclear zzso interaction partners to a zzso zzso which raises the awareness that important steps in the zzso life cycle may be regulated in this zzso
