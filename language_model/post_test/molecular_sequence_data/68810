zzso movement is a crucial step in plant virus zzso In many zzso the movement function is secured by specific zzso zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons of these proteins revealed a vast zzso containing a zzso sequence motif that may comprise a zzso interaction zzso This zzso combines proteins of viruses belonging to all principal groups of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso DNA containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso that have zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso In several groups of zzso zzso zzso the movement function is provided by the proteins zzso by the so-called triple gene block including two putative small zzso proteins and a putative zzso zzso A distinct type of movement proteins with very high content of zzso is found in zzso It is concluded that zzso of movement proteins based on comparison of their zzso acid sequences does not correlate with the type of zzso zzso acid or with grouping of viruses based on zzso analysis of zzso proteins or with the virus host zzso zzso between unrelated or zzso related viruses could have played a major role in the evolution of the movement zzso Limited sequence similarities were observed between zzso movement proteins of zzso and the zzso family of cellular integral membrane zzso and zzso between movement proteins of zzso and zzso and zzso protein of influenza viruses which is involved in nuclear export of viral zzso It is hypothesized that all movement proteins of plant viruses may mediate zzso interactions between viral and cellular zzso
