zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso during cardiac zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated that prenatal cocaine exposure caused a decrease in zzso expression and increased heart zzso to zzso injury in adult zzso suggesting an in zzso programming of zzso gene expression pattern in the zzso The present investigation aimed to zzso whether an zzso zzso DNA zzso accounts for zzso repression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso rats were administered either saline or cocaine zzso (15 zzso twice daily from days 15 to 20 of zzso age, and term fetal hearts were zzso zzso treatment significantly decreased zzso zzso and protein levels in the zzso zzso zzso found in zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso binding sites at the zzso promoter region of the zzso gene were densely zzso and were not affected by zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in the zzso protein 1 zzso binding sites was low but was significantly increased by zzso zzso gene zzso showed that the zzso binding site played a strong zzso role of zzso gene zzso zzso of the zzso binding sites significantly decreased zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso analyses implicated zzso zzso binding to the zzso binding zzso zzso did not affect nuclear zzso levels or the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso binding zzso The results indicate a role for DNA zzso in zzso zzso gene repression in the developing heart and suggest an zzso mechanism affecting this gene linked with vulnerability of zzso injury in the heart of adult zzso
