zzso acid zzso and nuclear zzso acid receptors zzso have been implicated in a variety of human zzso including lung cancer, and zzso has been proposed as a zzso agent for zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells show dramatic induction of zzso zzso and significant growth zzso after zzso zzso In contrast, 17 of 22 small cell lung cancer zzso and 9 of 15 zzso lines treated with 1 zzso zzso showed no significant growth zzso Of interest, 5 zzso lines with high levels of zzso gene family expression related to zzso zzso or zzso gene amplification exhibited growth zzso zzso whereas 2 zzso lines actually showed growth stimulation after treatment with 1 zzso zzso The lines varied greatly in their zzso expression of zzso zzso and 15 of 20 zzso and 8 of 15 zzso lines failed to show zzso zzso induction after zzso zzso Six cell lines showed possible zzso in the coding region of zzso by complementary DNA zzso chain reaction zzso analysis using zzso common to the zzso zzso since other regions would undergo zzso amplification whereas the DNA binding domain would zzso Nonetheless, no abnormal band shift patterns in zzso amplified by zzso were found by single strand zzso zzso analysis covering all zzso base pairs of the zzso open reading zzso Finally, no abnormalities in zzso gene structure or expression were identified by Southern and Northern zzso analysis, including lines with zzso abnormalities of zzso We conclude that abnormalities of the zzso system are common in human lung cancer cell zzso
