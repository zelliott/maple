zzso protein zzso zzso is required for diverse cellular functions, and similar zzso exist in zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso and also zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is yet to be established in zzso We here report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which controls zzso transition and response to stress, is the putative zzso zzso has a zzso binding domain zzso and associates with zzso proteins as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated are defective in the tolerance to limited zzso and this tolerance requires the zzso stretch present between the zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso defective in type 1 zzso and zzso also suppresses the zzso zzso and is required for the tolerance to limited zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds to type 2A protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus seem to antagonize in utilizing limited zzso We also show that zzso and zzso are the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which bind to common zzso and zzso zzso
