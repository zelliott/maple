We describe the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso a putative medium chain zzso of a zzso protein zzso or assembly protein zzso complex in zzso zzso The zzso clone is predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The predicted translation product zzso shares at least zzso identity and zzso similarity with the medium chain zzso of plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso complexes from rat and zzso zzso The deduced zzso sequence also demonstrates significant but lesser zzso to a number of medium chain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso demonstrates significantly greater zzso to plasma zzso zzso zzso complex medium chains than to their zzso counterparts, we suggest that zzso may be a medium chain zzso of an zzso complex involved in zzso function at the plasma zzso of zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that zzso gene defines a single copy gene in the zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso at different times during growth and development demonstrated that the zzso gene is expressed at relatively constant levels throughout the life cycle of the zzso zzso is the first reported full-length zzso zzso a zzso of an zzso complex in zzso zzso and thus provides the first evidence for the existence of zzso complexes in this zzso
