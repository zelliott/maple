In one zzso of zzso zzso cells, zzso the levels of delta zzso receptors markedly increase in response to nerve growth factor zzso This increase, as assessed by zzso zzso is found only under specific culture zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells also results in the induction of delta zzso zzso zzso zzso The time course for zzso induction of zzso and protein is similar, although the levels of zzso increase approximately zzso whereas the levels of zzso increase only zzso Competition studies with selective delta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso salt, zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso confirm that the delta zzso of zzso zzso is present on zzso zzso The delta zzso zzso is coupled zzso as indicated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Finally, the delta zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso The sequence was identical with that described previously for the rat zzso The zzso cell line thus provides a model system in which to study regulation of delta zzso zzso
