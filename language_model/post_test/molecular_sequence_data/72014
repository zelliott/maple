The zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso They form zzso channels that are expressed in the central nervous system and in sensory zzso where they are thought to play an important role in pain accompanying tissue zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso is not active on its own but zzso the properties of zzso In particular, whereas most members of the zzso zzso zzso family are highly selective for zzso over zzso zzso zzso show a zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso allowed identification of a zzso acid region preceding the first zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso that is involved in zzso zzso and is critical for zzso zzso Three zzso acids in this region zzso zzso and zzso appear to be particularly important, because channels zzso at these zzso discriminate poorly between zzso and zzso In addition, the pH zzso of the activity of the zzso and zzso zzso are changed as compared with that of zzso zzso A corresponding zzso zzso zzso also has modified zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso region of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
