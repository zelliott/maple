The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso in zzso solution was determined by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance at 600 zzso and distance geometry calculations with the program zzso The input for the structure calculations was prepared on the basis of complete zzso resonance assignments at pH zzso and 22 degrees C and consisted of 425 distance constraints from nuclear zzso enhancements and 159 supplementary constraints from zzso zzso zzso and from the identification of zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a molecular core with two zzso zzso and several zzso zzso The three zzso bonds zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso In contrast to this zzso molecular core, with an average root mean square distance for the zzso backbone of zzso A for a group of nine zzso solutions, no preferred zzso was found for the zzso segment zzso and a loop consisting of zzso zzso is not uniquely constrained by the zzso data zzso These structural properties of zzso zzso coincide closely with the previously described solution zzso of natural zzso but the presence of localized differences is indicated by chemical shift differences for zzso zzso 5, zzso 9, zzso 15, zzso 53, zzso 54, and zzso zzso
