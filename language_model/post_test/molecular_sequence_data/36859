Changes were observed in zzso forms in cells from acute zzso zzso zzso Total zzso activity was not significantly different for normal zzso and zzso cells, but zzso profiles obtained by zzso are quite zzso In zzso profile, two main zzso are present (B and more zzso zzso which were zzso at pH zzso with a shoulder at pH zzso In zzso the B form is present but zzso zzso whereas the more zzso forms are the major zzso This pattern may be related either to the zzso character or to the stage at which the differentiation is zzso zzso on an zzso cell line zzso cells corresponding to the zzso 3 zzso showed that differentiation induced by zzso zzso leads to the appearance of the B form present in normal mature zzso Thus the zzso of the zzso forms seems to be related to the stage of differentiation of the zzso zzso
