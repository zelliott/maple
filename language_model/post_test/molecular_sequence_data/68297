zzso is a small zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein previously known only from studies on animals and lower zzso but recently identified as a birch zzso zzso Here we have identified and characterized three members of the zzso zzso family from the plant zzso zzso Two zzso isolated from a zzso zzso library zzso 1 and zzso 3) each have a single, large open reading frame zzso a putative zzso 131 zzso acids long with a predicted molecular weight of approximately 14 zzso A third zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) has two zzso translation initiation zzso Use of the first zzso would result in a zzso 137 zzso acids long with a molecular weight of zzso zzso The three zzso zzso are highly zzso to each other zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequence zzso as well as other plant zzso but show far less similarity zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to animal and lower zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignments indicate that only nine zzso are shared by all zzso zzso zzso However, limited comparisons reveal zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso that have a high degree of similarity suggesting functional zzso The zzso gene family size is estimated to contain three to six members based on Southern zzso experiments with zzso and coding region zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrates that the three zzso zzso zzso characterized here are zzso in a zzso manner and are zzso or zzso zzso
