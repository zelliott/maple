qualitative and quantitative changes in human zzso DNA zzso have been implicated in various cancer zzso A zzso zzso deletion in the major arch of the zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso associated with a variety of human diseases and zzso 

we conducted a comprehensive study on clinical features and zzso of 104 zzso cancer patients in the zzso area of zzso In particular, using a quantitative real time zzso method, we analyzed the zzso zzso deletion and zzso content in tumor zzso and paired zzso areas from these zzso 

we found that the zzso zzso deletion was more likely to be present in patients of younger age zzso years, p zzso zzso In patients with the zzso zzso zzso the deletion level decreased as the cancer stage advanced zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso copy number in tumor zzso of patients with this deletion increased, both compared with that in adjacent zzso zzso and with in tumors of patients without the zzso Such zzso content increase correlated with the levels of the zzso zzso deletion and with cancer stage zzso zzso zzso 

our study indicates that the zzso zzso zzso deletion may play a role in the early stage of zzso cancer, and it is also implicated in zzso of zzso content in cancer zzso
