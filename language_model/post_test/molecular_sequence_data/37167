zzso zzso virus zzso produces more than thirty zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso that accumulate to various zzso during replication in zzso and zzso Among the most unusual species are two abundant populations of small zzso zzso of approximately 800 zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with all 10 3' genes deleted produce only the larger zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso do not have corresponding negative strands and were hypothesized to be produced by premature termination during zzso zzso zzso zzso We characterized a zzso element that controls the production of the zzso zzso Since manipulation of this zzso element in its native position (the zzso region of zzso was not possible because the zzso zzso affect zzso a region zzso surrounding the putative termination sites zzso approximately 550 to zzso was duplicated in the 3' end of a zzso zzso to allow zzso The duplicated sequence continued to produce a zzso zzso zzso here much larger ( approximately 11 zzso apparently by zzso Surprisingly, a new zzso zzso was observed from the duplicated zzso A large zzso zzso resulting from the putative promoter activity of the native zzso was not observed, possibly because of the zzso of a promoter approximately 19 zzso from the 3' zzso However, we were able to observe a zzso produced from the native zzso of a small defective zzso which placed the native zzso closer to the 3' zzso demonstrating zzso promoter activity of the native zzso zzso zzso mapped the promoter and the zzso activities of the zzso (in the 3' position in the zzso zzso to a zzso region, which was folded by the zzso computer program into two zzso zzso in the putative zzso structures equally reduced or prevented production of both the zzso and zzso zzso These zzso when introduced in frame in the native zzso similarly abolished the synthesis of the zzso zzso and presumably the large zzso zzso while having no impact on zzso demonstrating that neither zzso nor zzso zzso is necessary for replication of the zzso or full-length zzso in zzso zzso between the zzso which produced two zzso zzso and the zzso elements controlling the 3' open reading zzso which produced additional zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso suggest that the different zzso controller elements had different origins in the modular evolution of zzso
