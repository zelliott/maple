A bacterial strain designated zzso was isolated from a freshwater river in Taiwan and characterized using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso by means of a single polar zzso Growth occurred at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and with zzso % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and its most closely related zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity of zzso zzso The major fatty acids were summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : 0 zzso zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of a mixture of zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso and an zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso zzso was less than 70 zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
