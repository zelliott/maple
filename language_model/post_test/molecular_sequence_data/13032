It is unclear whether the six known human zzso peptides are all zzso by separate genes or whether some of them are zzso Three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso differ by only one zzso acid, and it is thought that zzso may represent a zzso product of zzso and/or zzso To help determine the relationship of these three zzso we isolated a nearly full-length zzso zzso zzso with a sequence very similar to, but different from, the previously isolated zzso and zzso zzso Gene copy number experiments established that there were at least two but fewer than five zzso genes with a high level of similarity to the zzso zzso zzso Three zzso clones were isolated that contained two different zzso of the zzso zzso zzso established that one zzso the zzso zzso whereas the other zzso zzso Analysis of zzso obtained from 18 unrelated individuals by Southern zzso analysis revealed the expected fragments as well as additional fragments that were not present in the zzso zzso This suggested the possibility of zzso however, when zzso from families were zzso these fragments did not segregate in an obvious zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes are on human zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso cell hybrid mapping showed that the number of zzso genes on isolated copies of zzso 8 was zzso We conclude that individuals can inherit versions of zzso 8 harboring either two or three copies of the genes that zzso the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso
