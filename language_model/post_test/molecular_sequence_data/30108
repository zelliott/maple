Large variations in zzso zzso exist among zzso in a DNA sequence following treatment with zzso zzso agents such as nitrogen zzso and the zzso attached to the zzso group can impose a distinct sequence preference for zzso In order to understand further the structural and zzso factors which determine the sequence selectivity of zzso zzso the effect of increased zzso strength, the zzso zzso zzso zzso minor groove zzso zzso A and zzso and the zzso zzso on zzso zzso by zzso mustard zzso zzso mustard zzso and zzso mustard zzso was investigated with a modification of the zzso chemical zzso technique for DNA zzso For zzso and zzso increased zzso strength and the zzso DNA affinity zzso dose zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso was less inhibited by salt zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (10 zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso gave an enhancement of overall zzso zzso More interestingly, the pattern of zzso zzso was zzso altered by zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso The result differed with both the nitrogen mustard zzso less than zzso less than zzso and the zzso agent zzso The effect, which resulted in both enhancement and suppression of zzso sites, was most striking in the case of zzso and zzso A, which differed from each zzso DNA zzso indicated that selective binding to AT sequences in the minor groove of DNA can have long-range effects on the zzso pattern of DNA in the major zzso
