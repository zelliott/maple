Rapid emergence of zzso resistance in zzso tuberculosis has necessitated the development of newer candidate drugs which can selectively inhibit the growth of the zzso Among the best targets available today, zzso machinery is, by far, the most important one and the zzso zzso binds to a specific site on the zzso zzso zzso However, it is not very effective towards the stationary phase of the zzso or the zzso In order to address this problem, we report here a protocol for generating an affinity zzso zzso zzso which can be zzso easily from different zzso of growth of the zzso It allows exploring zzso associated zzso which may zzso resistance to zzso using the approach of functional zzso
