A full-length zzso zzso house dust zzso zzso zzso f 7 from zzso zzso zzso zzso from China was zzso zzso and successfully zzso A reference sequence zzso zzso zzso was used to design zzso chain reaction zzso Analysis revealed eight mismatched zzso in five zzso f 7 zzso zzso and the projected zzso acid sequence contained six incompatible zzso These results suggest that the sequence of zzso f 7 may be zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that the mature zzso f 7 zzso had a molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso zzso f 7 protein secondary structure was composed of a zzso zzso extended strand zzso and random zzso zzso Group 7 zzso are present in zzso zzso and zzso families, and zzso analysis revealed a zzso similarity between zzso f 7 and zzso p zzso Furthermore, a zzso tree constructed of group 7 zzso from different zzso species revealed that zzso f 7 and zzso p 7 clustered with zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso f 7 zzso as conducted in this study may contribute to diagnostic and therapeutic applications for dust zzso zzso
