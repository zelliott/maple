The zzso alpha zzso zzso which zzso synthesis of terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso apes and zzso We cloned and zzso a zzso that contains the coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso was expressed on the surface of a human cell line zzso with an expression zzso containing this zzso and this zzso zzso expression subsided by zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso base pairs in length and encodes 371 zzso zzso The zzso sequence and its deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso gene are zzso and zzso respectively, similar to the reported sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso monkey zzso zzso while they are zzso and zzso respectively, similar to those of the orangutan and human zzso zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, similar to the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso genes and zzso of zzso are highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso changes among the zzso zzso as well as the zzso genes are still higher than the ratios of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso genes tend to be zzso
