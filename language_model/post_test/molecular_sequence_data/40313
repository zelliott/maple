The bacterial zzso zzso has a widespread distribution and is one of the most common and diverse zzso in soil zzso However, members of this zzso have often been recalcitrant to zzso methods, zzso the study of this presumably important bacterial zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso approach to recover zzso information from zzso members of this zzso A soil zzso zzso library was screened by zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the recovery of 17 positive zzso zzso zzso appeared to originate from a range of zzso zzso with dominance of subdivision 6 (10 zzso Upon full-length insert sequencing, gene zzso identified a total of 350 open reading frames zzso representing a broad range of zzso zzso six zzso from subdivision 6 contained a region of gene zzso containing genes involved in zzso de zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso hypothetical zzso Similar zzso regions had previously been observed in several environmental clones recovered from soil and marine zzso zzso comparisons with respect to gene organization and zzso Comparative analyses revealed a general zzso between marine and zzso genes in both zzso and zzso zzso Although the significance of this zzso gene cluster across subdivision 6 members is not known, it appears to be a common feature within a large percentage of all zzso zzso fragments recovered from both of these zzso
