We have identified a novel human gene with strong zzso to the mouse zzso cell cycle zzso This novel gene (called zzso belongs to a gene family with members in several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A composite zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The sequence of this zzso predicts a protein of zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of this human protein shows very strong zzso to the mouse protein zzso The zzso analyzed probably zzso to a functional copy found at zzso
