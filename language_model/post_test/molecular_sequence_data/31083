We have used block substitution zzso and in zzso zzso to define sequence elements important for efficient initiation and 3' zzso of the zzso leader zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These experiments indicate that the zzso zzso has an unusual promoter structure containing elements which include the 22 zzso zzso leader zzso zzso zzso zzso is correlated with the binding of a factor to the 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso which abolish zzso lead to a loss in binding of this zzso In addition to internal zzso synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso requires an element centered 50 bases upstream of the cap zzso zzso within this element dramatically affect the level of zzso zzso synthesis but do not affect accuracy of zzso Finally, all of the information required for accurate 3' zzso of zzso zzso lies within the transcribed zzso Thus, the arrangement of sequences necessary for the synthesis of zzso zzso does not resemble that of sequences important for the synthesis of zzso U zzso despite the similarities between zzso zzso and U zzso
