The human zzso growth factor zzso zzso genes play important roles in normal zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso gene have been associated with many zzso syndromes and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso identified to date are concentrated in the previously characterized region of zzso that codes for the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso The search for zzso in other regions of the zzso however, has been hindered by lack of knowledge of the zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso library zzso long-range zzso and zzso walking, we have characterized the zzso structure of nearly the entire human zzso zzso including a zzso of the organization and size of all zzso and zzso and determination of the DNA sequences at the zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the human zzso gene family reveals that the zzso organization of the zzso is relatively zzso Moreover, alignment of the zzso acid sequences shows that the four corresponding proteins share zzso identity overall, with up to zzso identity between individual pairs of zzso zzso However, the zzso gene contains an additional zzso not found in other members of the family, and it also has much larger zzso sequences throughout the zzso zzso similarities in zzso organization, zzso zzso and zzso sizes are found between the human and mouse zzso zzso zzso gained from this study of the human zzso gene structure may prove useful in future screening studies designed to find additional zzso associated with zzso zzso and in understanding the molecular and cell biology of this zzso zzso
