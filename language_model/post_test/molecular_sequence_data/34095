In zzso zzso zzso zzso two activities of zzso zzso zzso with zzso effect against zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso This work intends to zzso the growth phase of maximum zzso activity, the zzso and the effectiveness of the activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso were grown in MRS medium and collected at different growth zzso and the proteins were zzso The highest zzso activity was found during the zzso growth phase in the protein fraction bound to the cell zzso From this zzso two distinct proteins bands zzso and zzso in zzso were partially zzso with a three-step zzso Both bands showed zzso activity against zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis zzso indicated that the zzso band corresponded to a protein of unknown zzso The zzso band corresponded to a zzso that zzso zzso sites with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both proteins are reported in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The fraction containing the concentrated proteins (110 and 99 zzso inhibited the growth of several zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The growth of zzso zzso was diminished by 3 zzso units as early as zzso h of growth, while zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso was observed after 18 and 8 zzso respectively (both in one zzso zzso The minimum zzso concentration against zzso zzso was 10 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso at least two zzso zzso one of them recognized as zzso for the first time, which exert zzso activity against several bacterial zzso 

Both zzso activities have a broad growth zzso spectrum and could be used to control zzso zzso Because this activity comes from a zzso acid zzso it could be safely used in manufacturing processes of fermented zzso
