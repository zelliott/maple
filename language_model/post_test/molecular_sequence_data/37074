The zzso of persons with strong allergic responses to the bites of the zzso zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso with two major zzso zzso proteins with molecular weights of 35 and 28 zzso These zzso were zzso their zzso zzso zzso and the sequences were used to search for similar sequences in public zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso were identified as containing predicted zzso acid sequences identical to the 35 and 28 zzso zzso zzso These proteins are expressed specifically in adult female zzso zzso and, their predicted zzso structures are consistent with a role as carriers of zzso molecules in zzso zzso
