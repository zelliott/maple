Seven different zzso genes have been isolated from a zzso zzso library with zzso based on zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of these genes showed high similarity in the zzso domain but outside this region virtually no similarities were zzso The set of zzso genes was used to identify zzso expressed genes following the transfer of zzso zzso to zzso This differential screen resulted in the selection of the zzso gene which is induced by light within one hour of exposure of zzso or zzso zzso
