Rice zzso analysis showed that a number of stress-related genes are induced by external addition of zzso acid zzso The gene designated as zzso which is zzso to class capital zzso zzso zzso was found to exhibit the highest induction among these zzso However, its crucial zzso within the zzso active site are zzso with other zzso suggesting that the protein has no zzso zzso The zzso protein which is zzso by the zzso gene produced in zzso coli has zzso inhibitor activity, indicating that the gene encodes a novel rice zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso The expression of zzso was enhanced not only by zzso zzso treatment but also by various stresses such as zzso and sodium zzso treatments, and zzso however, it was not influenced by increasing zzso zzso zzso External zzso treatment caused a significant increase in zzso leakage from rice zzso These results suggested that zzso was induced by stress which is caused by external zzso zzso Rice zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed differential zzso zzso Also, these genes were zzso induced by stress and stress-related zzso The transcripts of zzso and zzso were zzso under normal conditions, and were drastically induced by wounding and zzso zzso zzso treatment in the zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the shoot but not induced by wounding and stress-related zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso were suggested to be specialized in their function and involved in defense mechanisms in zzso
