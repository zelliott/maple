Despite their wide zzso zzso and zzso are considered neglected diseases by the World Health zzso The epidemiology of these diseases and zzso in humans in developing countries is poorly zzso The high concentration of pathogens in raw sewage makes the characterization of the transmission of these pathogens simple through the zzso and zzso analysis of a small number of zzso 

The distribution of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso samples of combined sewer systems from Shanghai, Nanjing and zzso and the sewer system in zzso in China was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso to assess the contribution of domestic animals to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso The high occurrence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso made the source attribution zzso As expected, several zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso D, were the dominant zzso in zzso In addition to humans, the common presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso indicated that zzso might have contributed to the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso D in zzso Likewise, the finding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from birds indicated that zzso zzso might be of both human and bird zzso 

The distribution of zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in urban wastewater indicates that zzso transmission appeared to be important in epidemiology of zzso zzso and zzso in the study zzso The finding of different zzso of zzso between Shanghai and zzso was indicative of possible differences in the source of zzso zzso among different areas in zzso
