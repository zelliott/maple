It has been shown that a significant correlation is seen when the zzso scores of zzso acids zzso by the coding strand of zzso DNA are plotted against those of the zzso zzso Thus, peptides zzso by complementary DNA strands might form zzso structures and bind one zzso We have used this approach to study the interaction between zzso zzso and its cell zzso Taking into consideration the zzso sequence from published rat zzso clones that zzso to the cell binding site zzso in the zzso zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence found for the putative zzso binding site was zzso This zzso was chemically zzso and coupled to an zzso zzso zzso bound appreciably to this column and was zzso much more efficiently by a solution of zzso zzso than by a solution of related but inactive zzso zzso zzso of labeled zzso to zzso zzso human zzso cells was inhibited by the zzso The zzso zzso predicted similarly from the zzso sequence of human zzso was equally efficient in such zzso zzso produced against zzso recognized with equal efficiency zzso in an zzso zzso Furthermore, they were able to recognize a single zzso band in zzso extracts from Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso to their zzso Identification of the recognized protein was provided by showing that this zzso was also able to bind to zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso
