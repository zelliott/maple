zzso a zzso zzso hormone, plays an important role in zzso zzso and in diabetes zzso Several zzso zzso and zzso have been developed, but limited structural information is available to clarify the basis of their biological zzso The solution structure of the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and 37 degrees C in zzso zzso zzso The overall backbone zzso zzso zzso for the structured portion zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso A for the 15 zzso structures, after restrained molecular dynamics zzso The structure consists of four regions zzso backbone zzso in zzso an zzso zzso segment between zzso 2 and 5 zzso an irregular zzso between zzso 7 and 14 zzso a hinge region between zzso 15 and 18 zzso and a zzso zzso between zzso 19 and 29 zzso The two zzso form an L-shaped structure with an angle of about 90 degrees between the zzso zzso There is an extended zzso zzso which runs along the inner surface of the zzso and incorporates the side chains of the zzso zzso of each of the zzso zzso The outer surface contains the zzso side zzso with two salt bridges zzso and zzso implied from close approach of the charged zzso This result is the first clear indication of an overall zzso fold for a zzso analogue in the zzso zzso The relationship of the two zzso structural elements may have important implications for the biological activity of the zzso zzso
