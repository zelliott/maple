zzso is a major component of the zzso network of zzso and zzso that forms the zzso on the zzso face of the plasma membrane and the trans zzso network during the zzso of coated zzso zzso zzso is a three-legged structure zzso zzso three identical heavy chains and three different light chains located toward the center of the zzso on the zzso segment of the zzso All zzso light chains contain a central domain of 10 zzso repeats, which is necessary for the interaction with heavy zzso Because the repeats are characteristic of alpha zzso coiled zzso we proposed that the central domain had an extended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Harrison, zzso zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso However, an alternative model has recently been proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stock, zzso zzso zzso zzso and Brodsky, zzso zzso (1992) Cell 68, zzso Here, we use zzso electron zzso of zzso decorated with zzso zzso directed against different zzso on light chains to show that the light chain central domain has an extended zzso and reaches along most of the zzso segment of the heavy chain zzso
