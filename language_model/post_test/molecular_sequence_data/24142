To establish a system to study differentiation therapy drugs, we used the zzso human prostate zzso tumor cell line as a target and zzso acid zzso zzso or zzso which are zzso of zzso zzso as zzso These zzso evoked replication arrest, caused an increase in cell size, and triggered zzso of the zzso By Northern and Western zzso and zzso we demonstrated zzso expression of 12 proteins reported to reside in zzso zzso released by zzso zzso prostate zzso Additional zzso proteins were identified by two-dimensional gel zzso Among these was zzso 17, a prostate cell differentiation zzso By Northern zzso we also demonstrated the zzso expression of zzso 8 and 18 and induced expression of zzso 19, three other prostate cell differentiation zzso In addition, we established that cells were committed to differentiate after the 2nd day of zzso treatment using zzso which can abrogate the effects of zzso Based on the expression patterns of zzso proteins and zzso and the presence of tentative zzso zzso we zzso that zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso cells to mature into cells with a zzso that resembles normal prostate zzso cells, but at their intermediate state of zzso
