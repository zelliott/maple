We and others previously reported that zzso T zzso zzso zzso regulates the severity of zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso in mouse strains that are inherently susceptible to the zzso In this report, we show that zzso engagement also controls disease zzso in zzso mice, a strain considered to be resistant to zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso mice with zzso spinal zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to result in zzso zzso with either zzso preparation in conjunction with zzso resulted in both clinical and zzso zzso zzso blockade also resulted in a preferential increase in the frequency of zzso T cells zzso zzso We conclude that zzso controls zzso in zzso mice by limiting the expansion of zzso T cells present in the zzso suggesting a mechanism zzso zzso contributes to the maintenance of peripheral T cell tolerance to self zzso
