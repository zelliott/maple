Leaf rust is the most common disease in wheat zzso There are more than 45 specific resistance genes described and used in wheat breeding to control zzso of leaf zzso but none of them has been zzso The leaf rust disease resistance gene 1 ( zzso is a good model gene for isolation by zzso cloning because it is a single, dominant gene which is located in the zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso As the first step towards the isolation of this gene we constructed a high-resolution genetic map in the region of the zzso locus by zzso mapping of two large segregating zzso populations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The resistance gene zzso was zzso in a zzso region between the zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from zzso A zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened using the zzso markers zzso and zzso Five positive zzso clones were identified by zzso and four clones by zzso Two zzso type of resistance gene zzso which zzso proteins highly zzso to the bacterial blight disease resistance protein zzso of rice, were identified on zzso clones isolated with zzso zzso zzso end zzso were isolated from both ends of a zzso large zzso clone identified by zzso The end zzso were mapped at the same locus as zzso and no zzso event was found within 105 zzso around zzso in our analysis of more than 4,000 zzso
