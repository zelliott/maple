zzso zzso is a 166 zzso acids protein containing three zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso and 1 zzso zzso site zzso and involved in the regulation of the level of red blood zzso Today, only one zzso human zzso zzso produced in zzso cell line, is extensively used in therapy to cure severe zzso The structure of the zzso chains of this zzso slightly differ of those of the urinary human zzso zzso considered as the natural zzso zzso In an attempt to produce a zzso as close as possible to the zzso zzso gene was expressed in a human zzso cell line, named zzso zzso In order to fully characterize the zzso structural zzso of the protein skeleton as well as zzso chains were zzso As expected, the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso to that of zzso Surprisingly, the structure of some zzso zzso as mainly determined by zzso revealed some unusual zzso Thus, zzso of zzso possess a zzso zzso zzso zzso bear a second zzso zzso which is present, in a large part, in a zzso zzso and zzso contain more than three zzso repeats (up to five per zzso Despite these unusual structural zzso the data concerning the in zzso and in zzso biological activities were not impaired when compared to zzso and zzso
