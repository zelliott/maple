zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso I zzso exert their activity through two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recently, zzso and zzso have been discovered as potential zzso zzso selective for zzso known to be involved in brain functions such as learning and anxiety, as well as in cardiovascular zzso A zzso relationship study using zzso peptides was designed to characterize mouse zzso zzso and zzso further and to investigate the structural basis of their zzso zzso zzso In the framework of this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso was identified as zzso zzso for the rat zzso binding zzso Such affinity had previously not been observed for the human version of this zzso On the basis of secondary structure predictions, it was hypothesized that the zzso acid motifs zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso decrease zzso and thereby impair binding to zzso In support of this hypothesis, binding affinity to zzso of the zzso peptides zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso was found to be decreased by three orders of zzso whereas binding affinity to zzso was much less zzso The dramatic decrease in binding affinity to zzso correlated with a decrease in zzso as indicated by the data of circular zzso zzso
