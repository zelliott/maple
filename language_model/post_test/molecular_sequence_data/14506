Here, we report the zzso detection of protein zzso zzso zzso activity in a zzso cell zzso using a zzso complex zzso composed of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso modified with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a near infrared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso 1 formed the zzso with zzso through zzso zzso the zzso zzso was zzso effectively via zzso resonance energy transfer zzso between zzso and zzso However, this zzso zzso was recovered when the zzso peptides in zzso 1 were zzso with zzso due to the zzso of the zzso When zzso was added to the zzso zzso a significant increase in zzso intensity was observed, whereas its zzso increase was inhibited with a zzso inhibitor in a zzso zzso Furthermore, our zzso was robust enough to measure zzso activity in a zzso cellular zzso without zzso The zzso zzso offers a simple, zzso sensitive, and robust approach to detect zzso activity in crude cellular zzso that would be suitable for drug screening formats and cancer diagnosis using crude cellular zzso
