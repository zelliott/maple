A novel zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from zzso sludge from a municipal solid waste zzso zzso were straight zzso zzso zzso in diameter and 2-3 zzso in length and grew as single cells or in zzso zzso formed round terminal zzso The temperature range for growth was zzso zzso with an optimum at 65 zzso The pH range for growth was zzso with an optimum at zzso zzso zzso had the ability to zzso various zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso producing mainly zzso and zzso In addition, the isolate was able to grow with CO as the sole carbon and energy zzso CO zzso was coupled to zzso and CO2 zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, this zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso Based on the zzso features and zzso analysis, it is proposed that strain zzso should be classified in the zzso zzso as a representative of a novel species, zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
