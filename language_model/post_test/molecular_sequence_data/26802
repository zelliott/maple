The zzso iron zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso during the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso were determined in complexes with the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the product zzso and the zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The overall structure reveals a zzso core fold with two additional zzso zzso that are common to zzso iron zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso acid zzso zzso which catalyze the formation of zzso zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This unexpected zzso is caused by zzso control of the bound zzso which zzso a zzso zzso for zzso instead of the trans zzso observed for the zzso zzso zzso and other members of the zzso acid zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso specificity of zzso was zzso The side chain of the zzso zzso projects zzso from the active site by undergoing interactions mainly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts broadened zzso specificity by accepting the zzso zzso and zzso for zzso
