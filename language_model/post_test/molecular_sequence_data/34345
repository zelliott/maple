Current human zzso zzso vaccines that are based on zzso particles zzso of the major zzso protein zzso largely elicit zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with the zzso minor zzso protein zzso elicits zzso that are broadly zzso suggesting that a vaccine targeting zzso could provide more comprehensive protection against infection by diverse zzso zzso However, zzso zzso typically elicit much lower zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso We previously showed that a zzso broadly zzso zzso near the zzso of zzso is highly zzso when displayed on the surface of zzso derived from the zzso zzso Here, we report the development of a panel of zzso zzso vaccines targeting zzso that protect mice from infection with zzso and zzso zzso types that zzso the zzso tract and zzso 

zzso peptides from eight different zzso types were displayed on the surface of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso both individually and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso mice were protected from high dose infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were nearly completely protected from both zzso and zzso zzso Mice zzso with the mixture of eight zzso zzso were strongly protected from zzso challenge with zzso representing eight diverse zzso types and zzso challenge with zzso zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective approach for inducing zzso protective zzso zzso and is capable of offering protection from a spectrum of zzso associated with cervical cancer as well as zzso and zzso zzso
