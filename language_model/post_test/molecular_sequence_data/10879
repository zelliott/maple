zzso a specific target of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso possesses features common to zzso zzso including a K zzso zzso zzso To zzso its biological function, we first set out to identify zzso species that bound to zzso with high affinity using in zzso zzso From a zzso zzso pool, 15 zzso sequences were selected that bound to zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso The highest affinity zzso sequences zzso approximately zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso to zzso abolished binding to zzso zzso of the highest affinity zzso zzso was assessed to explore the role of different regions of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso domain alone did not bind zzso but a zzso containing the zzso domain and a region of zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso proteins was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain or zzso of zzso domain zzso analogous to zzso zzso in the human zzso X syndrome gene product and the zzso zzso tumor zzso protein zzso abolished zzso zzso Our results establish that a zzso zzso protein can bind zzso with specificity and high affinity and suggest that specific zzso binding is integral to the functions of some regulatory proteins in growth and zzso
