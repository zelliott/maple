zzso for zzso zzso was conducted by the qualitative zzso chain reaction zzso method in zzso grain and zzso processed foods obtained in the Tokyo zzso The numbers of samples possibly positive in the screening test were 7 of 22 zzso for zzso grain samples, 4 of 14 zzso for zzso foods, 11 of 30 zzso for canned products, 3 of 30 zzso for zzso zzso 3 of 4 zzso for zzso and 1 of 3 zzso for zzso However, zzso zzso was not detected in the confirmation zzso zzso the results of the screening test were zzso Since the reaction might have been caused by the base sequences of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso used in the screening test, a new primer pair was zzso The zzso products obtained with the new primer pair zzso were specific for zzso and were not obtained with zzso zzso rice, zzso zzso or zzso Thus, the new primer pair shows high zzso zzso zzso was detected from samples containing at least zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA by using this primer zzso
