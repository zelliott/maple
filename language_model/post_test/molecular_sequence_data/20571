zzso zzso has developed resistance to multiple classes of zzso There is now growing concern that without the availability of appropriate public health strategies to combat this problem, gonorrhea could become zzso For this reason, surveillance for zzso zzso resistance must be optimal both in terms of obtaining a representative sample of zzso zzso and in terms of having the appropriate tools to identify zzso To aid with this zzso molecular tools are increasingly being zzso In the present study, we investigated the use of a simple heat zzso protocol for isolate DNA preparation combined with zzso zzso real-time zzso for the identification of zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 109 clinical zzso zzso were tested by high-resolution melting zzso curve analysis for zzso zzso associated with zzso resistance to zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at positions 120 and 121 in zzso and an zzso deletion in the zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso was also investigated for its ability to detect the zzso deletion in the zzso zzso The results were compared to those obtained by DNA zzso Our zzso zzso provided the accurate discrimination of heat-treated zzso in which the sequence types differed in zzso content, including zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso accurately identified zzso with the zzso deletion in the zzso zzso zzso DNA combined with zzso zzso real-time zzso offers a simple, zzso and inexpensive means of detecting zzso resistance zzso These methods may have broader application in the detection of zzso associated with zzso of zzso
