The dominant immune response to rat zzso basic protein in zzso mice is directed against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso causes zzso on injection into mice of the zzso zzso Only two zzso of the zzso are required for zzso of the zzso from an zzso T cell zzso zzso at position 6 could not be zzso by any other zzso acid, whereas zzso at position 3 could be replaced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso recognition of these zzso appears to be specific, because increasing the affinity of each analogue for its zzso restriction element, by replacing zzso with zzso at position 4, did not alter the pattern of zzso For the majority of zzso at this position, a lack of stimulation could not be explained by failure to bind to zzso However, competition binding studies showed that introduction of zzso at position 3 reduced the efficacy of binding to zzso zzso zzso of zzso were injected into zzso mice to test the extent to which zzso T cell zzso might lead to zzso disease in this zzso An analogue containing zzso at position 3 caused clinical experimental zzso zzso in a small percentage of zzso zzso
