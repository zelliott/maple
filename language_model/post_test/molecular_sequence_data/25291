zzso zzso is associated with qualitative as well as quantitative changes in zzso zzso To analyze the molecular basis of zzso transitions of cardiac zzso in response to pressure overload, we have constructed and characterized two types of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso specifying zzso and zzso and two types of zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso complementary to zzso type zzso and zzso type zzso zzso from a human fetal heart zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso mapping zzso we showed that the zzso zzso transitions from zzso to zzso in the pressure overloaded zzso are produced by changes in the relative level of zzso and zzso gene zzso In addition, we observed that the expression of zzso gene is also induced in the zzso subjected to severe pressure zzso Thus, it appears that the increased expression of zzso zzso together with the zzso switch from zzso to zzso zzso may participate in the adaptation of zzso to new functional zzso Then, to get a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso zzso we have isolated and zzso zzso clone for zzso zzso zzso analysis has identified multiple potential zzso regulatory elements within a zzso upstream zzso This region includes zzso alternating zzso sequences and two segment exhibiting zzso to consensus sequence proposed for viral and cellular zzso zzso In particular, a comparison of the zzso upstream gene sequence with those available for several zzso genes revealed that zzso + zzso elements and zzso sequence are zzso These results suggested that zzso box zzso to zzso has an important role in the positive regulation of the zzso gene and this element may be involved in the zzso of zzso and cardiac zzso zzso
