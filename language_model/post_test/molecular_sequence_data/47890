zzso project their zzso along specific pathways in order to establish appropriate connections with their target zzso The rate and direction of zzso growth is determined by interactions between the highly zzso growth cone and environmental cues that can act in either an attractive or a repulsive zzso zzso is ultimately dependent upon the zzso of the zzso zzso and an established role for the zzso family of small zzso in regulating this process in zzso cells identifies them as candidate zzso molecules in growth zzso An inactive form of zzso has recently been shown to inhibit the zzso zzso response induced by chick zzso a protein that has recently been established as an important guidance zzso The molecular basis for this zzso remains zzso 

We have made a series of overlapping peptides from the zzso region of zzso and rendered them cell permeable by synthesis in tandem with an established zzso zzso We report here that a zzso encompassing zzso zzso acids zzso binds directly to the established zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso Furthermore, the zzso can compete with activated zzso for target zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We also zzso zzso peptides that zzso to the zzso zzso motifs present in zzso and zzso Our results show that a zzso zzso from zzso but not that from zzso zzso zzso collapse and that the zzso activity zzso with binding to zzso and not to zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso collapse is zzso by zzso zzso acids zzso and demonstrate the feasibility of designing new zzso zzso of small zzso
