Few studies have investigated the disease burden and genetic diversity of human zzso zzso in developing zzso 

To assess the burden of zzso in Amman, Jordan, and to zzso clinical differences between zzso zzso 

We zzso studied children zzso years, zzso with respiratory symptoms and/or fever in Amman, zzso zzso were identified by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso gene sequencing was performed on zzso zzso 

Of the zzso enrolled children, zzso zzso tested positive for zzso 240 of which were zzso Of the zzso samples, 62 zzso were of the recently identified group zzso 131 zzso were zzso and seven zzso were zzso The zzso strains clustered into at least 19 distinct zzso Compared with zzso children, children with zzso were more likely to require supplemental oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso and, when zzso were zzso were more likely to have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

There is a significant burden of zzso zzso in young children in zzso zzso with the recently identified group zzso is associated with zzso and more severe zzso
