A zzso zzso zzso marine, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso separation system on a North Sea oil zzso The optimum conditions for growth were 33 degrees C, pH zzso to zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso of at least 1 and zzso zzso Of various organic acids tested, only zzso was used as an electron and carbon zzso The presence of zzso zzso suggests zzso zzso via an operative zzso acid zzso Even though growth of most zzso strains (including strain zzso did not occur on hydrogen, zzso was detected at low zzso The growth yields were zzso zzso and zzso g of zzso zzso cells per zzso of zzso oxidized with zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as electron zzso zzso zzso was able to fix zzso zzso and zzso of the c and b types were zzso The zzso content of the DNA was 47 zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso zzso with a zzso zzso sequence similarity of zzso The zzso zzso between them was zzso On the basis of differences in zzso zzso and zzso zzso we propose that strain zzso is a member of a new species, zzso zzso It can be easily identified and distinguished from other zzso species by its large, zzso zzso
