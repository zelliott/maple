An zzso was raised to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To determine its function, the zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso were zzso This zzso consisted of 315 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso a value similar to that determined by zzso zzso comparisons uncovered a low but significant zzso with a zzso zzso protein and the zzso half of the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso an obvious zzso domain or a possible signal sequence at the N zzso zzso was predicted to be a soluble zzso whereas zzso data showed that it was present on the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In cells that were minimally zzso but with intact zzso zzso was found to be located on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso of proteins from the zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso was tightly bound to the zzso zzso zzso zzso also confirmed that zzso was on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso known to fuse with the zzso of the zzso the zzso of stages I zzso and II zzso zzso Although zzso was concentrated more on the mature than on the young zzso zzso the striking observation was that the zzso membrane that is derived from the zzso zzso was almost devoid of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was lost from the zzso zzso membrane after this membrane fused with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso greatly inhibited the fusion of the zzso zzso with the zzso membrane and thus the incorporation of the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a membrane protein that is involved in binding and/or fusion of the zzso zzso with the zzso membrane that leads to zzso zzso
