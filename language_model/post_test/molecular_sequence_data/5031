Native zzso IX alpha zzso zzso is a zzso of molecular mass 34 zzso We have developed an expression zzso that allows the isolation of 40 zzso of a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein from 1 zzso of zzso The fusion protein zzso zzso behaves as a zzso on gel zzso zzso zzso so that we have artificially created a zzso zzso The zzso rat kidney zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso that show a pH dependence similar to that already described for zzso kidney zzso Similar zzso was obtained in the presence and absence of the zzso domain both for the burst zzso and during zzso studies in the presence and absence of zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the A and B faces, was shown to occur exclusively via the B zzso
