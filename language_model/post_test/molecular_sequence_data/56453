We report the genetic construction and expression of a fusion protein between an zzso single zzso variable domain zzso specific for human zzso and zzso II from zzso zzso zzso zzso the variable regions of the zzso zzso zzso were assembled so as to be separated from each other by an zzso acid zzso and from the mature form of zzso by a zzso acid zzso The construct was placed under the zzso regulation of the zzso promoter, and the zzso signal sequence was used to direct export of the fusion protein to the zzso space of zzso zzso After zzso biologically active material was recovered from both culture zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso yielded about zzso zzso of zzso of initial culture zzso The fusion protein was shown to bind to tumor cells at least as well as chemically prepared zzso and to maintain zzso activity at a level similar to that of the native zzso zzso cells coated with the fusion protein were sensitive to a zzso mustard zzso in a zzso fashion comparable to that of zzso chemically zzso to zzso This article demonstrates the feasibility of using single zzso variable zzso fusion proteins for the zzso of zzso zzso
