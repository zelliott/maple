zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of a zzso zzso precursor which is subsequently transferred to suitable protein zzso a process which is zzso among all zzso zzso of the zzso occurs immediately following this transfer, the first step being the removal of the terminal zzso zzso by zzso I in the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso I has been isolated, the zzso gene zzso this zzso has not yet been zzso In the present work, it is shown that zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein previously identified as being required for normal cell wall zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has significant zzso acid similarity to the product of the human zzso I zzso zzso analysis for zzso I activity in zzso and in zzso was done on the progeny from the spores obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso It is shown that, unlike zzso cells, cell extracts obtained from zzso delta zzso zzso are unable to release zzso zzso from the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Following 1 h labeling of cells with zzso analysis by high pressure liquid zzso of the labeled zzso zzso combined with treatment with jack bean alpha zzso and zzso zzso I, shows that the zzso isolated form a zzso delta zzso zzso are fully zzso retaining the three terminal zzso zzso whereas the zzso from zzso cells do not have any zzso zzso These results showing a lack of zzso I activity in zzso delta zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso are consistent with the structural evidence that zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso
