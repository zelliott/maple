The genetic zzso that zzso prostate zzso are assumed to comprise gain or loss of specific zzso regions, whole zzso or zzso zzso zzso data have not demonstrated clear specificity of whole zzso or regional zzso gain or loss that characterizes entire individual zzso zzso or all zzso zzso within a zzso zzso We have analyzed zzso from 13 patients for target sequences by using zzso and FISH techniques on paired zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and benign samples (usually from different areas of the same zzso zzso We exercised stringent zzso control over these samples by examining small zzso 5 zzso discrete regions of zzso benign, zzso and zzso zzso The same zzso region was examined on serial sections by FISH and zzso zzso The zzso were examined for zzso aberrations involving zzso 4 (as a zzso 7, 8, 10, and the Y by FISH analysis, and for gain or loss of zzso 7 and zzso arms zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso The concurrent application of zzso and FISH to zzso zzso zzso yielded evidence of higher zzso of genetic aberration in prostate zzso than those found with either method alone or by other zzso These results indicate the power of simultaneous genetic zzso that are closely linked to specific tumor zzso
