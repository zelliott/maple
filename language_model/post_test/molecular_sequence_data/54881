zzso zzso 15 is an inflammatory zzso that plays an essential role in the zzso zzso and maintenance of specific natural killer cell and zzso zzso and has been implicated as a zzso of inflammatory zzso An zzso zzso that blocked zzso cellular responses was isolated by zzso display and zzso via zzso of the third zzso regions zzso of variable heavy zzso and variable light zzso zzso zzso of improved zzso were zzso with each other to explore the maximum potential sequence zzso zzso the most potent zzso isolated using this comprehensive strategy, exhibits a zzso increase in affinity and a striking zzso increase in cellular potency compared to its zzso Such a wholesale zzso strategy therefore represents a useful method for exploiting synergistic potency gains as part of future zzso engineering zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with human zzso was determined in order to map the structural zzso and zzso The most remarkable feature revealed lies within the zzso and is a novel zzso zzso that sits within the zzso zzso loop at the center of the zzso binding zzso This is the first report to describe an zzso as a principal component of a naturally derived zzso zzso following affinity zzso
