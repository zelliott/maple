zzso of the hard tick and zzso disease zzso zzso zzso has a repertoire of compounds that counteract host zzso Following sequencing of an I zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso library, a clone with sequence zzso to tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso This zzso codes for a mature zzso zzso called zzso with 140 zzso acids containing 10 zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in insect cells and shown to inhibit factor zzso zzso factor zzso factor X (FX) zzso with an zzso concentration of 50% zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with FX and zzso but not zzso zzso behaves as a zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso increasing its zzso zzso At high zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso however, in the presence of zzso or zzso (but not zzso zzso becomes a tight inhibitor of zzso as assessed by zzso factor IX zzso zzso zzso This indicates that FX and zzso are scaffolds for zzso in the zzso of zzso and implies that the zzso domain is necessary for zzso complex zzso Additionally, we show that zzso blocks zzso generation by zzso cells expressing zzso zzso may be a useful tool to study the structural features of zzso FX, and zzso and an alternative zzso in cardiovascular zzso
