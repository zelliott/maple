zzso healing in horses is fraught with zzso Specifically, wounds on horse limbs often develop exuberant zzso tissue which behaves clinically like a benign tumor and resembles the human zzso in that the evolving zzso is trapped in the zzso phase of repair, leading to zzso zzso gained from the study of zzso in horses should eventually lead to new insights into how to prevent unwanted zzso formation in zzso zzso fragments corresponding to zzso zzso for zzso and zzso genes potentially contributing to the zzso phase of repair, were previously identified in a zzso expression study as being zzso in 7 day wound zzso from zzso The aim of the present study was to clone full-length zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to study the zzso expression of zzso and corresponding proteins during repair of body and limb wounds in a horse zzso 

The zzso pattern of the two genes was zzso except for zzso in limb wounds, wounding caused zzso of zzso which did not return to baseline by the end of the zzso Relative zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso was noted in body wounds compared to limb zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso was principally observed in zzso cells and zzso and was especially pronounced in wounds having developed exuberant zzso zzso 

This study is the first to characterize zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and to document that these genes are expressed during wound repair in zzso It appears that zzso may be regulated in a zzso manner while zzso might help zzso wounds mount an efficient inflammatory response in contrast to what is observed in limb zzso Furthermore, data from this study suggest that zzso and zzso might interact to zzso zzso cell and zzso proliferation during wound repair in the zzso
