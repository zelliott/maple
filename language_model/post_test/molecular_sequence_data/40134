We have developed a novel method named zzso to predict zzso in proteins based on the support zzso machine zzso The prediction was done on a data set of 469 zzso proteins containing 967 zzso A great improvement in prediction performance was achieved by using multiple sequence alignment generated by zzso as input instead of the single zzso acid zzso The introduction of secondary structure information predicted by zzso also improved the prediction zzso Moreover, we handled the very uneven data set by combining the cost factor zzso with the zzso zzso This further promoted the prediction quality of our zzso The final zzso model yielded a Matthews correlation zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso zzso To our knowledge, this zzso value is the highest obtained so far for predicting zzso An online Web server based on this method has been developed and can be freely zzso at zzso or zzso
