An zzso zzso gene from a member of the zzso kingdom, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso for the first zzso Two zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso acid sequence information, led to the amplification of a zzso DNA fragment, used to screen zzso zzso Comparing the zzso zzso acid sequence of total zzso zzso with those of known zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed only a low degree of zzso except for a zzso region close to the zzso the so-called zzso Using zzso expression systems zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso was produced in large zzso Although the total length of the protein and the results of alignment procedures suggest a closer relation to zzso than to zzso zzso the zzso zzso may represent a novel class of zzso zzso This is zzso by the finding that an zzso against this protein does not zzso with zzso coli nor zzso or rabbit zzso zzso for zzso
