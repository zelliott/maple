The zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was isolated by zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the region containing zzso indicated an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a zzso of 432 zzso acids with a typical zzso signal zzso of 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing confirmed the processing of the protein in zzso coli at the signal zzso zzso site predicted by zzso sequence zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of zzso revealed no zzso to other known zzso indicating that zzso belongs to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potato zzso zzso has an alkaline pH zzso and requires zzso for its zzso Of several zzso zzso tested, none could substitute for zzso zzso zzso (with a degree of zzso up to zzso and zzso can be used as zzso zzso of the degradation products formed upon incubation with zzso indicated that zzso is an zzso zzso generating zzso zzso as the major end zzso zzso of zzso expression was studied by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of this fusion is low under all growth conditions tested and is dependent on the growth zzso In addition, zzso expression was found to be induced by zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso still displayed zzso zzso activity, suggesting the presence of multiple zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso
