zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso using an zzso and a gel zzso zzso Furthermore, the corresponding gene zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso zzso showed a higher affinity for zzso zzso zzso with respect to zzso the stability and activity of zzso were dependent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has an zzso of zzso zzso coding for a putative protein of 440 zzso acids and Southern zzso analysis revealed that the gene is present as a single copy in zzso zzso The zzso activity and the zzso expression level evaluated in zzso grown either in different carbon sources, in zzso or during zzso were the same in all the conditions tested, while zzso and Northern zzso analyses performed with zzso at different days of growth showed zzso zzso zzso regulation in response to the growth zzso Finally, Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is localized only in the zzso fraction confirming its important role in zzso
