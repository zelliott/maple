zzso chemistry and zzso sequencing were used to identify an Aedes zzso zzso zzso zzso after treatment of cultured cells with zzso zzso On acid gels, the putative zzso activity ran just ahead of the zzso zzso zzso of this activity yielded a single band on zzso gels, with a mass of approximately 14 zzso Mass spectral analysis of the zzso band uncovered five zzso peptides with masses that matched peptides from an Aedes aegypti zzso which we had previously characterized from the zzso zzso cell zzso Based on this tentative zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned using zzso zzso The full length zzso sequence was used to deduce the sequences and masses of theoretical zzso peptides that would be detected after zzso laser zzso zzso time of flight zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso In aggregate, this analysis uncovered seven peptides that zzso 75 of the 125 zzso acids in the mature zzso zzso zzso In a zzso analysis, the Aedes zzso were most closely related to the zzso zzso As a group the zzso zzso were more closely related to zzso from various zzso species than to those from higher zzso such as zzso and zzso which have evolved a zzso zzso
