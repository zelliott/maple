The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso vary in different zzso and different protein zzso of the zzso have been zzso Alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been detected in transformed zzso zzso and zzso the function of this zzso species is still zzso We developed a zzso for detecting alternatively spliced zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso at different stage of maturation obtained from human peripheral zzso in order to evaluate a possible zzso role during zzso zzso Trace events of alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequences were observed in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso we consider this phenomenon a zzso activity in the cells zzso
