A putative zzso of zzso zzso has been maintained for 19 pot culture generations over zzso The zzso differed zzso from the zzso parental lineage in characteristics of the spore zzso zzso versus pigmented zzso color, high plasticity in zzso zzso versus rigid and finely zzso deep zzso reaction versus no reaction in zzso zzso zzso This variation was equivalent to or greater than that between any two species in zzso or any other zzso in zzso zzso of spore zzso revealed that the terminal zzso state of the zzso zzso was similar to a transient intermediate stage in the zzso The zzso zzso therefore, did not result from emergence of a unique zzso zzso Rather, it arose from a zzso that led to premature termination of spore zzso so that a unique transient juvenile stage became permanent in mature zzso Because this zzso was homogeneous in all progeny zzso it is hypothesized to be zzso trait expressed only after the zzso was distributed in all zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the putative zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso suggested a local zzso The profile of the zzso was identical to that of the zzso parent and was zzso % similar to those of four other zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and a zzso gene with and without three variable zzso placed the zzso zzso solidly within the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that stability of zzso traits is not a suitable criterion by itself to recognize zzso The zzso zzso was a discrete and zzso zzso that became fixed in a population and was stable through time and zzso In the absence of negative selection, this zzso could persist, disperse and then be zzso as a new species in zzso zzso markers expose this zzso as a zzso zzso and therefore of no zzso zzso Assessment of genetic divergence amongst multiple zzso is important in zzso the contribution of zzso characters toward recognition of species in zzso zzso
