The human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has been isolated and its molecular structure was partially zzso The gene is approximately 11 zzso in length and contains nine zzso and eight zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso gene coding for zzso zzso are essentially identical with those of zzso zzso zzso and C, and zzso zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso belongs to a zzso family that includes zzso zzso zzso and C, and zzso and also demonstrate high conservation of the zzso organization among this zzso zzso
