To study zzso genes activated by zzso zzso we have constructed a zzso library using the mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso By differential zzso a zzso designated zzso was identified that showed zzso acid sequence zzso to rat liver zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are transcribed within an hour following stimulation and in the absence of protein zzso The predicted protein sequence of zzso consists of 181 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso zzso All three sequences contain basic and zzso zzso regions characteristic of the zzso and zzso family of zzso factors, but the remainder of the sequences are unrelated to this zzso zzso zzso has been shown to bind to a zzso zzso promoter zzso Additional experiments have shown that zzso is also induced by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso in both zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Based on these zzso it is likely that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso
