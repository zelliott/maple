zzso zzso is a prominent feature of many neurodegenerative diseases, such as zzso zzso and Parkinson's diseases, as well as zzso zzso and systemic zzso These diseases are sometimes called protein zzso diseases, but the latter term begs the question of what is the zzso state of proteins for which normal structure and function are zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso of approximately 100 A zzso These zzso are composed of a wide variety of proteins that have no sequence zzso and no similarity in three-dimensional zzso yet, as zzso they share a common secondary structure, the zzso Because of the prominence of zzso deposits in many of these diseases, much effort has gone into zzso of zzso zzso Recent advances in solid-state zzso zzso and other zzso techniques have led to the partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the time, for zzso a set of zzso peptides believed to play a zzso role in Alzheimer's disease, the zzso are parallel with all zzso acids of the sheets zzso Since the time of those zzso however, it has become clear that there is no universal structure for zzso zzso While many of the zzso zzso described thus far have a parallel zzso structure, some have zzso zzso and other, more subtle structural differences among zzso exist as zzso zzso demonstrate zzso zzso the ability to adopt more than one stable zzso zzso zzso plasticity could account for zzso differences in zzso and for the fact that a single zzso can form different zzso types with zzso differences at the atomic zzso More recent data now indicate that the zzso may not be the most potent or zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This damage is not confined to cell death, but also includes more subtle forms of damage, such as disruption of synaptic plasticity in the central nervous zzso Rather than zzso zzso zzso variously called zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in the case of zzso may be the more zzso zzso of cell zzso These are soluble zzso of zzso peptides or zzso but their structure is very challenging to study, because they are generally difficult to obtain in large enough quantities for high-resolution structural techniques, and they are temporally zzso rapidly changing into more mature, and eventually zzso zzso zzso the mechanisms by which they disrupt cellular function are also not well zzso Nevertheless, three zzso zzso zzso sets of mechanisms have been proposed as responsible for the cellular damage caused by zzso zzso protein zzso These are: zzso disruption of cell zzso and their functions zzso by inserting into zzso and zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of normally zzso functional proteins zzso by zzso or zzso zzso factors to the wrong cellular zzso and zzso zzso up the zzso by binding to and zzso components of the quality-control system of cells, such as the zzso or zzso zzso
