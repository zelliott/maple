zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso crops possessed genes for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and, therefore, have the potential to cause zzso illness in zzso 

zzso zzso followed by sequencing confirmed the presence of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso All zzso genes were detected in 59% of zzso zzso zzso while all zzso genes were detected in zzso All six genes were detected in zzso of zzso zzso genes were not detected in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso could express zzso genes in pure zzso 

zzso This study showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso that possess genes for zzso production are present in zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso lacked specific genes or lacked all zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, host, country of origin and tissue of origin had no impact on the zzso genes zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with the potential of causing zzso illness in humans is a cosmopolitan zzso inhabitant of plants, not incidental surface inhabitants or zzso as often suggested by previous zzso
