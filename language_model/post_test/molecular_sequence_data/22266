zzso are zzso calcium binding proteins from the zzso zzso implicated in various cellular functions, such as zzso duplication, DNA repair, and nuclear zzso zzso The intrinsic molecular flexibility and the zzso tendency make difficult the structural characterization of the integral zzso In this paper we report the solution structure, the zzso binding properties, and the zzso interactions of the zzso domain of two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso construct of zzso revealed a compact core zzso including four almost zzso zzso and a short zzso zzso very similar to the zzso state structure of other calcium regulatory zzso zzso The first 25 zzso show a highly irregular and dynamic zzso The three-dimensional model for the zzso domain of zzso based on the high sequence conservation and zzso zzso data, shows very close structural zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso and zzso monitored by zzso zzso revealed a very weak affinity zzso zzso suggesting that the cellular role of this domain is not calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that an zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso fragment, has a significant affinity zzso zzso zzso for the isolated zzso domain, suggesting an active role in the zzso of zzso zzso
