zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of human alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned into the zzso zzso expression zzso were used to derive zzso Chinese zzso zzso cell lines permanently expressing the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso alpha zzso proteins were studied in the presence of various zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso as well as zzso experiments showed that the zzso alpha zzso zzso continuous degradation that was prevented by zzso A but not by incubation of cells at 16 degrees zzso Moreover, zzso partially impaired the zzso of both zzso and zzso alpha zzso but not their zzso nor the degradation of zzso alpha zzso Those results suggest that zzso alpha zzso degradation occurs in the zzso network, a compartment located between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The process did not apparently involve zzso since it was insensitive to zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso and zzso by zzso did not result in the zzso of the zzso but instead in its rapid zzso zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso zzso for a short zzso zzso but not a long (24 zzso period, improved the zzso of zzso alpha zzso in a similar way as it affects retention of naturally zzso zzso suggesting that the small proportion of zzso alpha zzso which is not zzso or zzso but accumulates in the zzso zzso is back transported as a partially zzso species from the post zzso zzso compartment in which degradation takes zzso
