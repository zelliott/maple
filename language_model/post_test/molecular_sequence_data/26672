Here we present a zzso hypothesis for the New World zzso radiation, based on a zzso zzso of 219 terminal zzso and five nuclear molecular markers zzso zzso zzso We also estimate ages of the main zzso in this zzso This study corroborates many of the recent insights into the zzso relationships of New World zzso It further zzso a number of cases for which previous studies have been inconclusive, such as the relationships of zzso zzso and zzso We find a remarkable difference in age of the initial divergence events in zzso and zzso The deepest branches in zzso are of zzso age, whereas the extant lineages of zzso have their origin in the zzso zzso half of the New World zzso species are zzso in 5 large zzso that started to diversify around the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on our zzso results we propose a revised zzso of the New World zzso We also erect new family or zzso level zzso for four small and isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
