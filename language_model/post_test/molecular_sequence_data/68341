We have identified a human zzso of the bacterial zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli causes a dominant zzso zzso suggesting that zzso like other divergent zzso zzso interferes with the normal bacterial mismatch repair zzso zzso maps to human zzso zzso near a locus implicated in zzso zzso colon cancer zzso A T to C transition zzso has been detected in the zzso position of a zzso zzso site in sporadic colon tumors and in affected individuals of two small zzso zzso These data and reports indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso cause an instability of zzso repeats like those associated with zzso suggest that zzso is the zzso zzso
