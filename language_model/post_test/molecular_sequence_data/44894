zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso and plays an important role in the defense mechanisms of zzso birds and fish against zzso damage by catalyzing the reduction of a variety of zzso using zzso as the reducing zzso However, the zzso role of human plasma zzso zzso remains unclear due to the low levels of reduced zzso in human plasma and the low zzso of this zzso The crystal structure of human plasma zzso zzso was determined by Patterson search methods using a zzso model modified from the known structure of bovine zzso zzso zzso The structure was refined to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with I zzso zzso reflections in the resolution range of 8 to zzso zzso The zzso unit contains a zzso zzso are built up from zzso by zzso zzso The zzso structure of the plasma zzso shows the typical structure motif of the zzso fold consisting of a central zzso and several zzso zzso The active site zzso zzso is situated in the loop between zzso and zzso and is located in a pocket on the protein zzso The overall structure of the human plasma zzso is similar to that of the bovine zzso zzso The main differences in their zzso structures are an extended N zzso and the possible existence of a zzso bridge in the plasma zzso Compared to the bovine zzso zzso a number of zzso in the active site are zzso or deleted in the plasma zzso including all the zzso that were previously suggested to be involved in zzso zzso The observed structural differences between the two zzso suggest differences in zzso binding and zzso
