zzso zzso experiments performed at high protein zzso demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is zzso irrespective of the buffer and of zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso is comparable with that of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso structure commonly found in zzso zzso zzso is not necessary to ensure efficient zzso The analysis of the zzso acid sequences suggests that an altered interaction between zzso occurs in all bacterial zzso zzso zzso The substitution of zzso zzso with charged ones at positions located at the zzso interface of all known zzso zzso zzso could be specifically responsible for the zzso structure of the zzso coli zzso
