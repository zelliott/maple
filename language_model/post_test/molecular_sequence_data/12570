zzso acid sequencing by zzso DNA technology, although dramatically useful, is subject to base reading zzso is zzso and is insensitive to zzso zzso Mass zzso techniques can provide molecular weight data from even relatively large proteins for such zzso sequences and can serve as a check of an zzso purity and sequence zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso can be zzso to yield structural information by tandem mass zzso providing a second method for gaining additional confidence in primary sequence zzso Here, accurate zzso 1 zzso molecular weight and molecular zzso zzso information for human muscle and brain zzso zzso has been obtained by zzso zzso coupled with zzso mass zzso to help distinguish which of several published zzso acid sequences for both zzso are zzso The results zzso are consistent with one published sequence for each zzso and the zzso indicated by zzso focusing due to zzso zzso zzso This approach appears generally useful for detailed sequence zzso of zzso zzso
