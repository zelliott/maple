The zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and a protein of 180 zzso present in zzso zzso zzso This zzso was used to obtain a zzso clone zzso the 180 zzso protein now called zzso zzso zzso zzso of 180 zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence from this zzso shows that zzso is almost entirely composed of alternating zzso and basic zzso We show that zzso is heavily zzso and that it contains multiple consensus sites for zzso by zzso zzso II and zzso zzso In addition we show that zzso is the 180 zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso thus allowing reinterpretation of previous work with this zzso zzso appears to be the zzso zzso of the rat zzso protein zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso signal binding protein that zzso on zzso tracks between the zzso and the zzso zzso roles for zzso in zzso zzso are zzso
