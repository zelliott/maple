The zzso proteins of zzso are important zzso zzso The zzso protein sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso deduced from the zzso sequences of the corresponding zzso zzso were zzso Most differences were found in the zzso zzso of the zzso whereas the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso acid sequences revealed a signal sequence 25 zzso acids zzso No zzso zzso were present, even though zzso forms a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was determined by primer zzso The coding region and zzso zzso were separated by a leader sequence zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter sequence of zzso is identical to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed that this promoter is active in zzso Thus, the inability of zzso to express the zzso protein is due to a single base pair deletion in the coding region of the zzso gene of zzso
