This report studied the identification and sequence of a full-length zzso for the bovine zzso zzso family member, zzso protein A1 zzso and its localized and quantitative expression in the zzso to clarify the regulatory mechanism of zzso cell proliferation and differentiation during zzso and zzso zzso We cloned a full-length bovine zzso zzso with 725 zzso and an zzso frame corresponding to a protein of 175 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shared zzso zzso with human zzso All zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in bovine zzso were zzso as well as in other zzso zzso In the zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso was limited in zzso cells expressing various zzso molecules like zzso zzso zzso X protein zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso detection exhibited a high-level expression of zzso in the zzso at Day 21 of zzso and it was expressed and increased in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso zzso expression intensity increased with progression of gestation and remained elevated in zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso were detected from late gestation to zzso in zzso as well as in the results of zzso zzso We believe that the zzso of zzso cells may be regulated by the balance of the zzso and zzso zzso genes produced a zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is a new candidate for zzso maintenance of the zzso cells that support zzso functions throughout gestation in zzso
