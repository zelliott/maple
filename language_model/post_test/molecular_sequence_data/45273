zzso display libraries are powerful tools for identifying and manipulating zzso zzso While the large size of bacterial zzso display libraries has made them the platform of choice in many applications, often considerable engineering has been required to achieve display of properly folded and active zzso zzso such as zzso This problem has been partially solved in several zzso display systems, zzso using zzso or zzso but these systems have their own zzso Recently, zzso has been developed as a display system using the virus itself or infected insect cells as the display zzso Here, we review the development and use of zzso cells as a platform for display libraries of peptides bound to major zzso complex zzso class I zzso or class II zzso We have used fluorescent zzso soluble zzso receptors zzso to screen these libraries and to identify zzso zzso zzso We also present some improvements to this system that allow very large libraries to be constructed and zzso We have used these libraries to examine the role of zzso peptides in the presentation of the zzso zzso A zzso and to manipulate an zzso zzso zzso
