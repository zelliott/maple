We analyzed the zzso properties of duck zzso zzso II zzso which differs from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid zzso A zzso binding study showed that DEL binds to the zzso analog at zzso zzso in the same manner as zzso However, the experimental zzso of DEL against the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed remarkably enhanced production of zzso and reduced production of zzso as compared to in the case of zzso Computer simulation of the zzso reaction suggested that the zzso acid zzso at zzso E and F zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso caused the great zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso reactions of zzso in which zzso and zzso in zzso were converted to zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso exhibited profiles similar to those of zzso In contrast, the characteristics of the zzso zzso were different from those of zzso and rather similar to those of zzso the order of the amounts of zzso and zzso was reversed in comparison with in the case of zzso zzso production of zzso was also observed for the zzso zzso zzso with two zzso These results indicated that the substitution of zzso with zzso can account, at least in part, for the characteristic zzso of zzso Moreover, replacement of zzso with zzso reduced the rate constant of zzso The substitution of the zzso zzso may affect the zzso activity of zzso
