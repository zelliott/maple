The zzso locus encodes for the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso which plays an important zzso and zzso zzso zzso variation in this gene was studied in 13 different mouse lines that included eight laboratory zzso two zzso zzso subspecies and three additional zzso zzso The data presented represent the largest study of sequence variation across multiple mouse lines in a single gene zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso Among all mice, the average frequency of all zzso in the zzso regions was zzso zzso and the average zzso frequency was zzso zzso For zzso alone, the average zzso in the zzso and zzso regions for all mice were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Between laboratory zzso the average zzso and zzso zzso for all zzso dropped to zzso and zzso zzso zzso There were 111 zzso zzso that resulted in 42 different zzso acid changes, of which only 10 zzso acid changes had been previously zzso Based on the zzso zzso the zzso history of the gene showed mice from the zzso and zzso zzso in separate branches while mice from the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a more complex zzso zzso the zzso protein as a whole appears to be under zzso selective pressure zzso : zzso ratio zzso zzso Despite significant functional constraint in the basic zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding is not constrained to the zzso zzso which supports further the role of the zzso in development and its importance beyond the zzso response to environmental zzso
