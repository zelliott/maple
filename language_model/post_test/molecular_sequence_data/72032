zzso is a zzso acid zzso with a striking diversity of important biological responses, including, zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding to the zzso B zzso zzso a member of the zzso of zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 2 zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso reporter zzso A panel of single point zzso in zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso loop 3, and zzso zzso 7 zzso were developed to study the structural requirements for zzso zzso Point zzso within highly zzso regions of zzso and zzso loop 3 were without effect on zzso zzso zzso However, zzso within zzso of the zzso significantly impacted zzso downstream zzso For example, nine point zzso within zzso of the zzso were identified that prevented zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso fell into two zzso several exhibited greatly decreased zzso activity, relative to wild type zzso whereas others displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso activity relative to wild type zzso Our results suggest that zzso of the zzso is involved in its zzso mechanism and regulates zzso zzso zzso
