The zzso zzso gene was cloned by virtue of its zzso to the zzso zzso which encodes a membrane protein that zzso zzso of zinc in zzso zzso zzso protein is predicted to have six zzso zzso and shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso with the zzso extending throughout the two zzso Human zzso zzso were also zzso the zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to zzso zzso The mouse zzso gene has 8 zzso and maps to zzso zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso expression is restricted to the brain and zzso In zzso zzso reveals that within the brain, zzso zzso is most abundant in the zzso and cerebral zzso zzso raised against the zzso tail of mouse zzso react with the projections from these zzso and produce a pattern similar to that obtained with zzso reaction, which reveals zzso zzso zinc within synaptic zzso We propose that zzso zzso the zzso of zinc in synaptic zzso
