zzso of the zzso zzso coding for the zzso heat shock protein zzso were determined for six members of the order zzso including representatives of three zzso and for the only cultivated member of the order zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the zzso gene was amplified from these strains by zzso with zzso zzso targeting regions of the zzso gene that are zzso at the zzso acid level, and the resulting zzso products were cloned into a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the cloned zzso fragments revealed the presence of two different types of zzso sequence in one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso Only one type of zzso sequence was found for each of the remaining zzso zzso analysis of the partial sequence data suggested that the majority of zzso zzso including one of the zzso zzso zzso form a coherent zzso group branching adjacent to other main lines of descent within the domain zzso as has been shown previously by zzso zzso sequence zzso One of the two zzso zzso zzso sequences also appears to constitute a separate lineage within the zzso zzso Each of the remaining sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with the single sequence obtained from zzso zzso appeared to be unrelated to the other zzso sequences and to occupy a position distant from that of other zzso zzso The zzso diversity of zzso sequences exhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso was comparable to that found in zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso coli, the only other zzso for which a zzso zzso family has been zzso
