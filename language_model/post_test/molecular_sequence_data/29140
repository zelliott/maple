To study zzso zzso in zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a chicken zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso long and zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with an estimated molecular size of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso zzso protein is zzso identical to zzso from zzso humans, mice, rats and zzso Sixteen zzso three zzso and four zzso that contained the essential zzso acids Met, zzso zzso zzso were used for functional analysis of zzso in zzso zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso For most zzso and zzso tested, the zzso affinities were in the zzso range, indicating that zzso has high affinity for these zzso zzso and zzso were exceptions, with zzso affinities in the zzso zzso Neither free zzso acids nor zzso were transported by zzso Northern zzso analysis using a full-length zzso zzso as the probe demonstrated that zzso is expressed strongly in the zzso zzso and zzso and at lower levels in kidney and zzso The present study demonstrated for the first time the presence and functional characteristics of a zzso transport system from an avian zzso
