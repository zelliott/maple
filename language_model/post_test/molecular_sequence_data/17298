Using an approach based on the zzso zzso zzso System zzso we extracted 111 candidates from zzso gene sequences of zzso The results of zzso search and sequence analysis demonstrated that these candidates included actual zzso genes that would be important for further investigating the mechanism of translation termination regulated by zzso event, and could also give some useful clues for functional zzso zzso Between the candidates and zzso of gene sequences in rice, there exist significant base biases at the positions surrounding the stop zzso These positions, especially both zzso and zzso are referred to as part of an extended stop zzso In candidates, G at position zzso and G or C at position zzso are much more favored than that in zzso Both stop sequence patterns, zzso and zzso might drive high zzso efficiency in zzso Secondary structure analysis revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso acids around the first stop zzso of candidates have a strong bias toward zzso particularly the zzso position zzso which indicated that the zzso acids at the zzso region being frequently located in the zzso region of zzso might be a zzso for efficient translation termination or zzso
