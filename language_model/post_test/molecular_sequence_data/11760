zzso on a number of proteins in the Greek zzso zzso group using computer methods suggested that proteins containing modified Greek keys might exhibit some zzso interactions similar to those seen with zzso The two domain zzso modified Greek key structure of the zzso is shared by other zzso for example the zzso protein zzso Based on computer analysis, we tested for zzso interactions using protein A from zzso zzso and showed that zzso unlike zzso or gamma zzso exhibits weak protein A zzso zzso exhibits much weaker binding than zzso zzso A interaction may involve zzso interactions around the zzso zzso zzso We discuss the implications for the molecular evolution of the zzso the zzso and for the molecular interactions in the zzso lens that could be important in maintaining zzso
