A bacterial strain designated zzso T was isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso in Segovia zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of this strain showed zzso and zzso % sequence zzso respectively, with those of the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso T presented zzso zzso and molecular differences with respect to zzso species which indicated that it belonged to a different zzso The isolate was a zzso zzso zzso rod, zzso by means of zzso zzso The strain was zzso and showed weak zzso zzso It grew in the presence of 2 % zzso zzso was the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 0 and zzso were the major fatty zzso Major polar lipids were zzso zzso and zzso The zzso content was zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that isolate zzso T should be classified within a novel zzso species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
