zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso presents unique research opportunities, such as the functional analysis of complex human zzso after random zzso In one study, human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso stimulating hormone were expressed in zzso During the course of these experiments, we also investigated the role of zzso usage and of the DNA sequence upstream of the zzso start zzso The zzso zzso has a higher AT content than the human, resulting in a different zzso zzso The zzso gene contains three clusters with infrequently used zzso that were changed to zzso that are preferred by zzso The results reported here show that zzso the first zzso zzso of the zzso gene contributes to zzso to zzso increased expression levels, but that further zzso has no significant zzso These observations suggest that optimal zzso usage contributes to zzso stabilization, but does not play an important role during the zzso phase of zzso Furthermore, adapting the zzso of the zzso gene to the zzso zzso sequence increased expression levels approximately zzso Thus, using both zzso zzso and zzso adaptation, a 6- to zzso increase in expression levels could be obtained for zzso
