zzso data and genetic studies indicate that certain forms of human zzso are zzso Based on the similarity between the human and mouse zzso mouse models of zzso could facilitate the discovery of genes associated with zzso zzso Here, we report an zzso zzso zzso that zzso a novel gene and results in whole body zzso generalized zzso seizures, and zzso brain activity in transgenic zzso The zzso named zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso protein displaying zzso to a number of nuclear regulatory zzso suggesting that perhaps the jerky protein is able to bind zzso
