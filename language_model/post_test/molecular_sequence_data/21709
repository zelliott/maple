The response to zzso stimuli often alters the zzso state of plasma zzso associated zzso In this regard, generation of a comprehensive membrane zzso can significantly enhance signal zzso and drug mechanism zzso However, analysis of this zzso is regarded as technically challenging, given the low abundance and zzso of integral membrane zzso combined with difficulties in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this article, we highlight recent advances in membrane and zzso enrichment techniques resulting in improved identification of these elusive zzso We also describe the use of alternative fragmentation techniques, and assess their current and future value to the field of membrane zzso
