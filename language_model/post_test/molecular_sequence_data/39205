Two species of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are closely related to each zzso It is reported that the zzso organic substances in the skeletons of both contain a zzso complex playing a key role in the regulation of zzso However, information on the zzso proteins of zzso zzso has been zzso Hence we studied the zzso organic zzso of zzso for both species, to analyze the sequences and the functional properties of the proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of the preparations showed four bands of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 102, 67, 48, and 37 zzso for zzso zzso and seven bands of zzso 83, 70, 63, 41, 30, and 22 zzso for zzso zzso A major protein band of about 67 zzso in zzso zzso and two bands of proteins of about 70 and 63 zzso in zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso were zzso For detection of calcium binding zzso a zzso overlay analysis was conducted in the extract via zzso zzso The zzso and zzso calcium binding proteins in zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso binding proteins in zzso zzso were found to be zzso An zzso for zzso zzso zzso which is thought to play an important role in the process of zzso revealed specific zzso zzso derived protein sequences were subjected to standard sequence analysis involving identification of similarities to other proteins in zzso The significantly different protein expressions and compositional analysis of sequences between two species were zzso
