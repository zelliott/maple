This paper reports the first genetic characterization of zzso zzso zzso in Spain from a naturally infected zzso The dog presented clinical signs compatible with canine zzso After DNA extraction and zzso amplification, zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso gene ( zzso of this agent were zzso The zzso zzso number for the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene of this strain is zzso The zzso zzso strains registered in France and Japan showed the highest similarity to the zzso zzso gene sequence obtained from the Spanish zzso In the amplification of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was zzso and three zzso differences were detected in comparison with other strains zzso These data confirm the presence of zzso zzso in a dog showing clinical signs compatible with zzso in zzso
