The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso localized on the left arm of zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso The sequence contains 13 open reading frames zzso of which four zzso the known genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are made concerning the functions of the unknown zzso Some of the zzso contain sequences similar to expressed sequence tags zzso found in the database made available by zzso In particular, the highly expressed zzso gene is represented in this database by no less than 20 zzso zzso Two zzso sequences and a putative functional zzso motif have also been zzso One zzso zzso containing nine putative zzso segments is similar to a hypothetical membrane protein of zzso zzso zzso features of the other zzso include zzso binding sites, a zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso targeting zzso a zzso repeat signature and in two instances, good similarity to the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso
