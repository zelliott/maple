The zzso membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a prime malaria asexual zzso vaccine zzso zzso variation is one of the main obstacles in the development of a universal effective malaria zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of three zzso zzso of which the domain I is the most diverse region of this zzso The objective of our study was to investigate and analyze the extent of genetic diversity and the effectiveness of natural selection at the zzso domain I of zzso zzso in zzso from zzso A zzso of zzso gene spanning domain I was amplified by zzso zzso from 48 zzso zzso zzso collected from two major malaria endemic areas of Iran during 2009 to August 2010 and zzso zzso zzso and statistical analyses were performed using zzso and zzso software zzso Analysis of zzso diversity revealed relatively high zzso and zzso diversity at the zzso domain I of Iranian zzso zzso tests provided strong evidence of positive natural selection acting on the zzso gene zzso The findings also demonstrated that, in addition to natural selection, zzso zzso may contribute to the diversity observed at the domain zzso The results obtained will have significant implications in the design and the development of an zzso vaccine against zzso zzso
