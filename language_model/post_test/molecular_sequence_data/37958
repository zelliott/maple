Sox proteins are expressed at many stages of development and in numerous zzso The zzso factor zzso is first expressed throughout the inner cell mass and subsequently becomes localized to the primitive zzso developing central nervous system, and the zzso zzso is also highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells, but becomes zzso following differentiation of these zzso In this study, we have isolated, zzso and performed the first characterization of the zzso promoter of any zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region has been zzso and the primary zzso start site mapped by primer extension zzso Additionally, two positive regulatory regions within the promoter region have been zzso We also show that expression of zzso zzso gene zzso is reduced in differentiated zzso cells as compared to their zzso zzso Furthermore, we have identified a consensus zzso zzso box motif present in the zzso zzso zzso of this site significantly reduces the expression of zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate that this zzso box motif can bind the zzso zzso factor zzso
