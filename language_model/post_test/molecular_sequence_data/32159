In a previous study, we observed marked zzso between zzso and zzso against zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with approximately zzso reductions in zzso zzso observed at one-eighth to zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether the zzso between zzso and zzso could be explained by enhanced entry of zzso into the cell or was related to zzso acid zzso in the zzso site in the beta zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

We developed a zzso for zzso to measure zzso zzso levels as well as zzso zzso of zzso In addition, we zzso the zzso site in the zzso beta of zzso strains with and without zzso between zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso levels were the same in zzso zzso as in zzso zzso showing zzso zzso and were not affected by the presence of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso without zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso beta zzso site revealed that the synergistic strains had the same sequence as zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains all had zzso in known zzso zzso 

zzso is able to reverse zzso resistance in some strains of zzso but the mechanism could not be explained by an effect of zzso on entry of zzso into or transport out of the cell, by zzso of zzso or by zzso involving the zzso zzso
