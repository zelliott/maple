In plants, zzso proteins function as zzso factors involved in zzso production and zzso zzso We cloned a zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso that encodes for a zzso protein from zzso zzso The putative protein has a zzso motif at the zzso and a highly zzso region with that of the zzso zzso family at the zzso The promoter region of zzso contains a zzso box zzso that is known as a zzso element zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso transcripts were more abundant in developing seeds than in stems and leaves where zzso are normally zzso zzso zzso length zzso mapping demonstrated that zzso is located on the upper region of zzso 4, which clearly indicates that zzso is distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus that affects both zzso development and zzso zzso
