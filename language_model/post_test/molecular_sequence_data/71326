In order to clarify the difference between solution zzso and X-ray zzso analyses concerning the presence of zzso structure in protein A, the zzso zzso chemical shifts of the zzso zzso zzso for selectively labeled protein A were zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso shifts of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and Val zzso compared with the random zzso chemical shifts both in solution and solid state imply the presence of the third zzso in the zzso chain, in contrast to the crystal structure of zzso zzso Thus, a combination of selective isotope labeling and zzso chemical shifts will be a good zzso to monitor the local structure of zzso protein in solution and solid zzso
