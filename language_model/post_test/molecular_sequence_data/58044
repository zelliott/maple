Human zzso protein B zzso is a zzso zzso protein that enhances the surface active properties of pulmonary zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso type II cells of the respiratory zzso and its expression increases markedly late in zzso In the present study, a human pulmonary zzso cell line, zzso was used in both functional and zzso zzso to identify DNA sequences controlling lung zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso I hypersensitive studies demonstrated two distinct regions of lung zzso hypersensitivity located zzso to the zzso promoter and within the eighth zzso of the zzso To functionally define these DNA zzso a series of zzso zzso were constructed in which segments of the human zzso gene and zzso sequence were linked to a zzso reporter gene and zzso for expression in lung and zzso cell zzso Whereas far upstream and zzso sequences did not contain zzso zzso a zzso pair DNA segment zzso pair zzso to zzso was sufficient to support lung zzso zzso zzso I zzso demonstrated that this pulmonary zzso zzso promoter zzso contained five nuclear zzso sites, two of which bound lung zzso nuclear protein zzso These results suggest that the pulmonary zzso zzso expression of zzso is determined, in part, by both ubiquitous and cell zzso zzso interactions within the zzso promoter zzso
