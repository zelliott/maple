zzso of the anterior and zzso poles of the zzso zzso requires seven zzso expressed genes including zzso zzso and torso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is expressed throughout the zzso but is activated specifically at the zzso zzso mosaic analysis has shown that zzso is required during zzso in zzso cells at each end of the zzso We cloned the zzso locus and showed that it was expressed specifically in zzso cells at the anterior and zzso ends of the zzso zzso encodes a novel protein with a putative zzso signal zzso zzso expression of zzso produced zzso with a zzso similar to that resulting from zzso active zzso zzso These results suggest that localized zzso controls the localized zzso of zzso
