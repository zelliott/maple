The abundant zzso group proteins 1/2 zzso represent a group of potent architectural elements of zzso They are able to induce strong zzso and zzso zzso Here, we compared the abilities of diverse zzso proteins to distort the zzso zzso of zzso pair DNA zzso The DNA zzso was measured in solution by monitoring zzso resonance energy transfer between zzso zzso attached to opposite ends of the DNA zzso Various insect and plant proteins which differ in size, in composition of their zzso zzso zzso and in composition of the zzso and the zzso zzso regions were analyzed in these zzso Despite these structural differences the extent of the induced changes in DNA zzso upon binding to various proteins was similar, as the estimated bend angle was zzso degrees for all the tested zzso Our results suggest that a set of highly zzso zzso stabilizing the zzso structure of the zzso mainly determines the extent of DNA zzso in the zzso Even extended positively charged regions zzso the zzso are apparently not able to influence this zzso distortion of zzso
