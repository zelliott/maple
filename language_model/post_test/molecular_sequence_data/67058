zzso protein C zzso has potent zzso and zzso properties that are zzso in part by its interactions with its zzso protein S and the zzso cell protein C zzso zzso The protein zzso zzso domain is implicated in both zzso We sought to identify how the protein C zzso domain enables specific zzso interactions in addition to its zzso role in zzso zzso The human zzso zzso domain, which cannot bind zzso or support protein S zzso activity, has zzso zzso that are not shared with the human protein C zzso zzso We hypothesized that the unique protein zzso zzso domain zzso were responsible for zzso the specific zzso To assess this, we generated 13 zzso protein zzso zzso incorporating the zzso zzso zzso Despite zzso activity similar to zzso zzso in the absence of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso by protein zzso whereas zzso zzso exhibited reduced protein S zzso Moreover, zzso zzso displayed negligible zzso zzso despite normal binding to zzso zzso zzso and factor Va zzso in the presence and absence of protein zzso A single zzso zzso zzso also failed to bind zzso Factor zzso which also possesses zzso bound soluble zzso with similar affinity to zzso protein C, collectively confirming zzso as the critical zzso for zzso zzso These results reveal the specific zzso domain zzso responsible for zzso protein zzso molecular recognition with both its zzso and zzso and further illustrate the zzso potential of zzso zzso
