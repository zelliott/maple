In order to understand the molecular mechanism of growth regulation in zzso and to develop novel zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was constructed by using the zzso extracted from zzso zzso in the zzso stage zzso zzso and three zzso zzso fragments, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso According to the results of sequence analysis, zzso belonged to the zzso protein family, and the other two fragments, zzso and zzso were novel zzso Under continuous zzso these zzso zzso expression levels increased from zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso with increasing growth zzso Furthermore, under a zzso rhythm of light zzso zzso zzso zzso the daily mean zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the exponential phase also differed from those in the zzso zzso However, such differences between these growth zzso were not observed in the zzso levels of zzso and zzso This study not only provided a new way to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth but also offered a possibility of employing these gene fragments as indicators to monitor the growth status of zzso in the marine zzso
