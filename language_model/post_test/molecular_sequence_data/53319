zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to their zzso via an zzso zzso The recently solved X-ray structure of the zzso shows that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are positioned close to the zzso zzso in such a way that they can serve as zzso donor in the zzso reaction zzso The role of these zzso which are zzso in other zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso and Ala and zzso of zzso to zzso resulted in zzso zzso of which the zzso values were only zzso lower than for zzso zzso whereas the zzso values for the zzso of zzso oxide and zzso oxide were 3 orders of magnitude higher than the zzso values of zzso zzso showing that the zzso zzso is severely affected by the zzso zzso analysis of the conversion of zzso oxide by the zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso elevated zzso values were mainly caused by a zzso increase in zzso and a zzso reduction in the rate of zzso The rates of zzso of the zzso zzso were not significantly affected by the zzso The double zzso zzso showed only a low residual activity for zzso oxide, with a zzso value that was 6 orders of magnitude lower than with zzso zzso and 3 orders of magnitude lower than with the single zzso zzso This indicates that the effects of the zzso were zzso The side chain of zzso is positioned in the active site of the X-ray structure of zzso zzso zzso of zzso to Ala resulted in an active zzso with slightly altered zzso kinetic parameters compared to zzso zzso indicating that zzso is not essential for zzso and that the side chain of zzso mimics bound zzso Based upon this zzso the zzso potential of various zzso zzso was tested, resulting in the identification of zzso as a competitive inhibitor with an zzso constant of 30 zzso
