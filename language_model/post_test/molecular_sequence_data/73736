The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a protein capable of inducing zzso hypersensitivity reactions in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that it is the last gene of the zzso zzso which now comprises four zzso zzso zzso analysis of peptides zzso by the zzso zzso identified four zzso of zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso which zzso to the gene products zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of the zzso zzso showed that zzso is expressed by two zzso the longer zzso transcript of zzso zzso which was observed at growth temperatures of 37 and 20 degrees C, and a shorter transcript consisting of zzso which is detected only at low temperatures (20 degrees zzso Two zzso one preceding the zzso gene and another located upstream of the zzso zzso were zzso An extended zzso structure resembling box elements found in other zzso pathogens was also present in the zzso zzso zzso By zzso analysis, we found that although zzso was produced at both temperatures (20 and 37 degrees zzso it was zzso into culture zzso only at 20 degrees zzso However, zzso lacks a bona fide signal zzso sequence and could, like zzso be zzso by a type III transport zzso DNA zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso is species specific and restricted to zzso strains of zzso zzso
