zzso recognition by the zzso zzso protein is zzso in part by an zzso and zzso basic zzso implicated as a signature element in proteins that bind zzso Relative zzso binding affinities for a zzso zzso derived from zzso that spans the basic region are determined using a competition zzso zzso specificity is compared with zzso by a zzso model for the zzso binding domain of zzso using the same zzso zzso strength for the minimal zzso zzso zzso is correlated with that for the longer zzso both peptides recognize a short, zzso zzso However, the shorter zzso zzso more rapidly from the zzso site and discriminates less well between zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso Relative zzso zzso for zzso zzso determined from direct partition and competition zzso zzso the former zzso consistently predicts stronger discrimination against zzso with zzso in the stems zzso the zzso zzso between the two zzso are zzso in terms of contributions from zzso binding which is unstable to native gel zzso zzso stability may constitute a major specificity zzso for basic zzso recognition of zzso
