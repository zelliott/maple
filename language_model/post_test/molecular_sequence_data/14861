zzso are well known zzso reservoirs of zzso Unlike activated zzso T cells, this zzso zzso target cell type contains a very low level of the zzso zzso zzso required for zzso DNA synthesis whereas the zzso zzso zzso levels remain in the zzso range, resulting in an extremely low zzso zzso zzso simulations demonstrate that zzso reverse zzso zzso efficiently incorporates zzso zzso zzso during DNA synthesis at this ratio, predicting frequent zzso incorporation by the virus specifically in zzso Indeed, zzso zzso incorporates zzso at a remarkable rate of zzso zzso during zzso zzso This greatly exceeds known rates for cellular zzso zzso In contrast, little or no zzso incorporation is detected in zzso T zzso zzso of these zzso zzso is also substantially delayed in zzso compared with zzso T zzso Single zzso embedded in a DNA template are known to induce cellular DNA zzso zzso which mechanistically contributes to zzso zzso Indeed, we also observed that embedded zzso in a zzso template also induce zzso zzso DNA synthesis zzso Moreover, zzso zzso incorporated into the zzso during zzso reverse zzso would be generally zzso as was shown in zzso zzso Most importantly, the frequent incorporation of zzso makes them an ideal candidate for development of a new class of zzso zzso zzso
