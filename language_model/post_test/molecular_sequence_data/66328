A novel zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes 1), was isolated from zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso The full-length zzso was zzso zzso long and had an zzso zzso reading zzso that zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of 66 zzso zzso of this protein sequence with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso structure of the zzso gene showed that zzso consisted of four zzso and three zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso was a zzso gene in zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso was zzso expressed in all tested zzso including roots, stems and leaves, with the high expression in stems and zzso In addition, zzso was also found to be induced by zzso molecules for plant zzso responses, such as zzso zzso salicylic acid and zzso as well as attack by zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the response to pathogen infections in cotton zzso
