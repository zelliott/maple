Most data available from in zzso sources regarding the impact of zzso zzso on zzso V region structure and function are heavily biased due to the influence of zzso zzso In an effort to address this issue directly, we zzso introduced point zzso throughout the length of the zzso region of an zzso zzso zzso expressed as an zzso in the zzso display zzso This was accomplished by means of an zzso zzso with two zzso which resulted in two zzso zzso The nature of the zzso zzso obtained from each protocol differed from each other and resulted in different zzso of zzso clones that did not appear to contain zzso on their zzso However, the majority of zzso in both libraries lacked zzso zzso zzso zzso of the library containing the most expressed zzso for those that had gained affinity for structurally related zzso yielded two independent zzso that lacked zzso affinity for zzso and had high affinity for zzso These zzso both contained zzso acid zzso from zzso to zzso or zzso at zzso zzso position 35, a putative zzso contact zzso In this paper, we discuss the significance of these data with regard to the zzso of V region loss of function, gain of increased zzso and gain of altered specificity that result from zzso zzso in zzso
