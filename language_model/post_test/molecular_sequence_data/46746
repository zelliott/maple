A zzso protein zzso was identified in the duck liver that binds to several truncated versions of duck zzso B virus zzso zzso envelope zzso suggesting zzso may serve as a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso peptides from zzso zzso were found to be the duck p protein of the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso cloning revealed extensive protein conservation with the chicken zzso except for several insertions in the zzso leader zzso The zzso zzso contained no zzso zzso zzso at the predicted initiation site of the open reading frame, and zzso zzso experiments established an zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The zzso protein expressed in rabbit zzso zzso bound truncated zzso zzso protein identical to that of zzso derived from duck liver confirming zzso as zzso Moreover, zzso studies in zzso and zzso cells revealed both cell surface and zzso expression of the zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso zzso will permit a direct test of whether it functions as a cell surface zzso or as a zzso in the zzso replication zzso
