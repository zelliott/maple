Individual zzso containing zzso zzso were identified with in zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a widespread distribution of zzso zzso in several regions of the rat central nervous zzso zzso containing this transcript were most abundant in the anterior zzso nucleus, zzso zzso and zzso as well as in all regions of the cerebral zzso Moreover, the distribution of zzso zzso was zzso with the location of zzso containing zzso zzso in all areas of the brain zzso zzso zzso varied in their zzso and amount of zzso signal from region to zzso The widespread distribution and regional variations in zzso zzso and the amount of zzso signal are consistent with a neurotransmitter and/or a zzso role for zzso in addition to its well-established neuroendocrine zzso These results demonstrate that both the zzso and its zzso are found in zzso in the same areas and that they are therefore the sites of synthesis for zzso
