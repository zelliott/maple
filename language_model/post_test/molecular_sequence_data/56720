X-ray analysis at zzso resolution revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a compact zzso zzso Because of the hinge zzso the zzso zzso lobe is pulled tightly upward into the junction of the zzso zzso Along the molecular twofold zzso the zzso arms are joined by an zzso zzso bond between the two light zzso The zzso combining sites consist of large irregular cavities at the tips of the zzso zzso Potential complement zzso binding sites on zzso are zzso zzso by the zzso arms, but putative attachment sites are accessible for zzso with the zzso zzso on human zzso and with protein A of zzso zzso
