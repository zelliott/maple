zzso contains 34 genes that are predicted to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso activity previously has been detected in many locations in plant cells, including the zzso the zzso and the membrane zzso However, little is known about the zzso locations of individual zzso or the mechanisms involved in targeting them to those zzso We investigated the zzso location of one zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso did not partition with the plasma membrane in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that zzso was associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not contain zzso zzso or known zzso signals, but does have predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso extract and zzso was prevented by converting the zzso at the proposed site of zzso attachment to zzso zzso In plants, the zzso zzso decreased zzso membrane association by approximately zzso A zzso zzso consisting of the first 10 zzso acids of zzso fused to the zzso of zzso was also targeted to the zzso indicating that the zzso zzso of zzso can specify zzso zzso of a soluble zzso These results indicate that zzso is localized to the zzso that zzso is likely to be involved in the membrane association of zzso and that the zzso terminal region of zzso is sufficient for correct membrane zzso
