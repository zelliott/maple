A new zzso zzso which plays an essential role in cell differentiation in zzso zzso was detected and zzso zzso expression is not cell zzso and its expression in zzso and zzso alpha cells is unaffected by zzso When present on a high copy number zzso zzso causes zzso to zzso and increases the level of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso a zzso zzso bearing either of the two gene zzso zzso or zzso are sterile and have a modulated sensitivity to zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells elicits a zzso growth arrest zzso however this zzso is suppressed by a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of the zzso response zzso caused by disruption of zzso zzso zzso is not suppressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso partially suppresses the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the resulting zzso zzso zzso restore zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso may have a zzso in adaptation zzso and suggest a possible interaction of zzso with the G alpha zzso of the G zzso
