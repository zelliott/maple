zzso formation plays a role in over 25 human zzso A range of strategies have been applied to the problem of developing zzso of zzso formation, but unfortunately, many zzso are effective only in zzso excess and typically either zzso the time to the onset of zzso formation, (the lag time), while having modest effects on the total amount of zzso zzso produced, or decrease the amount of zzso without significantly reducing the lag zzso We demonstrate a general strategy zzso two moderate zzso of zzso formation can be rationally selected via kinetic zzso and combined in trans to yield a highly effective inhibitor which dramatically delays the time to the appearance of zzso and drastically reduces the total amount of zzso zzso A key feature is that the selection of the components of the mixture is based on their effect on the time course of zzso formation rather than on just the amount of zzso zzso The approach is validated using zzso of zzso formation by zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso formation in type 2 diabetes and the Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso
