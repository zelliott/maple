Butterflies in the large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are extremely uniform and exhibit few distinguishing zzso zzso However, these insects are distinctive in one respect: as a group they possess among the greatest zzso zzso diversity in the animal kingdom, with zzso numbers zzso ranging from 10 to zzso The zzso of zzso and its systematic position relative to other groups within the section zzso have been zzso zzso from the zzso genes for zzso zzso I and II and from the nuclear gene for zzso factor 1 alpha were used to reconstruct the zzso of zzso using maximum zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals, encompassing most of the zzso diversity of zzso and representatives of 14 related zzso were included in this zzso Our data indicate that zzso is zzso Representatives of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are the closest zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso in this analysis are tentatively arranged into 12 zzso only 1 of which zzso to a species group traditionally recognized in zzso zzso substitution rates across a recovered zzso were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso before the application of a molecular zzso Two published estimates of substitution rates dated the origin of zzso between zzso and zzso million years zzso During this time, there was zzso in the rate and direction of zzso evolution among lineages within the zzso zzso instability has evolved independently three times in the section zzso within the lineages zzso zzso and zzso Rapid zzso diversification may have played a significant role in the radiation of the zzso zzso
