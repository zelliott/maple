We completed the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso by determining the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso zzso G zzso and L zzso zzso The zzso consists of zzso zzso and encodes six genes in the order 3' zzso zzso zzso were derived from clones of a zzso library from zzso zzso zzso and from fragments amplified using reverse zzso chain zzso The zzso protein has a low zzso point characteristic for zzso zzso The zzso protein has significant sequence similarities with the movement proteins of zzso and zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso The putative G protein sequence contains a predicted 25 zzso acids signal zzso and zzso zzso site, three predicted zzso sites and a putative zzso zzso The deduced L protein sequence shows similarities with the L proteins of other plant zzso and contains zzso module motifs characteristic for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of this motif among zzso placed zzso in a group with other zzso zzso most closely related to zzso zzso zzso
