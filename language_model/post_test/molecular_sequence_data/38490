zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated, characterized and zzso expressed in bacterial zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso shows zzso identity with zzso from other organisms and has zzso the zzso signature motifs and zzso involved in zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso open reading frame of zzso sequences resembling the putative consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulatory elements were zzso Northern zzso zzso revealed a single transcript of zzso zzso The zzso start was determined by primer extension at position zzso relative to the initial zzso zzso zzso A binding and zzso zzso zzso activities characteristic of zzso were detected in soluble extracts of zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso In both cases, the zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of cultured zzso with zzso A decreased their proliferation with a 50% zzso value of 1 zzso and was lethal in doses over 50 zzso
