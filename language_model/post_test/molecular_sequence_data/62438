The zzso zzso 2 zzso is an important regulator of the zzso system and was very recently identified as a functional zzso for the SARS zzso The zzso sequence is similar zzso identities zzso and zzso and similarities zzso and zzso zzso to those of the zzso form of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The high level of sequence similarity allowed us to build a robust zzso model of the zzso structure with a zzso zzso from the aligned crystal structures of zzso and zzso less than zzso A prominent feature of the model is a deep channel on the top of the zzso that contains the zzso zzso zzso charged zzso surrounding the channel may provide a possible binding site for the positively charged zzso domain zzso of the zzso which we recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso 312 zzso zzso Several distinct patches of zzso zzso at the zzso surface were noted at close proximity to the charged zzso that could contribute to zzso These results suggest a possible binding region for the zzso zzso on zzso and could help in the design of experiments to further zzso the structure and function of zzso
