zzso display technology has been zzso for identification of specific binding molecules to an zzso target thereby enabling the rapid generation and selection of high zzso fully human zzso directed towards disease target appropriate for zzso zzso In the present study, single chain zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A virus zzso was selected from zzso displayed zzso library constructed from peripheral blood zzso zzso of a vaccinated zzso The variable heavy zzso and light chains zzso were amplified using zzso as template, assembled into zzso using zzso by overlap extension zzso zzso zzso and cloned into zzso zzso as a fusion for display of zzso on zzso The zzso displaying zzso fragments were subjected to three rounds of panning with zzso zzso on solid zzso High affinity zzso zzso to zzso A virus were identified by zzso zzso and cloned into a bacterial expression zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso on a zzso acid zzso zzso column and zzso The binding activity and specificity of the zzso was established by its zzso towards other human viral zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was further used in the development of an in-house zzso format in combination with a commercially available mouse zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso A virus zzso in human vaccine zzso The adjusted zzso values obtained by subjecting the values obtained by zzso of the zzso standards using the commercial and the in-house zzso kits by zzso analysis were zzso and zzso 39 vaccine samples were subjected to zzso using both the zzso zzso statistical analysis through the origin of the samples indicated International Unit zzso values of zzso and zzso respectively for the commercial and in-house kit zzso
