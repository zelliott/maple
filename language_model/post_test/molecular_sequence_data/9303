zzso zzso zzso zzso a swollen underground zzso is used as a model system for the study of dormancy release and zzso Natural dormancy release, at room temperature, is initiated by zzso zzso bud zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso dominance zzso zzso is shortened by treatments such as zzso zzso which mimics the zzso of dormancy release in cold storage by inducing early zzso of several buds zzso We studied the mechanisms governing zzso dominance zzso zzso zzso resulted in the development of increasing numbers of zzso buds with time in storage, suggesting the need for autonomous dormancy release of each bud prior to control by the zzso zzso zzso of programmed cell death zzso were identified in the zzso during normal growth, and these were more extensive when zzso was lost following either extended cold storage or BE zzso zzso included DNA zzso induced gene expression of zzso processing zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso zzso and its zzso activity was fully inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso electron zzso further revealed zzso structural zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso body in the zzso development of zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso Treatment of zzso with BE and then zzso inhibitor induced faster growth and recovered zzso in detached and zzso zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso occurrence is associated with the weakening of zzso zzso allowing early zzso of mature lateral zzso
