Eight bovine zzso clones have been identified as members of the zzso zzso gene zzso The clones were prepared in zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso partial zzso of DNA from a single zzso zzso maps show that seven of these clones are related and comprise at least five zzso zzso zzso for zzso variation these probably represent three or more different zzso The zzso sequences show open reading frames zzso corresponding closely to zzso 6, 7 and 8 of human and zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso shows that these are multiple bovine zzso A zzso The seven clones would zzso at least two different but closely related forms of zzso zzso The zzso zzso site at the end of zzso 7 in all seven clones is the unusual sequence zzso The eighth clone contains an zzso zzso to zzso 2 of the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso acid sequence is more closely related to bovine zzso than to any of the other known zzso it may be functionally zzso to zzso but could be a novel zzso zzso zzso The zzso boundaries seen in both this clone and in the bovine zzso A clones are at the same positions as found in human zzso A, bovine zzso and human and mouse zzso further evidence that the general structure of zzso zzso zzso genes has been strongly zzso
