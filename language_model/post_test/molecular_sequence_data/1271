To establish an infection, zzso zzso zzso a zzso type III zzso to zzso several zzso zzso zzso into the zzso of target zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in several key steps during zzso zzso zzso including maintenance of zzso regulatory control and pore formation in the target cell membrane through which zzso zzso These functions are zzso in part, by an interaction with the zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the complex molecular mechanisms of zzso function, we performed a systematic zzso study to search for discrete functional zzso We highlighted zzso acids beyond the first three zzso zzso that are zzso for zzso zzso and confirmed that an interaction between zzso and zzso is essential for maintenance of zzso regulatory zzso In addition, discrete zzso within zzso that are essential for both pore formation and zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso other zzso were found to be important for zzso zzso but not for pore zzso zzso zzso is clearly essential for several discrete steps during efficient zzso zzso zzso zzso of this modular zzso domain structure provides important insights into the function of zzso
