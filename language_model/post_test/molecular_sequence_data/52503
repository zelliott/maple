zzso zzso accumulates zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso acid when grown on mineral media under limited zzso or zzso and using zzso or zzso as a carbon and energy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso characterization of these zzso revealed the simultaneous zzso of two zzso rather than a zzso with random sequence distribution of the zzso zzso zzso Berger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso M, zzso J (1999) zzso zzso zzso To understand the genetic requirements for such unusual zzso zzso we zzso total zzso DNA from zzso zzso by Southern zzso experiments using zzso zzso These experiments indicated the presence of more than one zzso zzso gene within the zzso of zzso zzso However, when total zzso DNA from zzso zzso was used to complement a zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso only one zzso zzso gene was obtained resembling the zzso zzso type of zzso zzso based on zzso acid sequence zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso based on high sequence zzso genes zzso a zzso and zzso zzso were identified in a gene cluster with the zzso zzso zzso The arrangement of the three genes is quite similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
