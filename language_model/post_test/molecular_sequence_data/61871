zzso translation initiation factor zzso is a zzso protein that is an essential component of a system for ensuring that protein synthesis begins at the correct zzso within a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and seven fragments of the protein were zzso zzso and characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of the 6 zzso zzso domain located at the extreme N zzso of zzso can be clearly identified within the zzso zzso of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso relaxation rate data indicate that zzso the zzso domain is internally well ordered and tumbles in solution in a manner that is independent of the other zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso domain is connected to the zzso regions of zzso by a flexible zzso Chemical shifts of zzso within the isolated zzso domain do not significantly differ from those of the corresponding zzso within the context of the full-length zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a structurally independent unit that does not strongly interact with other regions of zzso CD and zzso data together provide evidence that zzso zzso of zzso have zzso and flexible regions as well as substantial zzso zzso CD data indicate that the zzso content of these regions decreases significantly at temperatures above 35 degrees zzso The features of structurally zzso zzso and zzso zzso connected by a flexible zzso with significant zzso content are reminiscent of another translation initiation factor, zzso
