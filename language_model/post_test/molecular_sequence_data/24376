We have isolated a zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors from the zzso most closely related to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gene is expressed in a set of early zzso zzso that project to a common zzso the lateral zzso zzso We show that the gene is specifically expressed in spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso in nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in a set of zzso zzso that include zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso anterior lateral line, zzso and zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso of expression of the gene in these zzso zzso with the phase of zzso outgrowth and target zzso zzso of the gene is also observed in several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso budding zzso zzso zzso semicircular zzso in the zzso zzso and in the zzso fin zzso
