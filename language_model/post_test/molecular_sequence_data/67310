The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential to maintain cell wall zzso zzso catalyze the final step of the zzso synthesis by forming 4 zzso 3 zzso between two zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso resistance mechanism involving zzso has been identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this resistance pathway, the classical 4 zzso 3 zzso are replaced by 3 zzso 3 zzso whose formation are zzso by the zzso To date, only one class of the entire zzso family, the zzso is able to inhibit the zzso zzso Nevertheless, the specificity of this zzso is still not zzso zzso the study of this new zzso family is of considerable interest in order to understand the mechanism of the zzso zzso by zzso In this context, we present zzso the backbone and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso assignment of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and in the zzso form with a zzso the zzso
