We have isolated two novel zzso involving the zzso domain of zzso from developing sensory zzso These zzso are generated by alternative zzso and lack two or all three of the zzso zzso Each of these zzso is expressed as zzso that possess or lack the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso expressing these zzso do not bind any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso and neither survive nor undergo zzso transformation in response to zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso motifs in zzso are essential for zzso binding and signaling and indicate that the zzso zzso zzso alone are insufficient to zzso zzso binding to zzso
