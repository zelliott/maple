The life cycle of the zzso zzso species zzso zzso infecting the urinary system of the shrew zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Holland Nature Reserve, South Africa, has been zzso by a study of its zzso zzso zzso data in local snails and zzso during a 34-year period, and its zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso obtained from dissected animals were mounted in microscope slides for the zzso study and measured according to standardized zzso The zzso DNA zzso gene was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso act as specific first and second intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso develop in zzso zzso zzso mature zzso show differentiated zzso male terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso and usually no tail, opposite to zzso in which mature zzso show a zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso usually zzso zzso the kidney of zzso zzso and differ from mature zzso by only a slightly greater zzso The final zzso are the zzso and zzso of the zzso kidney pelvis and zzso in light infections and also kidney zzso and zzso in heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso and adults proved to belong to zzso zzso by analysis of a zzso zzso fragment, which was identical except for three zzso in zzso of which only one zzso zzso studies showed usual zzso infection in zzso zzso and very rare zzso infection in zzso zzso which does not agree with high zzso and zzso in the zzso 

The presence of zzso adult forms and zzso zzso and zzso observed suggest that zzso zzso may use two transmission strategies, a zzso life cycle by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be the normal pattern, whereas a second zzso host is just starting to be zzso In zzso a zzso zzso migration followed by an zzso migration to reach and penetrate the outer surface of either of both zzso should zzso For first zzso infection, the fluke takes advantage of the phenomenon that zzso zzso always urinate during zzso zzso in zzso the second intermediate zzso host should zzso be seen as a last addition to the cycle and their present adult stage zzso restricted to zzso tract and related zzso as a loss of the zzso capacity of the zzso
