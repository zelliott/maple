The reliability of the zzso monkey as an important experimental animal depends on its genetic zzso with zzso During our assessment of the zzso monkey as a zzso model for zzso research, we cloned the full-length zzso of zzso monkey factor X (FX) and compared its genetic characteristics and zzso activity with those of human zzso The full-length zzso of zzso monkey FX was zzso zzso in zzso corresponding to zzso coding zzso acids and sharing zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso When FX sequences from different animals were compared with that of human FX, zzso monkey and zzso FX showed similar degrees of zzso to human FX, which were less than that between human and zzso FX sequences but remarkably higher than those of another 2 monkey species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of functional sites between human and zzso monkey FX revealed high similarities between their zzso acids sequences and zzso zzso The average zzso activity of FX from 24 zzso monkeys was in the normal range of that of healthy zzso The zzso monkey therefore may be a suitable animal model for research addressing zzso factor zzso
