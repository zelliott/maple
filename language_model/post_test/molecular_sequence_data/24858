zzso of zzso from the feces of a naturally infected dog and from an zzso human, were identified as the previously reported canine zzso of zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso Also among the zzso from the dog, a trace amount of zzso zzso bovine zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso from both the dog and human were infectious for zzso zzso zzso by calf 1 zzso zzso were approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas those zzso by calf 3 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso from calf 1 infected calf 2 resulting in zzso by calf 2 of zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were not infectious for zzso zzso mice or zzso zzso juvenile mice, although all control mice became infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from calf 1 and the human were structurally indistinguishable from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso However, zzso zzso zzso differed markedly at the molecular level from all known species of zzso based on sequence data for the zzso zzso and the zzso 70 zzso The differences in zzso and host specificity clearly differentiate zzso zzso as a new zzso
