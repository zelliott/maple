A unique zzso zzso was identified in a zzso strain zzso Based on its zzso zzso and zzso properties, strain zzso was deemed to be a novel species within the zzso zzso The zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso was composed of zzso zzso acids and contained four consensus zzso sites, and the zzso zzso was, at least in this study, speculated to have three zzso zzso per zzso The primary structure of the zzso was zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso but it showed no significant similarity to any known zzso zzso With zzso as the zzso the zzso efficiency zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was not inhibited by zzso a strong zzso zzso zzso The zzso also showed activity toward zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso efficiencies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We deemed the zzso would be a member of zzso from its broad zzso zzso However, typical zzso and other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso seldom exhibit zzso zzso zzso These results would expand the zzso zzso range to include zzso
