zzso a zzso zzso approach, we cloned the gene and zzso coding for the human zzso hormone zzso also called zzso V2 zzso zzso The zzso sequence of both cloned zzso provided the information to zzso the structure of the isolated zzso zzso The structure of this gene is unusual in that it is the first G zzso zzso gene that contains two very small intervening zzso the second of which separates the region zzso the seventh zzso region from the rest of the open reading zzso The sequence information was used to zzso appropriate zzso to be used as zzso in the zzso The zzso gene was localized by zzso using DNA from hybrid cells as zzso The gene was found to reside in the zzso portion of the human X zzso a region identified as the locus for zzso zzso diabetes zzso
