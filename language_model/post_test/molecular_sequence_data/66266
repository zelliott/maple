zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a unique zzso zzso of small zzso motor zzso One of its functions appears to be the transport of zzso along zzso Here, we present the X-ray structure of a zzso truncated zzso construct of zzso zzso the motor domain and the neck zzso and a 3-D image reconstruction of this motor domain bound to zzso by zzso zzso The protein contains zzso bound to the active site, yet the structure resembles an zzso zzso By comparison with structures of the zzso motor zzso in different zzso states zzso zzso et zzso (2001) Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso structure zzso to the zzso complex of zzso rather than the zzso zzso zzso differences in the coordination of the zzso and zzso interactions between adjacent molecules in the crystal are discussed in the context of the unusual zzso of the zzso zzso motor and the zzso construct used for crystal structure zzso The zzso motor zzso zzso at a zzso of one head per zzso zzso thereby forming an zzso zzso of 8 zzso In spite of unusual extensions at the zzso and within flexible zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso binding geometry is similar to that of other members of the zzso zzso
