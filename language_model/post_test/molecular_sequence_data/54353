The expression of the zzso genes is regulated during the cell cycle to provide zzso for zzso assembly during DNA zzso In budding zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed from divergent promoters at the zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that the major zzso of zzso is zzso a zzso DNA binding protein with a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to two pairs of upstream zzso sequence zzso elements in the zzso promoter: zzso and zzso drive zzso zzso and zzso and zzso drive zzso zzso zzso and zzso also contain binding sites for the cell cycle regulator zzso (an zzso zzso which overlap the zzso binding zzso The binding of zzso and binding of zzso to zzso and zzso are mutually exclusive in zzso Both zzso and zzso are bound in cells arrested with zzso apparently awaiting a signal to activate zzso Soon after the removal of zzso zzso zzso a small, early peak of zzso and zzso transcription, which is followed by a much larger peak due to zzso Both zzso zzso from the zzso promoter after expression has been zzso Thus, zzso and zzso cooperate to control the timing of zzso zzso
