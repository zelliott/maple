zzso is a zzso synthesis zzso DNA zzso essential for DNA damage tolerance in zzso In the process of zzso stalled zzso zzso DNA zzso are temporarily replaced by specialized zzso zzso that can bypass sites of DNA damage zzso thus allowing replication to continue or zzso gaps to be zzso Despite its limited zzso activity, human zzso plays a key role in zzso by serving as a scaffold that provides an access of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to their zzso DNA zzso and zzso their subsequent exchange to zzso that extends the distorted DNA zzso zzso interaction with the other major human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso domain zzso We used zzso zzso to determine the spatial structure of the zzso domain zzso zzso and its complex with zzso interacting region zzso from zzso zzso zzso The domain forms a zzso bundle with a zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso 1 and 2, creating a binding pocket for the two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif that upon binding folds into an zzso zzso zzso and zzso relaxation zzso zzso suggest that free zzso and zzso complex exhibit zzso zzso dynamics encompassing the zzso binding site, which might facilitate selection of the molecular zzso optimal for zzso These results offer new insights into the control of zzso in human cells by providing a structural basis for understanding the recognition of the zzso by zzso DNA zzso
