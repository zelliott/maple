We have applied zzso procedures that zzso zzso data to model the solution zzso of zzso a rigid microbial iron transport zzso of known zzso zzso structure zzso van der zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 102, zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dissolved in zzso zzso were investigated via one- and two-dimensional zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso distance constraints derived from zzso zzso experiments were input to a distance geometry zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso 46, zzso in order to generate a family of zzso structures consistent with the experimental zzso These models were subsequently zzso through restrained molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso Brooks et zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso The resulting structures were characterized in terms of relative energies and zzso zzso zzso based on integration of the generalized Bloch equations for the complete zzso which include the zzso zzso interaction, demonstrate that the zzso coordinates reproduce the experimental nuclear zzso effect time courses very well, and indicate that there are no significant differences between the zzso and solution zzso of zzso A similar study of the metal free zzso zzso suggests that at least two zzso are present in zzso at 23 degrees zzso Both are different from the zzso structure and explain, through zzso zzso the observed zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso backbone zzso yields an increased number of sequential zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso which reflects the mean value of zzso dependence of the zzso zzso Our results support the idea that, in the case of structurally rigid zzso moderately accurate distance constraints define a zzso zzso encompassing the zzso structure, and that energy considerations reduce the size of this zzso For flexible zzso however, the zzso approach can be misleading since the zzso parameters are averaged over substantially different zzso zzso
