zzso zzso zzso zzso dystrophy, caused by zzso in the zzso regulator zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso disease characterized by the breakdown of tolerance to zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid protein zzso by zzso contains several structural motifs suggestive of a zzso regulator and bears similarity to cellular proteins involved in zzso zzso We show here that zzso fused to a zzso DNA binding domain activates zzso from a reporter promoter, and the zzso seen requires the full-length protein or more than one zzso zzso At the structural level zzso forms zzso through the zzso domain, and molecular modeling for this domain suggests a zzso bundle zzso In agreement, we show that the common zzso zzso zzso protein zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso properties of zzso together with its interaction with zzso might be important in its function as zzso zzso almost totally abolish the zzso zzso
