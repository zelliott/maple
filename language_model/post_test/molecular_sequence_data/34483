To zzso the genetic characteristics of the zzso protein zzso region of zzso A virus strains circulated in zzso 

The zzso sequences of zzso region of 42 zzso zzso positive serum samples were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso acid identities and genetic characteristics of the zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso acid identities in the zzso junction region among the 42 strains were zzso - zzso and zzso - zzso while in the complete zzso region, the identities were zzso and zzso zzso with identical zzso sequences in the zzso junction region had zzso zzso identity in the complete zzso region and 0-2 zzso acid differences in this zzso There were no zzso acid changes at zzso zzso sites of zzso region within the 42 zzso zzso 

All the 42 zzso strains belonged to zzso I, with 40 strains zzso to zzso zzso and 2 to zzso zzso Different zzso strains zzso in this paper differed in the zzso sequences of the zzso region, but the zzso acid sequences were highly zzso with no changes at zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the strains with the same zzso junction region were identical or closely related when compared in the complete zzso zzso
