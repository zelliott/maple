The zzso zzso gene products zzso zzso zzso zzso signal molecules that induce zzso zzso on zzso zzso In spot zzso zzso with roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemically zzso zzso induced zzso zzso structures, similar to the activity of these zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso backbone and a zzso zzso zzso zzso were active on zzso zzso In contrast, the synthetic zzso which has previously been shown to be active on zzso zzso was inactive on zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso which produces zzso without zzso zzso at the reducing end, was able to induce zzso structures on both zzso Surprisingly, the individual, zzso zzso molecules produced by this zzso were incapable of inducing zzso formation on zzso zzso zzso However, when applied in zzso the zzso produced by the zzso zzso acted zzso to produce zzso structures on zzso zzso zzso
