zzso zzso libraries of zzso resonance energy transfer peptides were used for the analyses of the zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed in an effort to design selective zzso for the zzso Initially, we defined the zzso specificity by preparing a library with the general structure zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso and X is a random zzso where Z was successively occupied with one of the 19 natural zzso acids with the exception of zzso The peptides containing zzso and zzso in the zzso position had higher zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was fixed at zzso so we could define the zzso selectivity of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the results from these libraries, we zzso peptides zzso and zzso which contain the most favorable zzso for zzso zzso zzso reduction of the length of these two peptides resulted in zzso which demonstrated the highest selectivity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding of zzso with zzso zzso using a combination of zzso analysis and molecular zzso was zzso and the results shed new light on the binding characteristics of the zzso
