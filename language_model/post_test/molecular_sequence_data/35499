zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is a rare pediatric zzso disease in zzso Due to the lack of an animal model, its zzso mechanism is poorly zzso To study the role of zzso in brain development, a zzso model of zzso zzso was zzso We identified an zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene is expressed in the zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced brain volume and body zzso We observed increased brain cell zzso and loss of zzso zzso cluster zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also detected in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso had less sensitive touch response and impaired swimming activity that could be rescued by injection of zzso zzso In addition, eye movement was also significantly impaired in zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso appears to result in similar zzso as that of zzso zzso thus zzso could be a good model for investigating zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso
