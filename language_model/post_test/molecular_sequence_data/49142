After zzso zzso termination in zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso II zzso zzso must be recycled by zzso zzso domain zzso zzso the zzso responsible for zzso the zzso domain of the largest zzso zzso zzso factor zzso stimulates the activity of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein 74 zzso of zzso forms a complex with zzso in both human and zzso Here, we report a zzso structure of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso protein 74 bound to the zzso C zzso of human zzso zzso zzso These results illustrate the molecular mechanism by which zzso efficiently recruits zzso to the pol II zzso machinery for recycling of the zzso
