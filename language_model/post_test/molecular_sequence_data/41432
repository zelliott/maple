In zzso analysis identified a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sharing zzso zzso acid identity with zzso The aim of this work was to characterize the zzso zzso zzso from several zzso zzso that may represent potential reservoirs of acquired zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were from the zzso Institute collection, zzso DNA was extracted and used for shotgun zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso for resulting zzso coli zzso strains were determined by zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were zzso and compared with zzso zzso activity of bacterial extracts from zzso zzso coli strains was determined by zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as zzso 

zzso zzso coli zzso strains zzso hypothetical zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed decreased zzso to zzso only for zzso coli zzso and zzso coli zzso expressing the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from different zzso zzso shared weak zzso acid identity, ranging from zzso zzso zzso They differed greatly from that of zzso zzso zzso (and zzso sharing only zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso was zzso but weak in all these zzso zzso coli zzso except zzso coli zzso in which specific activity was significantly zzso 

Several zzso located zzso have been identified from zzso zzso They share weak zzso acid identity and are very zzso related to other acquired zzso zzso
