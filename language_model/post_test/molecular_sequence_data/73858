zzso fish are a vast group of advanced zzso The species examined to date have three forms of zzso hormone zzso within a single species, but the origin of the third zzso zzso is zzso In this study, the primary structure of three zzso peptides is determined from the brain of the zzso zzso zzso an example of a zzso that is less advanced than the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso from zzso brain extracts using high performance liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso The three forms identified by chemical sequencing and mass zzso are sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and salmon zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition the number of forms of zzso in the brains of male and female fish was determined zzso The same three forms of zzso were present in the brains of both sexes as determined by zzso zzso and zzso position from the zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso brain has the identical forms of zzso identified in zzso fish and zzso the origin of three forms occurred earlier in evolution than previously zzso
