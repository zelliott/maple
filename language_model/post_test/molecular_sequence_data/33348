zzso zzso are zzso machines that bind protein zzso via a degradation tag, unfold the zzso if necessary, and then zzso the zzso into a chamber for zzso zzso recognition is normally viewed as a passive zzso By contrast, for the zzso Lon zzso we show that zzso tags are also regulatory elements that determine zzso activity zzso Indeed, different tags fused to the same protein change degradation speeds and energetic efficiencies by zzso or zzso zzso binding to multiple sites in the Lon zzso appears to zzso stabilize specific zzso zzso including one with high zzso and low zzso activity, and results in positively cooperative zzso These zzso mechanisms allow Lon to operate in either a fast or slow zzso mode, according to specific zzso needs, and may help maximize degradation of zzso proteins following zzso zzso
