The hypothesis that zzso regions rich in zzso zzso zzso can be identified using local variations in zzso and zzso statistics has been zzso zzso zzso difference, zzso difference and zzso statistics were compared among seven classes of zzso and three zzso zzso variations were observed in zzso and, in zzso zzso in the frequency of the zzso zzso zzso programs based on these two zzso statistics were zzso With zzso screening alone, a zzso fraction of the zzso zzso containing all 44 known transfer zzso zzso zzso and signal recognition particle zzso could be zzso When zzso combined with zzso zzso screening was used, 43 of the 44 known zzso structural zzso were again identified, while the number of presumably false hits overlapping a known or putative zzso gene was reduced from 15 to zzso In addition, 19 candidate zzso were identified including one with significant zzso to several known zzso zzso zzso
