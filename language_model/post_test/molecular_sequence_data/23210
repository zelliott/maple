zzso zzso are electron transfer proteins that carry a zzso bound zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso active zzso A distinguishing feature of these zzso is the dramatic change in the zzso reduction potential of the zzso upon binding to the zzso (at pH zzso from zzso zzso when free in solution to zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, the contribution of three neighboring zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and of three zzso charged surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso the zzso properties of zzso upon its binding to the zzso has been zzso Additionally, the role of these zzso in the zzso interaction has been zzso zzso the zzso zzso the most noticeable result was obtained for the zzso zzso In this zzso zzso the increased accessibility of zzso leads to an increase of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso On the other hand, a correlation between the zzso environment of zzso and the zzso has been zzso The more positive zzso or the less negative zzso present in the surroundings of the zzso zzso zzso then the less negative the value for zzso With regard to zzso binding to zzso breaking of zzso interactions between zzso and zzso 56, 58, and 97 seems to increase the zzso values, especially in the zzso zzso Such results suggest that the zzso network in the zzso environment influences the zzso zzso
