The zzso zzso system from zzso zzso zzso unlike all known zzso systems, contains three genes zzso DNA zzso In addition to revealing two DNA zzso responsible for modification of zzso in different DNA zzso it has been first shown that one bacterial cell has two DNA zzso zzso and zzso with similar zzso zzso The boundaries of the gene for DNA zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso gene was cloned in zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso samples of zzso and zzso were obtained by zzso with different zzso The main kinetic parameters have been determined for zzso and zzso both zzso zzso in the recognition site zzso
