zzso zzso zzso harbors a zzso zzso zzso which zzso the ability to grow on zzso zzso zzso growth on zzso zzso results in selection of a zzso strain, which degrades zzso better but no longer grows on zzso zzso We have previously proposed that this zzso is due to a double zzso zzso event between zzso repeats of the zzso of this zzso within the zzso One zzso form of this zzso zzso explains this zzso since it harbors two copies of the zzso degradation zzso gene zzso which are essential to grow on zzso but has lost the zzso zzso zzso the first step in degradation of zzso The other zzso zzso zzso should harbor two copies of the zzso gene but no copies of the zzso gene zzso A molecular analysis using a multiplex zzso approach to distinguish the zzso zzso zzso from its two zzso forms, was carried zzso zzso zzso products confirming this zzso model were found and zzso Few zzso zzso forms in cultures grown in several carbon sources were zzso zzso studies indicated that cells containing the zzso zzso zzso were not zzso by sole carbon source growth pressure, whereas those cells harboring zzso zzso zzso were selected upon growth on zzso After 12 days of repeated growth on zzso the complete zzso population in zzso zzso zzso apparently zzso to this zzso However, zzso zzso forms could be recovered after growing this culture on zzso indicating that different zzso forms can be found in zzso zzso zzso at the population zzso
