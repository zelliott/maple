zzso This review covers the pharmacology and physiology of the body wall muscle systems of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso acid zzso play important roles in the control of body wall muscle in both zzso In zzso and zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso while zzso is the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso has a zzso role at zzso body wall muscle but little if any effect on zzso body wall zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the body wall muscle can be classified as zzso in both zzso though the zzso zzso has not been zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were the most effective of those so far examined while zzso and zzso were the most effective zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso were potent zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the body wall muscle exhibits similarities with the zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso is a very weak or inactive zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso receptors but is inactive on zzso zzso zzso zzso does block zzso responses of earthworm body wall zzso All these zzso responses are zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides of the zzso family occur in both zzso and zzso has been identified in zzso zzso probably have an important role in heart regulation in leeches and in zzso of their body wall zzso zzso also zzso zzso body wall muscle activity with zzso raising muscle tone while zzso zzso the zzso It is likely that this family and other zzso peptides play an important role in the physiology of body wall muscle throughout both zzso
