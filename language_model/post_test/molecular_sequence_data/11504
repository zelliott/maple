A zzso procedure was used to place a zzso crystal protein gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso strains containing multiple crystal protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes an zzso protein highly specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been found in any zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned into an integration zzso which contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso C, allowing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to be targeted to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso First, to minimize the possibility of zzso zzso between zzso and the resident crystal protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contained only one crystal zzso was chosen as a recipient and transformed by zzso Second, a generalized zzso zzso zzso was used to transfer the integrated zzso gene from zzso to two other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The integrated zzso gene was expressed at a significant level in all three host zzso and the expression of zzso did not appear to reduce the expression of the zzso crystal protein zzso Because of the newly acquired ability to produce the zzso zzso the zzso strains showed a higher level of activity against zzso zzso than did the parent zzso This zzso procedure should therefore be generally useful for the introduction of an additional crystal protein gene into zzso zzso strains which have multiple crystal protein genes and which show a low level of transformation zzso
