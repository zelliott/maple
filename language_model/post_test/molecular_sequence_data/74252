The zzso family of zzso zzso proteins has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell migration, as well as in the differentiation and proliferation of zzso zzso In screens for zzso defective in zzso zzso embryonic zzso we identified zzso the only zzso zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso in body muscles and zzso to zzso structures on body muscles and to other basement zzso zzso maintains strong attachments of muscles to zzso in the absence of zzso muscles progressively zzso from the zzso causing defective zzso zzso In animals with reduced zzso function, zzso becomes dose dependent, suggesting that zzso and zzso function in concert to promote the attachment of muscles to the basement zzso Although zzso zzso display largely normal zzso zzso zzso zzso with outgrowth defective zzso revealing a cryptic role for zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso acts in zzso guidance and zzso whereas in zzso zzso maintains process zzso Our results show that a zzso maintains zzso zzso in multiple zzso
