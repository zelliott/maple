The crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso was determined at zzso zzso zzso consists of an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso domain zzso The structure of the zzso highly resembles that of zzso zzso zzso except that it contains three zzso bonds, and the fourth zzso zzso zzso of the zzso active site motif zzso is located far from the active zzso These zzso bonds were shown to contribute to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was identified as the fourth active site zzso The structure of the zzso without the zzso also highly resembles that of zzso However, the arrangement of the zzso relative to the zzso greatly varies for these proteins because of the difference in the zzso size between the zzso The zzso of zzso is relatively long and flexible, while that of zzso is short and assumes a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its derivatives without the zzso or zzso or with a zzso in the zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso is important for zzso zzso and uses the flat surface of the zzso for zzso zzso However, this surface is located far from the active site and on the opposite side to the active zzso We propose that the zzso of zzso is required for initial contact with the zzso The resulting complex may be rearranged such that only the zzso forms a complex with the zzso
