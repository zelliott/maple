To investigate the mechanism of action of the zzso zzso fusion zzso on zzso infection, we studied its influence on virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso preparations on the synthesis of viral zzso in zzso cell cultures was determined by zzso capture zzso and the zzso of zzso DNA synthesis was detected by zzso with a zzso zzso probe after zzso zzso Fusion peptides inhibited zzso zzso formation and zzso production in zzso infected cells, and this effect was increased in zzso with bovine serum zzso or with synthetic zzso zzso by its zzso The association of zzso with carrier by zzso or with zzso zzso or gelatin completely abolished its effect on zzso zzso No zzso preparations influenced zzso chronically infected zzso Because zzso preparations blocked the zzso DNA synthesis 2 zzso after infection without influencing virus zzso and reverse transcription, we concluded that the block of infection occurred during the penetration of zzso through the cell zzso On the basis of results obtained we propose that our zzso preparations could be used for zzso zzso The possibility of the existence of receptors for zzso zzso region on target cell membrane is zzso
