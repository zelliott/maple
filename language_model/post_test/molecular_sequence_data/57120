zzso is a heavily zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso highly and specifically expressed by mouse tissue zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso zzso We have isolated zzso clones zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso library by transient expression in zzso cells and panning with the zzso zzso zzso zzso A single zzso zzso transcript was detected in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence predicts a type I integral membrane protein of zzso zzso with a heavily zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso containing nine potential zzso zzso sites and numerous potential zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain consists of two distinct regions, separated by an extended 12 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain of 89 zzso containing short zzso repeats and consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a membrane zzso domain of 170 zzso which has significant sequence zzso to a family of zzso associated zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso Both proteins are zzso expressed by zzso and share the same zzso structure having a zzso domain and a domain common to the lamp zzso zzso and zzso are the first examples of a lamp family protein with a restricted zzso zzso They may have evolved from the lamps to carry out specialized functions in dedicated zzso zzso
