zzso to a stainless steel surface selected zzso of zzso zzso with enhanced surface colonization abilities and a change in zzso from the common smooth colony zzso to a succession of rough colony zzso Growth in broth culture of the zzso zzso rough colony zzso gave a smooth colony zzso Comparative analysis revealed that the smooth and rough zzso had similar zzso and zzso characteristics zzso identical growth rates and zzso to antibiotics and environmental zzso zzso colony zzso however, failed to coordinate zzso or induce zzso The zzso in zzso of rough colony zzso which involved impaired cellular zzso of several zzso zzso including cell wall zzso A zzso suggested a link to a zzso zzso zzso The genetic basis for the impairment was studied at the level of the accessory zzso zzso component zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso gene in smooth and rough colony zzso found no zzso in the coding or promoter zzso Analysis of zzso expression with an integrated zzso tag construct found the protein to be zzso in the rough and zzso backgrounds compared to the parental smooth colony zzso A zzso mechanism involving the zzso zzso zzso components is zzso to control smooth to rough zzso of zzso zzso Such zzso variation may enhance the ability of this opportunistic pathogen to colonize environments as diverse as processing surfaces, food products, and animal zzso
