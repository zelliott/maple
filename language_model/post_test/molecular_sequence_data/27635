This paper describes a novel mechanism for zzso of nonsense zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso This zzso deletion of the nonsense zzso was discovered in the course of selecting for zzso zzso of zzso and for zzso active zzso zzso alpha chain zzso of zzso and zzso Each type of zzso zzso was cloned and its DNA sequence zzso zzso gave rise to two previously unidentified types of zzso zzso The first type was expected, namely zzso the result of a base substitution zzso The other type, representing approximately zzso of the zzso zzso was unexpected on the basis of single base zzso and an understanding of which zzso acids are functional at alpha chain position zzso It was found to be the result of a 21 zzso deletion of a region containing zzso zzso The zzso zzso of both position 234 nonsense zzso occurred at a frequency of approximately 2 per zzso viable zzso They were identical in that they both resulted from a 3 zzso zzso namely deletion of the zzso zzso at position zzso One of them, however, also displayed an A instead of the normal G in the third position of zzso zzso The zzso were characterized according to growth in different media and zzso zzso zzso performed on crude zzso These types of zzso should prove interesting and important for the zzso of alpha chain zzso zzso for insight into the assembly and interaction of zzso in this model zzso complex, and for the study of mechanisms by which deletions can be zzso
