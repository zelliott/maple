There are currently at least nine distinct zzso sequence families which are all known to adopt a TIM barrel fold zzso and zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso To explore the relationships between these zzso and their evolution, comprehensive sequence and structure comparisons were performed, generating four distinct zzso The first zzso S1, comprises the zzso related zzso all with the retention mechanism zzso The second zzso zzso included two functional subgroups, one composed of various kinds of zzso all with the retention mechanism zzso (the so-called zzso zzso and the other zzso including the zzso with the inversion mechanism zzso zzso The third zzso zzso with the retention mechanism zzso could be zzso based on the zzso zzso and mechanisms, into two functional zzso the zzso group, zzso by two zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso group, using two zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso for zzso The fourth zzso zzso is composed of zzso with the retention mechanism zzso zzso These clusters are compared with the sequence families derived by zzso and zzso zzso profiles and zzso of zzso structures suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso as are zzso and zzso which have zzso zzso This work highlights the difficulties of untangling distant evolutionary relationships in ubiquitous folds such as the TIM zzso
