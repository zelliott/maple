We obtained a partial sequence of mouse zzso zzso from zzso zzso and designed zzso zzso to cleave positions within zzso With a view to zzso zzso zzso for eliminating the zzso in zzso we varied the length and sequence of the three duplex zzso and measured the zzso of long zzso zzso in zzso at 37 degrees C (as well as 50 degrees zzso zzso zzso occurred, but it could only go to completion with a large excess of zzso The evidence suggests that the zzso step with a large target is not the zzso but the formation of the active zzso zzso zzso The efficiency varied unpredictably according to the target site, the length of the zzso zzso and the length of the zzso secondary structure in zzso may be zzso We particularly investigated the degree of zzso Some zzso could be zzso but zzso of the total zzso with the zzso to less than 14 zzso drastically reduced activity, zzso that interaction with zzso zzso is unlikely to be a serious problem in zzso These results suggest that specific and complete zzso of a zzso in zzso should be possible, given high-level expression of a zzso against a zzso target zzso
