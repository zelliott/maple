Previous studies characterized zzso differences between zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1989, zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso In the present study, zzso for zzso from zzso borealis and zzso zzso (American zzso were cloned and zzso in order to gain molecular insight into the structure, function, and species variation of zzso and the zzso zinc zzso zzso borealis and zzso zzso zzso have 339 and 335 zzso acids respectively, 5 and 9 fewer than zzso zzso zzso zzso borealis zzso exhibited zzso sequence zzso (55 zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso zzso This sequence variation is not zzso the zzso halves of these zzso contain substantially more zzso changes than the zzso zzso In particular, the zzso region of zzso zzso region forming strong DNA zzso is the most zzso and the zzso tail zzso region involved in zzso zzso the most zzso zzso analyses of these sequences revealed zinc finger zzso in the zzso halves, extreme zzso in the zzso halves, and a different zzso tail zzso for zzso zzso zzso Although considerable sequence variation exists in these zzso zinc fingers, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are strictly zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso conservation of only the zzso motif is observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso zinc fingers in zzso are much less zzso than zzso fingers in zzso zzso factor zzso 1) and also less zzso than zzso box zzso in zzso zzso The collective evidence indicates that zzso evolved from a common precursor containing up to 12 finger zzso which subsequently evolved at different zzso
