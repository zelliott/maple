The zzso system, consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been well established to be critical for the zzso regulation of protein function and zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we generated zzso cells that zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited severe defects in zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso cells formed very tiny plaques on a bacterial lawn and had a lower rate of bacterial zzso When developed in the dark, zzso cells exhibited a slugger zzso defined by a prolonged zzso zzso zzso Like other slugger zzso they were hypersensitive to zzso which has been known to inhibit culmination by raising the pH of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso cells showed defective zzso of zzso compartments and decreased activity of zzso zzso which functions in the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso studies revealed that the zzso system can directly reduce the zzso zzso of zzso zzso whose activity is regulated by zzso zzso bond zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso may be essential for growth and play a role in regulation of zzso and zzso possibly through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
