zzso of human or zzso cells with zzso leukemia viruses rapidly increases the expression of a number of genes that belong to the zzso zzso and are involved in zzso zzso including the class I major zzso complex zzso We have reported recently that the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso zzso leukemia virus encodes a trans zzso which zzso zzso and expression of class I major zzso complex genes and certain zzso zzso The portion of the zzso responsible for trans zzso was mapped by deletions to lie within the zzso zzso We demonstrate here that a transcript is initiated within the zzso region and that its presence zzso with the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso region reveals a potential internal promoter element for zzso zzso III zzso within the zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso suggest that this zzso transcript, designated let zzso trans zzso is a product of zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms zzso zzso leukemia viruses cause zzso zzso after a long zzso period have been extensively studied but are only partially zzso The region of the zzso identified here as being important in trans zzso has recently been shown to be a critical zzso of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso leukemia zzso These findings suggest a novel mechanism of zzso zzso of cellular gene zzso potentially contributing to zzso
