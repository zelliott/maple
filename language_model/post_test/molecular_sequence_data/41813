A zzso compound zzso is known to improve the cognitive function in Alzheimer's zzso The possible mechanism of action of zzso and structurally related zzso compounds was studied on the zzso zzso content of bacterial zzso rat brain zzso and some tissue zzso in model zzso zzso orange and zzso zzso zzso derivatives lowered zzso and zzso binding and membrane polarization in the simplest biological membrane zzso zzso as revealed by reactor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso orange partially saturated zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso to zzso A zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso acid, zzso zzso orange but other tissue zzso zzso and zzso B, were less sensitive to these zzso zzso is an zzso splitting zzso a zzso zzso The zzso complex forming ability and electron donor capacity of the compounds may play a role in the biological effects zzso It is assumed that compounds which do not zzso zzso zzso in zzso may exert an zzso effect on zzso and that zzso zzso may be promising for the treatment of degenerative brain zzso
