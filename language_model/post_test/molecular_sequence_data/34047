zzso is a global zzso regulator that is known to control, directly or zzso expression of more than 100 genes and zzso in zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso analysis and zzso I zzso experiments, we identified two zzso zzso sites that contribute to repression of the zzso gene and appear to act zzso One of these sites, located zzso downstream of the zzso start site, accounted for the bulk of zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso experiments, we demonstrated that in the presence of zzso a zzso zzso transcript that zzso at the downstream zzso site was zzso Thus, zzso binding to the downstream site zzso zzso by a roadblock zzso Similar premature termination of zzso was observed for zzso and zzso two other zzso genes with binding sites downstream of the zzso In zzso with the roadblock zzso zzso repression at downstream sites was partly relieved if the zzso zzso factor zzso was zzso
