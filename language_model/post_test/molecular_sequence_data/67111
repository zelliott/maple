zzso associates with zzso zzso channels zzso in zzso zzso We examined the role of the zzso scaffolding domain zzso in regulating the zzso zzso transient zzso potential zzso zzso in human pulmonary artery zzso cells zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which competes for protein binding partners with zzso to assess the interactions of zzso with zzso and its consequences on zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso influx via zzso in zzso in contrast to control zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso indicated strong binding of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso studies demonstrated an interaction between zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso zzso acid sequence revealed the presence of zzso binding consensus sequence in the zzso C zzso We also observed that an zzso zzso containing the zzso binding sequence markedly reduced the zzso zzso zzso We identified the interaction between zzso zzso C zzso zzso and zzso Thus, these results demonstrate a crucial role of zzso scaffolding domain interaction with zzso in regulating zzso influx via zzso
