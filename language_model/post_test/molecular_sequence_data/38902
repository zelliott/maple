An zzso zzso zzso clone zzso a novel 110 zzso acid zzso protein has been zzso The in zzso zzso protein is taken up by intact zzso inserted into the zzso membrane and the transit zzso is zzso off during this zzso The mature protein is predicted to contain 69 zzso zzso to form one zzso zzso and to have its zzso at the zzso side of the zzso zzso The protein showed similarity to the zzso zzso and zzso proteins of higher plants, but more pronounced to the zzso proteins zzso of zzso and red algae, to which no zzso previously has been detected in higher zzso As for zzso and zzso high light increases the zzso levels of the corresponding zzso zzso comparisons indicate that the protein may bind zzso and form zzso in the zzso zzso The level of expression of the protein seems to be far lower than that of normal zzso and zzso zzso
