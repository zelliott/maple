zzso acid zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso of a variety of toxic zzso zzso zzso offer potential for decontamination of zzso nerve agents and zzso The gene zzso zzso an zzso was cloned from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso DNA zzso contained the zzso gene zzso zzso and its zzso zzso We report structural and functional similarity of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso that zzso zzso with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These results corroborate the earlier conclusion that the zzso is a type of zzso zzso and that zzso could be the native zzso for such an zzso in zzso zzso
