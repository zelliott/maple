Human zzso is known as a zzso regulator, and zzso is considered as a potential zzso target of zzso 

The aim of the study was to clarify the relationship between zzso and zzso expressions in human zzso and to explore the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso 

A prospective experimental study was conducted at a zzso medical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expressions, as well as zzso numbers in the zzso of 32 zzso men were zzso The interaction between zzso protein and zzso zzso was assessed in in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso expressions, relationships between expression profiles, zzso zzso binding site for zzso and the effects of zzso on zzso zzso stability and zzso were zzso 

The protein expressions of zzso and zzso are significantly decreased in patients with zzso failure, with the lowest levels detected in patients with zzso zzso Both protein expressions are significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso profiling analysis among zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein suggests a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso specifically binds to a zzso region of the zzso zzso and this region is zzso zzso A zzso region within this zzso sequence is crucial for zzso zzso stimulates zzso translation, and this effect does not involve zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso is subject to zzso control by zzso which is an zzso zzso zzso A decreased zzso expression caused by lack or decrease of zzso may be associated with male zzso
