zzso is unique in the zzso family due to its zzso zzso However, either the zzso process or the precursors involved are largely zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso medium substantially increases the production of zzso with little effect on the growth of zzso indicating that zzso and/or zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso The zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso specifically and efficiently incorporated into the only zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso We noticed that the in zzso concentration of zzso zzso increased in parallel with the addition of zzso while the addition of zzso in the zzso medium significantly decreased the productivity of zzso zzso the zzso donor function of zzso is proposed to be involved in the zzso cycle but zzso itself was proposed to inhibit the zzso and zzso transfer processes a previously reported for the case of zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeled zzso indicated that zzso may also act as a limiting precursor contributing to the zzso zzso of zzso
