zzso zzso package full-length zzso zzso over spliced viral zzso For most zzso this preference is likely due to the absence of all or part of the packaging signal on zzso zzso In avian zzso virus, however, we have shown that the minimal packaging zzso zzso is located upstream of the zzso zzso site and therefore is present on both zzso and spliced zzso We now show that an zzso zzso zzso is packaged only zzso less efficiently than zzso zzso zzso virus zzso Thus, few additional packaging sequences and/or structures exist outside of zzso In contrast, we found that zzso zzso is not efficiently zzso These results indicate that either zzso is not functional on this zzso or the zzso is somehow zzso from the packaging zzso Finally, deletion of sequences from the 3' end of zzso was found to reduce the packaging efficiency of zzso zzso
