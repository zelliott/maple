The copper zzso for zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a protein that is believed to deliver copper zzso specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins from different organisms share high sequence zzso and consist of three distinct zzso a zzso central domain 2 flanked by zzso 1 and 3, which contain putative zzso zzso We report deduced protein sequences from tomato and zzso the first functional zzso of zzso identified in zzso We have zzso zzso human zzso and tomato zzso copper zzso zzso as well as a truncated version of zzso containing only zzso 2 and zzso Their zzso binding properties in the presence and absence of zzso were characterized by zzso and circular zzso zzso and it was shown that zzso has the ability to bind two zzso distinct zzso zzso whereas zzso binds only zzso The zzso binding site that is common to both zzso and zzso displayed zzso characteristics of zzso bound to four or three zzso zzso There are only four zzso zzso in zzso two in domain 1 and two in domain 3; all four are zzso in other zzso sequences including zzso Thus, an interaction between domain 1 and domain 3 is concluded, and it may be important in the copper zzso mechanism of these zzso
