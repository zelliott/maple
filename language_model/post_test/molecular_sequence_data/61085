The crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso zzso is a membrane bound zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso to zzso the process of zzso and hence has been implicated in zzso breast zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppresses zzso activity in a dose dependent zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the space group zzso with a unit cell of zzso zzso A, b zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure consists of a light and a heavy chain in the zzso unit, each characterized by the zzso zzso beta barrel folding seen in all zzso zzso The average elbow angle between the two zzso is 143 zzso Modeling of the interactions between the variable zzso of the zzso and a known model of zzso maps the zzso to a region of the zzso that is consistent with the available zzso data and the zzso function of the zzso The zzso mapping result is further supported by the inability of zzso zzso to suppress the activity of, or to interact with zzso zzso zzso which is zzso identical zzso zzso to human zzso but has a few key zzso in the putative zzso zzso
