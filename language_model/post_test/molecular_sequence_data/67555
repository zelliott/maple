In this study, we introduce a zzso sequence typing zzso zzso comprised of seven zzso zzso zzso to genetically characterize zzso zzso zzso historical and recent zzso of zzso zzso were sampled from the American Type Culture Collection and female patients at area health care facilities, respectively, to assess the usefulness of this typing zzso zzso zzso zzso sites, 51 different zzso and 60 sequence types were distinguished among the 68 zzso revealing a diverse zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso zzso scheme retains the ability to identify zzso linked zzso such as those collected from sexual zzso zzso genetic and zzso analyses determined that zzso zzso population structure is strongly influenced by zzso and is composed of two separate populations that may be zzso zzso is useful for investigating the zzso genetic diversity, and population structure of zzso zzso
