The linear sequence of zzso acids contains all the necessary information for a protein to fold into its unique three-dimensional zzso Native protein sequences are known to accomplish this by promoting the formation of stable, zzso accessible zzso Here we describe a Pro zzso in the center of the third zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator that promotes folding by a distinct zzso zzso the formation of a zzso zzso The zzso of this mechanism is supported by zzso zzso sequence zzso Furthermore, the results provide an explanation for the increased frequency of Pro zzso in zzso zzso zzso by nature of such zzso folding zzso aimed at preventing the formation of zzso structures, represents an additional mechanism by which folding information is zzso within the evolved sequences of zzso
