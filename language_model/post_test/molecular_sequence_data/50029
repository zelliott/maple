The Arc zzso of zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso position that serves a structural role as the zzso zzso of zzso B of zzso but also serves a functional role because its side chain is packed close to the zzso DNA backbone in the zzso zzso The tolerance of this zzso position to zzso zzso was zzso by determining the zzso activity in zzso the zzso stability and the zzso activity in zzso of a set of 13 zzso zzso The stability of zzso Arc zzso except for zzso correlated well with the zzso observed for the corresponding zzso at zzso positions in zzso of other zzso zzso was quite stabilizing at the zzso zzso position in zzso but surprisingly was the least frequent zzso zzso in the protein zzso This latter finding may reflect a zzso of zzso zzso which makes them prone to chemical zzso In general, only Arc zzso with small, zzso zzso at position 32 were active in zzso or showed strong operator binding in zzso Based upon the results presented here, revised sequence alignments of the zzso and zzso zzso with Arc and other zzso proteins are zzso
