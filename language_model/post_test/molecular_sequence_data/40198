Previously we developed an zzso sequencing zzso zzso as an zzso sequencing platform for rapid and zzso analysis of zzso zzso The first generation zzso however, was not tiled with zzso for the zzso zzso region, a site frequently zzso in human zzso Here we report the development of a second-generation zzso zzso with zzso zzso to sequence the entire zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso contains redundant zzso of sequences for 500 of the most common zzso including zzso changes, zzso and zzso zzso results from 14 primary head and neck tumor zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso detected a larger number of zzso than the original zzso Multiple coding region zzso detected only in the second generation zzso but not the earlier chip version, were further confirmed with conventional zzso Moreover, 31 variations in zzso region were identified using zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated zzso zzso in the second generation zzso In seven head and neck cancer samples with matched zzso DNA, the zzso zzso detected at least one zzso zzso zzso in four zzso zzso These results indicate that the second generation zzso is a zzso platform for identification of zzso DNA zzso in primary zzso
