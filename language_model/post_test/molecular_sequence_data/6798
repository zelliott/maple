zzso is a zzso seminal fluid protein that plays a role in the zzso of zzso by the zzso female and has structural features of a zzso The zzso which has a region of sequence similarity to the zzso hormone of zzso is transferred to the zzso female during zzso zzso is processed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that the processing involves sequential zzso zzso and we map the position of these zzso Although zzso is not zzso in the male, its processing in the zzso female requires activities donated by the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso females is not zzso zzso of zzso in zzso females zzso to males with altered seminal fluid is dependent on the presence and amount of male accessory zzso zzso The need for molecular cooperation between the sexes for processing of zzso could restrict its activity to the zzso zzso
