zzso and zzso lineage differentiation and maturation are regulated via cooperation between zzso factor zzso and its essential zzso zzso zzso The interaction between these two zzso proteins is well studied in zzso and depends on the binding of zzso to the zzso zinc finger zzso of zzso We identified the human zzso gene on zzso zzso and found expression mainly in zzso cells and also in several other zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso protein that contained nine zinc fingers, highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence and the zzso capacity of the human and zzso finger 5 are however zzso zzso zzso binding studies demonstrated that zzso interacts with both zzso and zzso We and others have described patients with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso or zzso who suffer from zzso and zzso zzso We now show ex zzso that the interaction between zzso and zzso is indeed disturbed in zzso and zzso of those patients carrying zzso zzso zzso The identification of the human zzso gene will enable the genetic screening of patients with non zzso zzso and zzso
