Plants are attractive expression systems for zzso low-cost production of high-value zzso The zzso 2 gene zzso zzso an zzso from zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso The optimal temperature and pH of the zzso zzso were 50 zzso and zzso respectively when expressed in zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to produce zzso zzso in zzso The zzso gene was transferred into zzso by zzso zzso The transgenic status and zzso expression of the transformed zzso were confirmed by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was biologically active, with an expression level of up to zzso of total leaf soluble zzso In the leaves, the average zzso content was zzso zzso per g of leaf fresh weight in the transgenic zzso We found that the zzso might make possible the large-scale production of commercially important zzso zzso
