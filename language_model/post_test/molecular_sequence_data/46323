zzso are intervening sequences that are transcribed and translated with zzso host protein sequences and then zzso by protein zzso zzso zzso also contain a zzso zzso responsible for their genetic zzso The zzso zzso the most widespread among zzso occurs in important pathogens such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso we describe the zzso zzso zzso in two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis and experimental evidence suggest that the zzso zzso from zzso is zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species complex was demonstrated in a non-native protein context in zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso is located in a functionally essential nuclear zzso it can be considered a promising therapeutic target for zzso drugs, because zzso of zzso zzso should inhibit proliferation of zzso zzso
