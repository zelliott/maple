A large zzso zzso referred to as the zzso zzso was identified, zzso and mapped at 310 to 320 zzso on the linear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This is the first report that a zzso promoter rather than a zzso promoter is involved in the zzso of a major zzso zzso in zzso From these results in conjunction with results from a previous study zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso we have identified 26 genes in this zzso that are relevant to zzso and zzso zzso With few exceptions, the gene order and deduced gene products were most similar to those of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso extension analysis indicated that zzso initiated from a zzso zzso promoter immediately upstream of zzso this promoter mapped within the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that a single transcript of 21 zzso initiated at this promoter and extended through zzso and (with our previous zzso onto the putative zzso gene zzso The zzso promoter element had strong activity in both zzso coli and zzso zzso As expected, a zzso of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso factor did not affect the function of this zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso similar to those of zzso coli and other zzso Although zzso of zzso coli or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with the zzso zzso genes was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso genes can influence zzso synthesis in other species of zzso Finally, Western zzso analysis with zzso from infected humans and animals indicated a weak or zzso response to zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that these zzso are not favorable candidate zzso to be used in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
