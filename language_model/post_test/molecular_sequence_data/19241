The internal transcribed zzso zzso region zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso DNA zzso was amplified via the zzso method in zzso different zzso of zzso zzso using the common zzso of the ITS of zzso Around 800 zzso zzso fragments were obtained based on the zzso marker and the sequences of the zzso products were zzso Taking isolate USA as zzso the zzso tree was constructed by means of maximum zzso analysis, and the genetic evolution among zzso was zzso The results showed that there is a great difference between the base constitution of zzso and zzso among various zzso The zzso zzso are classified into three groups, and the zzso from the same region belong to the same group, which shows the variation in zzso
