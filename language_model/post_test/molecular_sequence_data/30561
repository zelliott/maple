zzso zzso is a zzso protein that has recently been shown to inhibit the replication of human zzso zzso We have isolated a gene zzso zzso and have determined its DNA zzso The data indicate that zzso is zzso as a zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso the first 23 zzso of which comprise a putative zzso signal zzso The last 19 zzso comprise a zzso extension that has not been reported to be associated with the mature protein and that may be processed in the zzso zzso or zzso apparatus of cells producing zzso The mature protein consists of 247 zzso zzso The sequence predicted by translation of the DNA sequence agrees with and confirms the primary sequence determined recently on the zzso The molecular clone for zzso will facilitate directed zzso analyses that may provide information on how this zzso and other zzso zzso zzso These studies may also lead to the development of therapeutic agents with altered activities and/or improved properties for in zzso zzso
