A recent zzso review of the zzso zzso suggested the existence of a cryptic species of zzso zzso zzso zzso To evaluate the geographical and zzso range of the Type 1 and Type 2 forms reported in that study, zzso b sequences were examined from zzso zzso Type 1 fish were found primarily south of Point zzso on reefs deeper than 100 zzso Type 2 fish were common zzso at sites zzso than 100 zzso zzso isolation between the two types was tested using nine zzso zzso Estimates of genetic divergence were made using the fixation index zzso and correspondence between zzso and zzso was tested by zzso population assignment and zzso plotting of individual zzso zzso analyses gave strong support for the presence of two distinct groups of zzso All fish with Type 1 zzso and fish with Type 2 zzso from zzso 100 m depth had zzso unique to their zzso zzso However, most zzso fish with Type 2 zzso from zzso 100 m depth assigned strongly to the Type 1 zzso zzso zzso comparisons between the two zzso groups revealed significant differences at three of the six examined zzso zzso in both zzso depth of zzso and zzso suggest these are separate zzso This observation along with evidence of depth segregation in many recent species pairs led us to zzso a zzso model for zzso zzso by which the loss or zzso of a zzso zzso migration can lead to the creation of reproductively isolated zzso
