Worldwide increasing resistance of zzso zzso to common zzso agents calls for the urgent identification of new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a potential screening target for the identification of such new zzso We have cloned zzso the zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso It encodes a zzso zzso protein with an unusual zzso extension but a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso model was generated on the basis of the recently zzso human zzso zzso It illustrates how the regions involved in the active site, in zzso binding zzso zzso binding zzso and in activity regulation are highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso Neither native nor zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were investigated in the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is present in similar amounts at all zzso the zzso protein is predominantly expressed at the early zzso zzso Once zzso zzso is rapidly transported to the zzso zzso where it associates with zzso zzso The zzso functions of zzso for the zzso remain to be zzso A series of zzso beta zzso were tested on both zzso and zzso zzso Remarkably these zzso show a partially divergent sensitivity to the compounds, suggesting that zzso selective compounds might be zzso
