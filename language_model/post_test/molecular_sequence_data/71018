zzso tubes mediate the long-distance transport of nutrients and signals between source and sink zzso of zzso To detect mobile zzso proteins that are zzso distributed in source and sink zzso of zzso zzso we used both one-dimensional gel zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso Both techniques revealed that zzso protein patterns depend on the sampling zzso whilst several proteins were consistently observed in all zzso samples studied others appeared to occur in a zzso zzso For a characterization and identification of distinct zzso zzso two approaches were zzso First, protein bands resolved by zzso were zzso from the zzso gel and the masses of the proteins were then determined by zzso zzso Second, proteins resolved by zzso were subjected to zzso degradation and the resulting peptides were analyzed by zzso zzso the masses of the zzso peptides were used for a database zzso By the latter approach, three mobile zzso compounds were identified as the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1992, The Plant Cell 4, zzso a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso None of the other zzso studied corresponded to any of the protein sequences present in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso analyses indicated that some of the mobile zzso proteins occur in a zzso modified form and that the extent of the modification depends upon the plant zzso
