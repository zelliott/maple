zzso characterization of zzso zzso viruses zzso is an important component of laboratory surveillance of zzso In this study, a zzso analysis was performed of the zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso isolated in the Russian Federation between 2003 and zzso Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso From 1999 through the first 6 months of 2003, the most prevalent zzso in the European part of Russia was zzso All zzso zzso viruses were closely related to each other (with overall sequence diversity of zzso suggesting the presence of a single endemic zzso zzso After 2003, viruses with closely related sequences within zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso were zzso During this time, there was a low level of indigenous transmission of zzso zzso and zzso zzso viruses were imported from zzso countries, which led to the identification of two lineages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was closely related to viruses isolated in Turkey, Kazakhstan, and zzso whereas lineage zzso was linked to a large outbreak in Ukraine in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated with sporadic cases and clusters of transmission linked to zzso zzso vaccination interrupted the transmission of the previous endemic lineage zzso in 2003 and of lineage zzso in 2005, although an zzso of susceptible individuals in the population allowed for prolonged circulation of lineage zzso These data on zzso zzso distribution, in conjunction with the zzso data for zzso show considerable progress in zzso control and suggest that regional elimination is zzso
