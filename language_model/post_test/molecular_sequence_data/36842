A machine learning program, zzso has been applied to two problems: zzso the prediction of protein secondary structure from sequence and zzso zzso a quantitative zzso relationship in drug zzso zzso takes as input observations and combines them with background knowledge of chemistry to yield rules expressed as zzso principles for zzso The secondary structure prediction was explored on the zzso class of zzso on an unrelated test set it yielded zzso zzso The rules from zzso defined patterns of zzso forming zzso The system studied for drug design was the activities of zzso zzso binding to zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso rules were a better model than standard zzso zzso More importantly, these rules described the chemical properties of the zzso site that were in broad agreement with the zzso zzso
