The zzso untranslated region of human zzso zzso is highly zzso including a 26 zzso sequence containing a tandem 12 zzso repeat of zzso which predates the evolutionary divergence between birds and zzso We show here that this 12 zzso sequence in zzso zzso is a specific binding site for small zzso 20 zzso zzso proteins of rat zzso Point zzso analysis identified two zzso zzso in this 12 zzso repeat which are essential for protein zzso The 12 zzso motif sequence was found in the zzso of at least 15 other genes and could be a common target site for these zzso zzso zzso
