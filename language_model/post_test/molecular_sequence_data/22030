Over the past 10 years, zzso zzso gene sequencing has contributed to the establishment of more than 45 novel species of zzso zzso and to the description of emerging zzso zzso zzso experience has indicated that this molecular tool zzso the diversity of this group and does not distinguish between all recognized zzso zzso In order to improve the recognition of emerging rapidly growing zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing has been zzso Our previous studies have shown that an zzso isolate is a member of a novel species if it exhibits zzso % sequence divergence in the zzso gene from the type strains of established zzso When applied to a collection of 59 clinical zzso zzso zzso gene sequencing revealed nine novel zzso zzso zzso whereas only two zzso zzso zzso were deemed to be novel by conventional zzso zzso gene sequence zzso A zzso approach, including zzso tests, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence analysis, DNA zzso content determination and zzso fatty acid composition analysis, supported the evidence that these nine zzso represent three novel zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were susceptible to most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was resistant to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only zzso zzso was resistant to zzso These data illustrate that zzso gene zzso identification is a powerful tool to characterize emerging zzso and zzso infections and provides valuable help in zzso zzso at both the zzso and zzso level, thus contributing to a faster and more efficient diagnosis and zzso zzso
