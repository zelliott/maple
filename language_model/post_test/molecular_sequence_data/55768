The zzso gene of zzso coli encodes a putative zzso zzso zzso factor that is considered to be the central regulator of gene expression in stationary zzso The gene product zzso zzso was zzso using the cloned zzso gene and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to recognize in zzso a number of typical zzso zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, were recognized exclusively or zzso by E zzso 70, whereas at least one, zzso was favored by E zzso zzso Thus zzso coli promoters can be classified into three groups: the first group is recognized by E zzso 70 and E zzso 38, but the second and third groups are recognized substantially by either E zzso 70 or E zzso 38 zzso In contrast to other minor zzso factors, zzso 38 shares a set of zzso acid sequences common among the principal zzso factors of zzso and is therefore a member of the zzso protein zzso The zzso level of zzso 38 was demonstrated to increase in zzso upon entry into stationary zzso These results together indicate that zzso 38 is a second principal zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso
