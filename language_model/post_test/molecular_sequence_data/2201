High cell density and cell cycle withdrawal stimulate the differentiation of zzso smooth zzso zzso The differentiation process is accompanied by extensive changes in cell shape and the increased expression of a variety of zzso proteins including the vascular smooth zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso map analyses described in this report now indicate that a second, zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso and that the induction of this zzso zzso occurs late in differentiation well after the observed zzso of vascular zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified in zzso on the basis of the unique zzso mobility of its zzso zzso zzso the distribution of zzso products that were obtained when the zzso zzso zzso was subjected to secondary zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of an additional zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso precursor of this novel zzso While expression of vascular zzso was zzso when zzso reached zzso a zzso zzso treatment with zzso medium was required to induce zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of total zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso to the skeletal zzso zzso This is the first report describing dual expression of smooth muscle and zzso muscle zzso in a zzso zzso cell zzso The results indicate the potential usefulness of the zzso cell line for studying relationships between divergent muscle zzso gene sequences and zzso and zzso controls during zzso
