zzso f 7 is the group 7 zzso from the dust zzso zzso zzso zzso to the major zzso zzso p 7 from zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind to zzso zzso and zzso was found to inhibit zzso binding to zzso zzso which is important for the zzso between zzso f 7 and zzso p zzso 

Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso f 7 that shows an zzso and curved zzso consisting of two zzso zzso zzso and the other zzso wrap around a long zzso zzso The overall fold of zzso f 7 is similar to zzso p 7 but key difference was found in the zzso loop zzso In zzso f 7, zzso and zzso are in close proximity to zzso explaining why zzso zzso binding to zzso and zzso can inhibit zzso binding to zzso Both zzso f 7 and zzso p 7 bind zzso to zzso B via a similar binding site that is formed by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso stability of zzso f 7 is significantly lower than that of zzso p 7, and the zzso of both zzso are highly depend on zzso 

zzso f 7 is zzso to zzso p 7 in terms of the zzso acid sequence and overall zzso structure but with significant differences in the region zzso to the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso f 7 provides a basis for studying the function and zzso of this group of zzso
