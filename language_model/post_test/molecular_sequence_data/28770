The major zzso genes of zzso zzso are zzso regulated by zzso a zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using an in zzso selection and amplification approach we identified two new zzso binding sites of the zzso zzso Both binding sites were characterized by zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso binding sites are located at the zzso prime or minute ends of two genes coding for predicted proteins with functions unrelated to those of zzso This suggests that zzso zzso zzso may regulate the expression of genes zzso proteins with diverse zzso zzso sequence alignment of zzso sites highlights zzso zzso extending outside the previously proposed consensus binding sequence with structural features predicting geometry of zzso binding as an zzso
