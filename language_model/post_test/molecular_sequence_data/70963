To examine the zzso mechanism by which zzso exerts its essential positive function on certain signal zzso zzso we characterized the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso function and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while enforcing zzso interactions with these zzso zzso also reduced the amount of free zzso present in cell zzso inhibited zzso ability to bind zzso and induced resistance to zzso at a specific region within the zzso domain of zzso In contrast, the zzso inhibitor zzso prevented zzso from assuming natural or zzso zzso that allow zzso interactions with zzso When these compounds were applied zzso the order of addition determined the effects observed, indicating that these agents had opposing effects on zzso We conclude that a specific region within the zzso domain of zzso (near zzso zzso determines the mode by which zzso interacts with zzso and that the ability of zzso to cycle between alternative modes of interaction is obligatory for zzso zzso
