zzso The effects of zzso zzso E1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were investigated on the expression of tissue factor and zzso activities on the surface of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease of zzso tissue factor zzso zzso Similar zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhanced significantly zzso zzso activity and reversed the decrease of this activity caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased tissue factor activity and enhanced the effect of zzso on tissue factor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso tissue factor zzso and increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change the zzso zzso level after 2 h of incubation with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M to zzso zzso did not influence tissue factor or zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels may participate in the regulation of tissue factor and zzso zzso thus contributing to promote or restore zzso properties of the zzso
