zzso is a central zzso of zzso signaling in embryonic and stem cell development and in zzso Here, through a mass zzso analysis of a zzso protein complex, we identified 12 proteins as putative zzso zzso We show that one of them, zzso enhances zzso zzso by maintaining a high level of zzso protein in the zzso More importantly, zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the survival zzso zzso and zzso with activated zzso in zzso stem zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso binding and stabilization of zzso and these interactions may be involved in stem cell zzso
