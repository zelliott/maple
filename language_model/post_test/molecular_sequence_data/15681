In the present study, the first molecular genetic investigation of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso New zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified and characterized in zzso It was demonstrated that zzso of this locus differed in the size and structure of zzso zzso as well as in point zzso the combinations of which enabled the isolation of zzso fixed double zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and 4) and zzso zzso 1, 3, 5, and zzso Double zzso zzso described were also identified in the zzso zzso of the parental species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on the analysis of zzso distribution pattern at this locus in all populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso model was elaborated and zzso Using this model, zzso of zzso zzso for all populations of the species of interest were calculated and population genetic structure of zzso zzso was zzso zzso contribution of each population to the species gene pool was zzso The data obtained demonstrated that zzso variation was one of the factors of zzso and genetic diversity of a zzso
