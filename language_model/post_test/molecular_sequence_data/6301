We have analyzed the molecular mechanism of regulation of the zzso zzso transport system in zzso coli zzso by studying the zzso of the regulatory and structural genes under various environmental conditions, and by determining the location of their zzso start points and promoter zzso We report here that the main species observed in Northern zzso analyses were a zzso zzso zzso by the outer membrane protein zzso gene zzso and a zzso zzso zzso by a region including the zzso zzso The synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso is regulated by both zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso is dependent on the presence of zzso The promoter region for the zzso zzso a likely site of action for zzso is not related to the consensus promoter region for zzso 70 zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, it shows greatest similarity with promoters of genes regulated by a new zzso of zzso factors, zzso the zzso function zzso zzso factors, which are associated with the expression of genes involved in zzso functions, suggesting that zzso may act as a specialized zzso zzso We also show that the zzso transport genes are linked in zzso fashion to zzso Since the levels of the zzso zzso are extremely low, as compared to the level of zzso zzso it is likely that processing from the 3' end must occur and stop near the end of zzso where a hairpin structure is zzso
