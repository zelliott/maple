The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso starch branching zzso zzso is seed specific, with expression in both the zzso and the zzso In comparison, expression of barley zzso is confined to the zzso whereas that of barley zzso occurs in zzso embryonic and zzso zzso It has been suggested that the second zzso of barley zzso may be instrumental in zzso zzso zzso zzso to further investigate the regulatory mechanisms of barley and zzso zzso we examined the zzso activity of the zzso zzso promoter in transient zzso of green fluorescent protein zzso reporter zzso We found that, when linked to the barley zzso second zzso the zzso zzso promoter could not drive zzso zzso in zzso or barley embryonic zzso Similar results were obtained for the barley zzso zzso Database searches showed that sequences zzso to the barley zzso zzso also exist in zzso and zzso regions of some other grass zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter identified the minimal promoters required for zzso and low-level zzso respectively, but did not reveal any putative promoter elements crucial for zzso A sequence with similarity to the zzso element, implicated in sugar zzso was located in the zzso promoter region of zzso zzso upstream of the minimal zzso zzso elements are present in the zzso promoter regions of the zzso barley zzso zzso and barley zzso In keeping in line with these zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that expression of barley zzso was sugar zzso whereas that of zzso zzso was zzso
