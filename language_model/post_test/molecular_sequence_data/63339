The in zzso zzso procedure is a new random zzso method based on the use of zzso DNA zzso In the present study, this technique was applied on a 2 zzso gene zzso zzso an attractive zzso for the industrial synthesis of zzso zzso zzso were first introduced during a single replicating step performed by zzso zzso pol beta and pol zzso Three large libraries zzso independent zzso were generated (one with pol beta and two with pol zzso The sequence analysis of randomly chosen clones confirmed the potential of this strategy for the generation of zzso zzso generated by pol beta were zzso less zzso than those created with pol zzso indicating that our approach enables zzso rate control following the DNA zzso employed for zzso Moreover, pol beta and pol zzso provide different and complementary zzso zzso allowing a wider sequence space exploration than zzso zzso protocols employing zzso zzso Interestingly, some of the zzso generated by pol zzso displayed unusual zzso including combinations of base zzso and zzso deletions which are rarely generated using other zzso By taking advantage of the zzso bias of naturally highly zzso DNA zzso zzso thus appears as a very useful tool for gene and protein zzso
