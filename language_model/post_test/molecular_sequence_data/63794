zzso with zzso avian zzso zzso coli zzso cause significant economic losses in the poultry industry zzso In a previous study we applied zzso zzso zzso and identified 28 zzso genes in zzso strain zzso zzso : zzso : zzso One of them, zzso encodes a putative zzso regulator whose function and role in zzso are still zzso In the present study, this zzso has been zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso strain in zzso and infection of chickens with this zzso zzso led to strongly reduced bacterial loads in several zzso zzso studies showed that zzso of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso minimal zzso zzso the zzso zzso showed significantly reduced growth in zzso zzso Although the zzso could not be zzso a zzso deletion zzso showed zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso whereas deletion and zzso of the downstream gene zzso did not cause a growth zzso in zzso To identify zzso genes regulated by zzso one- and two-dimensional protein gel zzso was zzso The zzso analysis revealed that in the zzso zzso zzso the expression of several genes involved in iron zzso was zzso and some other genes were zzso The regulation of genes involved in iron zzso was shown to occur at the zzso level using real-time zzso Taking the results together, this functional analysis strongly suggests that zzso is a regulator involved in zzso of zzso by affecting iron zzso
