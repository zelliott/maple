zzso zzso is an zzso brain zzso with multiple effects on animal zzso However, there have been no studies on the zzso of this zzso In this report, we studied the zzso of zzso in zzso solution by conventional one-dimensional and two-dimensional zzso and zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso at 300 zzso A complete set of assignments for the resolved zzso and approximate assignments for the overlapping zzso were zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is in slow exchange between two zzso most likely determined by the zzso and trans states of the zzso zzso The minor zzso represents 30 zzso zzso of the population over the temperature range from 3 degrees to 73 zzso In the major zzso the zzso aromatic ring appears to be close enough to interact directly with the zzso zzso ring, as indicated by a strong temperature dependence of the zzso C beta zzso C delta H and C delta zzso chemical zzso In contrast, this interaction of the zzso and zzso rings is not present in the minor zzso
