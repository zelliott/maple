zzso zzso zzso plays a major role in the regulation of zzso Its zzso activity is controlled by the zzso zzso and by one or more zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso from cat and rabbit muscle are zzso We have determined the three-dimensional structure of the zzso type I zzso from zzso coli, in order to study the mechanism of zzso zzso 

The zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso type I zzso in the inactive zzso shows that each zzso of the zzso zzso comprises a zzso domain, a flexible zzso domain and a zzso zzso The zzso and active sites are located at the domain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coli zzso with the zzso muscle zzso which is thought to adopt a zzso similar to the active zzso reveals differences in the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso of each zzso which are rotated by 17 degrees and 15 degrees, zzso Moreover, the relative orientation of the four zzso differs by about 16 degrees in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso couple these movements to zzso changes in the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso observed in the zzso zzso induce a shift in loop 6 of the zzso domain, leading to a distortion of the zzso site accounting for the low zzso affinity of the zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso control of zzso is accomplished through remarkable domain and zzso zzso On transition from the zzso to the zzso all 12 zzso of the functional zzso modify their relative zzso These concerted motions are the molecular basis of the zzso between the active zzso and the zzso zzso
