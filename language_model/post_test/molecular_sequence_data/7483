To examine the possible role of zzso in zzso zzso migration in the retinal zzso zzso zzso of zzso we investigated the expression and distribution of zzso heavy chain zzso in zzso zzso of fish zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso displayed a prominent band at 120 zzso A third zzso zzso zzso recognized a band at 118 zzso The 118 zzso band was also occasionally present in blots zzso with zzso suggesting the presence of two zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso of zzso from zzso using zzso zzso to zzso regions of the zzso motor domain resulted in the identification of two putative zzso genes zzso and zzso based on partial zzso acid zzso Previous studies had demonstrated a requirement for zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso In addition, the reported zzso polarity orientation in zzso zzso projections is consistent with a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in isolated zzso cells using zzso revealed a zzso distribution over the entire cell body, with no zzso selective association with zzso zzso even in cells fixed while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso or zzso although each of the three zzso has been shown to block zzso function in other zzso Thus we found no evidence for zzso function in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the two zzso zzso may participate in other zzso processes in zzso
