zzso cloning techniques and V gene zzso display have zzso the production of human zzso zzso zzso of a defined specificity can be obtained by selecting zzso display libraries on zzso in a process known as zzso We have applied these techniques to the isolation of three zzso single chain variable domain fragments zzso from a patient zzso by blood zzso Analysis of specificity with cells of zzso zzso donors revealed the zzso zzso in addition to the major zzso with zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso binding to the zzso by the patients' zzso The heavy chain variable genes of all three were derived from the zzso gene zzso carry the hallmarks of zzso zzso and are most likely derived from zzso related B zzso The light chain variable zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso These data show that zzso display can be used to clone zzso zzso that zzso the native zzso from zzso zzso
