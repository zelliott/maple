zzso communication is an important factor in zzso units during zzso The zzso produces pivotal hormones and zzso for communication between zzso zzso and the maternal zzso Gene expression in bovine zzso throughout pregnancy was zzso screened by a zzso zzso and we searched for a common zzso factor in a gene cluster that showed increasing expression throughout gestation in zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso were collected from Day 25 to Day 250 of gestation for zzso zzso Global gene expression profiles were analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso A consensus sequence zzso that may control zzso genes in a characteristic cluster was examined in zzso The quantitative expression and zzso of a specific zzso factor were investigated in each tissue using quantitative real-time zzso and in zzso zzso 

The zzso expression profiles were classified into ten zzso The genes with most markedly increased expression became concentrated in cluster 2 as gestation zzso zzso 2 included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family zzso zzso member 1 zzso which were mainly detected in giant zzso zzso cells zzso Consensus sequence analysis identified zzso factor zzso binding sites in some genes in this zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis confirmed that high level expression of zzso factor zzso alpha zzso was common to cluster 2 genes during zzso In contrast, the expression level of another zzso family zzso zzso factor zzso beta zzso was extremely low over the same zzso Another gene of the family, zzso factor zzso gamma zzso was expressed at medium level compared with zzso and zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were localized in zzso cells but were expressed by different zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso cells including zzso zzso was specifically expressed in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

We detected zzso gene expression profiles in bovine zzso using a combination of zzso and in zzso zzso In zzso analysis indicated that the zzso family may be a consensus regulator for the gene cluster that characteristically appears in bovine zzso as gestation zzso In particular, zzso and zzso may be involved in regulating zzso zzso genes such as zzso some zzso or zzso These results suggest that the zzso family is a specific zzso factor for clusters of crucial zzso zzso This is the first evidence that zzso may regulate the differentiation and specific functions of zzso in bovine zzso
