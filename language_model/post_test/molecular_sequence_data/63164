zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as a zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the prevalence and variations of the zzso gene among 108 zzso zzso zzso from diseased and healthy zzso and human zzso zzso screening and sequencing analysis showed that besides the zzso gene reported already zzso type 1), there were three zzso zzso of zzso zzso types 2 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were expected to zzso functional zzso and zzso extracts of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso horse zzso Culture zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso also showed strong serum zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was interrupted by a point zzso and zzso zzso was disrupted by either zzso of an IS element or genetic zzso and therefore the zzso extracts and culture zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not show serum zzso zzso Regardless of their origins, approximately 30 % of the zzso possessed functional zzso although zzso zzso was found only in three zzso from healthy zzso zzso sequence typing analysis showed that most of the zzso with zzso zzso belonged to the sequence type zzso complex, and most of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonged to the zzso zzso The zzso with zzso zzso were not assigned to a major ST zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of a limited number of zzso zzso zzso zzso those of the zzso complex type, whereas other zzso zzso may not possess this category of zzso zzso the importance of zzso zzso is zzso
