zzso is considered to be one of the more zzso crop species, producing zzso such as the potent zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso likely accounts for much of the zzso of zzso zzso typically representing the zzso constituent of zzso zzso root zzso Previous and ongoing studies suggest that the zzso zzso for this plant growth inhibitor occurs in root hair cells, involving a zzso zzso activity that zzso an zzso zzso fatty zzso starter unit, resulting in the formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso modifications of this zzso intermediate are likely to be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso although the precise sequence of reactions has not been determined zzso zzso performed by gas zzso zzso with zzso root extracts identified a zzso zzso zzso of the likely zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso of the zzso ring is preceded by zzso at the zzso by a novel zzso zzso zzso An expressed sequence tag data set consisting of zzso sequences selected at random from an zzso zzso root zzso zzso library was generated to identify candidate sequences potentially zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso real time reverse zzso and zzso zzso studies with putative zzso sequences obtained from the expressed sequence tag data set have led to the identification of a novel zzso highly and predominantly expressed in root hairs zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso among a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore proposed to be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso
