zzso zzso members of the type III zzso group, were recently identified in several zzso Although zzso have the potential to be zzso as zzso and zzso agents in veterinary medicine, the biological properties of zzso have not yet been studied in companion zzso In this study, we analyzed the expression of canine zzso and their zzso produced a zzso canine zzso zzso and investigated its zzso and zzso activities using a canine kidney zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso cells were found to express type III zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was induced faster than zzso by stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli inhibited zzso plaque formation by influenza A virus infection, and induced the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells zzso These effects were observed in a zzso zzso These results indicate that canine zzso has zzso effect, and suggest the potential zzso of canine zzso as a therapeutic zzso
