Sister zzso cohesion is resolved at zzso onset when zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex that is responsible for holding sister zzso zzso This mechanism to initiate zzso is zzso in zzso from budding zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizes and zzso two zzso zzso motifs within zzso In addition, zzso zzso a similar motif in the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso may cleave further zzso proteins to orchestrate multiple cellular events that take place during zzso To investigate zzso recognition by budding zzso zzso we analyzed the sequence requirements at one of the zzso zzso site motifs by systematic zzso We derived a zzso site consensus motif zzso This motif is found in zzso of zzso predicted zzso zzso We analyzed 28 candidate proteins containing this motif as well as 35 proteins that contain a core zzso zzso We could so far not confirm new zzso zzso but we have uncovered other forms of zzso regulation of some of the zzso We studied whether zzso other than the zzso site motif mediate zzso zzso When the zzso active site was occupied with a zzso inhibitor covering the zzso site zzso zzso still efficiently zzso with its zzso zzso This suggests that zzso recognizes both a zzso site consensus sequence as well as features outside the zzso zzso
