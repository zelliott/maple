The zzso of zzso zzso convert zzso cellulose solely into zzso in contrast with bacterial zzso which produce zzso Previously, a zzso was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso analysis, which represented zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso To identify the component in the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso activity, zzso with zzso zzso was used to isolate the corresponding zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso The clone zzso an zzso protein containing a zzso family 3 zzso zzso domain zzso and was therefore named zzso The zzso end of the zzso zzso protein consisted of an auxiliary domain and three zzso zzso typical for zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain was expressed in zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso analyses of the zzso protein showed that the zzso zzso domain was specific for zzso bonds and functioned as an zzso on soluble zzso as well as zzso zzso of the apparent K zzso and K zzso values of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso for p zzso and zzso respectively indicated that zzso encodes the zzso activity of the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso
