We have identified a 13 zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso immediately downstream of a protein zzso to zzso coli zzso a protein taking part in the bacterial signal recognition particle zzso zzso The same zzso of the zzso and zzso genes occurs in zzso zzso zzso analysis of different mycoplasma strains revealed the same zzso in strains belonging to the zzso zzso cluster of the mycoplasma zzso zzso zzso in sequence databases identified zzso to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In these bacteria the zzso protein is zzso by the same zzso as a protein zzso to the 54 zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggest that there is a functional relationship between the zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso proteins strongly suggest that they have a zzso zzso zzso indicating that they are gene regulatory zzso
