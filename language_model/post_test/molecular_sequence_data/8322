The upstream region of the zzso gene from zzso zzso was screened for zzso sites using an zzso shift zzso A specific zzso interaction was detected within a zzso covering the region zzso to zzso relative to the zzso zzso start zzso The appearance of this protein and zzso zzso in culture extracts occurred at the same time point in zzso suggesting that the protein might be a zzso zzso The putative upstream zzso sequence was located more precisely using zzso zzso These indicated the involvement of the zzso motif zzso in the binding of the zzso
