In zzso there is a family of zzso protein zzso zzso containing novel zzso repeats in their zzso zzso Genes zzso many of these zzso zzso zzso are induced by pathogen infection, suggesting a possible role in plant defense zzso We have previously generated zzso plants expressing four zzso zzso genes zzso 6, 10 and zzso under control of a zzso promoter and found that induced expression of zzso but not the other three zzso zzso triggered hypersensitive zzso cell death in transgenic zzso In the present study, we have analyzed the structural relationship of the zzso family and identified three zzso zzso 19 and zzso that are structurally closely related to zzso Genes zzso these three zzso are all induced by salicylic acid and pathogen zzso Furthermore, induced expression of zzso 19 and 20 all activates rapid cell death in transgenic zzso Thus, the activity of inducing rapid cell death is shared by these structurally closely related zzso We have also performed zzso zzso screens and identified proteins that interact with the zzso zzso of zzso One of the identified zzso proteins is the zzso type zzso protein zzso known to interact with a number of other zzso through its zzso zzso zzso Other zzso proteins include a second protein with a zzso domain and another type zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso with these three proteins in zzso were demonstrated through zzso These zzso proteins may play roles in the regulation and signaling of zzso
