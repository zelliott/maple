A potentially important zzso characteristic of transforming growth zzso zzso is to inhibit zzso growth zzso zzso calcium rise zzso zzso Sharma, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Williamson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 210, zzso in zzso zzso zzso The present study examined the possible basis for this effect by evaluating the regulation of the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression by zzso with zzso and zzso effects after 8 and 2 zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso expression by 59% after 1 zzso zzso of the zzso was also demonstrated as early as 15 zzso after zzso zzso Back zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso cells with protein zzso A zzso indicated that zzso zzso of the zzso occurs at similar sites as for zzso In zzso zzso zzso using the known zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of both peptides zzso and zzso of control values, zzso zzso zzso was prevented by the addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso effects on the zzso may be an important characteristic of its ability to zzso the response of cells to factors that employ zzso calcium zzso
