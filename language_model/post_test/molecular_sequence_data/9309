The zzso zzso has been used as an effective food zzso to combat food-borne pathogens for over zzso Despite this successful use, zzso stability at zzso is zzso zzso we describe a zzso analog zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This analog termed zzso was obtained by zzso expression in zzso coli and subsequent zzso zzso zzso characterization demonstrated that zzso contains seven zzso zzso two more than the five zzso found in zzso and the most zzso found in any zzso to zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso was generally similar to that of zzso A, with increased activity against zzso zzso one of the zzso agents of bovine zzso zzso I demonstrated increased stability compared to zzso zzso In addition to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso also contains a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The corresponding compound was produced in zzso coli, and has a ring zzso different than that of any known zzso as determined by tandem mass zzso Interestingly, zzso only demonstrated zzso activity against zzso zzso Seven zzso strains were screened for production of the zzso using zzso zzso and five were shown to produce zzso but none produced zzso
