We previously reported that the defects in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell wall zzso are caused by a zzso in zzso a gene involved in zzso zzso anchor zzso Here we describe the effect of zzso on the zzso of cell wall zzso It was found that the release of precursors of cell wall proteins from the zzso zzso zzso was zzso This was accompanied by proliferation of zzso zzso The majority of the cell wall protein precursors that eventually left the zzso were not zzso incorporated into the cell wall but were zzso into the growth zzso Despite the inefficient incorporation of cell wall zzso there was no net effect on the protein level in the cell zzso It is zzso that the availability of zzso cell wall proteins determines the rate of cell wall construction and limits growth zzso
