A set of zzso precursors which contain the same leader sequences but different passenger proteins has been analyzed for the site of zzso zzso following import into zzso zzso Each precursor comprises the leader of zzso zzso zzso 9 of zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso 8 or 9 of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso containing the first five zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso between the leader and the zzso passenger protein were zzso at the natural site of the zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso without zzso sequences were zzso at novel zzso zzso occurred between the 3rd and 4th zzso of zzso zzso 8, but for zzso zzso 9, zzso occurred within the leader, 8 zzso upstream of the passenger zzso
