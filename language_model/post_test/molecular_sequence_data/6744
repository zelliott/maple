A zzso containing an open reading frame coding for a human zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was isolated from a male human kidney zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that, with few exceptions, this zzso was nearly identical to the published sequence for human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1987, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso indicated that: zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at comparable levels in the human liver and zzso compared to zzso zzso the steady state zzso of zzso zzso transcripts in the human kidney were substantially zzso The kidney zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso zzso expressed using a zzso insect cell system, and the zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and shown to metabolize zzso via zzso zzso with both proteins zzso almost exclusively, zzso products zzso and zzso of total products, zzso zzso turnover zzso and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso at 30 degrees C for zzso zzso and zzso zzso was inhibited by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was both zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso optical zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso was less zzso and zzso and generated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids (with optical zzso of 66, 69, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso acid 11, zzso with opposite zzso zzso Only for zzso zzso did the zzso of the products match that of the zzso present, in zzso in human kidney zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1990, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso is one of the human zzso zzso zzso responsible for the metabolism of zzso zzso acid zzso
