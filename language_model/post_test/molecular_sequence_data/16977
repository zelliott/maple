zzso in zzso proteins often lead to zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso essential zzso protein zzso Here, we show that a zzso core complex exists in zzso zzso and human zzso Nine zzso bind to human zzso two of these, zzso and zzso are authentic zzso zzso Four other human proteins of unknown function zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso complex components and are shown to be required for zzso segregation in zzso cells using zzso interference zzso Surprisingly, zzso also forms a stable complex with the zzso zzso components zzso and zzso Double zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may be the base to anchor the zzso core complex that is enriched with coiled coils and extends to outer zzso during zzso
