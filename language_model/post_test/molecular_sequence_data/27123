zzso zzso zzso zzso was proposed by Christensen and Cook in zzso however, this subspecies name has not been cited in the Approved zzso of zzso Names and therefore the nomenclature has not been zzso In our genetic approach to clarify the relationships of the designated type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso within the zzso zzso revealed that the strain was closely related to zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso The value for whole zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso or zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed relatively high DNA zzso the fatty acid profiles and some zzso characteristics were different, and we concluded that zzso zzso should be placed in a new zzso We therefore propose a new species with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso
