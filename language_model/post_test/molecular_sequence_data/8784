zzso forms of prion disease have been linked to zzso in the gene zzso zzso a zzso and zzso protein that is attached to the plasma membrane by a zzso zzso zzso One familial form of zzso disease is associated with a zzso zzso containing six additional zzso zzso We report here our analysis of cultured Chinese zzso zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso of this zzso zzso We find that, like zzso zzso the zzso protein is zzso zzso and expressed on the cell zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso of the zzso anchor using zzso zzso C fails to release the zzso zzso from the surface of intact cells, suggesting that it has an additional mode of membrane zzso The zzso protein is zzso since it partitions into the zzso phase of zzso zzso zzso and it is tightly zzso since it is not zzso in zzso buffer at pH zzso Whether membrane attachment of the zzso zzso involves integration of the zzso into the zzso zzso zzso or binding to other membrane proteins remains to be zzso Our results suggest that zzso in the membrane association of zzso may be an important feature of prion zzso
