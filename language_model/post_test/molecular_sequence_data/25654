zzso zzso beta was zzso as the zzso form from bovine zzso zzso and its active site was investigated by resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sample revealed that the zzso iron adopts the pure zzso zzso zzso state on the basis of the zzso 10 zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso mode zzso which are higher than those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso state, a zzso stretching mode was identified at zzso zzso on the basis of an zzso substitution zzso this frequency is very close to that of zzso zzso in the zzso state zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso sample at zzso K showed zzso zzso signals (at g zzso zzso zzso and zzso that were clearly distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso signals zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and confirmed previous assignments of zzso zzso signals in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso oxide zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso beta showed zzso signals with zzso symmetry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso very similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso complex in the presence of zzso and zzso at 77 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
