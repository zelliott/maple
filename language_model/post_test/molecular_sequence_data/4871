zzso cells contain a lot of mast zzso zzso We have reported that the expression of mouse mast cell zzso 6 zzso is remarkably reduced in both cultured mast cells zzso and skin mast cells of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we found that the expression of zzso was reduced in zzso but not in skin mast cells of zzso mice, and we compared the regulation mechanisms of zzso with those of zzso The zzso locus encodes a member of the zzso zzso zzso protein family of zzso factors zzso called zzso The consensus sequence recognized and bound by zzso zzso factors is zzso The zzso of the normal zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso the poor expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso Although zzso directly bound zzso motifs in the promoter region of the zzso gene and zzso it, the binding of zzso to the zzso motif in the promoter region of the zzso gene was not zzso The zzso appeared to regulate the zzso of the zzso gene zzso Moreover, addition of stem cell factor to the medium zzso the expression of the zzso but not of the zzso gene in zzso zzso Despite the significant reduction of both zzso and zzso expressions in zzso zzso their regulation mechanisms appeared to be zzso
