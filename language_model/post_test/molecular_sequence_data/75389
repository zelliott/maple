The zzso zzso protein structure is the zzso zzso zzso Recently a second motif for zzso zzso the zzso zzso emerged from sequence analysis of zzso a factor involved in the control of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The finger structure is based on pairs of zzso and His zzso which are arranged around a zzso zinc zzso This zzso allows the folding of zzso repeated zzso zzso which are thought to specify the contact with target zzso zzso fingers have been observed in the zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and man zzso zzso personal zzso and in several regulatory proteins of zzso including proteins zzso by members of the gap class of zzso zzso One of these, zzso zzso acts at the first level of the zzso gene zzso and its protein product may bind to zzso In addition, zzso is required for the development of the zzso zzso a zzso internal tissue that forms during later stages of zzso Here we show that a zzso which results in a conservative zzso exchange eliminates zzso zzso The change occurs in a key position within the putative core structure of a finger, and supports the role of zzso in metal binding as proposed by zzso and zzso
