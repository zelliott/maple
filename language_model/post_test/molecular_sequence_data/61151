zzso zzso strain zzso is a strictly zzso zzso zzso growing with zzso as the sole carbon and energy zzso zzso evidence and zzso of zzso activity in zzso extracts have suggested a zzso zzso for the conversion of zzso to zzso The zzso zzso is initiated by a zzso zzso system involving zzso I zzso and zzso II zzso which transfer the zzso group of zzso onto zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 96, zzso We report the zzso in zzso coli and the zzso to apparent zzso of zzso zzso This zzso zzso with a zzso molecular mass of 33 zzso zzso the conversion of zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso with a specific activity of 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The apparent kinetic zzso for zzso were: zzso zzso 240 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The reaction appeared to be first order with respect to zzso at zzso up to 2 zzso presumably reflecting the fact that zzso is an artificial substitute for the zzso zzso I, the natural zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso also present in zzso did not serve as a zzso group zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso II restored zzso zzso by a cell free extract of a strain zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso
