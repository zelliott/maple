The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso can generate functional zzso zzso receptors when expressed in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso express robustly in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso and show striking differences in the actions of a type I positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso are zzso by an increase in zzso only of the response to zzso zzso whereas type II zzso zzso in addition, changes in zzso of the zzso zzso The type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the type II zzso zzso are all active on human zzso but are without zzso activity on zzso where they zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso We used the published structure of zzso zzso to generate a model of zzso which was then zzso into the candidate zzso zzso binding site on zzso and zzso in an attempt to gain insights into the observed differences in zzso zzso The new pharmacological findings and zzso approaches being developed may inform the design of novel zzso drugs targeting major neurological zzso
