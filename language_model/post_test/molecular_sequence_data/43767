Ten zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso were shown to be required for zzso synthesis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso A common secondary folding motif for the zzso and zzso target segments predicts that site selection zzso zzso base pairing of the zzso with complementary zzso elements zzso the site of zzso and zzso identification of a zzso located at a zzso distance from the zzso zzso zzso The model is supported by zzso showing that: zzso reducing the zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation, and zzso altering the distance between the zzso box and target zzso causes an adjacent zzso to be zzso This discovery implies that most zzso function in targeting zzso modification in zzso zzso zzso for the box zzso zzso and zzso formation for the zzso zzso
