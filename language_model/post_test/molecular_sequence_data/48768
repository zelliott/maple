The origins and zzso of zzso zzso to its current worldwide distribution remains zzso Although progress on zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been achieved worldwide, information concerning New World zzso remains fragmented and largely zzso More information on the genetic diversity in Latin America zzso is needed to better explain current patterns of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso protein gene zzso was investigated using zzso chain reaction amplification and restriction zzso length zzso zzso and zzso sequencing in zzso from the Pacific Ocean coast of Mexico, zzso and zzso In conjunction with worldwide sequences retrieved from the zzso mismatch distribution analysis of central repeat region zzso frequency zzso of unique repeat types and zzso analysis of the 3' terminal region, were performed to obtain an zzso view of the genetic relationships between regional and worldwide zzso 

Four zzso zzso zzso zzso c and d were identified in Southern Mexico and three zzso zzso e and f in zzso The zzso sequences showed that Mexican zzso and all zzso zzso were similar to other American zzso In contrast, zzso c and d were less zzso had a domain zzso in their zzso end and clustered with Asian zzso All zzso zzso from Mexico and Peru had identical zzso zzso Their zzso sequences showed two copies of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso in mismatch distribution parameters of the zzso separate zzso from most zzso zzso While zzso zzso display a homogeneous pattern with no geographical zzso zzso zzso display a zzso geographically clustered pattern which clearly separates LA from non-American zzso except zzso c and d from Southern zzso 

The presence of zzso in Mexico and zzso f and g in zzso are consistent with other previously reported LA zzso and reflect their circulation throughout the zzso The zzso c and d are novel zzso in zzso Their genetic relationships and low zzso within these zzso and/or within the zzso zzso in Southern Mexico suggest its recent introduction and/or recent expansion to this zzso The global analysis of zzso zzso zzso suggests this zzso introduction to the region and likely LA by different independent zzso
