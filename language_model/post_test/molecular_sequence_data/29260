zzso zzso of zzso calcium zzso zzso play critical roles in many zzso zzso including zzso Although the factors that regulate calcium zzso are not clearly zzso calcium influx may be controlled by molecules interacting with calcium channels, including channel regulatory zzso Here, we describe the chick zzso regulatory zzso zzso the first such zzso to be characterized in early zzso zzso is expressed early in the zzso neural plate, and later in the zzso and zzso root zzso importantly, the timing of this later expression zzso precisely with the onset of zzso zzso zzso expression is also observed in zzso zzso undergoing zzso specifically the zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso in the limb zzso Finally, within the zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso but also, surprisingly, in neural zzso cells, previously shown to form only zzso in this zzso contrary to these previous results, we find that neural crest cells can form zzso in the zzso zzso Given the proposed role of zzso in modulating calcium channels and its expression in zzso cells, we suggest that zzso may promote differentiation via regulation of zzso calcium zzso
