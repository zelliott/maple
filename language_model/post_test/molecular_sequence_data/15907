Point zzso in G gamma and A gamma zzso gene promoters are associated with increased production of G gamma and A gamma zzso zzso To determine whether an upstream promoter zzso could account for elevated A gamma in a Black adolescent with A zzso and zzso cell zzso we cloned the 13 zzso zzso zzso containing both gamma genes into zzso zzso zzso zzso For one zzso the A gamma upstream promoter showed no zzso to a 19 zzso zzso whose sequence centered at zzso A gamma promoter sequence data for this zzso clone revealed a 13 zzso deletion which eliminated the A gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso A gamma zzso DNA of this and a similar case showed zzso to both zzso and normal zzso zzso We propose that this 13 zzso deletion removes part of the binding site for a zzso protein which is abundant in adult zzso zzso
