Two zzso zzso and zzso zzso two independent zzso oxide zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso predict zzso of zzso zzso with zzso acid sequence identity of zzso While zzso resides on the zzso zzso the zzso gene is located on a zzso DNA zzso zzso acid sequence analysis suggests that zzso and zzso zzso integral membrane proteins composed of 14 zzso zzso The region encompassing zzso 3 to 14 shows similarity to the zzso zzso of common bacterial zzso oxide zzso including the positions of six strictly zzso zzso zzso Unlike the Nor zzso characterized so far from zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso contain an zzso extension which may form two additional zzso connected by a zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso The presence of a zzso protein was predicted from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso While the common zzso of zzso bacteria is associated with a second zzso c zzso zzso by the neighboring gene zzso the nor zzso of zzso zzso and zzso lack adjacent zzso zzso The zzso roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were investigated with zzso disrupted in the two zzso zzso bearing zzso deletions in zzso or zzso were affected neither in zzso nor in zzso growth with nitrate or zzso as the terminal electron zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso was lethal to the cells under zzso growth zzso zzso growth was restored in the double zzso by introducing either zzso or zzso on a zzso zzso These results show that the zzso and zzso gene products are zzso and instrumental in zzso
