zzso belonging to the family zzso may establish beneficial or harmful relationships with zzso The zzso zzso contain nod and zzso genes responsible for zzso formation and nitrogen zzso respectively, whereas the zzso strains carry zzso genes responsible for the formation of tumors or zzso zzso The symbiotic and zzso strains currently belong to different species of the zzso zzso and, until now, no strains able to establish zzso with zzso and also to induce tumors or zzso roots in plants have been zzso Here, we report for the first time the occurrence of two zzso strains zzso and zzso belonging to zzso zzso able to induce zzso roots or tumors in plants and also to zzso zzso zzso under natural environmental zzso zzso plasmids zzso containing nod and zzso genes and zzso or zzso plasmids containing zzso genes were found in these zzso The zzso and zzso genes of the strains from this study are zzso related to those of zzso strains zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes from strain zzso are zzso related to those of zzso zzso zzso whereas the same genes from strain zzso zzso are related to those of zzso zzso zzso These findings may be of high relevance for the better understanding of zzso interactions and knowledge of zzso zzso zzso
