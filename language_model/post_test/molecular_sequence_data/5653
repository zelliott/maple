zzso was originally isolated as a component of a protein complex that specifically zzso zzso zzso repair zzso defects of zzso zzso group C cell extracts in zzso and was identified as one of two human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene product zzso zzso zzso has previously been shown to significantly stimulate the zzso activity of zzso human zzso protein zzso In this study we identify and functionally characterize the zzso domain of zzso zzso We prepared various internal as well as terminal deletion products of zzso protein in a zzso form and examined their binding with zzso by using zzso zzso We demonstrate that a domain covering 56 zzso acids of zzso is required for binding to zzso as well as for stimulation of in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a small zzso corresponding to the zzso domain is sufficient to exert stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with known crystal structures and analysis with secondary structure programs provided strong indications that the binding domain has a predominantly zzso zzso character, consistent with evidence that the affinity with zzso is based on zzso zzso Our work shows that binding to zzso alone is required and sufficient for the role of zzso in in zzso zzso but does not rule out the possibility that the protein has additional functions in zzso
