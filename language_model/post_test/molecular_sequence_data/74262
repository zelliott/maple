zzso zzso glaucoma zzso is a genetically complex zzso that affects retinal zzso cells and is a leading cause of zzso zzso zzso a gene of unknown function, was recently identified as zzso for zzso at locus zzso zzso studies found zzso zzso in control zzso leaving the role of zzso in this disease zzso To address this issue, we determined the function of zzso We studied zzso in zzso and found it is the functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso is cell essential and functions in the zzso processing of zzso zzso which is required for zzso zzso Evidence for functional zzso comes from sequence zzso ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso that include defects in zzso zzso processing and abnormal zzso zzso Additionally, we show that loss of zzso function leads to an zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso of defects in zzso zzso genes may influence the impact of zzso zzso on zzso Although these results overall do not provide evidence for or against a role of zzso in zzso they do provide important baseline information for future zzso
