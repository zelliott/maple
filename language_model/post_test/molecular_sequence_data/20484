zzso zzso zzso zzso are a newly identified class of zzso with unique properties compared to other members in zzso zzso This present study reports the zzso characterization and zzso expression analysis of two omega zzso genes in disk zzso zzso zzso zzso Two disk zzso omega zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso with calculated molecular mass of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their deduced zzso acid sequences showed highest similarity with another zzso omega zzso from zzso zzso zzso structures of two omega zzso were generated by zzso modeling and exhibited typical omega zzso structural zzso The zzso proteins of zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities; however, no activity towards other common zzso zzso was zzso Of the two zzso protein zzso by zzso showed much higher zzso ability than the other zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso with high levels in all examined zzso while zzso showed specific expression in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso in zzso were dramatically elevated when zzso were subjected to heat zzso heavy metals and zzso chemical zzso exposure, indicating that zzso might play important protective roles against environmental zzso zzso expression was also significantly induced by heavy metals and zzso although with much lower fold change than zzso But under zzso stress, zzso expression was zzso in a zzso pattern, zzso its different zzso roles under zzso These results indicate that omega zzso of the disk zzso especially zzso have great zzso as highly sensitive zzso of environmental zzso
