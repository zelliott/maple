zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso led to changes in the kinetic properties of this zzso The zzso is a zzso structure, with zzso occurring in the zzso between the two zzso zzso lies at the edge of the zzso making an interaction with zzso zzso This is the only direct zzso or zzso interaction between the small and large zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that binding of two zzso zzso and zzso was impaired relative to that of the zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso for two inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso were 4 and zzso zzso respectively, zzso and zzso higher than the zzso of the respective peptides for zzso zzso zzso zzso for three zzso zzso that differed only at the zzso position suggested a direct interaction of zzso with zzso at this zzso The zzso for zzso was zzso higher than zzso for the zzso zzso indicating an effect of the zzso on the zzso step, product zzso The pH dependence of kinetic parameters for zzso was also zzso A single zzso of zzso was observed in zzso as compared to the two zzso of zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso These changes suggest a role for zzso in zzso recognition and in stabilization of the zzso competent zzso of the zzso
