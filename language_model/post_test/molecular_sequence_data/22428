Most zzso zzso function at the plasma zzso however zzso is exclusively localized to zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso collecting zzso The zzso distribution indicates that zzso has a function distinct from zzso water zzso 

We show by zzso analyses and zzso that the zzso of zzso is a zzso for its zzso zzso zzso or absence at the plasma membrane of zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso fluorescent zzso or a zzso zzso zzso tag zzso or zzso to the zzso of zzso directed zzso to the plasma zzso of zzso zzso canine kidney zzso In contrast, addition of a zzso tag to the zzso zzso caused the protein to remain zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso of zzso by that of zzso also directed zzso to the plasma zzso whereas the zzso of zzso retained zzso in zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso of zzso is critical for trafficking of the protein to the zzso zzso Moreover, our studies provide an approach for future identification of proteins involved in zzso sorting in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
