To isolate and identify zzso zzso in the stem of Japanese zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and thinly sliced zzso zzso zzso stem samples were incubated in test tubes with zzso modified Rennie zzso zzso The test tubes were zzso for zzso reduction activity zzso 5 days after incubation at 30 degrees zzso Twelve zzso were obtained from MR plates zzso with a loop of zzso MR medium from zzso zzso However, zzso test showed that only nine zzso were zzso and three were zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso diagnostic zzso four zzso zzso were identified as strains of zzso zzso and five zzso as zzso zzso The zzso bacteria were strains of zzso zzso A zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolate zzso zzso zzso were identified to the species level by full sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso had zzso similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The stem of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study is an essential step toward understanding the ecology and interaction between zzso bacteria and zzso
