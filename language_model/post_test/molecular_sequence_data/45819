Natural products provide a unique element of molecular diversity and biological functionality and they are still indispensable for drug zzso The zzso zzso a large and structurally diverse family of zzso natural products, have been isolated from a group of zzso zzso zzso the zzso Relatively high zzso acid sequence identity of the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso was used to design three zzso primer pairs for zzso zzso detection of novel zzso zzso with particular interest into zzso involved in zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso method, described here, enables fast insight into the zzso arsenal within zzso Designed zzso and zzso zzso were applied for the analysis of two natural zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso analysis of chosen clones revealed the presence of two distinctive sequences in strain zzso zzso zzso but only one of these showed zzso to zzso zzso On zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso strain zzso three different zzso sequences were identified demonstrating a potential of designed zzso to target zzso gene pool within single zzso
