The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso encodes proteins required for the zzso of zzso including a zzso zzso zzso zzso A clone that expresses zzso zzso activity was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that the clone included part of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and a long partial open reading frame zzso The clone included zzso zzso of zzso DNA which had not been previously zzso zzso and expression studies with zzso constructed via zzso showed that three genes zzso are necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso was not zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to the zzso zzso zzso zzso this is a much higher identity than expected, given the relationship between these zzso DNA sequence analyses also supported previous studies indicating that the zzso zzso was inherited along with the adjacent zzso zzso zzso by a single horizontal gene zzso
