The zzso body is a zzso zzso that has been observed in over 50 species of zzso zzso However, neither the composition nor the precise function of the zzso body has yet been zzso Here we purify the zzso body from zzso zzso and isolate zzso a new protein containing a consensus sequence known as zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is localized to the zzso of the zzso body by zzso zzso and that a green fluorescent zzso zzso fusion protein is targeted to zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene in zzso generates zzso zzso that are zzso similar to the native zzso body, zzso a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso eliminates zzso bodies from the zzso and results in zzso that exhibit a zzso zzso in response to cell zzso Our results show that the zzso body represents a new category of zzso with a function in the maintenance of cellular zzso
