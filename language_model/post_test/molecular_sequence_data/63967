We have previously identified a cluster of 16 genes that zzso zzso zzso called zzso proteins zzso located on human zzso zzso zzso Here, we have identified similar zzso gene clusters in two zzso zzso and zzso DNA sequence comparison revealed the common cluster structure consisting of 16 zzso genes for these three zzso but a significant difference was found in the zzso zzso possesses a new zzso gene not found in human and zzso whereas one zzso gene ( zzso that exists in human and zzso was lost in zzso making no change in the total number of zzso zzso Interestingly, the sequence for coding regions are highly variable among species zzso to insertions and zzso resulting in variation of gene zzso On the contrary, the sequences for the zzso upstream region are highly zzso among zzso These findings suggest that the ancestral zzso gene cluster was composed of 17 genes before the divergence of Old World monkeys zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso
