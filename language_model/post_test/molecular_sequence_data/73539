zzso is a membrane zzso that is important for the development and plasticity of neural zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso degrades rapidly ( zzso zzso 5 zzso but becomes stable when cells are treated with nerve growth zzso To identify zzso acting factors that may influence zzso stability, we combined column zzso and gel mobility shift zzso to isolate zzso zzso binding proteins from zzso bovine brain zzso This resulted in the isolation of two proteins that bind specifically and competitively to a zzso sequence in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed that one of the zzso binding proteins zzso with zzso zzso upstream element binding zzso previously characterized as a protein that resembles zzso K and which binds to a zzso zzso DNA sequence upstream of the c zzso gene to activate its zzso The other binding protein shares sequence zzso with zzso a zzso tract binding protein implicated in zzso zzso and regulation of translation zzso The two proteins bind to a 26 zzso zzso sequence lying 300 zzso downstream of the end of the coding region, in an area shown by others to zzso instability on a reporter zzso in transient zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso and the zzso protein may compete for binding at the same site to influence the stability of zzso zzso
