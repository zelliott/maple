The zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso pooled human zzso zzso from zzso to zzso plus one from a zzso These zzso were subjected to zzso with the zzso zzso II, and the released zzso which included zzso zzso and repeat region zzso but not linkage regions, were reduced with alkaline zzso and identified on two separate zzso zzso Both of the latter had been zzso with samples, most of which had been derived from bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and all of which had been fully characterized by zzso zzso zzso The capping structures identified in human zzso zzso zzso occurred in the relative zzso zzso zzso zzso The other groups of capping structures which had been identified in bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso although the possibility of the presence of some zzso structures could not be zzso In addition, the human sample showed significantly higher levels of zzso repeat region structures than did the bovine sample, and it is not clear whether this reflects a species or age dependence as the bovine zzso were from young animals, whereas the human zzso were predominantly from an older zzso The charge zzso and zzso zzso chain sizes of the human and bovine zzso zzso zzso were seen to be zzso
