To investigate a potential zzso zzso zzso domain zzso in the zzso region of the human vitamin D zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were replaced with zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in response to 1, zzso D3 zzso was virtually eliminated when either point zzso was zzso into several zzso cell zzso Furthermore, both zzso exhibited a dominant negative zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso analysis at 4 degrees C and a zzso DNA binding zzso at 25 degrees C revealed essentially normal zzso binding for the zzso zzso which were also equivalent to native zzso in zzso with the rat zzso vitamin D responsive element as a presumed zzso with zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso fusion protein linked to zzso equally zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso These data zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso residing in a putative zzso region at the extreme C zzso of zzso as critical in the mechanism of 1, zzso transcription, likely zzso an interaction with a zzso or a component of the zzso zzso machinery distinct from zzso
