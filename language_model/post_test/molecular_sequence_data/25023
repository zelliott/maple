The zzso gene zzso is one of the most strongly expressed genes in zzso zzso To zzso the zzso regulatory element for this strong expression and the process of zzso zzso the zzso activity of a series of truncated zzso promoters was measured by using the zzso coli zzso gene as a zzso zzso of a zzso region located zzso zzso to zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation site caused both a drastic decrease in the zzso zzso activity and a loss of zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that the decrease in zzso activity was achieved at the zzso zzso In addition, zzso gel mobility shift zzso indicated that the zzso region contained a zzso element, to which one or more zzso zzso cellular factors specifically zzso These results suggest that the zzso element between zzso zzso and zzso zzso includes the sequence essential for the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
