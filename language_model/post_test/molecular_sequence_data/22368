The gene for zzso signaling protein zzso is centrally involved in the expression of coat color traits in zzso The zzso pig breed is characterized by a zzso zzso with black zzso pigmentation and yellow or white zzso zzso We investigated a zzso zzso zzso cross and observed a coat color segregation pattern in the zzso generation that can be explained by virtue of two zzso at the zzso locus and two zzso at the zzso zzso Complete linkage of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso at the zzso locus on zzso zzso was zzso zzso by the knowledge of similar mouse coat color zzso it seems therefore conceivable that the zzso pigmentation of zzso pigs is caused by an zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Toward zzso cloning of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso region has been constructed and subsequently zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso differed in their zzso untranslated regions, whereas they shared a common open reading zzso Comparative sequencing of all zzso zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso pigs did not reveal any differences associated with the coat color zzso Relative zzso analyses showed different zzso skin expression zzso of the five zzso transcripts in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is therefore probably a regulatory zzso zzso that alters its zzso expression zzso
