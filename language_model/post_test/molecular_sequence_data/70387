zzso zzso which were designed according to zzso acid sequences zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were used to identify the corresponding genes of zzso zzso zzso analysis of a 1904 zzso DNA zzso proved the existence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These two genes were separated by 11 zzso only, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were part of one zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso genes were not located upstream of the structural genes of zzso zzso but close to the zzso gene at a distance of about 1000 zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene region were constructed and introduced into zzso zzso zzso and a zzso deletion zzso The resulting zzso strains were examined for zzso regulation of the zzso and the alternative zzso in response to zzso and zzso Under zzso conditions the modified zzso and the zzso forms of component II of both the zzso and the alternative zzso were detected in a zzso zzso background by zzso analysis, whereas only the zzso forms were present in the zzso deletion zzso zzso activity in these strains was followed by the zzso reduction zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso were not affected in zzso activity in response to zzso or zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso genes are required for zzso regulation of both the zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
