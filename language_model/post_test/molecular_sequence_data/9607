The effect of acute and chronic administration of methamphetamine zzso on the levels of zzso zzso and its zzso has been investigated in rat brain using zzso zzso to three distinct rat zzso genes zzso I, zzso II, zzso zzso zzso I zzso was reduced in the zzso and nucleus zzso within 2 h of acute administration of 4 zzso zzso but returned to the control level by 6 zzso The zzso content in both the zzso and membrane zzso of the zzso was reduced zzso 2, and 6 h after acute administration of zzso In the chronic experiments, rats were treated with either 4 zzso zzso or saline once daily for 14 zzso This was followed by a withdrawal period of 28 days, and thereafter, the animals were challenged with either zzso (4 zzso zzso or zzso All the animals were zzso 6 h after this zzso There were four treatment groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was a significant decrease in the zzso for zzso I and zzso II in the zzso and zzso II and zzso III in the nucleus zzso in the zzso group and the zzso and zzso groups, respectively, when compared to the SS zzso The zzso content in the zzso membrane fraction decreased in both the zzso and zzso groups but not in the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso content in the membrane fraction of the zzso area showed a significant increase in the zzso zzso The zzso content in the zzso fraction of these brain areas decreased in both the zzso and zzso zzso The total zzso decreased significantly in the zzso and zzso groups of the zzso but increased significantly in the zzso group of the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso I and zzso III decreased significantly in the zzso group, and in the zzso and zzso groups, in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso area zzso zzso The zzso content in both the zzso and membrane zzso and total zzso content of the zzso decreased significantly in the zzso zzso and zzso group as compared with the SS zzso In the zzso prefrontal zzso and zzso the significant increase of zzso content in the membrane fraction of the zzso group was also found, but neither the zzso content in the zzso fraction nor total zzso content zzso These results suggest that chronic zzso administration leads to a zzso of zzso from the zzso to membrane zzso these may zzso zzso behavioral zzso
