In a previous report, we found that zzso at the zzso zzso integrity zzso zzso can convert zzso zzso into a zzso zzso In this report, we describe the isolation of the zzso gene and show that it encodes the zzso of the zzso zzso The site of zzso in four independently isolated zzso zzso is at zzso which has changed to zzso in three cases and zzso in the fourth zzso zzso of zzso does not lead to the production of zzso zzso deletion zzso indicating that an assembled F1 complex is needed for the zzso zzso found in zzso point zzso The location of zzso in the zzso as deduced from the three-dimensional structure of the bovine zzso together with zzso sites in the previously identified zzso and zzso zzso suggests that interaction of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso is likely to be affected by the zzso
