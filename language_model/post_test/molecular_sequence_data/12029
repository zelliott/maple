To investigate whether the amount of zzso C viral zzso zzso in liver and serum can predict the effectiveness of zzso treatment in patients with chronic zzso zzso 

The amount of zzso in frozen liver zzso and zzso of 22 patients with chronic zzso C was determined before and after zzso zzso treatment by the competitive reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

Patients with small amounts of zzso in serum before treatment showed a significantly more effective response to zzso zzso After treatment, zzso disappeared from both the liver and serum of all patients who sustained complete response zzso zzso zzso in contrast, zzso decreased but persisted in the liver of all those who relapsed after zzso of treatment zzso zzso zzso 

The elimination of zzso C virus from the liver as well as from the serum seems to be essential for sustained zzso The zzso of zzso in liver biopsy specimens obtained after treatment would be a highly accurate predictor of whether zzso is likely to zzso
