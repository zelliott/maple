The gene zzso a zzso from zzso zzso was cloned by zzso zzso Its zzso gene expression was performed using zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso zzso with the extra 33 and 13 zzso acids in its zzso and zzso respectively, was zzso to near zzso using zzso affinity zzso The zzso zzso was found to be present in both the culture medium and the zzso A single protein band on the native zzso gel was confirmed by both the activity zzso and protein zzso The optimum pH and temperature of the zzso zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso degrees C, zzso It was stable within the pH range of zzso zzso activity stimulation by zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso were zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso strongly inhibited the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso however, zzso was not zzso during the activity zzso zzso When zzso power was suspended in buffer with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected at 24 zzso
