zzso exchange by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is of pivotal importance for the physiology of zzso and bone zzso Mice lacking either zzso or zzso develop a zzso storage disease and zzso in either protein have been found to zzso zzso in mice and zzso Some human zzso zzso zzso accelerate the usually slow zzso gating of zzso However, it has remained unclear whether the fastened zzso is indeed zzso for the zzso Here we identified and characterized a new deleterious zzso zzso in Belgian Blue cattle with a severe zzso including zzso zzso and in most cases zzso zzso By zzso mapping and zzso sequencing we found a handful of candidate zzso including a cluster of three private zzso causing the substitution of a zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso by zzso The case for zzso was strengthened by subsequent examination of affected calves that revealed severe zzso The zzso zzso largely preserved the zzso zzso and assembly of zzso but drastically accelerated its zzso by membrane zzso These data provide first evidence that accelerated zzso gating per zzso is zzso highlighting a zzso importance of the slow zzso of zzso in zzso function and bone zzso
