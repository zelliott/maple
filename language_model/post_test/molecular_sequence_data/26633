In ancient and/or damaged zzso containing zzso materials, the species of origin of the materials can be difficult to identify through visual zzso therefore, a minimally destructive methodology for species identification is zzso While hair zzso from some species have seen substantial zzso others such as horn or zzso have received little or no attention, or lack protein sequences allowing formal identification using zzso zzso 

We used the zzso method zzso Mass zzso with zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to zzso and identify diagnostic zzso markers up to the zzso zzso zzso were checked using zzso liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso and unidentified peptides were searched against a theoretical database generated by substituting zzso acids in zzso zzso 

zzso peptides were identified by zzso and sequences zzso whenever possible for a range of species belonging to zzso and zzso and for zzso such as zzso and zzso The theoretical database allowed an increase in the number of peptides of up to zzso in species with little genetic zzso 

A zzso approach can successfully identify specific markers for the identification of materials to the zzso level, and should be considered when identification by other means is not zzso Identification by zzso is fast, reliable and zzso
