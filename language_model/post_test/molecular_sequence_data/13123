zzso type 1 zzso gene is a tumor zzso zzso and the zzso gene product, zzso can zzso the zzso zzso Because the zzso gene is often zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso we wondered if the zzso gene might be zzso in those zzso samples not having zzso zzso We investigated the zzso status of the zzso gene and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the open reading frame of the full-length zzso zzso which has a strong zzso with the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso especially for a stretch of three consecutive zzso acids zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct sequencing in samples from patients with zzso Of 48 zzso patients, 10 zzso had point zzso zzso of the zzso gene involving zzso 12, 13 and zzso However, zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene were not detected in any of the zzso zzso We also examined the difference of clinical response to induction therapy between zzso patients with and without zzso zzso A significantly lower rate of complete zzso was noted in individuals with zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso at least in the zzso zzso is very rare in zzso and the zzso gene probably is not a functional complement of the zzso gene zzso The presence of zzso gene zzso may be associated with a lower clinical response to zzso zzso
