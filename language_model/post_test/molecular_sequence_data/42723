We have zzso two segments containing a total of zzso zzso of the left arm from zzso zzso of zzso zzso The first segment of zzso zzso contains 18 open reading frames zzso of more than 100 zzso acid zzso Five zzso zzso known zzso zzso including the fatty acid zzso gene zzso Three new zzso genes were discovered with zzso to zzso genes and ten new genes without zzso to any known zzso The second segment of 13 zzso contains five zzso with two known zzso genes and three unknown zzso The sequences from zzso zzso were obtained entirely with the walking primer strategy resulting in a very low overall sequence zzso of zzso and an average reading length of zzso zzso
