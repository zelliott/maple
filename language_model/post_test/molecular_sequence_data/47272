zzso a member of the MAD family of zzso antagonists, encodes a zzso factor whose expression must be tightly regulated to maintain normal cell growth and zzso To more closely investigate the zzso regulation of the human zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized the zzso zzso After clarification of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso that the true length of the zzso transcript is zzso base zzso we identified two zzso initiation zzso We subsequently isolated the zzso promoter, which is zzso and lacks a zzso zzso Although it contains at least six potential zzso zzso functional studies indicate the zzso two zzso sequences in combination with nearby zzso and zzso sites together account for virtually all promoter zzso We also demonstrate that zzso promoter activity is zzso by high levels of zzso These studies provide further insight into the complex regulatory mechanisms governing zzso gene expression and its role in cellular differentiation and tumor zzso
