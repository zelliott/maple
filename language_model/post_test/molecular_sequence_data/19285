Three continuous zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso production from molasses wastewater at zzso pH of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B), or zzso zzso zzso After operation for 28 days, the microbial community formed ethanol type zzso zzso type zzso and zzso type zzso zzso The zzso production rate was the highest for ethanol type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso community dynamics and diversity were zzso using zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso profiles indicated that the community structures changed quickly in the first 14 zzso zzso analysis indicated that the dominant bacterial groups were low zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also presented as minor groups in the three zzso zzso bacteria were affiliated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from reactor C and zzso using zzso in zzso zzso zzso to be zzso of the zzso in reactor zzso In addition, zzso activity zzso for alcohol zzso zzso supported that the majority of zzso bacteria were affiliated with zzso in the microbial zzso
