We present a strategy to zzso the zzso steps in zzso of zzso compounds by zzso zzso The principle was to select zzso rat zzso cells for resistance to a zzso The hypothesis was that resistant cells should be systematically deficient in the zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso Here we present an example of the use of this approach using zzso B1 zzso a potent zzso as the selective zzso zzso cells as well as individual and pooled colonies selected for zzso resistance from three independent rat zzso lines were characterized for their content of 1) zzso zzso to zzso and/or zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 2) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were shown to express zzso but not zzso The majority of the zzso zzso clones failed to accumulate zzso zzso zzso and expressed no or only very low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels remained zzso demonstrating that loss of expression of zzso zzso was not a consequence of a general zzso zzso A zzso population showing restoration of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity was fully sensitive to zzso zzso The correlation between expression of zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso B1 in both parental cells and zzso strongly suggests that zzso zzso is a major contributor to the zzso of zzso B1 in rat zzso zzso The kind of strategy described here could be applied to other compounds that become zzso for zzso cells following zzso by zzso zzso
