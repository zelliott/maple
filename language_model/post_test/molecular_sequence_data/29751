zzso zzso are a venerable family of zzso zzso zzso Recently, evidence was presented that a rabbit gene in the type IV zzso of zzso zzso was missing a zzso zzso zzso domain 4) thought to be critical for zzso zzso a deletion that would place the two major zzso zzso of the zzso on opposite sides of the zzso It was proposed that the resulting protein was a zzso zzso protein that targets zzso factors to specific zzso within the zzso From analysis of human zzso sequence data, it is shown here that the region containing zzso domain 4, corresponding to zzso 12, is present in the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the zzso zzso transcripts in a rabbit zzso library and in a mouse zzso library also contain zzso zzso The results suggest that the transcript proposed to zzso the zzso zzso protein is a minor zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene thus may not zzso a protein with a function radically different from that of other zzso zzso zzso
