DNA zzso are essential to many cellular processes including zzso replication and transcription, and some zzso function in multiple zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso B and D genes function in both zzso zzso repair and zzso zzso zzso that affect the repair function of these proteins result in XP while zzso affecting zzso result in neurological and zzso zzso although the underlying molecular and cellular basis for these zzso is not well zzso To better understand the zzso roles of these zzso we have now identified and characterized the rep B and rep D genes from the cellular slime mold zzso zzso zzso Both genes zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso The rep D gene contains no zzso and the rep B gene contains only one zzso which makes their zzso structures dramatically different from the corresponding genes in zzso and zzso However the predicted zzso proteins share high zzso with the human zzso and zzso zzso The single copy of the rep B and D genes map to zzso 3 and 1, zzso The expression of rep B and D (and the previously isolated rep zzso genes during zzso development was zzso and it was determined that each rep gene has a unique pattern of zzso consistent with the idea that they have specific roles in zzso The pattern and extent of expression of these genes was not affected by the growth history of the cells, zzso that the expression of these genes is tightly regulated by the zzso zzso The expression of the rep genes is a very early step in development and may well represent a key event in the initiation of development in this zzso
