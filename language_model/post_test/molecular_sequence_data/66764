To investigate the effect of zzso compounds on the marine zzso zzso zzso an zzso was developed to measure the expression of two zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured in zzso zzso zzso following a 10-day exposure to 200 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso tissue increased zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of the compound by the mussels, however there was no significant increase of free zzso in zzso zzso during the exposure zzso The zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso of both sexes were measured at days zzso 5, and 10 in control and exposed zzso However, no significant change in the expression of either the zzso or zzso genes was recorded at any of the sampled time zzso The results suggest that either a regulatory mechanism exists in a zzso that is able to maintain constant levels of free zzso by converting the excess zzso into zzso products which may have reduced affinity for the zzso zzso or zzso that the zzso and zzso genes are unresponsive to zzso in these zzso The significance of these findings in terms of the utility of zzso and zzso as zzso of zzso disruption in zzso species is zzso
