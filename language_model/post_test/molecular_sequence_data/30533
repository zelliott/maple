An intrinsic zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso and is released from its binding site on the zzso upon zzso of zzso zzso to allow zzso of zzso The zzso activity to zzso zzso is not influenced by the absence of the inhibitor zzso The zzso activity to zzso zzso is induced by dissipation of the membrane potential in the absence of the zzso Thus, the inhibitor is not responsible for zzso zzso but acts only to inhibit zzso zzso by zzso upon zzso of zzso zzso The inhibitor protein forms a regulatory complex with two stabilizing factors, zzso and zzso zzso which facilitate the binding of the inhibitor to zzso and stabilize the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso having a sequence very similar to the zzso binds directly to F1 in a manner similar to the zzso The zzso protein binds to the zzso part and holds the inhibitor and the zzso protein on zzso even when one of them is detached from the F1 zzso
