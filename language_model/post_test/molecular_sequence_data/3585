A blood group zzso zzso from the mushroom zzso zzso zzso was investigated with respect to its molecular structure and zzso binding zzso zzso mass zzso analysis showed it to consist of an intact zzso 33 zzso and truncated zzso 23 zzso zzso in addition to a small zzso zzso 10 zzso Isolation in the presence of zzso produced only the H zzso indicating that the latter two are formed by zzso zzso of the intact H zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and P zzso chains followed by mass spectral analysis supports this zzso The zzso strongly zzso blood group type B substance, was zzso with type A substance, and reacted zzso with type H zzso zzso binding studies reveal a high affinity for zzso (but not for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the type B zzso zzso zzso also zzso strongly with zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and bovine zzso both of which contain multiple zzso end zzso This linear B zzso is a component of zzso zzso and zzso preventing their transplantation into zzso zzso also shares zzso recognition of this zzso with toxin A elaborated by zzso zzso
