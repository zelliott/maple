zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso from T cells is important in the zzso zzso and survival of inflammatory zzso Here the induction of zzso expression from T cells was dependent on zzso and translation and was prevented by zzso In primary human zzso T cells, up to zzso zzso of human zzso promoter was strongly activated by zzso + zzso zzso in either the zzso nuclear factor zzso site or the zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso element 0 zzso site substantially reduced promoter zzso Both zzso promoter and zzso zzso were unresponsive to zzso whereas the release of zzso was zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso and protein expression at various time points and the effect of adding zzso after the stimulus revealed the existence of potent mechanisms of zzso acting at a zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso proteins that bind the zzso element in the zzso zzso region was unaffected by zzso and overall zzso element binding activity was zzso Taken together our data support an important role for the zzso and zzso sites in the zzso control of zzso expression in primary human T cells and suggest that zzso mechanisms are key zzso of zzso zzso
