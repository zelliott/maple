The zzso of bacterial pathogens and their hosts has contributed to the development of very complex and sophisticated functional zzso zzso Thus, zzso pathogens have evolved a variety of strategies to manipulate host cell functions zzso For example, a group of unrelated zzso zzso bacteria have evolved a zzso known as zzso zzso toxin zzso that has the ability to control cell cycle progression in zzso zzso Recent studies have identified zzso as the active zzso of the zzso zzso Through its zzso activity, zzso causes limited DNA damage, thereby triggering the zzso response that ultimately results in the observed arrest of the cell zzso In addition, it has been established that zzso is a zzso AB toxin in which zzso is the active zzso zzso and zzso and zzso constitute the zzso zzso zzso required for the delivery of zzso into the target zzso The mechanism of action of zzso suggests that the zzso of limited damage could be a strategy used by zzso bacteria to zzso host cell zzso
