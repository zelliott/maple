A severe bottleneck in the size of the zzso zzso zzso in the common zzso of human and gorilla has been used to isolate an zzso source zzso The human zzso zzso zzso consists of about one thousand members which are absent in gorilla and zzso zzso Exhaustive library screening shows that there are as few as two zzso zzso in the gorilla zzso One is zzso zzso absent in the zzso zzso in both human and zzso suggesting the independent zzso activity of the zzso zzso in the gorilla zzso The second of these two gorilla zzso zzso is present in both human and zzso zzso and is the single zzso zzso known to zzso the radiation of these three zzso The zzso zzso in zzso DNA resembles the next older zzso zzso Thus, this zzso locus is originally zzso by a zzso source gene and acquired characteristic zzso sequence zzso by zzso drift in zzso consequently becoming the first member and zzso founder of this zzso zzso
