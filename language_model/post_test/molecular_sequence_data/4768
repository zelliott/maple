zzso C virus zzso is a zzso zzso virus and its zzso is translated into a single large zzso The zzso zzso protein possesses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since these activities appear to be important for viral zzso efforts are being made to identify compounds that might inhibit the zzso activities of zzso and serve as potential zzso zzso We used a genetic selection strategy in zzso to zzso from a pool of completely random zzso zzso random zzso those zzso zzso that could bind to zzso After six cycles of selection and amplification, zzso of the pooled zzso could bind specifically to the zzso zzso When the zzso in the pool zzso 6) were analyzed for binding and zzso of the zzso activity of zzso with the zzso zzso as zzso zzso two zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso were found to inhibit zzso in zzso zzso studies of the zzso revealed that the zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso with an zzso constant zzso of 3 zzso We also analyzed zzso zzso and zzso for their action with a longer protein zzso zzso acid region zzso and found that these zzso efficiently inhibited the zzso activity of zzso In addition, both zzso and zzso zzso were found to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso Since these zzso possesses dual zzso function for zzso they could prove to be useful as zzso drug zzso
