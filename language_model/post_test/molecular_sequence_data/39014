The zzso changes in the genetic diversity of Mediterranean zzso subjected to confinement were studied in an experimental 300 1 seawater zzso Five samples were taken at different times and analyzed by zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso to rapidly monitor changes in the bacterial genetic zzso zzso analysis clearly showed variations between the zzso Three of the five samples, with different zzso zzso patterns, were further analyzed by cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis indicated a shift from a mixed bacterial zzso to a community dominated by bacteria closely affiliated to a single zzso zzso zzso obtained at the start of the experiment were affiliated with two zzso and three zzso lineages known from other studies of marine zzso One sequence was affiliated with the zzso After 161 h of incubation two sequences represented a zzso lineage also present at 0 zzso but the majority of sequences clustered around that of zzso zzso After 281 h only the dominant zzso bacteria and bacteria zzso related to zzso were found by cloning and zzso zzso rates of bacteria indicated that grazing was the dominant mortality process when zzso zzso were zzso zzso changes in the genetic diversity of bacteria were partly influenced by the differential mortality of bacterial populations during the course of zzso
