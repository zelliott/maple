zzso is structurally very flexible, which provides the basis for its functional zzso An zzso zzso can often adopt different zzso which enables the regulation of its function through zzso zzso help zzso reach their functionally active zzso by increasing their structural stability or by zzso the folding zzso zzso dynamic zzso complexes, such as the zzso or the zzso require numerous proteins that coordinate zzso switches of the zzso components during assembly and during their respective zzso
