Two zzso zzso activities are involved in zzso to insulin zzso type I zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and type II zzso zzso at the zzso site zzso zzso To further understand the mechanism of zzso processing, we have investigated types I and II zzso processing of intact zzso in parallel to that of the conversion zzso zzso and zzso The type I processed zzso and zzso at the same zzso In contrast, the type II zzso processed zzso at a much faster rate zzso zzso p zzso zzso than it did intact zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso required for competitive zzso of zzso zzso and zzso processing by a zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso were similar zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso processing required a higher zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso 197 zzso zzso peptides corresponding to the sequences surrounding zzso zzso and zzso zzso of human zzso were zzso for use as specific zzso or competitive zzso zzso of the zzso by type I and zzso by type II was zzso of the zzso zzso with similar zzso pH requirements previously observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for type I processing of the zzso was zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for type II processing of the zzso was zzso zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso 97 zzso In competitive zzso zzso the zzso similarly blocked insulin zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not inhibit zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso inhibited insulin zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso 330 zzso and not zzso We conclude that the type I zzso recognized zzso and zzso as similar zzso whereas the type II zzso has a stronger preference for zzso compared to intact zzso Furthermore, we suggest that in intact zzso there exists a constraint to efficient processing that is relieved following type I zzso zzso flexibility, in addition to the presence of zzso therefore appears to be important for type II zzso specificity and may provide a molecular basis for a preferential route of zzso conversion via zzso
