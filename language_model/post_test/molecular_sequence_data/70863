Based on our N zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso and a deduced DNA zzso we searched for the corresponding gene in the zzso tuberculosis zzso sequence at the zzso zzso zzso zzso close to zzso and zzso The gene was cloned and zzso followed by zzso of zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso culture zzso In zzso there is 60 % identity with the active site of zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso with two zzso in a zzso zzso but zzso could not serve as an alternative zzso for zzso zzso Testing for zzso and zzso zzso in cattle zzso showed that zzso is zzso following natural and experimental infection with zzso zzso Cloning of zzso represents cloning of the last of the 10 proteins originally defined as zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis and zzso zzso based on determination of their zzso zzso zzso zzso Gen zzso zzso : zzso The need for a precise definition of the term zzso zzso is zzso So far we have observed full zzso between occurrence of an zzso value indicating zzso of a protein and occurrence of a signal sequence in the corresponding zzso Signal sequence independent protein zzso in zzso may occur for a limited number of proteins and remains to be zzso
