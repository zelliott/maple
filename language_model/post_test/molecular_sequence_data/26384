zzso zzso of small zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the partial zzso sequences of the zzso of seven zzso of zzso These seven sequences and the sequence of the corresponding region in an zzso zzso previously totally zzso were compared in order to investigate evolution of the zzso gene in zzso The results of the comparisons were consistent with the hypotheses that the zzso is zzso that the zzso and zzso grouping system is zzso that the zzso expansion segments in the zzso gene evolve at a much faster rate than the rest of the zzso and that the extent of zzso sequence divergence in the zzso zzso is roughly similar to that zzso zzso and zzso
