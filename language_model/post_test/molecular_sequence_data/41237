zzso zzso and classical zzso zzso zzso and zzso are two groups of zzso related zzso peptides zzso that adopt a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fold with a different zzso loop zzso size and diverse modes of zzso zzso Although they both are identified as zzso of cell wall zzso only zzso evolved membrane disruptive ability by zzso zzso to form zzso To understand how this occurred, we modified zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso disruptive zzso by substituting its zzso with that of an zzso zzso After air zzso the synthetic hybrid zzso zzso zzso was structurally identified by circular zzso zzso and functionally evaluated by zzso and membrane zzso zzso and electronic microscopic zzso zzso showed that zzso folded into a zzso zzso structure, as determined by its CD spectrum that is similar to that of zzso zzso was highly zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a lethal concentration of zzso As expected, in contrast to zzso zzso killed the bacteria through a membrane disruptive mechanism of zzso The zzso in modes of action supports a key role of the zzso extension in assembling functional surface of zzso for membrane zzso Our work provides mechanical evidence for evolutionary relationship between zzso and zzso
