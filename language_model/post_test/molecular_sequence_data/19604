zzso and zzso are components of molecular scaffolds located under the zzso zzso and named membrane zzso zzso of these scaffolds through zzso in zzso demonstrated that they are involved in the membrane zzso or the maintenance of proteins associated with zzso The ubiquitous zzso chain bears in its central region a unique domain that is sensitive to several zzso such as zzso or zzso The conservation of this region in zzso suggests that the zzso of zzso by these zzso could be involved in important zzso To assess the role of zzso zzso in zzso we generated a zzso model in which the zzso zzso the region defining this zzso sensitivity were disrupted by gene zzso Surprisingly, zzso mice expressing this zzso zzso appeared healthy, bred zzso and had no zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso assembles correctly into the membrane zzso thus challenging the notion that this region is required for the stable zzso of the membrane skeleton in zzso zzso Our finding also argues against a critical role of this particular zzso zzso in either major cellular functions or in normal zzso
