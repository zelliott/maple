Two protein pairs in zzso zzso zzso and zzso are necessary for zzso from the zzso promoter and subsequent expression of zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso of zzso in classical strains of zzso zzso is activated at zzso growth in zzso conditions, while zzso of zzso in El zzso strains is zzso In this study, we showed that while zzso of zzso differs at zzso growth in zzso conditions between the zzso zzso is zzso high during growth in zzso zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to zzso expression of zzso in each zzso throughout growth in zzso conditions and showed that although zzso of zzso is reduced at zzso growth in an El zzso strain, zzso is turned on later in growth to levels in excess of those in the classical strain (although zzso toxin is not zzso This suggests that the difference in expression of zzso zzso factors in response to zzso conditions between the El zzso and classical zzso of zzso zzso may be related to the timing of zzso of zzso rather than the absolute levels of zzso
