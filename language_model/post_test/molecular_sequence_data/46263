We have developed an effective zzso for the prediction and characterization of novel zzso zzso zzso The zzso algorithm, which is a highly accurate prediction method based on the zzso properties of zzso characterized zzso zzso barrel zzso structures, was used to predict zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The previously zzso product of gene zzso was tested as a model for zzso the zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso protein that is predicted to have 10 zzso zzso and an zzso signal zzso All of the zzso and zzso properties exhibited by zzso are consistent with the prediction that it is a zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso to the outer membrane when expressed in zzso zzso zzso has a zzso secondary structure with stable zzso contacts in the presence of zzso zzso or when zzso into a zzso zzso When in a zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso pore with an effective radius of zzso Taken together, these data substantiate the predictions made by the zzso zzso by showing that zzso is a zzso zzso
