Classical zzso fever virus zzso zzso T zzso zzso were derived from peripheral blood zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after in zzso zzso with infectious zzso Their zzso activity was determined against zzso target cells obtained from zzso virus 40 zzso large T zzso immortalized kidney cells of a zzso miniature zzso zzso with separated zzso cell populations revealed that the zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso zzso class zzso T zzso zzso of target cells with various zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of a major zzso site for zzso zzso near the zzso site between the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using synthetic overlapping zzso which covered this protein region the sequence zzso is the first sequence to be identified as an zzso class zzso T cell zzso recognized by zzso zzso
