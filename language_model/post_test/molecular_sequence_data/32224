zzso an activated and essential form of zzso which is an important component in the zzso structure of most organisms, is zzso from zzso and zzso by zzso zzso We previously reported the identification of the extremely zzso zzso zzso which has dual zzso zzso activities zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso analyses of the protein indicated that the activity is slightly lower than that of zzso For industrial applications, activity needs to be increased without decreasing zzso zzso to enhance this activity, we introduced zzso into the zzso acid zzso located within the predicted reaction zzso by targeted zzso All 12 zzso zzso proteins showed no decrease in zzso Among them, six zzso proteins were found to have increased zzso zzso activity under optimal reaction conditions with sufficient zzso or an appropriate metal zzso Our results indicate that targeted zzso is a powerful technique for in zzso production of a zzso zzso with enhanced zzso The results of this study also indicate that the space for the metal zzso is important for selecting the type of metal zzso and also affects the rate of the zzso
