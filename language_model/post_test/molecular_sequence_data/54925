zzso group zzso proteins regulate major zzso processes in zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates diverse genetic pathways and is required for zzso development and plant zzso Despite widespread zzso sequences in plants, little is known about their function other than in zzso and zzso To study the role of zzso in broccoli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso development, we identified two broccoli zzso zzso genes with sequence zzso to and a similar gene expression pattern to that in zzso zzso zzso their expression in broccoli resulted in zzso zzso and gene expression zzso zzso regulates genes involved in diverse zzso and stress programs similar to zzso in zzso However, zzso differs from zzso in the regulation of flower organ identity, cell proliferation and zzso and zzso zzso which may explain the distinct zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partially rescued the zzso zzso and restored the gene expression pattern to that of the wild zzso Many zzso molecular and zzso functions are zzso in broccoli and zzso Furthermore, the restored gene expression pattern in Rescued zzso provides insights into the molecular basis of zzso growth and zzso
