Alpha zzso are a family of zzso peptides first isolated from zzso zzso In the present work, the structure of the zzso complex of an alpha 1 zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso group was studied with zzso CD, and zzso The analysis indicated the existence of two zzso zzso depending on the orientation of the side chain of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso to the oxygen of the zzso zzso The two zzso could be separated on zzso under a slow zzso showing the ratio of zzso to be zzso in agreement with the zzso zzso The conversion process was shown to involve the coordination of a water zzso to the zzso core through the incubation of the complex in zzso water and subsequent zzso zzso zzso analysis of the analogous radioactive zzso complex showed the formation of two zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso complex in Swiss zzso mice with zzso induced inflammation showed higher accumulated zzso in inflamed tissue compared to normal zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso complexes of alpha zzso derivatives are expected to facilitate research on alpha zzso and accelerate exploitation of these peptides in zzso zzso
