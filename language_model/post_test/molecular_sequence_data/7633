The high zzso of zzso zzso viruses zzso in African green monkeys zzso without zzso defects in their natural hosts has prompted consideration of zzso zzso as a model of zzso zzso zzso Study of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso infection could thus provide clues for understanding the zzso of human zzso zzso Regulatory genes could be candidates for genetic control of zzso zzso We have characterized zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of two zzso strains isolated from naturally infected zzso monkeys captured in zzso The results provide further evidence that zzso from West African green monkeys is the most divergent class of zzso zzso with structural features in long terminal repeat sequences and zzso and zzso genes that distinguish them from viruses isolated from other zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso
