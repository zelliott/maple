zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be combined into one zzso on the basis of several contributions on both DNA sequence and protein analyses reported in the zzso Moreover, for the differentiation and identification of zzso of the zzso zzso we investigated the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso A segment of zzso zzso of the zzso gene was amplified from 31 strains of zzso zzso by zzso The zzso sequences were determined and zzso and accurate genetic relationships were zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA allowed species differentiation within the zzso zzso and confirmed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be distinguished from each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed as a common name for both zzso
