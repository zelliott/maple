zzso are an important class of proteins with many biomedical and zzso zzso Although there are a plethora of experimental techniques geared toward their efficient production, there is a paucity of zzso methods for their de zzso zzso zzso is a general zzso method to design the binding portions of zzso to have high specificity and affinity against any targeted zzso of an zzso First, combinations of zzso structures for the zzso zzso determining regions zzso that are most likely to be able to favorably bind the zzso are zzso This is followed by the simultaneous refinement of the zzso zzso zzso and optimal zzso acid selection for each zzso zzso is applied to three zzso test zzso a zzso from the zzso of zzso C, the zzso zzso and the protein vascular zzso growth zzso The results demonstrate that zzso can efficiently generate diverse zzso libraries of a zzso size with promising zzso affinity potential as exemplified by zzso derived binding zzso
