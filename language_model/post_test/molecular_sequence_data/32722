The zzso molecular marker is a useful gene resource for studying zzso determining mechanisms and controlling fish zzso zzso produced male and female zzso tongue sole zzso zzso were used to screen zzso amplified zzso length zzso zzso molecular zzso The zzso sex of 28 tongue soles was determined by zzso zzso of zzso The zzso analysis of 15 females and 13 males via 64 primer combinations produced a total of zzso zzso bands, of which zzso and zzso of bands were zzso in females and zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso markers were identified and designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso zzso marker zzso was zzso recovered from the gels, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso marker was converted into a zzso zzso reaction zzso marker of a zzso amplified region zzso A simple zzso method of using the specific zzso was developed for identifying genetic sex of zzso tongue zzso zzso products demonstrated that the initial 15 females produced the zzso band of about 350 zzso but the initial 13 male individuals failed to produce the zzso We also investigated the zzso of the zzso zzso in other tongue sole zzso The same zzso zzso of about 350 zzso was found in the additional 59 female individuals, but not in the additional 58 male zzso This zzso molecular zzso technique may have great application potential in zzso of sex determination mechanisms and sex control in zzso tongue zzso
