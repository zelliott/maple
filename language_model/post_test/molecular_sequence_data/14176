Avian zzso zzso coli zzso is associated with zzso infections in poultry causing a variety of diseases collectively known as zzso The host and bacterial factors influencing and/or responsible for carriage and systemic zzso of zzso inside the host are poorly zzso Identification of such factors could help in the understanding of its zzso and in the subsequent development of control zzso zzso in zzso expression technology zzso was used to identify zzso genes specifically expressed during infection in zzso A total of 21 clones with in zzso promoters were isolated from chicken zzso and zzso indicative of systemic zzso DNA sequencing of the cloned fragments revealed that 12 of the genes were zzso zzso coli genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 6 of the genes were zzso zzso and 3 genes were pathogen specific zzso zzso and zzso These genes are involved in various cellular functions, such as zzso cell envelope and integrity, transport systems, and zzso Others were zzso related or have zzso zzso
