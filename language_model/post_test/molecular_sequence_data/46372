Central to protein architecture is the local arrangement or secondary structure of the zzso zzso Thirty to zzso percent of protein zzso are zzso with zzso zzso per zzso zzso in which the zzso chain is more loosely coiled zzso zzso per zzso have also been zzso However, such structures zzso an energetically zzso zzso central zzso zzso We show that rather than being composed of idealized zzso zzso regions formed from putative zzso actually consist of a series of zzso wide turns with unique elliptical zzso These structures have a larger zzso radius akin to that of a zzso but without the loss of favorable zzso van der zzso zzso This not only zzso the zzso zzso but also zzso proteins with important zzso including metal zzso zzso enhanced flexibility and specific zzso binding zzso
