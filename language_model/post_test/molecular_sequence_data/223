The zzso zzso and zzso related zzso zzso gene family comprises several zzso factors that share a zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be involved in sexual development, but the precise function of other family members is zzso In this study, we isolated zzso DNA and zzso sequences of zzso a member of the zzso gene family, from olive flounder, zzso zzso through zzso walking and real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that its zzso DNA contains two zzso and one zzso A zzso factor binding sites prediction program identified a sexual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso box containing 9) in its zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso analysis suggested that zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso domain gene in zzso The expression of zzso in adult zzso was sexually zzso as shown by real-time zzso analysis, with strong expression in the zzso but very weak expression in the zzso Its expression was also strong in the brain and zzso but there was only weak or no expression at all in some of the other zzso tested of both zzso During zzso its expression was detected in most zzso zzso although the level of expression was distinctive of the various zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso at different zzso zzso These results will improve our understanding of the possible role of zzso zzso in the development of the zzso nervous system and sense zzso
