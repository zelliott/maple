zzso zzso zzso are an emerging class of antibiotics for the treatment of infections caused by zzso zzso These compounds are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso by large gene zzso The gene cluster zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library and zzso Four zzso zzso responsible for zzso of the zzso as well as genes for accessory functions such as zzso zzso and zzso were identified by sequence analysis in a zzso zzso region of DNA that appears to be located zzso in the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences within the zzso genes indicated a zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso as observed for zzso analogous zzso in two related compounds, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the structure and the zzso gene cluster of zzso with those of the related peptides showed many zzso This information may contribute to the design of experiments to address both fundamental and applied questions in zzso zzso engineering and drug zzso
