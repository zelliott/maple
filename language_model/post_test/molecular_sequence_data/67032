zzso channel zzso regulates cellular zzso in cells such as zzso and zzso Ion channel activity relies on a switching mechanism between two zzso the open and closed states, known as zzso It has been suggested that zzso channels are gated via a zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso Our analysis suggests that zzso occurs at the zzso immediately preceding the central zzso of the inner zzso Furthermore, we show that the highly zzso central zzso is necessary to prevent constraining interactions with critical zzso in its vicinity, including those located in the selectivity zzso We show that such interactions can impair channel function, and that upon their removal channel activity can be zzso
