The assembly protein precursor zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso in other zzso functions at several key steps during the process of zzso zzso This zzso and the genetically related zzso zzso is distinguished from the other zzso proteins by zzso zzso including zzso The objective of this study was to identify sites at which zzso is zzso so that the functional significance of this modification and the zzso responsible for it can be zzso In the work reported here, we used zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso zzso to identify two sets of zzso zzso zzso One is a zzso zzso II zzso consensus sequence that contains two adjacent zzso both of which are zzso The other zzso is in a different domain of the zzso is zzso less frequently than the zzso site, does not require preceding zzso zzso and causes an zzso mobility shift when zzso zzso zzso for zzso activity showed no gross effect of zzso zzso on the zzso activity of the zzso or on the zzso behavior of zzso Evidence is presented that both the zzso sites and the secondary sites are zzso in zzso cells and zzso cells, indicating that these modifications can be made by a cellular zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggest the involvement of more that one zzso in these zzso
