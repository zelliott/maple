Royal jelly zzso is an exclusive food for queen honey bee zzso zzso zzso that is zzso and zzso by young worker zzso zzso is also widely used in medical products, cosmetics, and as health zzso However, little is known about zzso functionality and the total protein zzso although recent research is attempting to unravel the zzso zzso We have embarked on a detailed investigation of the zzso zzso using a modified protein extraction protocol and two complementary zzso approaches, one- and two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and zzso in conjunction with tandem mass zzso zzso we examined total soluble protein from zzso collected at 24, 48, and 72 h after honey bee larvae deposition twice (in two flower blooming zzso to check differences, if any, in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso gels stained with silver nitrate revealed similar protein profiles among these three time zzso However, we observed a clear difference in two bands zzso zzso of 55 and 75 zzso on zzso gel between the first and the second collection of zzso A similar difference was also observed in the zzso zzso Except for this difference, the protein profiles were similar at the 3 time zzso As the zzso from 48 (or sometimes zzso is commercially used, we selected the zzso sample at 48 h for detailed analysis with the first zzso zzso identified 90 and 15 proteins from the first and second selection, zzso in total, 47 zzso proteins were zzso zzso identified 105 proteins zzso 14 zzso zzso In total, 52 zzso proteins were identified in this study, and other than the major royal jelly protein family and some other previously identified zzso 42 novel proteins were zzso Furthermore, we also report potentially zzso modified zzso and zzso zzso proteins based on the zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were suggested as potential zzso The zzso data were integrated to develop a zzso gel reference map, and all data are accessible through zzso zzso portal zzso
