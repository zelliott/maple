zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in fatty acid zzso from zzso stores, is expressed in the liver and decreased zzso insulin sensitivity has been reported in our zzso zzso mouse zzso Here, an integrated approach, zzso zzso and zzso together with targeted zzso analysis, was used to investigate the liver zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed altered expression of genes involved in zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso zzso mice compared with zzso mice and in genes controlling the immune system in mice on high-fat diet versus mice on normal zzso zzso gel zzso followed by zzso and/or zzso allowed identification of 52 and 22 unique proteins zzso regulated according to the zzso and diet, zzso Changes were observed mainly for proteins related to zzso including several proteins involved in zzso metabolism or exhibiting zzso zzso zzso Despite the coordinated changes in zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso no significant differences in levels of key zzso zzso were detected between the two zzso This study identifies a link between zzso and zzso zzso which deserves further attention in view of the emerging data suggesting that disturbances in zzso metabolism may affect insulin zzso The present work also describes a limited correlation between zzso protein and zzso levels, thus, zzso the importance of integrated zzso
