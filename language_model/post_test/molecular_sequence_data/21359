zzso zzso is the most zzso agent of human zzso It belongs to the zzso zzso which includes other zzso zzso zzso The origin of the zzso is still zzso zzso zzso exports zzso proteins into the host cell using the zzso export element zzso zzso based on the presence of a zzso motif suggest that more than 300 proteins are exported by zzso zzso while there are many fewer exported proteins in zzso 

A zzso approach was applied to resolve the zzso of eight zzso species and four zzso zzso By using 218 zzso proteins we received unanimous support for a sister group position of zzso and avian malaria zzso This observation was zzso by the analyses of 28 exported proteins with zzso present in all zzso zzso Most interestingly, several zzso from the zzso zzso zzso motif were found to be present in the zzso sequences of zzso 

Our zzso analyses strongly support the hypotheses that the zzso have been founded by a single zzso species switching from birds to African great apes or vice zzso The zzso from the zzso zzso motif in zzso may explain the comparably low number of exported proteins that have been predicted in zzso
