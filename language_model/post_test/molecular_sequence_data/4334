In rats expressing the f zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso T cells utilizing the V alpha zzso segment are zzso zzso during zzso development, resulting in V alpha zzso expression by zzso of mature zzso T cells as compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso responses of zzso T cells from zzso rats against zzso V alpha zzso zzso T cells are also zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso of V alpha zzso zzso require selective V beta zzso However, zzso zzso V alpha zzso zzso zzso use a related set of J alpha segments which contribute short homogeneous zzso alpha zzso with features suggesting zzso zzso and little N zzso In contrast, only few zzso V alpha zzso zzso T cells showed an imprint of positive selection on J usage or zzso zzso The results demonstrate that a single V alpha segment can promote both zzso zzso positive selection and zzso and that the latter is more dependent on an additional contribution of zzso zzso possibly by promoting zzso with a diverse set of zzso peptides or by providing additional zzso zzso
