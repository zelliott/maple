zzso Mice zzso for a targeted zzso of the zzso gene are born with a bilateral zzso of the secondary zzso associated with multiple head and zzso anomalies and these animals die within 24 zzso of birth zzso et zzso 1993; zzso et zzso 1993; zzso and zzso zzso We have determined the spatial and zzso expression of the zzso zzso protein in the developing mouse zzso at embryonic stages zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso cells of the zzso at zzso but is progressively restricted to the tips of the growing zzso shelves at zzso zzso By the zzso stage of development, zzso protein was found to be expressed throughout the zzso zzso These observations correlate with zzso shelf orientation and zzso protein may play a direct or indirect role in guiding the zzso shelves vertically along side the zzso starting with the tips of the zzso shelves at zzso followed by the entire zzso shelf at zzso zzso As development zzso to zzso the stage at which shelf zzso occurs, zzso protein is zzso in the zzso zzso but remains in the zzso edge zzso zzso of zzso continues in the zzso edge zzso until the fusion of opposing zzso zzso zzso By the zzso stage of development, zzso is zzso in the zzso and expression is localized in the zzso and oral zzso zzso In an animal model of zzso zzso zzso we report that zzso zzso and protein expression were significantly zzso implicating a possible functional role of the zzso gene in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso A recent report by Barrow and zzso (1999), has illustrated the importance of tongue posture during zzso shelf closure in zzso zzso zzso This along with our new findings of the expression of the zzso protein during zzso has shed some light on the putative role of this gene in zzso zzso
