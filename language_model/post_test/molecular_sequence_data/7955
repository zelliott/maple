Gene therapy clinical trials targeting zzso and other genes are zzso in zzso cancer zzso To explore the potential for zzso therapy in zzso zzso we examined the in zzso effects of zzso targeting zzso and zzso in the zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The zzso cell viability zzso was used to measure growth effects after zzso treatments with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso binding region of zzso and zzso region of zzso A random sequence of the zzso zzso was used as a control, and an zzso zzso cell line was used for zzso zzso was defined as the zzso concentration required for 50% growth reduction compared to zzso zzso zzso vs zzso effects of zzso combinations were zzso by combination indexes zzso as calculated from median effect parameters by the methods of zzso and zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were consistently lower than corresponding zzso zzso in all cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line was sensitive to zzso and combination zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), but not to zzso zzso alone zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso toxicity was observed at zzso of 16 zzso for all cell lines except in zzso where zzso growth stimulation occurred at this concentration with zzso zzso Growth stimulation was also observed in zzso with zzso and zzso combinations at intermediate doses, with zzso at higher zzso While zzso combinations in zzso were synergistic zzso zzso zzso they were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso and zzso in different cell lines were shown to have both zzso and zzso activity, as single agents and in zzso at zzso that are achievable in zzso Because of the complex patterns of effects, further in zzso studies are warranted before considering clinical trials with these agents in zzso zzso
