As the demand for accurately aligning gene sequences to the zzso of a related species grows with the sequencing of new zzso spaced seeds emerge as a promising vehicle for increasing alignment zzso We extend the existing zzso zzso zzso models for sensitivity evaluation to take into account the compositional structure of coding sequences and ultimately produce seeds better suited to this particular zzso zzso seeds for alignment programs, however, needs to balance sensitivity and zzso We assess the effects of seed variations on both sensitivity and specificity in an extended model that incorporates transitions and zzso among the three zzso positions, and show that spaced seeds with transitions offer a better zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose a theoretical zzso for rigorously assessing seed zzso starting from zzso and zzso models of the zzso and zzso zzso Within this zzso we perform the first comprehensive analysis of seeds to serve as a blueprint for selecting sensitive and specific seeds for practical zzso Our analyses show that specificity is relatively constant for seeds of a given weight, while sensitivity varies widely, with the highest values attained by seeds allowing a small zzso number of zzso strategy for designing seeds, therefore, is to first select the weight of the seed by identifying the desired zzso zzso then choose the most sensitive zzso within that weight zzso We illustrate our methods with the alignment of chicken coding sequences against the human zzso assembly version zzso
