A number of zzso and linear fragments and zzso of zzso were zzso and their biological zzso tested using the isolated carp scale zzso zzso In this system the zzso portion zzso exhibited only zzso zzso which was markedly enhanced by the addition of the zzso sequences zzso and zzso The zzso sequence itself, zzso had minimal activity, zzso zzso of zzso with zzso reduced the potency of the ring structure zzso by about zzso zzso of zzso with zzso reduced the potency of zzso zzso while both zzso together caused a still more marked reduction zzso in zzso zzso fragments of zzso extending from zzso to zzso showed a progressive increase in zzso The zzso forms of zzso zzso and zzso were approximately zzso or less potent than their zzso zzso The significant increases in zzso produced by the addition of the zzso and zzso zzso sequence even to these zzso forms further emphasizes the importance of these regions for interaction at the zzso zzso
