zzso II of the zzso type zzso c zzso contains a zzso copper center zzso which functions as the entry point for electrons donated by zzso zzso We have introduced zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso center in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso fully assembled zzso complexes were analyzed by various techniques, including zzso optical zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso to determine metal to protein zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso site is transformed into a zzso copper zzso In contrast to wild type, the zzso zzso does no longer exhibit the characteristic zzso band in the zzso region of the optical spectrum that has been assigned to zzso These major changes in the zzso site of this zzso correlate with an almost complete loss in zzso zzso
