Using the reverse zzso of zzso followed by the zzso chain reaction, we cloned the zzso for the rat zzso zzso I and II, which are produced by alternative zzso from a single zzso and developed a system for their expression in zzso zzso The homogeneous preparations of these zzso without zzso zzso showed zzso activity with zzso having various zzso zzso The two types of the zzso exhibited different zzso zzso with respect to the zzso zzso zzso zzso I showing the optimum activity at shorter zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso
