Recent findings suggested that zzso in insulin zzso zzso expression might be involved in the molecular mechanism of insulin zzso Using reverse zzso reaction followed by competitive zzso chain reaction, we measured the level of the zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso under conditions of decreased insulin effectiveness zzso aging, and zzso The liver expressed the zzso zzso with zzso 11 zzso and the hind limb skeletal muscles expressed the zzso without zzso zzso The heart and zzso zzso tissue expressed both zzso zzso and zzso diabetes increased the level of zzso zzso in the liver but did not modify the zzso between the two zzso The modification of the expression ratio, in favor of the form with zzso 11, found by some authors in the skeletal muscle of zzso patients was not observed in rat muscles that expressed zzso zzso of the form without zzso 11 under all the conditions zzso In zzso zzso the proportion of both zzso zzso was never altered zzso of zzso zzso zzso while the total zzso zzso concentration changed markedly during zzso or zzso The only modification observed in the zzso distribution was a significant decrease in zzso zzso concentration in the liver, muscle, and heart of old zzso We conclude that alternative zzso of insulin zzso zzso is not involved in the impairment of insulin action during zzso or zzso Its potential role in the insulin resistance of old animals remains to be zzso
