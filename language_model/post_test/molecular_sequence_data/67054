zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso snake that lives in Southeast Asian zzso zzso and zzso swamps and that zzso primarily on zzso We have isolated, zzso and zzso a novel toxin from its zzso which we named zzso It is a zzso zzso of 77 zzso acid zzso with five zzso zzso In organ bath experiments, it displayed potent zzso zzso activity and zzso inhibited indirectly zzso zzso in chick zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, it induced much smaller and readily zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso More precisely, the chick muscle zzso zzso zzso was zzso more susceptible compared with the mouse zzso These data indicate that zzso has a zzso zzso zzso We chemically zzso zzso zzso it, and solved its crystal structure at zzso A by the molecular replacement zzso The toxin structure adopts a zzso zzso fold with an additional zzso zzso bond in the first loop and seven additional zzso at its N zzso which is blocked by a zzso acid zzso This is the first crystal structure of a zzso toxin from zzso snake zzso and the first fully characterized zzso zzso zzso illustrates the relationship between toxin specificity and the primary prey type that constitutes the zzso zzso
