Human and rat zzso and b zzso zzso silent zzso channel zzso zzso that modify the zzso properties of zzso These alternatively spliced zzso arise by the usage of an alternative site of zzso in zzso 1 producing an zzso acid zzso in the zzso between the first and second zzso zzso in zzso In human, the zzso zzso were detected by Northern zzso in brain kidney lung and zzso In brain, they were expressed in cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso products were detected in brain and zzso in zzso In zzso zzso in rat brain shows that zzso zzso are expressed in cortex, zzso cortical structures, zzso zzso structures, zzso and in many zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso present a zzso that show a progression from high level of expression in the zzso area to a weak level in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso areas had low levels throughout the zzso Several small zzso were also labeled in the thalamus, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso or b zzso in zzso zzso produced smaller currents that in the zzso injected zzso and a moderate reduction of the zzso rate without any appreciable change in recovery from zzso or zzso dependence of zzso or zzso At higher zzso zzso also reduces the zzso rate and a more important reduction in the zzso zzso The gene that encodes for zzso zzso maps to zzso zzso in human, zzso in rat and zzso in zzso locations consistent with the known zzso for human, rat and mouse zzso
