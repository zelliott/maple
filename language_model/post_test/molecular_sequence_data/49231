In zzso zzso zzso is an essential gene involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso restriction of amplified zzso zzso previously proposed as the most zzso analysis, showed no zzso among 144 zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso However, these strains fell into three statistically significant zzso production level zzso zzso sequences of 13 strains belonging to the three zzso groups revealed a zzso restriction site only in good zzso zzso This result was confirmed on the 144 zzso 82 of which were identified as zzso producers by both zzso and amplified zzso zzso restriction zzso They are candidates as potential zzso zzso
