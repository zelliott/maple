zzso populations in a human zzso virus type 1 zzso individual behave as a zzso with a rated distribution of fitness zzso Fitness zzso in naturally occurring viral populations have been difficult to study due to the lack of markers for individual virus clones and complicating zzso and zzso factors like the presence of multiple cell types with distinct zzso differences in route of transmission, and intervening zzso Here, we zzso the relative fitness in zzso of three zzso of zzso marked by zzso at zzso 41 and 215 of reverse zzso zzso directly related to zzso resistance in an zzso individual who was infected by a zzso strain transmitted from a donor on zzso The transmission event did not have a substantial impact on the distribution of zzso within the dominant virus population replicating to high levels in the zzso The evolution of the zzso gene was monitored for 20 zzso All 102 clones obtained from the donor and the recipient at the different time points contained the zzso zzso which is associated with a fourfold reduction in zzso zzso The zzso at position 41 was stable, although it was zzso by zzso and zzso triplets that zzso in abundance partially due to founder effects of clones with zzso zzso at zzso zzso Of the three zzso in the patient, distinguished by a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso at the 215 position of zzso the relative fitness of the zzso zzso was calculated to be 10 to zzso higher than the initial zzso zzso and the relative fitness of the zzso zzso was zzso higher than that of the zzso zzso Similar to other zzso zzso zzso populations like zzso in patients with a high virus load apparently consist of a broader spectrum of fitness zzso than the 1 to zzso fitness difference sufficient for significant zzso zzso
