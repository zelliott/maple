The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso a type 1 zzso protein zzso isolated from zzso zzso seeds, has been determined by automated zzso degradation and zzso mass zzso zzso consists of 234 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of 26 zzso zzso All zzso acid zzso involved in the formation of the zzso active site zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are fully zzso Furthermore, a fast zzso experiment showed that two out of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso bridge, while zzso is in the zzso form, which makes it suitable for linking carrier molecules to generate zzso and other zzso
