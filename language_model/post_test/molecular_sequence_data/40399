zzso protein with death domain zzso was originally reported as a zzso zzso zzso that mediates zzso zzso Recent studies have revealed a potential role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle regulation and zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso have been associated with the transformed zzso in many zzso and is therefore a potential target for therapeutic zzso In an effort to delineate signaling events that lead to zzso zzso and to identify novel compounds that impinge on this pathway, the authors developed a zzso reporter for zzso zzso zzso The reporter zzso zzso for a zzso screen zzso measures zzso in response to zzso of zzso zzso activity in live zzso In addition, the potential use of the reporter cell line in the rapid evaluation of zzso properties of zzso hits in mouse models has been zzso
