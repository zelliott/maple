We isolated two new PAL zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso are clustered and zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence in the coding region of zzso was zzso identical to that of zzso The promoter regions of zzso zzso and zzso have several elements zzso among many zzso zzso zzso We measured the zzso levels of the four PAL genes by zzso mapping using total zzso from stem zzso developing secondary zzso zzso showed that the transcript level of zzso was higher than that of the other PAL zzso
