X zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that arose spontaneously in a zzso strain of zzso zzso originally containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the same size as zzso but shares no zzso with zzso X zzso with zzso and direct zzso sequencing of X showed that the first zzso 25 base pairs (of the X positive zzso and at least the last 110 base pairs of the 3' end were identical to the ends of zzso zzso X showed zzso inheritance and, like zzso was dependent on zzso for its zzso X was zzso in zzso particles whose major coat protein was provided by zzso (as is true for zzso and X was found in zzso particles with one to eight X molecules per zzso This finding confirms our zzso zzso model originally proposed for zzso and zzso Like zzso or zzso X lowers the copy number of zzso especially in a ski zzso Surprisingly, X requires many zzso zzso genes that are necessary for zzso but not for zzso
