High zzso resistance resulting from insensitive zzso zzso has emerged in zzso A single zzso zzso of the zzso zzso explains this high resistance in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso In order to provide better documentation of the zzso gene and the effect of the zzso zzso we present a zzso structure model of zzso showing that this unique substitution is localized in the zzso hole, explaining the zzso zzso and its interference with the zzso zzso zzso As the zzso creates a restriction site, a simple zzso test was devised to detect its presence in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso species belonging to different zzso zzso and zzso It is zzso that this zzso also explains the high resistance found in other zzso and the present results indicate that the zzso test detects the zzso zzso in the malaria zzso zzso zzso The zzso has thus occurred independently at least four times in mosquitoes and this zzso test is probably of broad zzso within the zzso zzso
