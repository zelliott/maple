The zzso of the human stomach and the influence of zzso zzso colonization on its composition remain largely zzso We characterized bacterial diversity within the human gastric zzso by using a small zzso zzso zzso clone library approach and analyzed zzso sequences generated by zzso bacterial zzso from 23 gastric zzso biopsy zzso A diverse community of 128 zzso was identified, featuring diversity at this site greater than previously zzso The majority of sequences were assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ten percent of the zzso were previously zzso including a zzso zzso relatives of which have been found in extreme environments but not reported before in zzso The gastric clone libraries from 19 subjects contained zzso zzso zzso however, only 12 of these subjects tested positive for zzso zzso by conventional laboratory zzso zzso analysis revealed a large degree of zzso zzso of the gastric zzso The presence of zzso zzso did not affect the composition of the gastric zzso This gastric bacterial zzso data set was significantly different from sequence collections of the human mouth and esophagus described in other studies, indicating that the human stomach may be home to a distinct microbial zzso The gastric zzso may play important, zzso roles in human health and zzso
