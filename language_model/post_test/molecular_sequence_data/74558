The zzso family zzso zzso zzso comprises approximately 160 zzso and 2000 species divided in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso the later with 16 zzso The current paper represents the first attempt to estimate zzso relationships within zzso based on molecular zzso We use a total of zzso sequence alignment of four zzso the zzso coding genes zzso c zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso b zzso a portion of the nuclear zzso zzso and two zzso portions of the nuclear zzso zzso The zzso relationships of 72 terminal specimens were reconstructed using both maximum zzso and zzso zzso zzso Through the analysis of this empirical zzso we also provide comparisons among different a zzso zzso strategies and the use of mixture models in a zzso zzso Our comparisons suggest that mixture models overcome the benefits obtained by zzso the data according to zzso position and gene identity, as they provide better accuracy in zzso zzso The recovered maximum zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggest that the family zzso is zzso in respect with zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is also recovered by both zzso In contrast to a zzso zzso recently proposed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso form a zzso zzso
