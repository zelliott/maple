Seven peptides with zzso activity were isolated in pure form from an extract of the skin of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The peptides were identified as belonging to the zzso (three zzso zzso (one zzso zzso (three zzso and zzso (one zzso zzso zzso zzso containing three zzso zzso represented the zzso with highest potency against zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso against zzso coli, zzso zzso against zzso zzso and 50 zzso against zzso zzso and the greatest zzso activity against human zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso with only a single zzso zzso showed weak zzso and zzso zzso zzso relationships among zzso zzso frogs are less well understood than those of North American zzso but the primary structures of the zzso zzso zzso peptides suggest a close relationship of this species with the Japanese pond frogs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
