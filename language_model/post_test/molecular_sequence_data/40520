zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is essential for zzso of both the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso branch of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, and is zzso by binding of the zzso scaffold protein to the zzso membrane zzso We found that zzso has two major zzso and zzso and one minor zzso binding sites for zzso zzso binds zzso zzso and can transmit signals to both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in contrast, binds zzso only when zzso is zzso by zzso under zzso conditions and zzso the signal zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso by activated zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso from zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso together with zzso protein zzso reduces the zzso activity of the zzso and the mating zzso zzso Thus, dynamic regulation of zzso interaction zzso the zzso signaling zzso
