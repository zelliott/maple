The importance of zzso factor zzso zzso pathways in the zzso of zzso differentiation has been recognized relatively zzso zzso studies have revealed that zzso proteins are important regulators of two major molecular and cellular processes critical for zzso cell zzso zzso formation and the expression of zzso zzso However, whether zzso proteins mediate these key processes in a separate or coordinated fashion remains zzso Moreover, knowledge on the contribution of zzso dynamics to the zzso mechanisms zzso by these proteins to perform their function is zzso Here we report the characterization of two zzso zzso mechanisms by which zzso also known as zzso zzso growth zzso early gene 2) and zzso zzso zzso onset diabetes of the young zzso regulates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso First, zzso activates zzso by binding to a distinct zzso site within the zzso promoter zzso to zzso and recruiting the zzso zzso zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso is partially antagonized by zzso protein 1 zzso the code reader for zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso Interestingly, zzso regulates neurotransmitter zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cell populations without affecting zzso zzso Overall, these studies highlight zzso zzso and zzso as key zzso mechanisms modulating zzso neurotransmitter gene zzso These data extend our knowledge of zzso zzso events that maintain key zzso features of differentiated zzso zzso
