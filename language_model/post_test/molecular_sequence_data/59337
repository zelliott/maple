zzso of the zzso tumor zzso protein has been demonstrated to block cell growth by inducing either a transient cell cycle arrest or programmed cell death zzso Although evidence exists linking zzso function as an zzso of zzso to its ability to effect cell cycle arrest, the role of this activity in the induction of zzso remains zzso To gain insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso a study was initiated to explore the functions of a putative zzso signaling zzso This region of the human zzso protein is localized between zzso acids 61 and 94 (out of zzso and is noteworthy in that it contains five repeats of the sequence zzso (where P represents zzso and X any zzso zzso This motif has been shown to play a role in signal zzso via its zzso domain binding zzso A zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso pro zzso which lacks this entire zzso domain zzso for zzso acids zzso was created and characterized for a variety of zzso zzso The entire domain has been shown to be completely zzso for zzso zzso On the other hand, this deletion of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso ability to suppress tumor cell growth in zzso zzso acid substitution zzso at zzso 22 and 23 of zzso zzso zzso zzso also impair zzso zzso of cell growth in zzso Unlike zzso zzso the delta zzso zzso zzso can be zzso expressed in tumor derived cell lines with few immediate zzso zzso These cells express zzso levels of zzso protein that are induced normally in response to DNA damage, indicating that removal of the zzso domain does not disrupt zzso upstream regulation by DNA zzso These data indicate that, in addition to the zzso zzso domain, the zzso zzso domain plays a critical role in the transmission of zzso signals zzso of the zzso protein and may link zzso to a direct signal zzso zzso
