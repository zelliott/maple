The zzso sites in native zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso have been analyzed using sequence analysis, mass zzso analysis, and solid-state zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso sequence analysis, and mass zzso analysis, the zzso sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and bovine zzso zzso have been zzso Various solid-state zzso methods using magic angle spinning have been applied to ascertain the local structure and dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso calcium zzso within the zzso Contributions from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso located in the zzso portion of the zzso to the mobile constituents of the zzso were assigned by comparison with zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of zzso zzso from the various species in the dissolved zzso zzso of the zzso magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance zzso of zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso indicates that the zzso from these species are very similar but not zzso
