Stage conversion between the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important aspect in the zzso of zzso In an initial investigation of molecular regulation of stage conversion in zzso zzso we describe the cloning and characterization of a zzso expressed gene zzso zzso formation was induced in cell culture by alkaline zzso and this was followed by zzso of this zzso stage using magnetic cell zzso A zzso zzso library was constructed by random amplification using the zzso chain zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence derived from the 687 zzso open reading frame showed similarity to the zzso zzso region of small zzso proteins from zzso zzso expression of the naturally occurring 30 zzso zzso in zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso generated against the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a zzso location of this zzso in zzso The expression of zzso seems to be regulated at the zzso level, since reverse zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso amplified transcripts in zzso only, not in zzso
