The zzso complex consists of four zzso proteins and was shown to be exclusively distributed in zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the pattern of expression of the zzso and proteins of the zzso zzso during cell differentiation in a culture of zzso All four zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells, and expression of the zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso following muscle cell zzso However, zzso proteins were scarcely zzso in zzso cells and were first detected 2 days after the induction to be zzso The zzso of the zzso protein zzso was accompanied by cell zzso The zzso between the expression of the zzso and proteins of the zzso zzso in zzso cells may be ascribed to rapid degradation of the zzso
