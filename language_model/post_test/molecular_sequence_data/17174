zzso zzso zzso catalyze the reduction of zzso into zzso which constitute the precursor pools used for DNA synthesis and zzso zzso in these pools increase zzso rates and are zzso to the zzso Balanced precursor pools are maintained primarily through the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso Here, the molecular mechanism of the zzso zzso specificity regulation is revealed through the structures of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso both in complexes with four zzso zzso pairs and in three complexes with only zzso The mechanism is based on the flexibility of loop 2, a key structural element, which forms a bridge between the specificity zzso and zzso zzso zzso specificity is achieved as different zzso and their zzso zzso stabilize specific discrete loop 2 zzso The mechanism of zzso specificity regulation is probably general for most class I and class II zzso
