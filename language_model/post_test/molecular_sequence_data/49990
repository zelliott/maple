In trout and zzso the major zzso expression site for zzso forms is in the zzso A zzso zzso a new zzso zzso member was isolated from rainbow trout zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso followed by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso In a set of two zzso for zzso a consensus sequence in the highly zzso regions in 17 zzso sequences was used for one zzso and the second primer was designed based on adapter sequence zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso end zzso sequences of zzso products were used for the zzso sites for the full-length zzso in zzso The resulting zzso zzso contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso protein zzso zzso with 26 zzso acid differences from that of the previously cloned rainbow trout zzso The zzso was assigned as zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rainbow trout zzso was zzso identical with trout zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso alignment zzso Northern zzso by a zzso zzso probe showed that the major expression site was the zzso zzso rather than the liver in both male and female zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso was constructed under zzso promoter of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus and used to express zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso The Western zzso showed that the expressed zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso and was recognized by zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso showed zzso activities for the 6 zzso 2 zzso and 16 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso a second form of zzso with steroid zzso activity, zzso has been cloned from rainbow trout and the major site of expression was in the zzso zzso
