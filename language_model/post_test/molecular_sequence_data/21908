zzso is a highly zzso small zzso protein that is involved in regulating zzso in zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized a highly zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso a zzso pathogen of zzso zzso is, at least in part, functionally equivalent to zzso zzso zzso since it restores the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by expression of an zzso zzso or a dominant negative form of zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso differentiation under zzso conditions, suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso development in this zzso We also examined the possible linkage between zzso and Ras zzso zzso of a dominant active zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso growth under zzso zzso This zzso was similar to that of our previously reported dominant active Ras zzso zzso zzso Also consistent with our observations of the zzso Ras zzso high levels of zzso oxygen species zzso were observed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso restored the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in spore zzso virtually no zzso zzso and earlier zzso again similar to what we observed in a dominant negative Ras zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso Ras resulted in zzso rates close to zzso levels, while zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso Ras zzso restored the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is positioned as a downstream zzso of zzso to regulate spore zzso and zzso zzso
