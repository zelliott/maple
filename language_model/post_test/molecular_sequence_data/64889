Mothers of children who have zzso zzso have been reported to be at increased risk for development of breast zzso To test whether sequence zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso are associated with breast zzso the authors compared the frequency of zzso zzso sequence changes in patients with breast zzso with the corresponding frequency in control zzso 

The authors zzso zzso zzso from 91 patients with breast zzso and compared the zzso of sequence changes in these patients with the corresponding zzso in a control sample of zzso individuals with no history of zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients with breast zzso had one or more zzso changes in zzso Three genetic zzso were found in at least two zzso These zzso resulted in zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was more common in patients with breast zzso than in the control patients, with respective zzso of zzso (5 of 75 zzso and zzso (12 of zzso zzso zzso Fisher zzso exact zzso The zzso of patients with bilateral breast zzso had a zzso frequency of zzso (2 of 17 zzso which again was significantly different from what was observed in the control group zzso Fisher zzso exact zzso The zzso zzso of the other two zzso were not different between case patients and control zzso 

Patients with breast zzso particularly those with bilateral disease, were more likely to have a zzso in the zzso gene that resulted in a zzso substitution in the gene zzso Additional studies are needed to evaluate the potential functional consequences of the zzso substitution and confirm the relevance of this zzso in the development of breast zzso
