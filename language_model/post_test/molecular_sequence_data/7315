We used direct zzso sequencing to determine the zzso organization of the region downstream from the G gene of viral zzso zzso virus zzso a fish zzso This region contains a gene coding for a zzso identified as zzso protein zzso and the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso organization was confirmed to be zzso In both a virulent European zzso and an zzso North American zzso strain, the zzso gene is transcribed into a small zzso that codes for a protein of 122 zzso zzso It has no significant sequence similarity with the infectious zzso necrosis virus zzso protein nor with any other known zzso We expressed the zzso protein as a fusion protein with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and used the zzso fusion protein to zzso zzso The rabbit zzso zzso from infected cell zzso not from zzso cells or zzso zzso protein of 14 zzso well in accordance with the expected zzso gene product zzso The prediction that the zzso protein is a zzso protein is supported by its absence from mature zzso although it is present in infected zzso
