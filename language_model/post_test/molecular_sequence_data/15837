In order to study the interaction between zzso zzso and representative human DNA in a highly defined manner, zzso sequence DNA was isolated from two human parental cancer lines (one of head and neck zzso cell origin, zzso and one of breast zzso origin, zzso as well as from three zzso cell lines derived from the parental zzso The zzso zzso were then cloned and tested for zzso with published consensus sequence zzso zzso zzso with the consensus sequence varied between zzso and zzso for all of the cloned zzso DNA tested and there was no significant difference for zzso derived versus resistant zzso derived zzso zzso These results suggest, as expected, that resistance to the zzso zzso drug zzso is not the result of a general zzso in DNA base sequence from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso which are less favorable binding zzso The highly zzso abundant zzso sequence DNA should provide an excellent model for investigating the interaction between various DNA active drugs and human zzso
