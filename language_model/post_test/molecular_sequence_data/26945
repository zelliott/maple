We describe the expression of zzso zzso from zzso transformed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into a culture medium with a molecular mass of approximately 29 zzso zzso scanning showed that the zzso zzso accounted for approximately zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso to zzso using a simple zzso zzso affinity zzso The identity of the zzso protein was confirmed as human zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited human zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso The concentration at zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso expressed in zzso transformed zzso cells was approximately zzso zzso A maximum production level of 11 zzso zzso zzso was obtained in a zzso culture of zzso cells after 6 days of zzso
