The isolated zzso zzso domain of the zzso adapter protein zzso zzso zzso zzso exists in a dynamic equilibrium between a folded zzso and an unfolded zzso state under zzso buffer conditions zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34, zzso The effect of binding a zzso zzso derived from the protein zzso a biological target of the zzso zzso domain, on this equilibrium has been zzso The stabilization of the zzso folded state upon binding provides an example of the link between binding and protein folding or zzso We have compared zzso parameters of the zzso state with those of a zzso state in 2 M zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrate that interactions in a region encompassing zzso zzso zzso 28 in the zzso state are zzso upon addition of zzso zzso Data from an zzso zzso experiment as well as recently developed methods provide more zzso structural information than described zzso showing the presence of preferential structure in both unfolded zzso zzso zzso observed in both unfolded states as well as chemical shifts and zzso zzso suggest a rapid equilibrium between extended structure and zzso structures which may play a role in initiation of protein zzso However, differences in detailed structural features between the two unfolded states argue that caution is needed in interpretation of results from structural characterization of protein zzso states generated using zzso zzso
