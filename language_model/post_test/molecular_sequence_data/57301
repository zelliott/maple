zzso beta zzso zzso transcripts have been identified in a number of zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso probe to screen a normal human zzso zzso library we have isolated 22 zzso zzso These clones could be divided into four zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that one group of clones zzso to functional and another group zzso to zzso zzso zzso The other two groups are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which are members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in normal human zzso zzso and zzso analysis, along with zzso chain reaction amplification further confirm the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso
