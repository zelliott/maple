zzso zzso zzso have been well known to be responsible for the synthesis of zzso compounds and the metabolism of zzso compounds in almost all living organisms, which require zzso zzso zzso zzso as an electron donor to zzso In this study, a zzso zzso open reading frame of zzso gene was cloned from zzso Roman zzso liver, zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that chicken zzso shares high zzso with other zzso zzso and possesses the zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequences of zzso genes from chicken and other four zzso have highly zzso zzso organization zzso By fusion with bacterial signal zzso chicken zzso gene was functionally expressed in zzso coli membrane and showed activities in reduction of zzso c and zzso of zzso The zzso values for zzso c and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso mechanism was proposed for chicken zzso
