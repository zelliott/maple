Recently we described an zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso gag zzso zzso In this study we have isolated an zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of influenza A zzso The shortest zzso recognized by zzso T zzso zzso is eight zzso acids long, zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of these two zzso zzso restricted peptides reveals zzso which can be aligned from one zzso to the zzso Of the eight zzso two are zzso zzso and zzso Both peptides have a positively charged zzso at the N zzso zzso at position 265 of gag and zzso at position zzso of zzso Using modified peptides we have shown that zzso or zzso is crucial for the interaction with zzso zzso The zzso gag zzso blocked zzso recognition of zzso zzso by zzso zzso but removal of the zzso prevented zzso of zzso zzso zzso The importance of these charged zzso was confirmed by the observation that truncated zzso and gag peptides where the zzso or zzso was removed were not recognized by specific zzso Further studies showed that the zzso zzso influenced the association of the gag zzso with zzso zzso because the affinity of the gag zzso for zzso was strongly increased after replacing this zzso with a zzso or a zzso However, these peptides were not recognized by zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso may interact with both zzso zzso and T cell zzso These observations should help in the identification of zzso zzso peptides from other viruses or zzso
