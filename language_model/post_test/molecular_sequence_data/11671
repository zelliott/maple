zzso factor zzso is a zzso which binds factor zzso The zzso complex serves as a potent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an immediate early zzso may also play a role in cell zzso zzso of zzso was correlated with some types of zzso 

zzso zzso and tumor human zzso zzso cells were used in the zzso The differential display zzso technique was used to identify genes zzso expressed in the zzso zzso expression patterns were examined by Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso of cultured cells, and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso 

In a zzso display, an amplified zzso chain reaction zzso product was found in normal and immortalized human zzso zzso cells but not in the breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The result showed that the zzso was identical to human tissue zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that expression level of tissue factor zzso remained high in growing, zzso and zzso normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also confirmed tissue factor expression pattern in the cell lines zzso zzso zzso showed that tissue factor was expressed in the normal zzso and zzso cells of some ducts but not zzso No zzso was observed in invasive zzso zzso However, zzso cell zzso was seen in some residual zzso structures in invasive zzso 

This study shows the use of zzso to reveal the loss of zzso expression pattern in human breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso results showed breast zzso cells expressed little zzso if any, suggesting that zzso is not required for breast tumor cell zzso The results also indicated that zzso expression was independent of the proliferation status of the expressing zzso The expression pattern of zzso may be a meaningful marker in the development of breast zzso
