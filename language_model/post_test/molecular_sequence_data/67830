zzso with their high affinity and zzso are widely zzso in the field of protein engineering, medicinal chemistry, and zzso applications, and our recent studies have demonstrated the recognition and binding of zzso for the surface on zzso zzso In this study, we generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso techniques and showed the availability of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso as interface zzso After a zzso zzso sequence was grafted into one of the zzso determining regions of a single variable domain of a zzso camel zzso a zzso library approach raised by 20 times the affinity of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso spontaneously zzso on gold zzso and consequently the zzso formed a stable zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constructed on the zzso platform by means of fusion technology zzso gold zzso in one pot, and these zzso zzso could be used to obtain surface zzso resonance scattering images of cancer cells and to spontaneously link two different zzso Here, we propose the zzso zzso as convenient interface molecules in the zzso zzso
