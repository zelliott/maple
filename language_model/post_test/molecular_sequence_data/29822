zzso is abundant in cardiovascular tissue and active in the metabolism of zzso acid to zzso that possess potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the entire zzso gene zzso zzso zzso which contains nine zzso and eight zzso We then zzso the zzso zzso and zzso boundaries in 72 healthy persons representing zzso Asian, and zzso populations as part of the National Institutes of zzso Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Environmental Genome Single zzso zzso zzso A variety of zzso were found, four of which resulted in coding changes zzso zzso zzso and zzso A fifth zzso zzso was identified by screening a human heart zzso zzso All five zzso zzso of zzso were generated by zzso zzso and expressed in zzso insect cells by using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso with zzso zzso to zzso and displayed typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso and zzso zzso also had prominent spectral zzso at zzso zzso The ability of these zzso to metabolize zzso acid and zzso acid was compared with that of zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significantly reduced metabolism of both zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed significantly reduced activity toward zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso showed similar metabolism to zzso zzso for both zzso zzso Based on these data, we conclude that zzso zzso of the human zzso gene exist and that some of these zzso result in a zzso protein that has reduced zzso zzso zzso as zzso products have effects in the cardiovascular system, we speculate that these zzso may be functionally zzso
