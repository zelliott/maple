zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso produced by zzso oxygen zzso in DNA and its zzso In this work, zzso zzso zzso was chemically zzso and extensively zzso by zzso The electron withdrawing zzso group facilitated zzso of zzso Thus, p K a of the base unit of zzso was zzso significantly lower than that of parent zzso zzso K a zzso zzso as zzso zzso efficiently replaced zzso during DNA replication zzso by zzso coli DNA zzso I zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso free) and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso of the replication products by zzso revealed that when incorporated as zzso incorporation of zzso was virtually uniform, suggesting minor sequence context effects on the incorporation frequency of zzso zzso also replaced zzso but with much lower efficiency than that for zzso The substitution efficiency for zzso increased with increasing pH from zzso to zzso The parallel correlation between zzso of the base unit of zzso zzso K a zzso zzso and the substitution efficiency for zzso strongly suggests that the zzso form of zzso is involved in zzso with template zzso These data indicate that zzso can be specifically introduced into DNA as unique zzso by in zzso DNA zzso zzso In addition, zzso is potentially zzso since this zzso is much more prone to form zzso with G than parent zzso
