The complete zzso acid sequence of an zzso named zzso II, isolated from the skin zzso of zzso zzso was determined by sequencing of the protein and its peptides generated by zzso and chemical zzso zzso II consisted of 135 zzso acids zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso II was found to be only zzso zzso in sequence to zzso I which was previously determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso with diverse molecular properties are present in the skin zzso of zzso zzso However, it was confirmed by analysis of the secondary structures using circular zzso that both zzso I and II shared similar folds characterized by beta zzso zzso I and II showed different molecular properties such as zzso pH dependency for zzso activity and for binding specificity against the zzso zzso of zzso zzso I showed more strict recognition specificity for zzso than did zzso zzso Furthermore, the effects of chemical modification on zzso I and II were investigated in order to identify the type of zzso acids involved in their different zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activities of zzso However, modification of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid zzso led to considerable loss of their activities, and a different mode of binding activity was observed between modified zzso I and zzso These results suggest that multiple zzso from zzso zzso with the same scaffold have different biological functions and zzso
