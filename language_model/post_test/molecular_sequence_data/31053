Human zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso In order to obtain correct expression of the human zzso zzso a few bases on one strand were zzso by the corresponding zzso zzso but those bases were not replaced in the complementary so a few zzso bases zzso The gene was cloned into a shuttle zzso (with zzso The zzso containing different human zzso DNA sequences were separated by zzso restriction zzso We compared the expression level of human zzso from two kinds of genes and the results showed that the zzso expression level by the gene containing zzso sequences was lower zzso zzso than that expressed by the original gene zzso zzso
