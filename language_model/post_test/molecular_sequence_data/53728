zzso is a zzso zzso originally obtained from the zzso zzso zzso Because it has a high sensitivity to calcium zzso and is biologically zzso zzso is widely used as a probe to monitor zzso levels of free zzso The zzso zzso contains four zzso zzso zzso of which three can bind zzso The zzso also contains zzso as its zzso zzso When calcium is added, the protein complex zzso into zzso zzso and zzso accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso into active zzso in the absence of calcium by incubation with zzso oxygen and a zzso zzso Cloning and expression of the complementary DNA for zzso were first reported in 1985 zzso 2, zzso and growth of zzso of the zzso protein has been zzso however, techniques have only recently been developed to prepare zzso zzso of the highest zzso permitting a full zzso zzso Here we report the structure of zzso zzso determined by X-ray zzso zzso is found to be a zzso zzso containing a zzso core cavity that zzso the zzso zzso The structure shows protein components stabilizing the zzso and suggests a mechanism by which calcium zzso may zzso
