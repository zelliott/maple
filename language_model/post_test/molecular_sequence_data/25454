The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso In total, a sequence of zzso zzso pairs was determined wherein a single zzso of 1011 zzso zzso a zzso of 336 zzso acids having zzso similarity with the zzso coli zzso gene product, was zzso A region of zzso symmetry exists within the leader region zzso the potential for the formation of a stable secondary structure in the zzso end of the zzso zzso from several regulatory zzso were located within the region of zzso symmetry which would impart changes in the transcript within the putative secondary structure, implicating the secondary structure in zzso zzso extension analysis revealed multiple zzso start sites located six to nine zzso downstream from the zzso box, with the primary initiation site differing in zzso and zzso growth zzso The results are discussed in terms of a zzso zzso model for regulation of zzso zzso
