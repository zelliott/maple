The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated by two 28 zzso elements zzso located in the zzso that bind a factor called zzso This regulation requires the zzso gene zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and the human zzso zzso are zzso regulated by elements that are functionally equivalent to zzso Here, we zzso the zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso repress translation of a reporter zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Furthermore, they regulate zzso tail length and bind zzso We also find that the zzso zzso control translation and zzso tail length in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, these same organisms contain a factor that specifically associates with the zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the zzso control being present in zzso and zzso zzso Three lines of evidence indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso controlled in zzso by zzso First, like zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso control translation and zzso tail lengths in zzso and zzso cells, zzso Second, the same factor in zzso and zzso cells that binds to the zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Third, deletion of the zzso zzso increases zzso ability to transform zzso These findings suggest that zzso control is zzso and regulates the expression of other zzso
