Three peptides with zzso activity toward zzso zzso coli have been zzso from a zzso digest of bovine zzso All peptides were zzso and originated from the zzso of the zzso in a region where a zzso zzso zzso B, had been previously zzso The most potent zzso zzso I, was almost identical to zzso zzso the sequence corresponded to zzso 17 to 42, and the molecular mass was zzso as determined by mass zzso A second, less active zzso zzso II, consisted of two zzso zzso 1 to 16 and 43 to 48 zzso mass of zzso linked by a single zzso zzso The third zzso zzso III, also a zzso zzso corresponded to zzso 1 to 48 zzso mass of zzso zzso between zzso 42 and zzso zzso I and II displayed zzso activity toward a number of zzso and food zzso zzso and zzso I inhibited the growth of zzso zzso at zzso as low as 2 zzso zzso growth zzso showed that zzso effects of peptides I and II were zzso within 30 zzso of zzso The results confirmed and extended those of earlier studies suggesting that the zzso domain of zzso was localized in the zzso and did not involve zzso zzso
