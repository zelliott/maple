In this study, two zzso bacterial strains were isolated from the China zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the strains belonged to the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that they clustered together and are most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids of the novel strains were zzso zzso : 1 A, zzso : 0 and zzso : zzso Both strains contained zzso zzso and one unidentified zzso in the cell zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso tests allowed the zzso and zzso differentiation of strains zzso and zzso from related zzso However, their high zzso zzso showed that they belong to the same novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected as the type strain to represent this novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
