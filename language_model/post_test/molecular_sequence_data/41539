zzso impacts are an increasing threat to the diversity of fishes, especially in areas around large urban zzso and many effective conservation actions depend on accurate species zzso Considering the utility of DNA zzso as a global system for species identification and discovery, this study aims to assemble a DNA zzso reference sequence library for marine zzso from the coastal region of zzso Paulo State, zzso The standard zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene was zzso amplified and zzso zzso from zzso individuals belonging to 135 zzso A zzso analysis revealed that this approach can zzso discriminate zzso of the species zzso Most species exhibited low zzso genetic distances zzso about zzso less than the distance among species within a zzso Four species showed higher zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso suggesting overlooked zzso zzso just one zzso exhibited zzso zzso of zzso This library is a first step to better know the molecular diversity of marine fish species from zzso zzso providing a basis for further studies of this zzso - extending the ability to identify these species from all life stages and even zzso remains, setting the stage for a better understanding of interactions among species, zzso the zzso about species composition and richness in an ecosystem, and providing tools for zzso zzso and monitoring illegal species zzso
