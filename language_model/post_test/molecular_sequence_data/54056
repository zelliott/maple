zzso play an important role in specific zzso zzso zzso Their expression appears to be tightly regulated during development and each tissue or cell type shows a characteristic pattern of zzso zzso zzso regulation of their expression levels or functionality has been observed in human zzso in many cases leading to aggravated cancer cell invasion and zzso The zzso form a zzso with at least six zzso which can be distinguished on the basis of protein domain zzso zzso structure, and zzso analysis of the protein zzso These zzso comprise classical or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, several zzso clearly occupy isolated positions in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and most zzso zzso We suggest a different evolutionary origin of the zzso and zzso zzso genes versus the genes zzso zzso zzso classical zzso and zzso zzso The present zzso analysis may accelerate the functional investigation of the whole zzso zzso by allowing focused research of zzso zzso within each zzso
