Six zzso clones add zzso zzso to the DNA sequence of the alpha 1 chain of basement membrane zzso zzso zzso Thus the complete zzso and derived zzso acid sequence of the alpha 1 type IV collagen with zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso acids with a calculated Mr of zzso is zzso The six zzso clones cover the putative zzso signal zzso the 7 S region and two thirds of the zzso region extending into the previously published zzso zzso sequence zzso Gene 43, zzso The protein sequence for zzso zzso acids of the zzso region adjacent to the 7 S region has not previously been published for any zzso
