We have identified a human zzso of the zzso zzso protein that is structurally altered by zzso zzso in acute zzso Human zzso zzso is a predicted 431 zzso protein containing two potential zzso motifs consisting of zinc fingers zzso with the fly protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs related to the zzso motifs in zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupt the zzso gene between these two zzso and in a zzso cell line fusion transcripts are expressed from both zzso zzso The more abundant zzso 11 transcript codes for a zzso protein containing the AT hook motifs fused to a previously zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso These data suggest a novel role for a zzso protein in zzso human zzso that may be zzso by DNA binding within the minor groove at zzso sites, implicated to play an important role in bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso
