The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a 45 zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso zzso acid zzso We have shown that this precursor is a zzso zzso carrying both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acids of the precursor showed zzso similarity with zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso similarity with zzso zzso zzso Three open reading frames were identified downstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coding for zzso of zzso 440 and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso As for zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso requires the expression of additional zzso The gene products of zzso and zzso are highly similar to zzso and zzso known to be necessary for the transport of zzso across the cell envelope and for its release into the external zzso zzso and functional studies indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is zzso by a mechanism similar to that described for zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso and zzso gene products, the presence of a third gene product specified by the zzso zzso
