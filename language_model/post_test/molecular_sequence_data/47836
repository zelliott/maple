zzso in a zzso acid zzso segment, immediately following the zzso signal anchor sequence of zzso zzso zzso have been shown to affect proper assembly of zzso and decrease activity of the zzso expressed in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in which zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for those of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region, exhibited increased activity when expressed in zzso zzso To examine further the basis for the increased activity of zzso in zzso cells, the protein was expressed in insect cells and zzso zzso The amounts of the functional zzso species of zzso expressed in these systems and the ratios of zzso to zzso were greater than those of zzso zzso zzso indicating that more efficient assembly zzso the increased activity of zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso could compensate for the decreased assembly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso were introduced into zzso If all 7 zzso acids in the zzso were deleted, no zzso active zzso zzso zzso or zzso was detected in zzso zzso or bacterial cells expressing the zzso The zzso zzso in which two zzso were zzso for the zzso had no zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, and minor amounts of zzso for this zzso were expressed in zzso coli and insect zzso In contrast, the same zzso in zzso reduced activity only 50% in zzso cells and markedly elevated levels of zzso expression in bacteria and insect zzso The zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activity of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in whole cell zzso of insect cells but reduced the activity of partially zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso introduced into the zzso region of zzso zzso can facilitate assembly of the proteins and partially reverse the decreased assembly resulting from the zzso zzso
