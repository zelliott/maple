The zzso root of zzso is an important zzso but insufficient zzso and zzso data are currently available to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso root formation and zzso zzso zzso sequencing is essential to generate a large transcript sequence data set for gene discovery and molecular marker zzso In this study, a total of zzso million clean reads were generated using zzso zzso sequencing zzso De zzso assembly generated zzso zzso with an average length of zzso Based on a sequence similarity search with known proteins or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consensus sequences showed zzso with sequences in the zzso zzso and zzso databases, zzso Of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were assigned to gene zzso categories and clusters of zzso groups, zzso A total of zzso zzso were assigned to 123 pathways in the zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso Analysis of transcript differences between libraries from the early and late zzso zzso stages demonstrated that starch and zzso metabolism and zzso zzso may be the dominant zzso events during zzso root formation and plant hormones probably play critical roles in regulation of this zzso zzso In total, zzso potential zzso were identified among the zzso and zzso primer pairs for zzso zzso were zzso zzso this study gave us a clue to understand the zzso zzso root formation and development, and also provided us with a valuable sequence resource for novel gene discovery and zzso selective breeding in zzso 

De zzso assembled and characterized the zzso zzso root zzso explored the mechanism of zzso zzso root zzso development of zzso markers in zzso
