We isolated the zzso for human zzso alpha zzso zzso from a human peripheral zzso library using two synthetic zzso as zzso zzso studies with this zzso showed that the zzso alpha zzso is zzso in all the rat zzso studied but is most abundant in zzso and within this zzso mainly zzso by zzso In the zzso zzso its expression is higher in zzso immature zzso than in zzso and zzso T zzso A quite similar pattern was obtained with the zzso protein zzso cell nuclear zzso These data show that zzso alpha zzso levels change with the maturation stage of zzso Moreover, the amount of zzso alpha transcript is increased in zzso from human patients with zzso Our findings indicate a role for zzso alpha linked to zzso zzso
