The objectives of this study were to zzso characterize and examine differences in proteins zzso de zzso and zzso by different regions of the zzso tract of the American zzso zzso zzso during three zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso After capture, zzso from lakes in north central Florida were zzso the zzso tract excised zzso the size of any zzso determined, and different functional regions of the tract dissected out and zzso for zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso activity indicated regional variations within the zzso differences among zzso groups and region by status zzso When zzso regions were considered regardless of zzso status, the greatest incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso zzso was by the anterior and zzso zzso and zzso tube compared with the transition zone and the zzso When status was included, the zzso activity of the anterior and zzso portion of the tract in zzso zzso was not different, whereas that of the zzso region of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of the anterior zzso This finding indicates that regulation of protein synthesis and zzso by the zzso zzso tract is different from that in the tract of the zzso zzso zzso media were zzso by one-dimensional and two-dimensional zzso and zzso Sixteen major proteins in culture media were identified as de zzso zzso by relative molecular weight, by zzso point and by differences in distribution determined for zzso status and zzso zzso Six proteins were examined by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso On the basis of a 29 zzso acid zzso the major zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso and tube of zzso alligators, was identical to the major protein isolated from zzso egg zzso Four proteins zzso were zzso and shown to be significantly related to zzso heavy chains from several zzso This study demonstrated that a large number of proteins are zzso de zzso and released by the female zzso zzso tract and that there are zzso activity differences by zzso status and zzso Six proteins have been identified, several of which may be incorporated into zzso egg zzso and some of which appear to be different from proteins found in the egg zzso of other zzso
