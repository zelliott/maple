T cell zzso is initiated by recognition of zzso zzso presented in complex with zzso molecules on the surface of zzso The mechanism by which this recognition occurs is still zzso and many models exist in the zzso zzso T cells have been shown to respond to soluble zzso of zzso class II zzso complexes, but not to soluble zzso In determining the zzso of zzso T cells to soluble zzso class I zzso complexes, a complicating phenomenon had been observed zzso zzso from soluble complexes was loaded onto cell surface zzso on the T cells and zzso to other T cells, clouding the true zzso requirement for zzso This study uses soluble zzso class I zzso zzso and zzso to stimulate zzso zzso T cells without the possible complication of zzso zzso The results show that zzso class I zzso bind to, but do not zzso zzso T cells whether the cells are in solution or zzso to a zzso zzso zzso class I binding can antagonize the stimulation triggered by soluble zzso a phenomenon also observed for zzso T zzso zzso engagement is necessary and sufficient to stimulate downstream zzso processes including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso even in T cells that do not express the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso dependence of the response of zzso T cells to soluble zzso zzso is the same as previously observed for zzso T zzso
