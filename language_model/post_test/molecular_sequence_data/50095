zzso regulation of genetic resistance to infectious disease may partially be explained by variation in the binding affinity and the repertoire of zzso zzso peptides associated with major zzso complex zzso zzso In this study, we investigated characteristics of peptides that bind to the bovine zzso zzso zzso which is associated with occurrence of clinical zzso in zzso dairy zzso and assigned a putative zzso motif to this zzso This was achieved by in zzso expression of zzso zzso as well as a control zzso zzso which is present at high frequency in zzso zzso cell lines alone (for zzso zzso or in combination with blood zzso cells from an animal zzso for zzso zzso were used as the source of naturally processed and presented zzso zzso to zzso of peptides from zzso cells, their sequences were determined by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso peptides were between 13 and 20 zzso acids long and the majority were in sets of overlapping zzso These peptides were derived from zzso and zzso zzso as well as foreign proteins present in the culture zzso Some peptides had originated from molecular zzso present in the zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso pointing to some degree of overlap and zzso between zzso class I and class II zzso presentation zzso zzso with reports of human and mouse zzso class zzso zzso putative zzso motifs could be assigned to zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso or an aromatic zzso at relative position 1, a zzso zzso at position 4 and a small zzso at position 6 of the zzso zzso These findings provide the foundation for future studies of molecular mechanisms of zzso associations of zzso
