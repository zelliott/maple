zzso zzso use zzso variation of their zzso surface zzso zzso coat as a defense against the host immune zzso Although about 1000 zzso and zzso genes are scattered throughout the zzso zzso each zzso expresses only one zzso while the rest of the genes are zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Venezuelan zzso was proven here to represent the soluble form of a zzso Initially, a zzso characterization of zzso was carried zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemical zzso provided zzso of the zzso nature of zzso The zzso parameters indicated that zzso is zzso with a zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso focusing and two-dimensional zzso gel zzso revealed that zzso contained two zzso with zzso points of zzso and zzso When zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments were zzso the same zzso sequence was zzso zzso which displayed a significant zzso with a putative zzso zzso zzso gene located on zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso established that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were confined to the surface of both zzso An zzso characterization of this zzso was also carried out using several Venezuelan zzso zzso zzso expressing different zzso which were obtained from naturally infected zzso Although zzso from animals infected with the various zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso only one zzso besides zzso contained zzso that were recognized by zzso zzso All these results together with prior zzso zzso zzso et zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso is the soluble form of a zzso zzso zzso containing common zzso recognized by zzso from animals infected with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Despite the huge repertoire of zzso genes existing on zzso zzso our data also demonstrated the potential use of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso isolate as a diagnostic zzso
