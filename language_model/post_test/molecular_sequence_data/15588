The zzso zzso and comparison of zzso and product zzso from a data independent zzso acquisition strategy with data dependent zzso is zzso The data independent mode of acquisition differs from an zzso data acquisition since no zzso transmission window is applied with the first mass zzso prior to collision induced zzso zzso the energy applied to the collision cell, between low and elevated energy, on a zzso basis, provides accurate mass precursor and associated product zzso zzso from every zzso above the zzso of the mass zzso The method therefore provides a near zzso duty cycle, with an inherent increase in signal intensity due to the fact that both precursor and product zzso data are collected on all zzso of every zzso across the entire zzso peak zzso The correlation of product to precursor zzso after zzso is achieved by using reconstructed retention time zzso and zzso peak zzso Presented are the results from the comparison of a simple four protein mixture, in the presence and absence of an zzso zzso protein extract from zzso zzso The samples were run in zzso by both data zzso analysis zzso zzso and zzso alternate scanning zzso The detection and identification of precursor and product zzso from the combined zzso search results of the four protein mixture were used for comparison to all other zzso Each individual set of zzso zzso data provides a more comprehensive set of detected zzso than the combined zzso identifications from the zzso zzso zzso In the presence of the complex zzso coli background, over zzso of the zzso masses from the combined zzso identifications were detected at the appropriate retention zzso Moreover, the fragmentation pattern and number of associated elevated energy product zzso in each replicate experiment was found to be very similar to the zzso zzso In the case of the corresponding individual zzso zzso experiment, zzso of the possible zzso peptides of interest were zzso The presented data illustrates that the zzso data from zzso alternate scanning zzso experiments is highly comparable to the data obtained via zzso The obtained information can therefore be effectively and correctly zzso to correlate product zzso with parent precursor zzso The ability to generate zzso zzso tables from this information and subsequently identify the correct parent precursor zzso will be illustrated in a companion zzso
