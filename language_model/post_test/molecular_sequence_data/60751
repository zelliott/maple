The zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of nitrate as the terminal electron zzso We identified two zzso genes zzso and zzso which are indispensable under these zzso zzso alignment identified significant similarity of the zzso gene product zzso and the zzso gene product zzso with zzso class III zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso abolished zzso growth and led to the formation of zzso zzso cells, a typical feature of bacteria whose DNA synthesis is zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso is dependent on a stable radical at a zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso exchange in zzso showed the zzso zzso as the deletion strain, suggesting that zzso forms the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso zzso indicate that zzso and zzso are zzso and that the translation efficiency of zzso is zzso higher than that of zzso Thus, the two proteins zzso and zzso are not zzso at a zzso zzso
