zzso zzso channel receptors mediate zzso zzso or zzso depending on their zzso charge zzso An investigation into the zzso of zzso charge selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was undertaken using point zzso to zzso lining the zzso and zzso ends of the zzso zzso Five zzso zzso were zzso A single substitution at the zzso mouth of the channel zzso zzso was sufficient to convert the channels to select zzso over zzso with zzso zzso zzso This result zzso the selectivity filter and provides evidence that zzso interactions between zzso zzso and pore zzso are a critical factor in zzso charge zzso The zzso zzso zzso retained its zzso selectivity zzso zzso zzso but it was much reduced compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso and the zzso zzso were combined zzso double zzso zzso zzso the relative zzso zzso was enhanced zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also zzso permeable zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso mouth of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso produced a more zzso channel zzso zzso zzso without drastically altering zzso charge selectivity zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which introduces a zzso charged ring at the zzso mouth of the channel, further enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with little effect on zzso selectivity zzso zzso zzso Estimates of the minimum pore diameter of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that these pores are larger than the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso being comparable in diameter to the zzso zzso zzso zzso This result provides evidence that the diameter of the zzso channel is also an important factor in zzso charge zzso
