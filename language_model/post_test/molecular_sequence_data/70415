Respiratory zzso virus zzso has been isolated from sheep suffering from respiratory tract zzso Since the greatest differences between bovine zzso and human zzso are found on the attachment G zzso we have determined the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the G gene of zzso zzso The latter contained zzso zzso and had a major open reading frame zzso a protein of 263 zzso and shared zzso zzso sequence identity with that of bovine zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso G protein showed only zzso zzso acid identity with the G protein of bovine zzso Despite the low level of identity, there were similarities in the predicted zzso profiles of the G proteins of zzso and bovine zzso The zzso sequences for the zzso and G-F gene junctions of zzso zzso showed 64 and 57% identity respectively with the corresponding regions of the bovine zzso Our results indicate that zzso and bovine zzso might be classified as two zzso of an zzso zzso
