zzso folding of zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso insulin zzso proceeds via one- and zzso zzso A zzso zzso intermediate in each case contains the zzso zzso zzso bridge zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in human zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso model of this zzso zzso One zzso zzso (19 zzso zzso spans zzso zzso zzso zzso positions zzso in the insulin zzso the other (18 zzso zzso spans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only half of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not well zzso zzso zzso elements corresponding to native zzso are nonetheless observed at 4 degrees zzso Furthermore, zzso nuclear zzso effects establish transient formation of a zzso partial zzso no non-native nuclear zzso effects are zzso Together, these observations suggest that early events in the folding of zzso zzso are zzso by a zzso molten zzso containing zzso and zzso We propose that nascent interactions within this zzso orient the zzso and zzso zzso for zzso bond formation and stabilize the zzso intermediate once zzso zzso in the corresponding region of insulin are associated with inefficient chain combination and impaired zzso zzso The intrinsic zzso zzso of a flexible zzso zzso thus define a folding nucleus, foreshadowing the structure of the native zzso
