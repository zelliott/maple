The zzso and zzso promoters of zzso zzso are zzso transcribed zzso zzso promoters that are positively activated by the zzso zzso zzso binds to upstream zzso sequences zzso usually located zzso zzso upstream of the start of zzso Bound zzso is presented to the zzso zzso 54 complex zzso zzso zzso via DNA loop formation, zzso by the binding of integration host factor protein zzso between E zzso 54 and zzso The zzso promoter sequence contains three potential zzso binding sites zzso 2 and 3) and two potential zzso zzso zzso sites zzso promoter zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso is located zzso zzso into the coding region and zzso zzso zzso by 5 zzso zzso and zzso analyses have shown efficient zzso of the zzso promoter requires that zzso is bound at zzso 2 and zzso zzso is initiated at zzso Only a weak interaction of zzso with the zzso overlapping zzso was zzso zzso demonstrated that E zzso 54 forms a closed complex at zzso but not zzso and that bound E zzso 54 closely approaches the zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity by zzso was not as great as that observed for other zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso promoter sequences zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This appeared to require zzso bound at the zzso zzso Thus, one additional role of zzso may be to partition zzso between the two promoters by constraining the zzso of the zzso
