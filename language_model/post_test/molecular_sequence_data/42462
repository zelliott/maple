zzso zzso zzso zzso two sequential zzso reactions to produce zzso from zzso via zzso In zzso proteins so far reported, two zzso zzso are zzso From the results of the studies on zzso zzso zzso it has been proposed that one of these two zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso formation at the zzso zzso step zzso and Gray zzso zzso 25, zzso To clarify the reaction zzso we investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in cabbage zzso Thus, zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the other zzso one, zzso were replaced with Ala, zzso or zzso All the zzso zzso zzso zzso both the alcohol zzso and zzso zzso zzso producing 1 zzso of zzso during the reduction of 2 zzso of zzso as did the wild type zzso zzso zzso at zzso did not cause significant changes in the zzso properties, zzso These zzso together with the results of detailed comparison of the zzso properties of zzso zzso clearly indicate that neither zzso nor zzso is involved in the reaction, and ruled out the involvement of zzso formation in the zzso zzso zzso
