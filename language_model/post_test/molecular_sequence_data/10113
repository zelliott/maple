zzso levels of zzso in the blood cause retinal zzso zzso genes implicated in retinal zzso metabolism represent candidates for inherited retinal zzso In the current study, molecular genetic analysis of a zzso pedigree segregating for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the affected siblings were zzso by descent for a zzso zzso substitution in zzso the gene zzso cellular zzso protein zzso This substitution is predicted to replace an zzso with zzso at zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso but is abundant in the retinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells of the zzso where it carries zzso and zzso When expressed in bacteria, zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso substitution was less soluble than zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the soluble cell zzso and the protein structure was verified by mass zzso The zzso protein lacked the ability to bind zzso These findings suggest that zzso in the current pedigree results from a lack of functional zzso presumably leading to disruption of retinal zzso zzso
