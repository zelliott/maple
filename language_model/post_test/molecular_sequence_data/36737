Mixed malaria infections zzso zzso and zzso zzso are suspected to occur at a greater frequency than is detected by conventional light zzso To determine this frequency we carried out a prospective zzso comparison of diagnosis by conventional light zzso and zzso amplification of the zzso gene extracted from dried spotted blood zzso Patients were previously healthy, active duty Thai soldiers assigned to a malaria risk area presenting with zzso zzso zzso immersion objective at 1000 zzso zzso involved examination of zzso thick and thin blood films by an experienced zzso Whole blood samples zzso zzso dried on filter paper were used for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso amplification by the zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Of 137 consecutive cases of malaria zzso zzso zzso of microscopically diagnosed zzso zzso infections and zzso zzso of microscopically diagnosed zzso zzso infections were found to be mixed by the zzso probe systems, while 1 case was diagnosed as mixed by both zzso and zzso The possibility that malaria patients may have zzso mixed infections should be kept in mind because of the specific therapy required both for zzso zzso and for radical cure of zzso zzso
