zzso chain zzso is a zzso type II protein that forms a complex with the major zzso complex zzso class II molecules in the zzso zzso zzso The membrane zzso zzso region of zzso is responsible for the zzso association with zzso class II zzso Chemical zzso in zzso cells was used to study the effect of zzso and zzso deletions on zzso of zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso is independent of the zzso tail of zzso whereas zzso zzso (the sequence zzso by zzso 6) in the zzso part of zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso zzso deletion zzso show that the zzso acids zzso by zzso 6 of zzso are also essential for the induction of large zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso must be in a zzso form to modify the zzso zzso
