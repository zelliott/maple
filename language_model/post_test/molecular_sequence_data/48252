In human zzso virus zzso patients treated with potent zzso therapy, the persistence of zzso infected cells may reflect the long zzso zzso of this cellular zzso or ongoing viral replication at low levels with continuous zzso of the population or zzso To address these possibilities, sequences encompassing the C2 and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed from virus present in baseline plasma and from viral zzso obtained after 2 years of zzso therapy in six zzso The presence of sequence changes consistent with evolution was demonstrated for three subjects and correlated with less complete suppression of viral zzso as indicated by the zzso of the initial virus load decline or the intermittent reappearance of even low levels of zzso zzso Together, these results provide evidence for ongoing zzso In the remaining three patients, virus recovered after 2 years of therapy was either zzso contemporary with or ancestral to virus present in plasma 2 years before, indicating that virus recovery had indeed resulted from zzso of zzso infected zzso
