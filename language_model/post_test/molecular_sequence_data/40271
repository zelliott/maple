We have studied the zzso status of the sequence 152 zzso upstream of the zzso repeat of the zzso locus in patients' peripheral zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by zzso This allowed to correlate the zzso status of each zzso zzso with its zzso zzso to previous findings, only the zzso site is often but not always zzso zzso among expanded zzso zzso zzso this zzso was not restricted to zzso zzso nor to large expansions, as it was also present in zzso patients with a classical zzso and various expansion zzso On the other hand, we did not find any zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso sites, as was reported by zzso et zzso which is in line with the results of Shaw and zzso The size range of the repeat expansions with zzso was from as small as 300 to as large as zzso zzso
