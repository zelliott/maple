zzso transgenic plants as alternative systems to the conventional zzso coli, zzso zzso or zzso hosts to produce zzso zzso may offer the possibility of having available edible vaccines in the near zzso In this study, two zzso zzso zzso from olive zzso Ole e 3 and Ole e 8, were produced in transgenic zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, were zzso incorporated into the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso e 3 and zzso e 8, which exhibited the molecular properties zzso zzso analyses and CD zzso of their olive and/or zzso coli zzso zzso zzso which were carried out to assess the zzso activity of zzso e 3 and zzso e 8, gave positive zzso In addition, their zzso on zzso were according to the zzso changes derived from their zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso proteins was equivalent to that of the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso as shown by their ability to bind zzso rabbit zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso These results indicate that transgenic plants constitute a valid alternative to obtain zzso with structural and zzso integrity not only for zzso up production, but also to develop new kind of vaccines for human zzso
