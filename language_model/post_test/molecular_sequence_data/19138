zzso genes are well-known master regulators in zzso zzso along the zzso axis of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso proteins regulate their target genes and determine cell fates are not fully zzso The silk zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso tissue divided into several zzso along the zzso zzso and the silk genes are expressed with specific zzso The zzso gene zzso is expressed in the middle silk zzso zzso with zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso protein zzso is a component of the middle silk zzso complex, zzso zzso zzso binds to the essential promoter element of zzso and activates its zzso zzso expression of zzso in transgenic zzso induced the expression of zzso in the zzso silk zzso zzso but not in the anterior part of zzso zzso zzso a zzso complex was formed by the addition of zzso zzso in extracts from zzso with its zzso zzso and zzso but not in extracts from zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso induced by the zzso expression of zzso in zzso were almost the same as those in zzso at the fifth zzso and altered depending on the induction timing of zzso Other zzso genes were expressed with zzso specificity in the silk zzso The zzso silk zzso might provide a useful system for understanding how zzso proteins select and regulate their target zzso
