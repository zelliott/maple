The zzso outer zzso protein zzso is responsible for cell membrane penetration during virus entry and contains zzso necessary for zzso zzso zzso 582 to 611 of zzso are necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso and zzso 594 and zzso independently regulate the efficiency of viral entry and zzso cell zzso zzso Two of three zzso within this region, zzso 1 zzso 582 to zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso to zzso play a role in zzso zzso Here, we chemically zzso peptides representing zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso and examined their biological zzso We found that zzso but not zzso was able to cause zzso and zzso leakage of molecules from small zzso zzso We further found that direct application of zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso to cells resulted in zzso Application of the zzso zzso to zzso cells caused rapid zzso in zzso calcium concentration that were independent of zzso C zzso zzso of zzso was not restricted to zzso cells, as the zzso zzso also had zzso zzso Based on these findings, we propose that the zzso function of the zzso region of zzso is dependent on its capacity to destabilize cellular zzso and cause release of molecules from zzso zzso that ultimately zzso cell necrosis or zzso depending on the zzso
