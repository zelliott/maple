The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso complementary to the zzso zzso the gag zzso and the rev zzso were studied in a long-term infection zzso Three zzso zzso directed to the zzso site of the zzso gene failed to suppress human zzso virus type 1 replication at 1 zzso concentration in long-term zzso In contrast, two zzso zzso zzso complementary to the gag and the rev zzso inhibited viral replication for zzso 80 days, and the zzso activity was zzso and zzso In addition, after zzso of cells we could reduce the concentration of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and still maintain the zzso of viral zzso These results suggest that chemotherapy for human zzso virus type 1 infection with zzso zzso zzso may be achieved by an initial high-dose treatment followed by a lower maintenance zzso
