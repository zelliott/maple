A new zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of about 50 zzso and optimal functioning at pH zzso was isolated from the culture medium of a zzso zzso 94 zzso strain using affinity and gel zzso zzso The zzso N terminal zzso acid sequence zzso exhibits a reliable similarity to N terminal sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso displays a double zzso specificity and zzso bonds formed by zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Ala, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso can also zzso native zzso The zzso zzso is effective in a wide range of zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso at 4 and 37 degrees C showed that a decrease in temperature by more than 30 degrees C causes a zzso increase in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an zzso adapted to low positive zzso A zzso displaying such properties was found in zzso of the zzso zzso for the first time and may serve as a virulent factor for these zzso
