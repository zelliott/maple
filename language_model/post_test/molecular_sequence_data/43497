We have tested the zzso potential of zzso zzso acid zzso on in zzso reverse zzso of the zzso gag zzso zzso was designed to target different regions of the zzso gag gene and the effect on reverse zzso by zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso was zzso We found that a zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso was superior to both the parallel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso reverse zzso of the zzso thus indicating triplex formation at the target zzso A complete arrest of reverse zzso was obtained at approximately zzso zzso excess of the zzso with respect to the gag zzso At this zzso ratio we found no effect on in zzso translation of gag zzso A zzso zzso zzso was also found to inhibit reverse zzso at very low zzso ratios of zzso gag zzso zzso of the zzso of reverse zzso by zzso was confirmed by zzso sequencing, which revealed that all tested zzso were stopped by the zzso complex at the predicted zzso We propose that the effect of zzso is exclusively due to zzso zzso as we found no signs of zzso degradation that would indicate zzso zzso H zzso of the tested zzso In conclusion, zzso appears to have a potential to become a specific and efficient inhibitor of reverse zzso in zzso , provided sufficient zzso levels are zzso
