zzso and zzso zzso have identified specific contact interactions between the zzso and the zzso sequences of zzso zzso and the zzso and in conjunction with the high-resolution structures of zzso and the zzso have been used to construct models of the zzso complex, which suggest that zzso adopts a more extended structure within this zzso To directly test these predictions, we have used zzso resonance energy transfer to measure the average zzso and zzso between zzso zzso bound to the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso In the absence of the zzso the zzso domain of zzso assumes a wide range of structures relative to the zzso zzso which can be described using a model involving a zzso distribution of distances with an average distance zzso of less than 21 A and a zzso zzso of 36 zzso This zzso zzso of zzso is consistent with the 10 structures resolved by zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso in organic zzso In contrast, zzso bound to the zzso assumes a unique and highly ordered zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The small spatial separation between the bound zzso on zzso is inconsistent with an extended zzso of bound zzso in current zzso Thus, to satisfy known interaction sites of zzso and the zzso these findings suggest a zzso of the zzso binding domain of the zzso toward the zzso surface to bring known zzso binding sites into close juxtaposition with zzso near the zzso of zzso zzso of an altered zzso of the zzso binding domain of the zzso by zzso binding is suggested to zzso the reduced calcium sensitivity associated with zzso zzso of the zzso
