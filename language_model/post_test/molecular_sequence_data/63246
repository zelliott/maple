zzso to contribute to the knowledge of the evolutionary history of zzso a zzso analysis of the zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried out in 33 zzso zzso Most sequences were obtained from in zzso searches in the zzso zzso The complex evolutionary pattern reported by other authors for the gypsy zzso was also observed in the present study, including vertical transmission, ancestral zzso zzso loss and horizontal zzso Moreover, the elements zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to have followed an evolutionary model that is similar to zzso Fifteen new possible cases of horizontal transfer were zzso The infectious potential of these elements may help zzso the evolutionary scenario described in the present zzso
