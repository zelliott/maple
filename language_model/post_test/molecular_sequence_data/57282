zzso and zzso zzso protein II have been zzso and their crystal structures have been determined to zzso A and zzso A zzso The zzso and zzso have different but related zzso space zzso The X-ray zzso for both structures were determined using the molecular replacement zzso The crystal zzso were refined to an zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso and zzso have nearly the same zzso zzso Cellular zzso protein II consists of a zzso zzso zzso with the zzso binding cavity within the zzso Two zzso cover the open end of the zzso making it almost zzso zzso A single portal large enough to admit a water zzso was observed opening into the binding zzso zzso added zzso was found within the cavity of each zzso zzso protein II zzso Each zzso was surrounded by both polar and zzso zzso The zzso group of the bound zzso hydrogen bonds to the zzso group of zzso zzso The overall zzso of the bound zzso was derived from the four different molecules of zzso zzso protein II present in the zzso zzso The four copies of bound zzso had essentially the same zzso as found in zzso zzso
