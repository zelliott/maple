zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two closely related sister species of zzso but differ in their preferred zzso zzso humans or horses, zzso zzso procedures for their identification depend on studies of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso and may yield ambiguous zzso zzso methods using zzso ITS also had been judged to be insufficiently zzso In the present study two genetic markers were zzso in addition to the ITS region, zzso partial zzso zzso and translation zzso factor zzso zzso The zzso locus revealed a consistent differences in a 13 zzso zzso and an additional zzso between the two species, along with a single base substitution in zzso and one zzso enabling zzso distinction of the two zzso zzso targeting the ITS region was evaluated as a potential tool for routine screening of suspected zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
