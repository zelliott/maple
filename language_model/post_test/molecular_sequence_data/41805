The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains two zzso sequences that define a domain in gamma that is zzso to the zzso domain in zzso zzso The zzso is based on both sequence and functional zzso To account for this zzso it has been proposed that the zzso sequences in gamma and the zzso domain in zzso I have evolved from a common zzso We investigated this possibility by comparing the zzso structure of the gamma gene with that of zzso gene over their zzso zzso In the quail zzso zzso it is known that the entire zzso domain is zzso by a single zzso However, two zzso are found to zzso the zzso domain in the gamma gene from zzso This result indicates that zzso evolution may be responsible for the sequence and functional similarities between the zzso zzso in zzso I and zzso
