zzso regulatory zzso protein 2 zzso zzso factor has been identified as a key protein in cholesterol metabolism through the zzso of the LDL zzso and cholesterol zzso zzso Here, we generated mice lacking zzso zzso zzso by an zzso of the zzso and showed that zzso zzso the expression of zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso zzso a key regulator of HDL synthesis by zzso cholesterol zzso from cells to zzso A zzso In fact, zzso zzso derived from zzso mice showed a marked increase in zzso levels and higher zzso cholesterol zzso than those from zzso zzso zzso protein levels in liver were also higher in zzso mice than in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso mice had significantly higher serum HDL cholesterol levels than zzso zzso These data establish a critical role for zzso in the regulation of zzso expression and HDL zzso in zzso
