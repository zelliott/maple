The formation of knotted species on random ring closure of two zzso that are zzso zzso pairs zzso and zzso zzso in length was measured, and these data were used to calculate the effective DNA zzso diameter as a function of sodium zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the presence of more than 50 zzso zzso zzso interactions between DNA segments appear to be attractive rather than zzso The free energy of formation of relaxed zzso and zzso DNA knots and of zzso zzso DNA knots was also zzso
