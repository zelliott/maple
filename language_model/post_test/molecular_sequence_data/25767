The zzso binding sites of zzso zzso zzso proposed by X-ray zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Schulz, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso in conjunction with structural analysis by zzso The zzso examined in this report include two near an zzso site zzso and zzso and two in the zzso binding region zzso and zzso The results and conclusions are summarized as zzso zzso Although zzso is very close to an zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Schulz, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it is zzso either structurally or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed significant increases in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while all other kinetic parameters were relatively zzso The zzso zzso property of this zzso was unchanged in the free zzso and only slightly zzso in the zzso complexes with zzso and with zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso complex with zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso interacts specifically with zzso starting at the zzso complex, and suggest that the zzso site proposed by zzso et zzso zzso is likely to be the zzso zzso zzso The kinetic parameters of zzso were dramatically zzso zzso decreased by a factor of zzso zzso increased to zzso and zzso decreased by a factor of 2 X zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
