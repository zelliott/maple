We have previously reported that microbial peptides having 3 to 6 zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso zzso of retinal zzso zzso are capable of inducing experimental zzso zzso zzso in Lewis rats and zzso zzso zzso obtained from animals zzso with these microbial peptides zzso when zzso with zzso zzso in culture and vice zzso We were interested to know whether these 3 to 6 identical zzso acid zzso by themselves were sufficient to induce zzso in susceptible animals under optimal zzso For this purpose we have determined the response of synthetic zzso of 3 to 18 zzso acid zzso for their ability to zzso zzso Here, we report that small synthetic zzso of 3 to 5 zzso acid zzso of the two zzso peptides of zzso induced zzso in Lewis rats, although with a higher dose (2000 zzso than that of the larger peptides zzso zzso These results define the core sequences in the zzso peptides of retinal zzso
