Many zzso zzso zzso express a zzso zzso of about 29 zzso that can be detected in zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso this zzso has previously been cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein bears a putative signal zzso close to its zzso end and, in zzso cultures, is present in both the cells and the zzso zzso zzso extracts of different zzso producing zzso zzso exhibited an zzso activity on zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso was exerted by zzso or zzso zzso that were heat zzso Immediately downstream from the zzso zzso in the complementary zzso we have identified an open reading frame composed of 135 zzso that we have named zzso whose expression in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso activity to zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso to zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene have been found in all the tested zzso strains that express a zzso zzso Whereas the zzso protein is zzso to zzso G from zzso and to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso no protein zzso to zzso was found in the available zzso zzso zzso represents a novel gene zzso a zzso zzso
