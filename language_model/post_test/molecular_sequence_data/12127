It has been proposed that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso oxygen zzso generated by zzso of zzso zzso We have compared sensitive zzso cells and derived cell lines depleted of zzso for their ability to undergo zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacking around zzso of zzso were still sensitive to zzso zzso zzso cells devoid of zzso zzso zzso were resistant to zzso but this was due to the loss of its 55 zzso zzso zzso degree cells were also resistant to zzso acid, which causes zzso cell death by zzso zzso These cells were sensitive to zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso and zzso toxicity occurs by a mechanism mostly independent of zzso free radical zzso
