zzso coli that carry a zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso express zzso that mimics the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of two zzso transcribed zzso the rightward zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes and the control region separating the two zzso supply the primary regulatory control over the zzso zzso the regulatory mechanisms result in a dramatic increase in the rate of zzso synthesis after zzso apparently due to a unique zzso positive feedback zzso and in an enormous difference zzso than zzso in levels of zzso in cells before and after zzso The generally accepted model of primary regulation of zzso in zzso zzso involves the interaction of the product of the zzso gene and zzso zzso the zzso produced by the zzso zzso by zzso the first gene of the rightward zzso with an operator sequence within the control region to stimulate zzso of the rightward zzso in a positive feedback zzso We have used deletion mapping of a zzso reporter zzso to determine the approximate location of the zzso By zzso zzso of the presumed operator, we have demonstrated that the zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso (where the vertical line is the center of zzso which bears striking similarity to the recognition sequence for the zzso zzso protein zzso is the operator of the zzso zzso We also found that deletion of sequences upstream of the zzso leads to increased zzso from the rightward promoter zzso indicative of a zzso element that zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso that eliminate stimulation by zzso of zzso from zzso have no effect on repression by the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso is not necessary for repression of the rightward zzso Thus, it appears that the large increase in zzso upon induction of the zzso zzso is the result of at least two independent mechanisms, one positive and the other zzso
