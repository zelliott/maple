To study the role of zzso zzso zzso interactions in the zzso of the insulin zzso we have replaced the insulin zzso TM domain with that of zzso A zzso an zzso protein that spontaneously forms zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences with the TM domain replaced by that of zzso were constructed and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso binding to cells and zzso receptors was not zzso zzso after partial reduction of zzso bonds revealed an altered structure for the soluble zzso zzso seen as an altered mobility apparently due to increased interactions between the beta zzso of the zzso zzso signaling was markedly decreased for cells zzso with zzso receptors compared with cells zzso with normal zzso A decrease in zzso zzso zzso activity was observed for zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, substitution by the native zzso TM domain of the insulin zzso results in structurally modified zzso receptors that are unable to transmit the insulin signal zzso It is hypothesized that this substitution may impose structural constraints that prevent the proper changes in zzso necessary for zzso of the zzso zzso Other zzso zzso the structure or the membrane orientation of the zzso A TM domain are required to better understand these zzso
