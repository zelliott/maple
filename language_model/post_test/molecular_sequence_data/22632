Native zzso protein 1 zzso 1) was zzso from rat zzso by zzso zzso and identified by zzso mass mapping and tandem mass zzso Native and expressed zzso 1 were zzso into zzso and zzso flux through zzso 1 was shown to be fatty zzso and zzso To investigate the mechanism of action of zzso 1, we determined whether zzso modification of the zzso of zzso zzso its transport zzso We show that zzso flux was greater through native zzso zzso zzso when facilitated by less zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with little or no zzso flux due to zzso or zzso We show that zzso charge transfer was greater when facilitated by less zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with no zzso charge transfer flux due to zzso We show that the zzso oxygen consumption rate in brown zzso tissue zzso was reversed by zzso (as zzso but not by zzso Our data are consistent with the model that zzso 1 flips zzso fatty acid zzso and contradict the zzso model of zzso 1 zzso
