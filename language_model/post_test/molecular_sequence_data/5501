We have incorporated zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso into zzso coli zzso and examined the hybrid zzso for their ability to form zzso in zzso and perform zzso zzso synthesis in zzso The rye zzso zzso used for the experiment is a highly divergent protein zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso 74 zzso containing a repeating, zzso zzso zzso and has zzso acid sequence identity of only zzso to zzso coli zzso When expressed in zzso coli, zzso zzso was assembled in zzso coli zzso The latter formed zzso in zzso at about the same rate as the host zzso indicating that the replacement of zzso coli zzso with its zzso zzso has only a minor, if any, effect on zzso The zzso protein is much more zzso in sequence and chain zzso and is known to have a very important zzso The zzso zzso zzso used in the experiment was incorporated into zzso coli zzso zzso that associated with the zzso zzso to form zzso but the latter were unable to form zzso This result indicates functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso To further confirm this result, we zzso zzso zzso through the use of a zzso zzso and zzso the protein to zzso zzso zzso could be efficiently incorporated in zzso into zzso zzso coli zzso but the hybrid zzso were totally inactive in zzso zzso zzso Computer modeling of the spatial structure of all known zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso coli zzso zzso indicated a zzso zzso present only in zzso zzso The presence of this loop might have a role in the observed zzso Taken together with previously reported results zzso in this zzso it would appear that the features of zzso zzso concerned with specific functions are more divergent than their assembly zzso We have previously described methods suitable for overproduction and zzso of zzso zzso that are zzso in zzso DNA zzso zzso but that gave poor yield for those zzso in the nuclear DNA zzso zzso Here we describe a method that overcomes this problem and allows the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
