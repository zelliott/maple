zzso of zzso and translation during zzso germ cell differentiation is critical for successful zzso Here we establish that the interaction between zzso and zzso protein zzso sets the stage for an elaborate zzso control mechanism by zzso the zzso of germ cell zzso into zzso zzso zzso particles until they are later zzso Our studies reveal that loss of zzso regulation of zzso which controls the distribution of germ cell zzso between zzso active and inactive pools, results in abnormal round zzso differentiation and impaired zzso Interestingly, zzso functions as a broadly acting zzso zzso as it zzso translation initiation by blocking zzso formation and zzso the transport of zzso to zzso zzso These findings identify a unique role for zzso proteins in zzso regulation, and suggest that zzso and general zzso control mechanisms work in tandem to regulate critical germ cell differentiation events and diverse zzso cell zzso
