Members of the protein family called zzso associated with various cellular activities zzso play a crucial role in transforming chemical energy into biological zzso zzso proteins are complex molecular machines and typically form zzso zzso complexes that are crucial for zzso activity and mechanism of zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso shock protein F zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that functions to sense and relay the energy derived from zzso zzso zzso to catalyze zzso by the zzso zzso Closed promoter complexes formed by the zzso zzso are zzso for the action of zzso By using a protein fragmentation approach, we identify here at least one zzso surface in the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso by zzso is coupled to the exposure of at least one zzso zzso This zzso zzso presentation of a zzso binding surface can explain why complexes that form between zzso and zzso are transient and could be part of a mechanism used generally by other zzso proteins to regulate zzso
