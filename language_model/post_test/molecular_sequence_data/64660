zzso syndrome is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso deafness, zzso and impaired zzso zzso It is caused by zzso in the zzso gene that encodes zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells and a zzso zzso in zzso cells of the zzso cortical collecting zzso The partially impaired zzso zzso zzso in zzso syndrome suggests a possible role of zzso in zzso transport at the zzso membrane of zzso zzso cells, but experimental evidence for this concept is zzso The zzso transport properties of zzso were determined in polarized zzso canine kidney cells expressing the sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso measurement of zzso content in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we determined the functional consequences of two naturally occurring zzso zzso and zzso In polarized zzso canine kidney cells, zzso mediates zzso at the zzso zzso Only minimal amounts of zzso reach the zzso compartment in the absence of zzso In cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso mediates transport of zzso into the zzso zzso Wild type zzso also mediates zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, both zzso zzso lose the ability to promote zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso from polarized zzso cells loaded with zzso zzso with the partial zzso zzso observed in patients with zzso syndrome, naturally occurring zzso of zzso lead to impaired transport of zzso
