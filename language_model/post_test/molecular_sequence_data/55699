Terminal zzso zzso is a zzso DNA zzso that is expressed zzso during the earliest stages of zzso and zzso zzso Previously, we characterized the promoter for the zzso zzso gene and identified a novel zzso zzso called zzso that interacts with a DNA sequence element found to be critical for zzso activity in zzso cell zzso Here, we present a more detailed analysis of this zzso control element, called the zzso zzso element, which is centered approximately 60 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso We found that both the zzso and human zzso elements are recognized by multiple zzso including zzso and at least two zzso family zzso zzso and zzso Additional zzso interactions were identified through studies using zzso nuclear zzso in which the zzso element was apparently incorporated into a zzso complex, possibly containing an zzso protein as a core zzso By analyzing a series of substitution zzso two adjacent binding sites for zzso were identified in the zzso zzso element, with the zzso protein binding site closely coinciding with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with these zzso revealed that only a zzso region, containing precisely the zzso and zzso zzso binding sites, was needed for zzso zzso These results suggest an important role for an zzso family protein in the expression of the zzso zzso The role of zzso is less clear; it might act in conjunction with the zzso protein bound at the zzso element or it might be unnecessary for zzso zzso
