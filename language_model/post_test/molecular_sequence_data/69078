The genetic zzso in the zzso form of chronic zzso disease zzso follows an zzso zzso pattern of zzso When zzso DNA from normal individuals is zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso an zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso is zzso We cloned and characterized the zzso gene using the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso mapping 16 zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso region was then zzso to identify the inheritance pattern of zzso fetal cells by zzso zzso The zzso a 9-year-old female patient with zzso zzso and her zzso normal mother are zzso for the zzso marker, whereas the father and two brothers are zzso The fetus was shown to be zzso as well, showing it had inherited at least one normal zzso gene from the father and that it was predicted to have a normal zzso zzso blood samples at birth showed normal zzso zzso zzso allows rapid detection of the inheritance pattern for fetal diagnosis in zzso zzso We report the zzso structure of zzso and an zzso method for detection of the marker on zzso zzso used here for prenatal diagnosis of zzso
