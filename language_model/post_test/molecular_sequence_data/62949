We have earlier shown that zzso zzso of the zzso drug resistance zzso zzso is linked to various stresses wherein a zzso promoter zzso zzso from the zzso start point zzso was found to be predominantly more zzso In this study we have examined zzso expression of the zzso zzso promoter by employing a zzso zzso reporter zzso We observed that upon sequential deletion of the zzso promoter, there was zzso in zzso reporter zzso The reporter activity was highest zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso and was reduced upon subsequent zzso zzso I zzso revealed four protected regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter which could represent possible zzso factor binding sites and thus might be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of three of these protected regions did not significantly affect the zzso reporter activity, however, the zzso of zzso led to a considerable enhancement in reporter activity zzso zzso and was designated a negative regulatory element zzso zzso as well as deletion of the zzso sequence in the native promoter zzso zzso from zzso and sequential deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in enhanced promoter reporter zzso When the reporter activity of native zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso was monitored throughout the growth phase of zzso zzso there was zzso in reporter activity in both zzso but interestingly the level of zzso reporter activity of the zzso promoter was always approximately zzso higher than that of the native zzso zzso zzso and affinity zzso confirmed that a zzso approximately zzso nuclear protein specifically interacts with the zzso Taken together, we have identified a zzso and zzso its interactive zzso which may be involved in controlling zzso expression of zzso
