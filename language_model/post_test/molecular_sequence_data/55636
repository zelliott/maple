As part of a general program investigating the mechanism of the Rev axis of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso zzso which differ from the parental zzso strain at selected positions within the zzso were zzso All of the zzso were designed to zzso the zzso by introducing local zzso disruptions without altering the coding potential of the overlapping envelope open reading zzso zzso replication in various cell types was monitored by a cell zzso reverse zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso zzso displayed at least some impairment in zzso However, the relative impairment varied drastically among the various cell types zzso This suggests that the zzso may contribute to zzso viral zzso
