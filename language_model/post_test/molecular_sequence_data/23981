zzso zzso max zzso zzso contains two proteins called zzso storage proteins zzso that function as temporary storage reserves, but are also closely related to plant acid zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This study examined the zzso basis for the relatively low zzso activity previously reported for these zzso The specific activity of zzso zzso zzso on zzso was about zzso lower than for a related soybean root zzso acid zzso zzso which had a specific activity of zzso U zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso increased zzso activity about zzso This zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso and is a highly zzso zzso in the HAD zzso Related zzso from cultivated soybean and from three wild perennial zzso as well as a zzso storage protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso all lack the zzso zzso suggesting they too are zzso zzso zzso analysis showed the zzso and zzso are more closely related to each other than to 21 other zzso proteins from several plant species, all of which have the zzso zzso This study suggests that loss of zzso activity may be a requirement for the zzso and zzso to function as storage proteins in zzso
