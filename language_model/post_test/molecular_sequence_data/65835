zzso analysis was performed on the sequences of 44 Polish zzso of zzso zzso virus that were isolated from the zzso of zzso from national and private zzso collected during zzso These sequences were also compared with 41 reference strains previously described and commonly used in zzso On the basis of the zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso it was demonstrated that the Polish zzso zzso belonged to two zzso and showed the closest relationship to the European zzso Similar results were obtained using the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso The zzso identity between the zzso and zzso sequences of all Polish zzso was in the range of zzso and zzso zzso The analysis of genetic diversity within the zzso sequences enabled a retrospective zzso zzso This study suggested that some of the zzso shedding zzso were probably infected before they were moved to zzso
