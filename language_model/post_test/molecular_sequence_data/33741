zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of white shrimp, zzso zzso was cloned from zzso by a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso using zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tiger shrimp, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso region zzso and a zzso zzso containing a zzso A zzso The molecular mass of the deduced zzso acid zzso sequence zzso zzso was zzso zzso with an estimated zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a typical zzso zzso a putative zzso motif zzso and four zzso zzso a zzso zzso is present as in zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso analysis revealed that shrimp zzso can be separated into two subgroups, zzso and zzso and zzso is more closely related to zzso than to zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were detected in all tested zzso of zzso zzso with zzso mainly being zzso in zzso However, the pattern of zzso zzso expression was not directly correlated with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso injected with zzso zzso showed a significant decrease of zzso activity at 3 h and a significant increase of zzso zzso expression at 6 h followed by a notable decrease from 12 to 24 zzso which indicated that cloned zzso was involved in the immune response of zzso The results also imply that more than one type of zzso may be involved in the defense response in zzso zzso
