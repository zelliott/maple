zzso play important roles as prey and predators in zzso Changes in the zzso community can affect the composition and population of zzso and zzso in zzso To investigate the structure of zzso communities, we developed a zzso zzso method, which combines a universal zzso primer set in the first zzso step with a zzso primer set in the second zzso step, to amplify zzso zzso genes from zzso The 300 zzso zzso fragments generated more bands on the gel than the 600 zzso zzso zzso Prior to zzso zzso DNA extraction of zzso from soil samples was zzso with a combination of zzso cycles and zzso We applied this zzso zzso method to agricultural zzso amended with 0, zzso zzso and 600 zzso zzso zzso of livestock zzso The results from the zzso profiles and principal component analysis zzso revealed that the supplement of slurry to zzso influenced the zzso zzso From zzso analysis, 108 zzso bands were assigned to six classes, which included zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and one class of the zzso zzso These results indicated that a wide variety of zzso groups were detected by zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso method described here could clearly differentiate between zzso communities within soil samples and allowed for the zzso identification of these zzso at the class zzso
