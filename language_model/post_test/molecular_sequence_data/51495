An zzso based on the zzso zzso repeats of the zzso zzso protein was used to isolate other zzso genes with these zzso One of these genes is the cactus zzso 1 of 11 genes required zzso for the establishment in zzso of a zzso of nuclear zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso Previous work showed that in cactus zzso more zzso protein enters the nucleus in zzso regions, resulting in a zzso zzso It is now shown that the cactus locus produces two proteins that differ at their zzso zzso both contain six zzso zzso repeats that are sufficient for binding to zzso and for zzso the ability of zzso to bind zzso The site on zzso to which cactus binds was localized to the zzso zzso domain, where it zzso with, or is adjacent to, the nuclear zzso zzso In zzso the bulk of the cactus protein associated with zzso is zzso This, or the association with zzso appears to stabilize the maternal cactus zzso
