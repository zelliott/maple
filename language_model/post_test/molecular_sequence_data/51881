We have cloned and zzso members of a family of satellite zzso from three zzso of the zzso tribe of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The satellite zzso zzso as intensely zzso bands following zzso separation of zzso zzso DNA, consist of three size zzso zzso distributed in the various zzso zzso The sizes of the zzso are approximately 237 zzso zzso zzso 230 zzso zzso zzso and 209 zzso zzso zzso Several cloned zzso were zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of derived consensus sequences for the zzso units of the satellite zzso revealed sequence identities within and between species that ranged from 89 to zzso The type II and type III size zzso appear to have arisen by deletions of 9 and 29 zzso respectively, within different regions of the type I zzso zzso of a cloned zzso satellite from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso DNA from all three zzso detected zzso high molecular weight restriction fragments that produced zzso zzso The complexity of these DNA fingerprints varied from one species to another, suggesting a markedly different zzso organization for these zzso satellite zzso
