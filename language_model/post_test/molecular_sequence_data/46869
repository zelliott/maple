zzso specific scorpion toxins are peptides of zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso tightly bound by four zzso zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of 85 distinct peptides are presently zzso For some zzso the three-dimensional structure has been solved by X-ray zzso and zzso zzso A constant structural motif has been found in all of them, consisting of one or two short segments of zzso plus a zzso zzso connected by variable regions forming zzso zzso zzso experiments have shown that these toxins are zzso of the gating mechanism of the zzso function, affecting either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Many functional variations of these peptides have been demonstrated, which include not only the classical zzso and zzso but also the species specificity of their zzso There are peptides that bind or affect the function of zzso from different species zzso insects or zzso or are toxic to more than one group of zzso Based on functional and structural features of the known zzso a zzso containing 10 different groups of toxins is proposed in this zzso Attempts have been made to correlate the presence of certain zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso of these peptides with zzso zzso zzso containing positively charged zzso in special locations, such as the zzso turn, the turn between the second and the third zzso the zzso zzso and a segment of the zzso region from zzso zzso seems to be implicated in the activity of these zzso However, the uncertainty, and the limited success obtained in the search for the site through which these peptides bind to the channels, are mainly due to the lack of an easy method for expression of cloned genes to produce a zzso active zzso Many scorpion toxin coding genes have been obtained from zzso libraries and from zzso chain reactions using fragments of scorpion zzso as zzso The presence of an zzso at the DNA level, situated in the middle of the signal zzso has been zzso
