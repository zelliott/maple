Only a fraction zzso of 268 zzso T cell clones derived from zzso mice can selectively induce the production of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and accelerate the development of lupus zzso when transferred in zzso The zzso zzso of T cell zzso beta chains expressed by these zzso T helper zzso clones contain a zzso motif of zzso zzso suggesting that they are selected by zzso with zzso zzso zzso we found that approximately 50% of these zzso zzso clones were specific for zzso zzso but none of them responded to zzso zzso shared by variable regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not stimulate the T cells as a zzso zzso or zzso Only the zzso zzso cells of lupus responded to zzso zzso that were processed and presented via the major zzso class II zzso Although the presentation of zzso zzso to the zzso clones could be blocked by zzso of zzso zzso neither of the two components of the zzso DNA or zzso by zzso stimulate the zzso zzso Thus critical zzso zzso for the zzso cells were probably protected during zzso and processing of the zzso particle as a zzso The zzso zzso clones zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso to zzso complex in zzso In zzso zzso zzso T cells were not zzso in normal mice, but they were found in the zzso of zzso mice as early as 1 zzso of age, long before other zzso zzso zzso of young, zzso lupus mice with zzso zzso the production of zzso and markedly accelerated the development of severe zzso Previously, crude preparations containing zzso were shown by others to have zzso zzso activity for B cells from normal as well as lupus zzso Identification here of pure zzso as a zzso zzso for the zzso cells that selectively help the zzso zzso zzso producing B cells of lupus could lead to the design of specific therapy against this zzso zzso zzso
