zzso protein modification plays a key role in many cellular signal zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso encodes a protein containing an zzso repeat domain at the zzso half and a zzso finger zzso The zzso protein is capable of zzso zzso zzso in zzso causes a number of zzso including severe defects in lateral root production and in the expression of the cell division marker zzso The zzso gene is expressed abundantly in the vascular system of the primary zzso but not in newly formed lateral root zzso Treatment with zzso increases the expression of zzso in the primary root and partially zzso the lateral root zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a novel zzso zzso required for lateral root zzso
