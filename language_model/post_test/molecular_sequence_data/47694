zzso DNA zzso of the parental zzso has been implicated in the establishment and maintenance of the zzso expression of imprinted zzso zzso and zzso are zzso imprinted with only the maternal and the paternal zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a childhood zzso zzso loss of the zzso imprinted expression pattern results in zzso of zzso and zzso expression of zzso This was shown to be associated with zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in the tumor and the adjacent kidney tissue suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is an early event in zzso zzso An zzso mark region characterized by paternal zzso zzso has been suggested to reside in a zzso region of zzso pair direct repeats starting at zzso zzso pairs zzso relative to the zzso zzso start and extending zzso The upstream boundary of the potential paternal zzso imprint of the zzso gene has yet to be zzso We sought to define this upstream imprint boundary and investigate whether zzso tumors with loss of zzso are zzso zzso in this zzso mark zzso The analysis of zzso zzso of new upstream zzso sequence determined in this study identified a series of the direct zzso pair repeats that extends to approximately zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso DNA zzso analyses indicated that the upstream boundary of the potential imprint may coincide with the zzso end of the direct zzso We found that zzso tumors with loss of zzso are zzso zzso in the zzso upstream repeat region, and we suggest that pathological zzso in this region is the zzso error that zzso zzso zzso
