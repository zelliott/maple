zzso zzso the most important cause of long-term graft failure, is thought to result from both zzso and zzso zzso To examine these zzso zzso dynamics were assessed by zzso competitive reverse zzso and by zzso in an established rat model of chronic rejection zzso zzso zzso zzso controls develop zzso and zzso changes that are similar to zzso zzso changes, although zzso less intense and at a delayed zzso these are thought to occur secondary to zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was determined throughout the zzso During an early zzso zzso rejection episode, both zzso associated zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso products were zzso despite transient zzso zzso zzso upon zzso normal zzso expressed and zzso peaked at 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed at 6 zzso zzso products such as zzso zzso protein zzso increased dramatically (to 10 zzso zzso intense peak zzso zzso at 16 zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso peaked at 24 zzso zzso was zzso expressed at 52 weeks, commensurate with a progressive increase in zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso of zzso and zzso recipients was zzso We conclude that chronic rejection of kidney zzso in rats is predominantly a local zzso event with intense zzso of zzso products such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso The zzso expression in zzso emphasizes the contribution of zzso zzso The dynamics of zzso expression between early and late zzso of chronic rejection suggest a key role in zzso the events of the chronic zzso
