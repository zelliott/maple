Two distinct groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of zzso zzso differ by their requirement for a zzso metal zzso for zzso zzso The unique difference between these groups is the replacement of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso of just this zzso for a zzso in zzso zzso does not create the zzso zzso dependency of natural zzso zzso We describe how three or four zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso produce a fully functional, zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso zzso (this zzso binds to the metal zzso in all zzso zzso and zzso and for double and triple combinations, zzso zzso that contained zzso in place of zzso showed an increase in activity in the presence of zzso metal zzso However, combining these zzso with substitution by zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso motif of zzso zzso created zzso with zzso metal zzso The quadruple zzso zzso showed comparable activity to zzso zzso only in the presence of metal zzso with maximum activity with zzso the metal zzso that is strongly zzso at zzso zzso for the zzso zzso In the absence of metal zzso activity was barely zzso for this quadruple zzso or for triple zzso bearing both zzso and zzso zzso The structures of zzso and its zzso and quadruple zzso at pH zzso were characterized at resolutions better than zzso zzso Aged zzso of the zzso zzso featured a zzso zzso linkage, explaining the spectral zzso observed when this zzso was incubated with zzso Such zzso was not observed for the quadruple zzso zzso evolution to a fully functional zzso zzso zzso has been achieved with just three directed zzso for zzso that have, at best, zzso identity between zzso and zzso zzso
