In the zzso zzso nucleus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are arranged in an oriented zzso zzso cluster in close proximity to the zzso pole body zzso while zzso form another cluster at some distance from the zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso in which the structure of the zzso zzso nucleus appears to be zzso Using specific zzso to zzso the zzso and zzso multiple signals were observed in the zzso zzso in contrast to the case in zzso zzso analysis showed that in the zzso zzso zzso frequency was reduced to about one-quarter of the zzso level and zzso segregation was zzso This zzso strongly suggests that the zzso zzso of zzso distribution that normally occurs in the zzso zzso zzso nucleus is an important prerequisite for the efficient pairing of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also impaired in zzso suggesting that the zzso gene is involved in zzso zzso However, the zzso gene is zzso for zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the gene product shows no significant similarity to known zzso
