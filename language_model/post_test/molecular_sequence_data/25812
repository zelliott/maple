A large number of reports have demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso and an zzso function has been ascribed to zzso zzso zzso zzso We have undertaken large scale zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso substances which demonstrate mouse zzso zzso activity zzso in zzso zzso with zzso were extracted from more than 5 zzso of bovine zzso zzso zzso containing peptides were found in both high (Mr approximately zzso and low (Mr approximately zzso Mr species from zzso zzso zzso of zzso N zzso acid zzso After zzso in zzso zzso acid, the zzso zzso peptides were localized to an zzso Mr zzso zzso A homogeneous zzso which shared an identical retention time zzso and zzso acid sequence with synthetic zzso zzso zzso was isolated by serial zzso high performance liquid zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso
