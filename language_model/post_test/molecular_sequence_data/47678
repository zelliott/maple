We have cloned a zzso protein from rabbit small zzso which, when zzso with the zzso heavy chain zzso in zzso cells, zzso a zzso zzso acid transport zzso This protein zzso for the sixth member of the zzso light chain zzso consists of zzso zzso acids and has 12 putative zzso zzso At the level of zzso acid zzso zzso shows significant zzso zzso zzso to the other five known members of the zzso light chain family, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso transport process is zzso and exhibits high affinity for neutral and zzso zzso acids and zzso These characteristics are similar to those of the zzso zzso acid transport activity previously shown to be associated with zzso zzso related to zzso zzso acid transport zzso However, the newly cloned zzso does not interact with zzso This is the first report of the existence of a zzso zzso acid transport process that is independent of zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the small zzso and zzso Based on the characteristics of the transport process zzso by the zzso complex and the expression pattern of zzso in zzso zzso we suggest that zzso is a new candidate gene for zzso
