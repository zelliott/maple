zzso N zzso is a key zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso ring closure of zzso to form zzso zzso Recent advances in our understanding of the unique chemistry of this zzso have come through the combined application of zzso molecular genetic and zzso approaches and led to important new insights into the structure and function of this zzso Here we review new information on the nature of the zzso zzso that constitute the zzso iron active site, sequence evidence for a novel structural motif involved in iron binding in this and related zzso iron dependent zzso crystal structure studies on the zzso and its zzso complex and the impact of these and zzso zzso studies for unraveling the mechanism of the zzso N zzso zzso
