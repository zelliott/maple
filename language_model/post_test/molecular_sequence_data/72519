A zzso zzso isolate was found to produce an zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso components of zzso zzso iota toxin and zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rubin, zzso zzso Gill, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso locus from zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso It contained two genes zzso and zzso which display organizations and sequences similar to those of the iota toxin zzso The deduced zzso zzso and binding zzso components have 81 and zzso identity, respectively, with the corresponding components of iota zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso zzso similar to those caused by other zzso zzso zzso The lower level of production of zzso toxin by zzso than of iota toxin by zzso zzso was related to a lower transcript level, possibly due to a promoter region different from that of iota toxin zzso The zzso and zzso genes have been detected in 3 of 24 clinical zzso zzso and zzso alone was found in 2 additional zzso One strain (in addition to zzso was shown by Western zzso to produce zzso and zzso These results indicate that some zzso zzso strains zzso a zzso toxin that could be an additional zzso zzso
