zzso is induced in zzso coli by the zzso response and zzso cell division through interaction with zzso To determine which region of zzso is essential for the zzso of cell division, we constructed a series of zzso and zzso deletions of zzso and a series of zzso substitution zzso zzso at position 62, zzso at 67, zzso at 77 and zzso at 87, in the central region of zzso were all essential for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso 21 zzso were zzso for the zzso The zzso protein lacking zzso zzso zzso was zzso as was that lacking the zzso 34 zzso zzso deletions of 8 and 21 zzso increased the zzso activity in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso proteins were isolated in a form fused to zzso coli zzso zzso and tested in zzso for sensitivity to Lon zzso Lon zzso zzso zzso and a deletion zzso lacking the zzso 93 zzso zzso but did not degrade the zzso lacking 21 zzso at the zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso and the zzso deletion zzso formed a stable complex with zzso while the zzso deletion did zzso zzso fused to the zzso 20 zzso of zzso formed a stable complex with, but was not zzso by zzso When zzso protein was fused at its zzso to 8 or 20 zzso acid zzso from the zzso region of zzso the protein was stable in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso 20 zzso of zzso permit recognition by, and complex formation with, zzso and are necessary, but not zzso for degradation by zzso
