zzso analysis of a substantial part of the zzso gene of the zzso coronavirus zzso revealed the 3' end of an open reading frame zzso overlapping with a large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which covers the 3' half of the zzso zzso The expression of zzso occurs by a zzso zzso mechanism since the zzso overlapping zzso sequence is capable of inducing zzso zzso in zzso as well as in zzso A zzso structure and a zzso are predicted in the zzso sequence involved in zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso with the zzso acid sequence deduced from the corresponding gene of the avian coronavirus zzso demonstrated that in contrast to the other viral genes this zzso is extremely zzso zzso analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence revealed sequence elements which are zzso in many DNA and zzso zzso
