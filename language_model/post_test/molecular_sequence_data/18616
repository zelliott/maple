The zzso family zzso to zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso complex with zzso and partially overlapping expression and possible participation of the corresponding genes in zzso zzso Here, we describe a new protein zzso of the human zzso zzso namely zzso which differs from the published zzso only at the zzso by the zzso in of the newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated differential expression patterns of the two zzso Whereas zzso is broadly expressed among zzso cells, zzso is abundant in the zzso of zzso zzso cells, such as zzso but absent or zzso in simple zzso cells such as zzso or zzso The differential expression of the zzso zzso has been observed in a similar manner in selected normal human zzso and zzso derived zzso Both zzso are localized to the zzso of all cells of zzso zzso whereas the new zzso is zzso expressed in the colon and its zzso zzso we assume that both zzso are controlled by alternative zzso zzso gene zzso have confirmed that a zzso upstream of zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity only in zzso cells but not in zzso cells and thus has been identified as an alternative promoter driving the expression of zzso Finally, by using zzso shift zzso we found a potential binding site in the zzso promoter for zzso factor zzso regulating zzso differentiation and probably also zzso zzso We discuss the properties of the new zzso zzso as a possible marker protein for the analyses of differentiation and zzso zzso
