zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso bacteria implicated in the zzso of zzso disease zzso in individuals with zzso zzso and life-threatening systemic zzso They are resistant to many antibiotics of microbial origin but are sensitive to the zzso zzso action of zzso These organisms are susceptible to the zzso effect of zzso G but are killed by two distinct zzso The purpose of this study was to assess their sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso peptides derived from human zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the synthetic peptides zzso and zzso were tested by zzso zzso zzso and kinetic zzso against three representative strains zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one strain of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were sensitive to zzso and zzso at equal zzso zzso whereas strains of zzso and zzso zzso were more sensitive to zzso than to zzso These differential zzso effects occurred over both time and dose ranges too narrow to be of therapeutic significance but are consistent with the premise that zzso G kills these oral bacteria by two distinct zzso Except for zzso zzso of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso at 500 zzso zzso exhibited no zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was as potent as zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity but somewhat less than zzso We conclude that charge distribution, but not zzso or net charge, is an important zzso in the zzso efficacy of zzso Moreover, zzso antibiotics derived from zzso G may have therapeutic value against zzso zzso zzso zzso
