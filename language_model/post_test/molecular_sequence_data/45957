The avian B cell differentiation zzso zzso is a zzso zzso membrane protein most zzso to zzso zzso Here, we report a new zzso zzso zzso that is located 18 zzso away the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso protein contains two zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso which are identical to those found in zzso whereas zzso lacks the second zzso Although zzso expression is restricted to the zzso and an immature B cell line, zzso is highly expressed in the zzso zzso and both immature and mature B cell lines, a pattern that parallels zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso does not interact with zzso zzso characterization using zzso zzso zzso B cells demonstrated that zzso in zzso zzso a negative signal for zzso nuclear factor of activated T cells zzso zzso and that zzso zzso this negative zzso This study has established zzso as the genuine avian zzso of zzso zzso and revealed an opposing role for the two zzso through binding with zzso and zzso for regulation of zzso zzso zzso
