zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are potent relaxing agents in the zzso were submitted to in zzso degradation by the neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the most active zzso in the zzso to test their relative resistance to zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso but zzso was zzso The main fragments produced were zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The degradation of zzso zzso and zzso was also hindered by extending their zzso ends with the zzso sequence of zzso The sensitivity to zzso degradation was gradually reduced when the zzso extension was increased from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso The biological activities of the degradation products were evaluated on the three classes of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso retaining an important part of their activities on the zzso zzso Thus, the degradation of zzso and zzso by the neutral zzso zzso might produce a zzso zzso active zzso provided that very high zzso or zzso zzso are achieved in the zzso zzso
