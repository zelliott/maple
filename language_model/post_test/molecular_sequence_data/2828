The coding region of the zzso complex zzso of zzso virus zzso is located in the unique long part of the zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso units zzso to zzso zzso zzso which includes the 3' end of the zzso gene displays a size zzso among different zzso strains and also within plaque zzso of a given zzso To reveal the cause of this zzso and whether it might affect the zzso region we zzso different zzso fragments of the zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso and determined the 3' end of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso These data show that the size zzso is caused by the presence of a variable number of zzso repeated DNA sequence downstream but adjacent to the coding region of the zzso zzso zzso The 3' end of the zzso zzso was mapped about 24 zzso upstream of the first repeat zzso A 15 zzso sequence zzso zzso 3' is repeated from three to over 50 times in different zzso zzso It is the only repeat unit present in strain zzso whereas the zzso and zzso strains show additional zzso
