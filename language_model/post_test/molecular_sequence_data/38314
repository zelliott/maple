zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso zzso DNA in zzso zzso Here, we identified a zzso in zzso Schneider cells that can be activated by zzso 3, and zzso it as a complex of two zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso based on the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso a zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso contained 450 zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso and showed significant zzso with human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carry a nuclear zzso signal at the C zzso In contrast, zzso lacked the corresponding zzso and the zzso zzso did not cause DNA fragmentation in zzso in a zzso zzso When zzso was zzso in zzso cells with zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso a zzso zzso was produced as a zzso complex with zzso When the complex was treated with human zzso 3 or zzso zzso zzso the zzso was zzso and released from zzso In addition, zzso was also zzso by these zzso and behaved as a zzso complex in gel zzso When a zzso zzso cell line was induced to zzso by treatment with a zzso zzso both zzso and zzso were zzso These results indicated that unlike zzso zzso zzso zzso must be zzso by zzso to be zzso
