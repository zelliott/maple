We have cloned the mouse zzso of human zzso zzso a type II zzso protein with a single external zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso zzso displays 65 and zzso zzso in total zzso acid and zzso zzso with those of zzso The zzso mouse and rat genes were assigned to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso to the zzso gene on zzso zzso With zzso zzso transcripts were as expected detected in zzso class zzso but not zzso class zzso cells from zzso and the expression level was reduced by zzso However, zzso transcripts were also expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, lung and even heart, but not zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso suspensions, zzso transcripts were mainly detected in the zzso zzso cells zzso especially the zzso fraction of zzso and zzso DC generated from bone zzso precursors by zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso expressed zzso but this was shut down during maturation with zzso zzso or zzso DC derived from blood zzso by zzso + zzso lacked zzso unless the cultures were supplemented with transforming growth factor zzso zzso significant amounts of zzso transcripts were detected in skin and zzso of zzso mice, although in much lower amounts than zzso zzso zzso zzso could form zzso and bind to zzso These findings indicate that zzso expression is regulated at several zzso by zzso DC subsets, DC maturation and the tissue zzso
