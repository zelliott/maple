The most abundant soluble zzso protein from the Andean crop zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso has been zzso and zzso zzso accounts for zzso to zzso of the total soluble zzso zzso zzso has an apparent molecular mass of 18 zzso and an zzso point of zzso This protein appears to be found only in zzso and is accumulated only within the cells of the zzso and zzso layers zzso of the zzso as it zzso zzso zzso the growth of several zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso displays substantial zzso acid sequence similarity with a widely distributed group of zzso zzso proteins with a zzso unknown biological zzso Our results showed that zzso serves as a storage zzso has zzso properties, and belongs to the zzso zzso protein zzso Our findings suggest that an ancient scaffolding protein was recruited in the zzso zzso to serve a storage function and that proteins from the zzso zzso family might play a role in natural resistance to zzso
