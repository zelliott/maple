zzso and zzso analyses were used to study an zzso array of peptides of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso peptides were characterized from a single individual skin of the zzso zzso zzso that zzso 107 novel zzso zzso This contribution almost zzso the number of currently reported zzso zzso zzso The peptides could be organized into 30 divergent groups, including 24 novel zzso The diversity in zzso coding zzso sequences is, to our knowledge, the most extreme yet described for any zzso The patterns of diversification suggest that point zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso of zzso sequences were responsible for the zzso The diversity of zzso peptides may have resulted from the diversity of zzso These diverse peptides exhibited both diverse secondary structure and zzso zzso zzso Such extreme zzso zzso diversity in a single zzso species is zzso This has led us to reconsider the strong capability of innate immunity and molecular zzso of zzso ecological diversification and doubt the general opinion that zzso different zzso peptides can protect an animal because of the relatively wide specificity of the zzso zzso The zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso peptides were zzso They exerted their zzso functions by various means, including forming zzso zzso structures, peeling off the cell walls, forming zzso and inducing DNA zzso With respect to the development of zzso these peptides provide potential new templates to explore zzso
