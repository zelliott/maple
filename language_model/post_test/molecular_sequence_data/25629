zzso is widespread in the zzso acid zzso The majority of zzso can be induced by zzso zzso or treatment with zzso C, but indicator strains which allow zzso growth of the induced zzso are often not easy to zzso A few temperate zzso have been shown to zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso Information about the molecular biology of the temperate zzso from zzso acid bacteria is sparse and needs significant supplementation in order that these potentially valuable zzso might be zzso more efficiently as tools for improving existing starter strains in dairy zzso
