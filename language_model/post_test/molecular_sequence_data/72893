Members of the zzso family of zinc finger zzso factors regulate critical steps of cellular differentiation during zzso zzso In the studies described in this report, we have isolated and functionally characterized the zzso zzso zzso and protein and defined the zzso and spatial pattern of zzso gene expression during zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the mouse zzso protein shares high level zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not with other members of the zzso zzso zzso binds to the functionally important zzso nuclear protein binding site in the zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso muscle cell zzso During embryonic and zzso development, the pattern of zzso gene expression differs significantly from that of other zzso family zzso In the primitive streak zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso Within the embryonic heart, the zzso gene is expressed within the zzso and zzso chambers zzso zzso becomes restricted to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is subsequently not expressed in the heart during late fetal and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with the earliest steps in lung development, only the zzso gene is expressed within the pulmonary zzso Finally, the zzso gene is expressed in zzso zzso of smooth muscle cells zzso including zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso These data are consistent with a model in which zzso performs a unique temporally and zzso restricted function in the embryonic heart and zzso Moreover, these data suggest that zzso may play an important role in the zzso zzso that zzso smooth muscle cell zzso
