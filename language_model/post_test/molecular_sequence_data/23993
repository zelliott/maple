zzso zzso zzso from zzso were analyzed by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso spectral library, in particular, focusing on two pairs of zzso incompletely separated or zzso in zzso We previously reported that zzso spectral matching considering both major zzso zzso zzso and zzso is useful and zzso to the structural assignment of zzso zzso In this study, zzso spectral matching based on the zzso spectral library was applied to the assignment of these zzso zzso in zzso Its usefulness was investigated by comparing it to the conventional two-dimensional mapping method based on retention time zzso Specifically, we focus on the assignment and zzso of the zzso which are zzso in zzso From this, we propose a new method using zzso spectral matching and the working curve on which are plotted the relative zzso of selected zzso zzso in their zzso zzso versus various zzso of the zzso This new method demonstrated that the obtained quantities coincide very well with those estimated after separating by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso This means that separation by zzso is greatly simplified because complete separation of the zzso is no longer zzso Application of this new method was tested by using the two other pairs of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso The results showed that this method works for them as zzso
