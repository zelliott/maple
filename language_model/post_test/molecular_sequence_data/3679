zzso studies of human zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso were performed by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The structural information that was obtained was used in the design of zzso zzso with improved zzso zzso In the presence of increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a dramatic increase in a minimum at 198 zzso is observed in the CD zzso of zzso The zzso data of zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso reveal the proximity of zzso zzso and zzso indicating the existence of a more compact zzso zzso zzso were designed on the basis of this zzso which incorporated a zzso bond to stabilize an extended loop in this region of the zzso One of these, zzso 4, was 100 times more potent than zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso 4 revealed a zzso structure with charged zzso protruding on the outside surface, while a combination of aromatic zzso and zzso are packed into an internal zzso
