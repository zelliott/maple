zzso zzso zzso is a small, zzso domain that has become a model system for understanding the fundamental tenets governing protein zzso In this communication, we explore the role that zzso plays in the structure and stability of the zzso zzso of zzso results in a completely unfolded protein that cannot be expressed in zzso zzso zzso of only the zzso zzso side chain zzso zzso zzso neither the backbone zzso nor the orientation of local zzso side zzso As a result, a large, zzso zzso pocket, a negative replica of the zzso zzso was created on the zzso The loss of the zzso interface between zzso 61 and the zzso pocket zzso the construct by zzso zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso immediately before zzso zzso zzso was also highly zzso and had the effect of altering the backbone zzso zzso to zzso in order to precisely preserve the zzso position and zzso of all zzso zzso including zzso In addition to demonstrating that the zzso zzso of zzso is critically important for the stability of zzso zzso our results are consistent with the notion that the precise interactions present within the zzso core, rather than the hydrogen bonds that define the secondary structure, specify a zzso zzso
