zzso 14 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned using a zzso probe generated using zzso zzso designed from an internal 14 zzso acid zzso The sequence identifies zzso zzso 14 zzso as a zzso zzso and it is assigned to the zzso family together with the zzso 14 zzso from zzso and zzso The presence of highly zzso regions in the zzso acid zzso analogous zzso and the same zzso role demonstrate that the zzso 14 zzso are zzso zzso The zzso 14 zzso zzso an essential step in zzso zzso as evidenced by the absence of a 14 zzso group in all known functional zzso A functional zzso zzso 14 zzso was expressed at high levels in zzso coli and zzso using an efficient method based on zzso zzso zzso phase zzso The zzso zzso zzso produced a type I spectrum with zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso confirms that zzso 14 zzso zzso the 14 zzso of zzso to 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso The isolation of a zzso clone zzso the plant zzso 14 zzso combined with the previously isolated zzso clones for zzso and zzso zzso 14 zzso provides an important tool in the rational design of specific zzso towards the individual zzso 14 zzso
