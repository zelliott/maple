One of the zzso proteins in the bark of elderberry zzso zzso has been identified as a novel type 2 zzso protein that exhibits a normal zzso zzso activity, but is devoid of zzso binding zzso zzso analysis of the corresponding zzso clones revealed a striking zzso to the previously cloned bark zzso from zzso suggesting that the new protein is a zzso zzso zzso modeling of the protein confirmed that its A chain is fully active, whereas its B chain contains two functionally inactive zzso zzso These findings not only demonstrate for the first time the occurrence of a type 2 zzso protein with an inactive B chain, but also offer interesting perspectives for the synthesis of zzso with an improved zzso
