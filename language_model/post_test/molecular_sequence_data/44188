Despite extensive study following the pioneering work of zzso on lens development zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso and the subsequent establishment of the concept of embryonic zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso lens induction remains largely zzso Here we report that in zzso expression of zzso results in lens formation in a cell autonomous zzso In animal cap experiments, zzso induced expression of the zzso marker beta zzso without inducing the general neural marker zzso zzso zzso expression also resulted in the formation of zzso zzso in whole zzso as well as in animal cap zzso indicating that in zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso zzso can direct the development of major components of the zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso formed in whole zzso without association with neural zzso zzso giving rise to anterior neural tissue in animal cap zzso resulted in the expression of both beta zzso and zzso Given the ability of zzso to direct lens formation, we propose that the establishment of zzso expression in the zzso lens zzso during normal development is likely to be a critical response of zzso zzso to early lens zzso
