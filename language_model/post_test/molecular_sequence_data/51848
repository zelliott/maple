The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined by sequencing the intact protein zzso zzso and peptides originated by zzso zzso and zzso Twelve zzso zzso and two sugar chain binding sites at zzso and zzso are zzso identities with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is composed of 107 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso including the six zzso bridges and zzso the sugar zzso The zzso zzso zzso has approximately zzso sequence identity with that of zzso and zzso with the fish zzso zzso zzso sequences among zzso zzso numbers zzso and zzso extensively differed from those of the zzso
