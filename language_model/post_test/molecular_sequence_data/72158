A key question relating to zzso zzso is the way in which closely related zzso chains discriminate between each other to assemble in a zzso zzso zzso assembly of zzso occurs via an initial interaction between the zzso followed by zzso propagation of the zzso domain in the C to N zzso zzso signals within the zzso must, therefore, determine the selective association of individual zzso zzso We have used the pro zzso chain of type III zzso zzso zzso and the pro zzso chain of type I zzso zzso zzso as examples of zzso chains that are either capable or incapable of zzso When we exchanged the zzso of the pro zzso chain and the pro zzso chain we demonstrated that this domain is both necessary and sufficient to direct the assembly of zzso with correctly aligned zzso To identify the sequences within this domain that determine selective association we constructed a series of zzso zzso chains in which we exchanged specific sequences from the pro zzso zzso with the corresponding region within the pro zzso zzso (and vice zzso and zzso for the ability of these molecules to form zzso Using this approach we have identified a zzso sequence of 15 zzso acids which directs zzso zzso By exchanging this sequence between different zzso chains we can direct chain association and, zzso assemble molecules with defined chain zzso
