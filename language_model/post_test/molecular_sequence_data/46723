The interaction of zzso with the nuclear zzso via zzso attachment region zzso DNA is considered to be of fundamental importance for zzso organization in all zzso zzso zzso binding zzso protein 1 zzso from tomato is a novel plant protein that specifically binds to zzso zzso Its filament zzso structure makes it a likely candidate for a structural component of the nuclear zzso zzso is located at nuclear zzso zzso structures at the nuclear zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel protein that specifically interacts with zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso binding zzso zzso associated factor 1 zzso is a small, zzso zzso protein that is zzso expressed and has no similarity to known zzso zzso like zzso is located at the nuclear periphery and is a component of the nuclear zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are in zzso interaction partners and that both proteins are components of a nuclear zzso previously zzso in plants, that connects the nuclear envelope and the internal nuclear zzso
