We used molecular evidence to examine the roles that zzso mechanisms zzso and drainage changes during the zzso have played in producing zzso structure within and among South American fish species of the temperate perch family zzso The zzso include two South American zzso zzso and zzso each containing several species, all of which are endemic to southern Argentina and Chile zzso zzso zzso constructed using zzso DNA zzso control region zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso sequences support the current zzso at the zzso level (both zzso and zzso form strongly supported, zzso zzso but indicate that zzso zzso need zzso zzso patterns at the zzso support the hypothesis that the zzso have been a major barrier to gene zzso Most species diversity occurs in zzso to the west of the zzso together with some ancient zzso among zzso zzso In contrast, only one species zzso zzso is found east of the zzso and little to no zzso structure occurs among populations in this zzso zzso analyses of zzso sequences suggest that eastern populations last went through a major bottleneck zzso 188 zzso zzso a date consistent with the onset of the penultimate and largest zzso zzso in zzso We suggest that eastern populations have undergone repeated zzso events as a consequence of glacial cycles, and that the shallow zzso is due to mixing during zzso zzso The area of greater diversity west of the zzso lies outside the northern limit of the zzso zzso mismatch analysis of the zzso zzso which is restricted to this area suggests a long-established population at zzso We conclude that patterns of genetic diversity in these South American zzso have been primarily influenced by barriers to gene flow zzso zzso and to a lesser extent, isolation in river zzso and by glacial cycles, which have resulted in population contraction, zzso of some zzso and the temporary breakdown of zzso barriers among eastern river zzso
