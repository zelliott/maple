This work addresses the zzso of zzso zzso interaction liquid zzso conditions for the comprehensive characterization of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso on a zzso zzso column based on their zzso structure and zzso acid zzso The contribution of zzso interactions to the retention of charged zzso was found to be zzso Thus, zzso carrying neutral zzso were more retained than zzso because zzso charged zzso acid zzso were zzso zzso by the stationary zzso In addition, zzso differing only in the position of the linkage of the zzso acid zzso could be zzso The same zzso zzso was observed for model systems constituted by a synthetic zzso zzso zzso to neutral and zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso was carried out on an zzso zzso trap tandem mass zzso at both positive and negative zzso zzso zzso fragmentation at positive zzso mode was valid for determining the zzso structure as the resulting main fragments corresponded to zzso zzso derived from sequential zzso bond zzso whilst the fragmentation of the zzso structure was preferably obtained through the formation of zzso zzso at the zzso stage, allowing the complete structure zzso of the zzso zzso Overall, the developed method allowed the identification and characterization of 41 zzso covering all the known zzso sites without any previous enrichment zzso These results point out that zzso coupled to zzso zzso procedures can be a powerful technique for future zzso zzso
