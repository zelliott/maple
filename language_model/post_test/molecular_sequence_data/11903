zzso cells often display a zzso zzso but the mechanisms involved are largely zzso We have studied here the recently identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the well-known drug resistance marker zzso using a panel of 16 human melanoma cell lines and 71 benign and zzso zzso tissue zzso By flow zzso and zzso expression of zzso was not zzso on the protein level in the 10 cell lines zzso although by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso gene expression was demonstrated in 2 of 10 cell zzso In addition, zzso revealed zzso expression in only 1 of 71 zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was detected in a subset of melanoma cell lines by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso (4 of zzso zzso expression was observed in 8 of 10 melanoma cell lines by zzso and in 10 of 10 by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Furthermore, zzso was detected zzso in almost 50% of primary and zzso melanoma zzso although no significant differences were found between zzso taken before or after zzso zzso of zzso was detected in a subset of zzso with zzso cells exhibiting up to zzso positive zzso zzso In 13 of 21 primary zzso and 23 of 37 zzso more than zzso of tumor cells were stained by the zzso zzso zzso Particularly in the group of zzso with more than 50% of zzso cells, 7 of 11 of the zzso had been previously exposed to zzso zzso Although the expression of membrane transport proteins may explain only the zzso toward zzso natural compounds and not resistance against zzso agents, the lack of zzso expression after zzso treatment and the significant expression of zzso and zzso in melanoma cells provide first insights into the drug-resistant zzso in zzso Additional studies analyzing the role of zzso and zzso in zzso of melanoma are zzso
