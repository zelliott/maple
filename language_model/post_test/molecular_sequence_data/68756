The zzso gene from zzso zzso was identified by zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso DNA using zzso derived from regions of high zzso between the products of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The product zzso by the zzso gene is a predicted type II membrane protein of 425 zzso acid zzso with a short zzso zzso a zzso region and a large zzso domain containing zzso with a short zzso zzso a zzso region and a large zzso domain containing four potential zzso zzso zzso has zzso identity with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso One member of this gene family, zzso (also known as zzso zzso and Robbins, zzso encodes an zzso zzso which adds the third zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso which produce shortened zzso zzso zzso harboring a zzso gene disruption zzso zzso chains with the zzso patterns of five zzso zzso A zzso zzso in zzso leads to partial resistance to killer toxin and hints that zzso which encodes a putative zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso
