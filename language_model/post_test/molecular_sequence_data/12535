The zzso zzso zzso exists in two alternatively spliced zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which differ by 29 zzso acids in the third zzso zzso The functional differences between these two zzso are still zzso We have performed zzso studies on the zzso and zzso receptors expressed in zzso cells in order to follow the zzso processing of the two zzso Both zzso are present in three zzso zzso a newly zzso zzso a partially zzso product, and a fully zzso mature zzso zzso However, the processing to the mature zzso differs between the two zzso First, the zzso zzso is processed to the mature zzso species faster than the zzso zzso Second, at 20 degrees C the zzso zzso is fully processed to the zzso species, whereas the zzso zzso persists in its partially processed zzso zzso Finally, a significant portion of the zzso zzso remains in its partially processed form in an zzso compartment and does not reach the plasma zzso These results give rise to the suggestion that the difference observed between the two alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso zzso may lie in their zzso processing and zzso zzso
