We describe the structure of the promoter and zzso 1 of the human and rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of the two genes are zzso identical zzso to zzso and contain a completely zzso zzso response zzso Although both genes are single zzso multiple zzso events of the human transcript lead to multiple zzso Based on several lines of evidence alternative forms of zzso of rat zzso analogous to those in the human are not zzso Both rat and human promoters direct the zzso of reporter genes when introduced into rat zzso and zzso zzso
