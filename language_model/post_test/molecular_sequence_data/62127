zzso protein alpha zzso is one of the key zzso factors that mediate lineage zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso zzso into mature zzso Although zzso is known to induce zzso while suppressing zzso zzso it is unclear how zzso regulates this cell fate choice at the zzso zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso differentiation inhibit the alternate cell fate choice, that of zzso through zzso of zzso This zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso 1 and/or 2 zzso which interact with zzso through an zzso zzso site and zzso zzso zzso As a consequence of zzso zzso induction of zzso differentiation by zzso or zzso acid is zzso Our analysis of zzso by fluorescent resonance energy transfer revealed that zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso increasing the distance between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso development is partly regulated by an zzso change in the zzso of zzso that favors zzso differentiation by blocking zzso
