zzso of zzso cells depends on a zzso process zzso specific zzso proteins become targeted to specialized membrane zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso zzso zzso Lost zzso that plays a crucial role in the polarization of embryonic zzso during cellular zzso zzso At subsequent stages of development, zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso localized protein zzso IV zzso zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso interference lead to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso IV and cause a zzso loss of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is required to establish and maintain cell polarity and zzso in different molecular complexes that define zzso and lateral membrane zzso
