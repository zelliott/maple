zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso that defines a subset of zzso cells responsible for the rejection of parental zzso bone zzso by F1 mice has been shown previously to react with zzso Here, the zzso zzso was found to detect two zzso molecules in B6 zzso Two zzso clones were isolated from B6 zzso cells, one identical to previously reported zzso and the other a novel zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the latter differs from that of zzso at only 4 zzso whereas the previously reported zzso differs at 22 zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso cells zzso with the two zzso showed that the zzso zzso binds to both zzso zzso while another zzso zzso zzso binds to the newly described zzso but not the previously reported zzso zzso flow zzso analysis detected zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso cells from zzso but not zzso zzso The level of zzso expression on B6 zzso cells detected by the zzso zzso was substantially lower than that on zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity of the novel zzso was indistinguishable from that of zzso whereas no binding was zzso with previously reported zzso These results demonstrate that the newly described zzso not the previously reported zzso is the probable B6 zzso form of zzso The previously reported zzso must be zzso by a separate gene and should be renamed zzso The implication of these results with respect to the role of zzso in hybrid resistance is zzso
