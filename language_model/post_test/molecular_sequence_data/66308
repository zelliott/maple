Two zzso receptors zzso and zzso with sequence similarity to zzso zzso receptors have been previously zzso These receptors have been shown to form specific interactions with zzso that resemble zzso zzso zzso which have a characteristic zzso zzso We hypothesized that similar zzso receptors exist in the zzso zzso zzso that may regulate the numerous effects that this family of peptides exerts on a range of target zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso was used, with primer design based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library prepared from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso As an approach to testing the function of this zzso in zzso the technique of zzso zzso zzso gene interference was zzso zzso experiments suggest that the putative zzso of zzso zzso expression may increase juvenile hormone zzso zzso
