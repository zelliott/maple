zzso precursor protein zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso A zzso product of zzso called zzso is a major component of the diffuse and zzso deposits found in zzso diseased zzso The normal zzso role of zzso remains largely unknown despite much zzso A knowledge of its function will not only provide insights into the genesis of the disease but may also prove vital in the development of an effective zzso Here we describe the zzso A resolution crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso which is responsible, among other things, for stimulation of zzso zzso The structure reveals a highly charged basic surface that may interact with zzso in the brain and an abutting zzso surface that is proposed to play an important functional role such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso similarities with zzso growth factors, taken together with its known zzso properties, suggests the zzso zzso domain could function as a growth factor in zzso
