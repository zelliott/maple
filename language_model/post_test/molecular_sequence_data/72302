We have previously reported on the isolation of several zzso expressed genes derived from young and zzso non growing zzso human fetal zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso population doubling zzso encodes the 3' end of the human zzso of the Twist zzso Twist genes zzso basic zzso zzso zzso factors that play crucial roles in zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and sequencing of the zzso human twist zzso It encodes a protein of 201 zzso acids with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to mouse zzso and zzso sequence conservation in the zzso region among all species in which it has been zzso We further show that expression of human twist is retained in zzso zzso and cell lines derived from adult zzso
