zzso zzso of the zzso are large zzso zzso that play a key role in cellular zzso zzso of the zzso from an inactive to an active state is accompanied by substantial structural zzso Here, we construct a zzso model of the zzso domain incorporating experimental structures for the two stable states, and simulate the dynamics of zzso transitions in zzso zzso We explore the transition energy landscapes by constructing a structural network among clusters of zzso from the zzso From the structural network, two major ensembles of pathways for the zzso are zzso In the first transition pathway, we find a coordinated switching mechanism of interactions among the zzso zzso the zzso and the beta strands in the zzso of the zzso zzso In a second pathway, the zzso change is coupled to a partial unfolding of the zzso region of the zzso zzso We also characterize the switching mechanism for the zzso zzso and the zzso in zzso Finally, we test the performance of a zzso model and its ability to account for the structural zzso in the context of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide a broad framework for understanding the main features of the zzso transition taking place upon zzso zzso
