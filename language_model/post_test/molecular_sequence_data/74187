zzso DNA synthesis requires the supply of zzso zzso zzso independent of nuclear DNA zzso In resting and zzso cells that withdraw from the cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso formation for the zzso zzso in zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso in zzso remains zzso Here, we identified an expressed sequence tag zzso which encodes a zzso with a zzso import sequence at its zzso designated as zzso zzso cells expressing zzso fused to green fluorescent protein zzso displayed green zzso in zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso level of cellular zzso and promoted the conversion of radioactive zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso was detected in several zzso and zzso cell zzso We also generated zzso zzso and used it for zzso zzso to demonstrate zzso expression of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso protein expression was zzso in zzso zzso cells, suggesting the coordinated regulation of zzso expression with the terminal differentiation zzso
