Members of the zzso zzso zzso family have recently been identified as functional receptors of the zzso family of zzso Here we show the rat zzso locus to be complex, zzso at least four distinct zzso Three of the zzso zzso are full-length zzso zzso zzso that differ by novel zzso acid insertions in the zzso zzso A fourth protein is a truncated zzso that lacks the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso indicate that zzso receptors interact with zzso and not with the related zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, high and low affinity zzso sites are associated with the zzso zzso zzso and transient expression of zzso receptors in zzso cells indicates that the zzso outgrowth response zzso by zzso is dramatic in receptors lacking the novel zzso insert zzso but absent in receptors containing the 14 zzso acid insert in the zzso domain zzso These data suggest that the zzso locus encodes receptors that may be capable of zzso different biological responses within the zzso This could have important implications in understanding the role of zzso in the development of the zzso nervous zzso
