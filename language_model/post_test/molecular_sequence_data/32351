zzso has been implied as an zzso in zzso arthritis zzso zzso with zzso zzso arthritis in zzso zzso mice but not in other strains of mice zzso zzso zzso In humans, the strongest genetic association with zzso is to the shared zzso zzso and zzso peptides are predicted to bind to the zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso mice transgenic zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be susceptible to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice were zzso with a mixture of zzso zzso peptides and tested for immune responses to the corresponding peptides as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso immune responses to zzso and several of its peptides were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice showed only transient zzso responses to different zzso peptides and little zzso zzso zzso an immune response to peptides of zzso can be induced zzso in zzso zzso mice as anticipated from the predicted and actual binding affinities of these peptides for the zzso zzso Failure to induce arthritis in these zzso zzso mice may be due to a lack of appropriate zzso zzso
