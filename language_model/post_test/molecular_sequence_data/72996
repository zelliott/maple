zzso display of zzso was used to isolate a full-length zzso and a partial zzso alfalfa zzso induced during infection with the zzso pathogen zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences are similar to each other and resemble plant zzso proteins and tree zzso zzso zzso is a member of a gene family in zzso which may also include the putative zzso gene zzso Unlike many zzso genes described in similar systems, expression of zzso genes does not correlate with resistance to zzso zzso We speculate zzso is induced in response to plant zzso
