A prerequisite to understanding the evolution of the human X zzso is the analysis of zzso of zzso genes in different zzso We have focused on the zzso zzso gene in human zzso zzso We show that whereas the human gene spans a zzso region of 54 zzso the zzso zzso gene is zzso in a zzso zzso However, we could not find zzso zzso between this region of human zzso and the equivalent zzso zzso zzso A zzso clone containing the zzso zzso gene does not contain other zzso zzso Instead we identified zzso of human genes that are zzso zzso the zzso zzso type I zzso which is implicated in zzso zzso and central core disease, and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso highlights zzso sequences potentially involved in zzso Interestingly, zzso of this gene that are present in the human and mouse zzso seem to be absent in the compact zzso zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso zzso clone containing zzso zzso shows an intermediate zzso size in this zzso zzso analysis of this zzso clone did not reveal other known zzso neither the zzso zzso nor the zzso zzso nor other human zzso genes were zzso
