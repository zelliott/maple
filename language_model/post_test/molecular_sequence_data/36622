In a zzso zzso prepared from acid extracts of zzso brain, several zzso zzso peptides were detected and two of these were zzso zzso of the peptides by sequence analysis, mass zzso and zzso zone zzso identified them as a zzso nine zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso and as an zzso four zzso truncated form of zzso corresponding to zzso zzso The former finding suggests that the removal of the signal zzso in zzso occurs by zzso zzso between zzso and zzso The presence of truncated zzso might refer to a zzso where zzso is zzso by removal of functionally important zzso acid zzso from the zzso
