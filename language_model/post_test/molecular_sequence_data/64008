zzso infection with zzso C virus zzso is a leading cause of chronic zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso It has recently been shown that zzso zzso replication is susceptible to small interfering zzso zzso but the zzso activity of zzso depends very much on their zzso to the target zzso Thus, the high degree of sequence diversity between different zzso zzso and the rapid evolution of new zzso is a major problem in the development of zzso gene zzso For this study, we developed two alternative strategies to overcome these zzso In one approach, we used zzso zzso zzso to simultaneously target multiple sites of the viral zzso We show that zzso directed against various regions of the zzso coding sequence as well as the zzso zzso region zzso zzso efficiently block the replication of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In an alternative approach, we generated zzso zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso A total of 12 zzso most of them targeting highly zzso sequence motifs within the zzso zzso or the early core coding region, were analyzed for their zzso zzso After the zzso of zzso cells containing a zzso zzso zzso we found that all zzso targeting sequences in domain IV or nearby coding sequences blocked viral zzso In contrast, only one of seven zzso targeting sequences in domain II or III had a similar degree of zzso activity, indicating that large sections of the zzso are resistant to zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso zzso cells that zzso expressed certain zzso zzso zzso were largely resistant to a challenge with zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso provides a new possibility for zzso zzso
