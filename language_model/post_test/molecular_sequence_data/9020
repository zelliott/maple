In this study, we have cloned and characterized a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of this zzso zzso zzso revealed 531 zzso with around zzso sequence identity to known zzso zzso The zzso was functionally zzso in zzso coli and investigated with respect to zzso spectrum and kinetic zzso zzso specificity studies revealed that a large variety of zzso and zzso zzso are converted by this zzso A high zzso efficiency against zzso was observed and seems to be a particular property of this zzso The thus produced zzso derivatives are valuable building blocks for the synthesis of a variety of natural products and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso revealed activity against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which have not been reported to be accepted by typical zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso from zzso zzso indeed might be rather unique and since no zzso originating from zzso organisms have been produced zzso so far, this study provides the first example for such an zzso
