The zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized in zzso zzso zzso zzso an endangered freshwater fish species, and changes in zzso zzso expression in response to various zzso such as challenge with zzso zzso bacteria, or heavy metals, were zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses zzso features of zzso zzso including its zzso zzso gene structure (five zzso interrupted by four zzso and high sequence identity with zzso zzso in coding regions, including a typical zzso zzso zzso The zzso upstream region of the zzso zzso zzso gene lacked a zzso zzso zzso however, it displayed various zzso factor binding elements that may be involved in immune and stress responses, as well as the zzso of zzso that mediate the metabolism of metals and other zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes from fish and zzso zzso databases revealed zzso zzso of the zzso locus in the zzso zzso zzso transcripts were zzso detected in diverse zzso with variable levels of zzso expression using an zzso zzso zzso expression in the liver and kidney were significantly modulated by injection of zzso zzso 5, or 10 zzso zzso body zzso zzso zzso challenge (5 zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso zzso and heavy metal exposure zzso zzso or zzso at 5 zzso zzso from this study suggest that zzso plays an important role in the host zzso against zzso damage caused by zzso inflammation and/or zzso related stress in this zzso
