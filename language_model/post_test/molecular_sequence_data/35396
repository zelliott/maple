zzso derived zzso zzso type 2 strains strongly divergent from the corresponding vaccine strain, zzso 2, were repeatedly isolated from sewage in Slovakia over a period of 22 months in zzso Cell cultures of stool specimens from known immune deficient patients and from an identified putative source population of 500 people failed to identify the potential zzso of the zzso The occurrence of zzso in sewage stopped without any zzso No zzso cases were reported in Slovakia during the zzso According to a zzso search and similarity zzso the closest known relative of the first isolate zzso through all main sections of the zzso was the type 2 zzso zzso strain, with zzso identities in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parts of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso percent, zzso zzso properties of selected zzso zzso strains resembled those of zzso strains isolated from immune deficient individuals with prolonged zzso infection zzso including zzso changes and moderate zzso in the transgenic mouse zzso One hundred and two unique zzso coding sequences were determined from zzso strains isolated from 34 sewage zzso zzso differences from zzso 2 in the zzso coding region ranged from zzso to zzso percent, and reached a maximum of zzso percent between the zzso strains under zzso Most of the zzso zzso were synonymous but as many as 93 zzso acid positions out of 301 in zzso showed zzso We conclude that zzso individuals with prolonged zzso infection are not as rare as suggested by the studies on immune deficient patients known to the health care systems and zzso genetic divergence of zzso strains may remain extensive during years long replication in zzso
