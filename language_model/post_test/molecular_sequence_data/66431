Death receptors in the zzso zzso zzso signal for zzso via the ordered recruitment of zzso and zzso to a zzso signaling complex zzso However, the nature of the zzso interactions in the signaling complex is not well zzso Here we show that zzso zzso through a zzso zzso motif in the death zzso domain zzso Despite exhibiting similar binding to both zzso and zzso and preserved overall secondary structure, zzso zzso motif zzso cannot zzso zzso or zzso zzso and fail to recruit zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can transform zzso into a zzso zzso that interferes with zzso zzso and formation of microscopically visible zzso zzso These findings suggest that lateral interactions among adapter molecules are required for death zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso into zzso zzso as a key function of death zzso adapter proteins in initiating zzso
