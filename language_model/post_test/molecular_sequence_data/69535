High field zzso studies of a synthetic zzso zzso fragment, corresponding to zzso zzso to zzso within the zzso leader zzso transcript, have been carried zzso Seven well resolved zzso zzso zzso corresponding to six zzso and one zzso hydrogen bonded base pairs, together with their characteristic zzso patterns can be identified in the zzso zzso This experimental result provides direct evidence for the zzso zzso secondary structure, zzso which has been reported to act as a zzso termination signal for zzso zzso
