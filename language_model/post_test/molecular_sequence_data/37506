We thoroughly zzso the results of 40 blind predictions for which an experimental answer was made available at the fourth meeting on the critical assessment of protein structure methods zzso Using our comparative zzso and fold recognition zzso we made 29 predictions for targets that had sequence identities ranging from 50% to zzso to the nearest related protein with known zzso Using our zzso zzso zzso we made zzso predictions for targets that had no zzso sequence zzso 

For 23 of these zzso we produced models ranging from zzso to zzso A root mean square zzso zzso for the zzso atoms between the model and the corresponding experimental structure for all or large parts of the zzso with model zzso zzso fairly zzso with respect to sequence identity zzso the higher the sequence identity, the better the zzso We produced nine models with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso A zzso zzso for zzso zzso proteins (or large fragments of a zzso with a prediction accuracy of zzso A zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso 

The areas of protein structure prediction that work well, and areas that need improvement, are zzso by examining how our methods have performed over the past four zzso zzso These results have implications for zzso the structure of all zzso proteins zzso by the zzso of an zzso
