Although most nuclear hormone receptors are zzso zzso zzso certain members of this zzso such as zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso The zzso function of these receptors has been localized to the zzso binding domain zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso of either the entire zzso or only the zzso region of the zzso zzso acids zzso is able to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso From this result we zzso the existence of a limiting factor zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso zzso To support this hypothesis, we identified zzso acids in the zzso region of the zzso of zzso that are important for the zzso interaction and for the zzso function of zzso The zzso activity of zzso was unaffected by zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso at position 174 and/or zzso acid at position 177 are important for zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso also lost the ability to silence target zzso suggesting that these zzso acids are important for zzso zzso Control experiments indicate that this zzso zzso maintains its zzso hormone binding and zzso zzso These findings further strengthen the idea that the zzso region of the zzso of zzso interacts with a putative zzso zzso to achieve zzso of zzso gene zzso
