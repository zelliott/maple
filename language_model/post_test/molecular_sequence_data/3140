zzso is an zzso zzso which is thought to stabilize zzso filaments and influence many aspects of zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene encodes zzso and the gene product zzso is known to be essential for the formation of the zzso zzso ring and hence for zzso in the zzso cell zzso 

We isolated zzso zzso zzso that were defective in cell fusion during zzso One of them turned out to carry a point zzso in zzso We found that the original zzso zzso zzso frequently failed to undergo cell fusion when zzso at a zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso isolated by targeted zzso also showed defects in both cell fusion and zzso A decrease in the amount of zzso zzso also affected both, but cell growth was more severely blocked than cell fusion in this zzso zzso revealed that zzso was localized as a spot at the zzso attachment site during zzso without overlapping with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is indispensable for cell fusion during zzso in zzso zzso However, cell fusion appears to require fewer zzso molecules than zzso We speculate that zzso may organize a small zzso zzso at the zzso contact site in each mating cell, which plays a key role in cell zzso
