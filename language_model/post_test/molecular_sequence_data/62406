The small heat shock proteins zzso belong to a family of proteins that function as molecular zzso by preventing protein zzso and are also known to contain a zzso region termed zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso and partial characterization of a novel zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso agent of the citrus variegated zzso zzso The gene was cloned into a zzso zzso to zzso the protein coupled with fusion tags in zzso coli zzso The expressed zzso was zzso by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso and had its identity determined by mass zzso zzso The correct folding of the zzso zzso protein was verified by circular zzso zzso Finally, the zzso protein also proved to efficiently prevent induced zzso of insulin, strongly indicating a zzso zzso
