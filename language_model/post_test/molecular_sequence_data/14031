The gene zzso a 51 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was isolated by zzso using an zzso raised against zzso zzso alkaline zzso DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing a gene zzso the 51 zzso protein revealed one complete and two incomplete zzso Database searches using the zzso program revealed significant zzso between the zzso zzso 51 zzso protein and the zzso protein of zzso coli, which functions in zzso zzso The cloned 51 zzso protein zzso a functional product that zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso just upstream of zzso coded for a protein that was zzso zzso with the zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso just downstream of zzso coded for a protein that was zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which functions in zzso synthesis and is responsible for zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso contains a zzso of the zzso coli zzso synthesis gene zzso and indicate the possibility of a cluster of genes responsible for cell division and cell growth, as in the zzso coli zzso zzso
