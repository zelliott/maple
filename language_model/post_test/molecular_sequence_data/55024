zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family, which represents a major source of zzso oxygen species zzso in the vascular zzso zzso zzso production mainly depends on the expression levels of the zzso The present study was aimed to investigate the mechanisms of zzso zzso regulation by zzso zzso zzso In human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso led to a marked decrease in zzso zzso zzso A similar zzso of zzso zzso expression was observed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was associated with enhanced zzso zzso increased zzso accessibility in the human zzso promoter region, with no significant changes in DNA zzso In addition, we provided evidence that zzso played an important role in controlling zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso led to a zzso of zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso treatment, the binding of zzso to the zzso promoter region was reduced despite the open zzso zzso In zzso the binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso promoter was significantly inhibited as well, which may explain the reduction in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso in human zzso cells by preventing the binding of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter, most likely because of a zzso zzso zzso
