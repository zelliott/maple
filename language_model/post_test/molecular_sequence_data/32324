The crystal structure of a novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso in its free form and in complex with zzso zzso and zzso d zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A, zzso A, and zzso A resolution, zzso The protein structure is composed of two zzso which consist of four and six zzso connected by two zzso zzso and structural comparisons reveal that zzso is the third member of a newly identified family of zzso zzso which includes zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso that share a high degree of structural similarity and zzso zzso The data for the free zzso are the highest resolution data for any protein of this zzso The crystal structures of the zzso in complex with two zzso zzso and zzso which differ only in the zzso of a single zzso zzso group, provide the structural basis for its zzso zzso zzso has two distinct zzso sites, a primary and a zzso zzso binds at the primary site, whereas zzso binds only at the secondary zzso Thus, zzso has the ability to recognize and probably bind at the same time two different zzso zzso zzso comparison to zzso zzso zzso complexes reveals that the primary site is also able to bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the secondary site zzso The features of the molecular recognition at the two sites are described in zzso
