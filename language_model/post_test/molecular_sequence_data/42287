The zzso are a family of zzso proteins that have been implicated in the initial interaction between zzso and the vascular zzso The three members of this family will bind to the zzso zzso zzso alpha 2-3 Gal beta zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso and related zzso In this report, we examine the molecular details of that recognition using zzso carbohydrates with specific modifications on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso require zzso groups at the 2, 3 and 4 positions of the zzso zzso zzso however, requires only the zzso zzso group, while tolerating removal of the oxygen at positions 2 or 4 of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso side chain or the zzso group of the zzso acid have little effect on the binding of any of the zzso All three zzso bind efficiently to an zzso with a zzso replacement for the zzso acid zzso or zzso beta zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso For zzso binding to zzso appears to be equivalent to binding to zzso while for zzso and zzso binding to the zzso structure shows characteristics distinct from zzso zzso Taken together, these data indicate that, while all three zzso can recognize zzso zzso zzso and zzso each display distinct zzso zzso zzso
