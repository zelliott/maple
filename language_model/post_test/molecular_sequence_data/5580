The zzso three-fourths of the zzso C virus zzso zzso protein has been shown to possess an zzso zzso activity, typical of members of the DEAD box family of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso protein contains four zzso acid motifs zzso in DEAD box zzso In order to inspect the roles of individual zzso acid zzso in the four zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis was used in this zzso Thirteen zzso proteins were constructed, and their zzso activities were zzso zzso in the zzso motif was important for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the absence of zzso zzso A zzso in the X position of the zzso motif disrupted the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution at zzso of the zzso motif made the protein possess high zzso zzso In addition, we now report zzso of zzso activity of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was indispensable for the zzso activity, and this zzso represents a distinguishing feature between DEAD box and zzso zzso There are four zzso zzso in the zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso and the second, zzso was important for zzso binding and zzso activity, even though it is less well zzso than other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were essential for the zzso zzso As the various zzso activities were altered by zzso the zzso characteristics were also zzso
