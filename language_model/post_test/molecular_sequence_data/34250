Giant cell tumor of bone zzso is an aggressive tumor consisting of zzso zzso giant cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our group has reported that the zzso cells express high levels of the bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this expression is regulated by the zzso zzso factor zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the upstream regulation of zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cells obtained from patient zzso we demonstrated that zzso a master zzso regulator, was highly expressed in all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression whereas zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, cells obtained from a zzso lung zzso showed a reverse regulatory pattern between zzso and zzso In zzso analysis, we revealed a point zzso zzso at the zzso domain of zzso This zzso zzso may be an essential underlying factor in the development and zzso of these tumors in that they lead to inappropriate zzso zzso of zzso arrested zzso zzso and the maintenance of an immature and zzso zzso
