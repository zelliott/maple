The role of human zzso zzso in the zzso of in zzso and invasive zzso of the zzso tract is well zzso In the rare disorder zzso zzso zzso in which patients develop extensive warts of unusual types and multiple zzso zzso zzso on zzso skin, current evidence suggests a probable role for a specific group of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the possible role of zzso in the zzso of zzso skin zzso zzso which occur frequently in zzso organ zzso recipients, has been zzso until recently, by the lack of availability of a sensitive detection system for a wide range of zzso zzso zzso We have used a combination of 2 sets of zzso zzso to examine 68 benign and zzso zzso collected over a 12-year period from 25 zzso zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of the zzso products were carried out to distinguish zzso DNA from cellular zzso A combination of these techniques revealed zzso DNA in all viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of invasive zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso types were zzso including 18 novel zzso In 4 patients with multiple zzso the most prevalent types were in the zzso group: zzso 20, 23, 38 and 2 novel types, zzso and zzso zzso to zzso 10 and 38, zzso These 5 zzso types were present in a total of zzso of all zzso zzso zzso The technique described represents a reliable method of zzso DNA detection in zzso The zzso group of zzso predominate in the zzso but the zzso of zzso types detected with double infection in some zzso suggests zzso in addition to zzso interaction in the zzso zzso
