Two DNA restriction zzso fragments coding for the 3' zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso spaces between them in zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso The zzso space of one of these genes contains a zzso zzso whereas the other does zzso Nevertheless, the zzso spaces contain several regions that exhibit high levels of sequence zzso and are capable of forming structures with similar base zzso An analysis of Southern blots of zzso DNA cut with one and two restriction zzso indicated that zzso zzso has a total of six zzso zzso
