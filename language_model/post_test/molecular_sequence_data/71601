The zzso for the sea zzso zzso zzso protein zzso a 40 zzso protein which binds two zzso regions of zzso DNA (the zzso region and the boundary between the zzso transcribed zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso Four different zzso regions have been detected that are related to each other in pairs and do not contain the zzso zzso zzso The in zzso zzso mature protein zzso zzso zzso deprived of the putative signal zzso binds specifically to its DNA target sequence and produces a zzso I footprint identical to that given by the natural zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso one of which is zzso and two small zzso and zzso basic zzso A deletion zzso analysis of the zzso protein has shown that the zzso region and the two zzso zzso are necessary for the zzso Furthermore, evidence was provided that zzso binds DNA as a zzso This rules out a zzso role for the zzso zzso and rather suggests that zzso interactions between zzso zzso take zzso A database search has revealed as the most zzso zzso a match with the human zzso zzso termination factor zzso a protein that also binds DNA as a zzso and contains three zzso zzso forming zzso zzso These similarities, and the observation that zzso sites contain the zzso of zzso coded by opposite strands and the zzso of the zzso structure, point to a dual function of the protein in modulating sea zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso
