To detect less prevalent zzso such as zzso zzso in sewage from a highly zzso community, a method was developed to efficiently recover viruses and remove zzso zzso The method consisted of initial separation of zzso from liquid, followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To zzso viruses from the separated zzso zzso M zzso zzso zzso was as efficient as zzso beef extract but zzso no zzso zzso In samples that were concentrated approximately zzso zzso of the initially seeded viruses were zzso When zzso type 3 zzso zzso strain at low levels and zzso zzso strain at high levels were seeded in raw zzso zzso was specifically detected in the final sample concentrates at sensitivities of 14 zzso by direct zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso While applying the method to international airplane zzso which contains high levels of zzso as well as commercial zzso zzso (7 of zzso of the samples were found to harbor zzso by both cell culture zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso products revealed that multiple zzso zzso were amplified from each final sewage zzso whereas the fewer virus zzso detected by cell culture zzso were probably the better growing zzso By this method, we demonstrated that air travel may contribute to the intercontinental dissemination of enteric zzso
