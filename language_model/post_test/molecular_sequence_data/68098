A DNA sequence zzso rat zzso NO zzso zzso was isolated and cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells with the construct zzso resulted in the synthesis of high levels of zzso NO zzso Analysis of the expression pattern revealed zzso zzso active NO zzso in the zzso of cell zzso Active zzso could also be zzso from culture zzso using zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso This zzso was zzso by zzso to the native zzso and showed a similar degree of zzso by zzso zzso as the native zzso The majority of the zzso zzso had accumulated as zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso from insect cells should facilitate zzso of zzso NO zzso
