Previously, we mapped the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 49, zzso Since zzso genes tend to be zzso unknown zzso may be present in the vicinity of those mapped to new zzso zzso zzso by this hypothesis, we analyzed the zzso region containing the gene for zzso zzso and have identified a novel zzso zzso termed zzso The genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso are localized within a region of approximately 40 zzso By Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the heart and zzso We have generated zzso zzso in a zzso expression zzso zzso induced transient calcium zzso specifically in zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso cells with an zzso of 3 zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso to zzso zzso cells with an zzso of 13 zzso zzso was zzso for normal peripheral blood zzso and zzso at high zzso zzso zzso is yet another functional zzso for zzso The potency of zzso as a zzso zzso seems, however, to be approximately zzso less than that of zzso Identification of zzso will further promote our understanding of the control of zzso trafficking and other zzso biological zzso The strategy used in this study may also be zzso to identification of other unknown zzso zzso
