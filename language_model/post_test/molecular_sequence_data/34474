zzso of zzso pathogens on living plant zzso to zzso implies strong zzso between host metabolism and zzso zzso by the zzso However, factors determining host suitability and establishment of infection are largely zzso We describe a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified in a screen for zzso zzso zzso with increased resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Through different molecular mechanisms, these zzso zzso zzso acid zzso leading to zzso of the zzso zzso acids Met, zzso and zzso Although zzso for the plant, the zzso do not cause defense zzso and both zzso retain full zzso to the adapted zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso Chemical treatments mimicking the zzso zzso state identified zzso as the zzso acid suppressing zzso but not Go zzso We conclude that zzso in zzso acid zzso render the zzso plants zzso as an infection zzso for zzso This may be explained by deployment of the same zzso acid zzso pathways by zzso and zzso Our data show that the plant host zzso state can, in specific ways, influence the ability of adapted zzso strains to cause zzso
