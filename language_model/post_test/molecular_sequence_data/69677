A proposal that zzso of zzso zzso might mediate electron transfer has been tested by substitution of a series of zzso and aromatic zzso at this zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso with the aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso to zzso of wild zzso zzso in zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso were less than zzso except for zzso zzso zzso is the only naturally occurring substitution for zzso at this position in zzso zzso zzso and is present in the electron zzso proposed on the basis of the crystal structure of zzso c and zzso c zzso The preference for aromatic zzso or the small zzso zzso acid, zzso at position 120 is consistent with a role for this zzso in electron zzso
