A large number of resistance zzso to the powdery zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso map to the barley zzso zzso This complex locus harbors multiple members of three zzso related gene families that zzso proteins that contain an zzso zzso zzso structure, a central zzso binding zzso site, a zzso repeat zzso region, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified zzso which encodes a zzso protein that shares 89 and zzso identical zzso with the known proteins zzso and zzso Slow zzso resistance was altered dramatically to a rapid response by zzso of zzso A series of zzso zzso swaps between zzso and zzso identified in each protein recognition domain for zzso powdery zzso fungus zzso genes zzso and zzso These zzso were within different but overlapping zzso regions and the CT zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso recognition exhibited markedly different dependence on zzso a gene required for the function of some but not all zzso resistance zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso function from zzso also zzso the response from zzso a protein known to associate physically with zzso Our findings suggest that differences in the degree of zzso dependence of different zzso immunity responses are determined by intrinsic properties of zzso zzso and place zzso activity downstream of and/or zzso with the action of resistance zzso recognition zzso
