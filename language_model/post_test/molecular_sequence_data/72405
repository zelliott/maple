We identified proteins whose amounts were altered in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso whose amounts were increased in the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso zzso II, zzso fatty acid transport zzso and zzso zzso while the decreased ones were zzso and zzso zzso Transformation of the zzso with a zzso containing the wild type zzso gene zzso the zzso As zzso experiments revealed that the rates of synthesis of the proteins were altered in the zzso zzso protein may be involved in expression of these zzso
