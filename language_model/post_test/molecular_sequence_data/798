Since the emergence of zzso much attention has been paid to the development of new technologies for zzso zzso Compared with large scale zzso analysis at the zzso level, comprehensive and reliable zzso site mapping of individual zzso is equally zzso Here, we present a modified zzso database search strategy for confident zzso site analysis of individual zzso without manual interpretation of zzso Instead of using all protein sequences in a zzso database of an zzso for the construction of a zzso database for zzso analysis, the composite database constructed for zzso site analysis of individual zzso only included the sequences of the individual target proteins and a decoy version of a small zzso protein zzso It was found that the confidence of zzso identifications could be effectively controlled when the acquired zzso and zzso zzso were searched against the above composite database followed with data zzso Because of the small size of the composite database, the zzso time for the database search is very short, which allows the adoption of zzso zzso for protein zzso to increase the coverage of zzso site zzso The sensitivity and comprehensive zzso site mapping of this approach was demonstrated by using two standard zzso samples of zzso and zzso and this approach was further applied to analyze the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which resulted in the identification of 17 zzso sites, including five novel sites on four zzso zzso
