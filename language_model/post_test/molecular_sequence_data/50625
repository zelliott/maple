Two zzso zzso of bovine viral zzso virus zzso have been zzso For both viruses two regions of their zzso zzso were found to be duplicated and zzso The viral zzso contain a small duplicated element zzso derived from the zzso zzso end far downstream of its original zzso This sequence is followed by a larger zzso which encompasses the region coding for the protein zzso a molecular marker for zzso The zzso element codes for the viral zzso zzso In the case of the viruses analyzed here the zzso of zzso is generated by zzso removal of the preceding zzso zzso For one of the zzso zzso a specific fusion protein zzso could be identified which is composed of zzso and part of zzso another viral zzso zzso characterization of the respective zzso counterpart revealed that zzso and zzso of sequences as well as the expression of zzso and zzso are specific for the zzso zzso
