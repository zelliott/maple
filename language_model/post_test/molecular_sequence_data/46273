An zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial strain devoid of zzso designated strain zzso , was isolated from tidal flat zzso of zzso in zzso island, South zzso Identification was carried out on the basis of zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that the isolate belonged to the family zzso and showed the highest sequence similarity of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Several zzso and zzso properties including growth at pH 6, sea zzso requirement, zzso zzso carbon zzso DNA zzso content and fatty acid profiles also differentiated the strain from the related members of the zzso zzso results from the zzso zzso study suggested that strain zzso represents a novel zzso and species in the family zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
