zzso are one of the major families of zzso peptides produced as part of the innate immune zzso We have studied the gene locus of the Atlantic cod zzso gene zzso by sequencing of a zzso zzso zzso have revealed the genes upstream and downstream of zzso in a sequence of zzso zzso and these include zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There appears to be no pattern of zzso observed when the zzso of zzso genes in other species was zzso Analysis of the promoter region of 1 zzso upstream of the translation start zzso led to the identification of numerous different putative zzso factor binding sites zzso that are believed to be important for the control of immune gene zzso Further studies into the quantitative expression of zzso found that it is zzso expressed in the head kidney and zzso and significant increases in expression are observed at 24 h post injection with the zzso zzso By inserting a 311 zzso zzso of the zzso promoter into a zzso reporter zzso we found that stimulation with Poly zzso results in significant zzso of gene zzso This report detailing the promoter region of a zzso gene in zzso fish, and the varied putative zzso identified, suggests that the zzso gene is highly likely to be induced in response to a wide range of different immune stimuli including bacteria and zzso
