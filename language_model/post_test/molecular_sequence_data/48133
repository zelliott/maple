It is known that clinical zzso of zzso zzso exhibit a high level of resistance to copper zzso although the molecular basis of this resistance is not zzso To investigate this, a novel zzso protein was zzso from a clinical isolate of zzso zzso The protein was extracted from zzso cells after an induction period of 10 h in a zzso suspension zzso It was further zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All protein zzso were zzso for their protein and copper zzso The zzso ratio increased steadily throughout the zzso process; the most highly zzso fraction showed a zzso increase compared to the zzso zzso with a recovery of zzso The molecular mass of the protein was 10,000 Da and a zzso study using the zzso zzso suggested that the equivalent extent of zzso binding was approximately 14 zzso zzso The zzso segment of the zzso protein revealed three zzso zzso which is typical of a zzso zzso and showed significant zzso with zzso zzso with respect to the positions of the zzso zzso This is the first report of the isolation of a zzso protein from zzso zzso
