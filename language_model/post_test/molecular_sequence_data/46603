The zzso zzso was cured from race 7 strain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains lost zzso toward zzso causing the hypersensitive reaction in previously susceptible zzso Restoration of zzso was achieved by zzso with zzso clones spanning a zzso region of the zzso that contained previously identified zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso Single zzso insertions at multiple sites (including one located in zzso abolished restoration of zzso by zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso of the zzso region identified three potential zzso zzso genes that were predicted to zzso zzso proteins and shared the zzso promoter motif indicating regulation by zzso One gene achieved partial restoration of zzso when cloned on its own and therefore was designated zzso as the first zzso gene from zzso to be identified for zzso zzso In zzso zzso acted as an zzso gene controlling expression of a rapid zzso hypersensitive zzso zzso also revealed the presence of zzso of the zzso sequence zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso The proximity of several zzso and zzso genes together with mobile zzso as well as zzso content significantly lower than that expected for zzso zzso indicates that we have located a zzso zzso island equivalent to those found in zzso zzso
