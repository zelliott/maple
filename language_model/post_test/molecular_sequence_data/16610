We present a method, called zzso Long and zzso zzso zzso zzso for directly determining zzso from an extended zzso zzso This method uses zzso zzso in long-range zzso to amplify only one of the two zzso zzso for the region of zzso zzso are then determined from these zzso zzso fragments by conventional single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This simple robust procedure makes it practical for zzso zzso of unrelated individuals, and potentially allows direct observation of zzso information for up to 40 zzso or zzso We demonstrate the feasibility of this molecular zzso procedure by generating zzso E zzso zzso from 100 unrelated zzso
