The zzso zzso responsible for carbon zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the ethanol zzso The zzso part of the zzso protein encompassing the two zinc fingers zzso class zzso and an zzso region was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein with zzso Our results show that zzso is a zzso protein able to bind to the promoters of both the specific zzso zzso zzso and of the structural zzso zzso zzso the alcohol zzso zzso zzso I protection zzso experiments revealed several specific binding sites in the zzso and in the zzso promoters having the consensus sequence zzso The disruption of one of these zzso sites in the zzso promoter overlapping the induction target for the zzso zzso results in a partially zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcription, showing that this binding site is functional in zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso the ethanol zzso by a double lock mechanism zzso both the zzso zzso zzso and the structural zzso zzso
