The expression of genes zzso zzso beta gamma zzso was investigated in isolated zzso zzso zzso from channel zzso DNA sequencing of zzso products showed that the beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2 and gamma 3 genes were expressed in the zzso Western zzso showed that at least three of these zzso proteins were zzso This first analysis of the expression of beta gamma genes in zzso zzso zzso suggests that these zzso may be involved in a variety of zzso events in these zzso
