Human and mouse zzso interacting proteins zzso are zzso containing proteins that bind to the zzso motifs of the zzso protein zzso zzso We report a new member of this gene family, a zzso Abi zzso that is a zzso for zzso zzso and that zzso with zzso if the Abi zzso domain is zzso We have identified a new function for both zzso and human zzso zzso Both proteins activate the zzso activity of zzso as zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain eliminates zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an unstable protein in cells and is present at low steady state levels but its protein level is increased zzso with zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strand of zzso reduces zzso protein levels and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of Abi protein levels may be an important mechanism for regulating the level of zzso zzso activity in the zzso
