In this paper we describe our studies on the zzso consequences of zzso DNA damage introduced by zzso OH zzso zzso and by exposure to zzso oxygen zzso released by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have made use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA, containing a 144 base pair zzso insert in the zzso alpha zzso This 144 zzso insert was used as a zzso target zzso When dilute zzso solutions of zzso zzso zzso (plus 144 zzso zzso were zzso in the presence of oxygen zzso zzso zzso or nitrous oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso very specific zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed, of which zzso to zzso zzso are the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso are for the most part concentrated into two zzso hot zzso a minor and major zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could also be zzso Under zzso zzso deletions were zzso which are absent in the presence of zzso and in the zzso spectrum more zzso to zzso zzso are zzso To investigate whether these differences were due to the small amount of H zzso which are formed under zzso zzso zzso (plus 144 zzso zzso was exposed to zzso in zzso buffer under nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso Under these conditions a remarkable shift was observed from zzso to zzso zzso while the zzso were far more scattered along the 144 zzso sequence and no zzso zzso deletions were zzso These results strongly suggest that H zzso do not cause zzso zzso zzso but may be responsible for the observed zzso to zzso zzso The kind of zzso substitution not only appeared to be dependent on the type of the water zzso but also appeared to be strongly influenced by the zzso in which the target sequence is zzso When an zzso solution of zzso zzso DNA (plus 144 zzso zzso is zzso mainly zzso to zzso zzso were found at the same major hot spot instead of zzso to zzso zzso when the 144 zzso sequence is part of zzso zzso Finally, in agreement with the observation that zzso zzso zzso with zzso in DNA, a zzso is involved in most of the zzso scored after exposure of zzso zzso zzso DNA to zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
