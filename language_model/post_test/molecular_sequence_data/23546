The importance of the zzso source to generate zzso or to construct zzso gene libraries from which to identify potent zzso zzso is zzso However, the few comparative studies that exist seem to favor the zzso zzso tissue as a zzso zzso Here the peripheral blood and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso have been employed to clone two independent gene banks of the variable zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso Several zzso zzso were retrieved after panning of these zzso zzso zzso Some of them were derived from the same zzso zzso possibly reflecting the restricted primary repertoire of zzso zzso Other zzso originated from different zzso lineages and apparently zzso toward a striking zzso zzso acid sequence motif in their zzso This illustrates the strong zzso zzso and stringent zzso selection ongoing in these zzso Although the various zzso zzso exhibit a broad range of kinetic rate zzso for their interaction with the zzso leading to equilibrium zzso from 70 zzso to 100 zzso no significant difference existed between the zzso from the two zzso zzso The zzso of both libraries were zzso in three groups based on zzso zzso Some of these zzso could inhibit and others could enhance the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso seem to sense or induce zzso changes on different zzso zzso a feature that might be exploited to study the zzso zzso flexibility and to discriminate the stages of prostate zzso
