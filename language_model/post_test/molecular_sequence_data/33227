zzso proteins zzso on exposure to the zzso component of zzso This effect is exacerbated in the presence of fluorescent zzso agents zzso which are often applied to textiles to improve product zzso zzso zzso have been identified as significant contributors to protein zzso however, the role of zzso zzso is less zzso In this study bovine zzso containing no zzso zzso was zzso in the presence and absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified using mass zzso zzso was found to be dependent on the presence of the zzso attributed to amplified generation of zzso oxygen species zzso particularly zzso zzso and zzso Four key zzso zzso contributing directly to zzso were located in zzso collagen zzso with zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso This represents the first direct characterization of the three zzso zzso in the zzso of an isolated zzso zzso and implicates the zzso zzso as a key contributor to protein zzso zzso zzso modification of the zzso itself was also zzso This study demonstrates that, even in the absence of zzso zzso significant zzso of protein zzso leading to zzso formation occurs in the presence of an zzso
