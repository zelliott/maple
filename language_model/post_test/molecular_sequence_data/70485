To obtain a clearer understanding of the evolutionary transition between zzso and zzso modes of zzso in insects, we studied the expression of two gap genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso gene zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This species has features of both zzso and zzso mode of zzso In zzso zzso expression deviates from that known in zzso in two main zzso zzso it shows an extended zzso domain that is linked to the large zzso zzso and zzso it shows a terminal expression in the zzso zzso These expression patterns are reminiscent of the zzso expression pattern in the zzso zzso which has a short germ mode of zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, was found to be rather similar to the zzso zzso both at early and late zzso eve expression starts with six stripes formed at zzso stage, while the seventh is only formed after the onset of zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, no zzso secondary Eve stripes could be observed in zzso although such zzso stripes are known from higher zzso zzso and zzso We therefore also studied another zzso zzso to address this question and found that some zzso stripes form by zzso as in zzso although zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso both with respect to zzso and molecular characteristics represents an intermediate between the zzso mode known from higher zzso such as zzso and the zzso mode found in more ancestral zzso
