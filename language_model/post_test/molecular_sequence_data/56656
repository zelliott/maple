zzso responsible for the zzso processing of precursor proteins to form zzso zzso hormones require the availability of several zzso including zzso copper, and zzso zzso For this reason, we studied the effects of 6 weeks of a zzso diet zzso 1 zzso zinc per g zzso zzso zzso and marginal zinc zzso zzso 6 zzso zinc per g zzso compared to a control diet zzso zzso zzso on the conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and heart of young adult, male zzso zzso In the zzso severe zinc zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso peptides to zzso zzso In zzso animals, zzso was selectively inhibited zzso while zzso increased all of these zzso levels compared to zzso A similar effect of zinc zzso on the zzso precursor peptides was zzso A quantitative loss of zzso from the zzso of zzso was also zzso zzso zzso results in a substantial reduction in body weight and testosterone production in male zzso zzso testosterone zzso supplementation of zzso rats resulted in a selective increase in the zzso concentration of the zzso but not of the zzso The change in zzso levels of zzso precursor peptides in the hearts of the zzso rats was consistent with a reduction in the activity of the zzso zzso H zzso We conclude that severe zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the male rat due to the combined effects of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
