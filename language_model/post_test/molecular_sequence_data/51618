The zzso channel of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to be lined by zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso at positions 4, 8 and 12 of zzso is zzso between different members, zzso and zzso selective, of the zzso zzso Parallel zzso of zzso zzso zzso are considered as simplified models of zzso zzso The relationship between S and T zzso zzso and zzso interactions is explored via evaluation of interaction energies of zzso and of zzso zzso with channel zzso Energy calculations are used to determine optimal zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may form zzso interactions with either zzso or zzso dependent upon the zzso 2 values zzso zzso and zzso zzso are considered, as are zzso models designed to mimic the zzso zzso The main conclusion of the study is that zzso flexibility at zzso 2 enables both S and T zzso to form zzso interactions with zzso or zzso zzso there is apparently no difference between S and T zzso in their interactions with zzso zzso which suggests that the presence of T zzso S zzso within the zzso motif is not a major mechanism zzso zzso selectivity may be zzso The implications of these studies with respect to more elaborate models of zzso and related receptors are zzso
