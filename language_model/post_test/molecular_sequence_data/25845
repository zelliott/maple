zzso strains of Japanese encephalitis zzso virus from a variety of geographic areas in Asia were examined by zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso A 240 zzso sequence from the zzso gene region was selected for study because it provided sufficient information for determining genetic relationships among the virus zzso Using zzso divergence as a zzso point for virus zzso the 46 zzso fell into three distinct zzso zzso One zzso group consisted of zzso virus zzso from northern Thailand and zzso A second group was composed of zzso from southern zzso zzso zzso and zzso The remainder of the zzso from Japan, China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Sri zzso India and Nepal, made up a third zzso The implications of these findings in relation to the epidemiology of zzso are zzso zzso of this study demonstrate that the comparison of short zzso sequences can provide insight into zzso virus evolution, transmission and, zzso zzso
