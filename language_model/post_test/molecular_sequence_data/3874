Single zzso zzso zzso are about to become one of the most popular genetic markers for genetic model zzso To test the usefulness of zzso for zzso genetic diversity, we surveyed three zzso regions in two zzso zzso zzso one from Africa and one European, collected in zzso Diversity estimates based on the full zzso set indicated higher levels of zzso in the African than in the European zzso When the analysis was based on the European zzso set, European and African flies had similar levels of zzso Interestingly, this bias was not observed for diversity estimates using zzso derived from the ancestral African zzso This result suggests that diversity estimates based on zzso from ancestral populations could provide a general strategy to avoid biased zzso diversity zzso Finally, the potential of zzso for zzso organisms is zzso
