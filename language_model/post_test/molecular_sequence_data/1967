zzso zzso zzso is a member of a poorly characterized but widespread family of zzso bacterial proteins that have apparent DNA binding and zzso zzso zzso positively regulates expression of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso acid zzso and zzso the zzso transcribed zzso zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to the DNA region overlapping the zzso region of the zzso promoter and the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso Two 6 zzso direct repeats located at the ends of this region appeared to be essential for zzso zzso In zzso reactions in zzso zzso alone zzso expression from the zzso promoter but activated expression from the zzso promoter only in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso an essential zzso of zzso A similar requirement for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso was shown in zzso In zzso this requirement could be partially satisfied with zzso zzso and zzso zzso the products of a zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso reaction between zzso and zzso zzso is essential for zzso action as a zzso zzso
