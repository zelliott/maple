In zzso mouse brain, the zzso factors zzso and zzso were rich in the cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso but relatively poor in the zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso factor zzso was rather poorly distributed in mouse brain under the conditions zzso Among these 3 zzso factors zzso DNA binding activities of only zzso were invariably higher in zzso structures, such as the cortex, zzso and zzso of the zzso El mice than in those of parent zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso factor zzso may be at least in part responsible for molecular mechanisms underlying zzso of a variety of abnormal symptoms observed in zzso El zzso
