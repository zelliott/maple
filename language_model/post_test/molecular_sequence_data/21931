We isolated a putative zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso as zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso of zzso is zzso zzso long with zzso tail and contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is composed of five zzso and four zzso zzso alignment shows that the deduced zzso has a relatively high identity to other plant zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso DNA gel zzso analysis indicates that zzso belongs to a small gene zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso
