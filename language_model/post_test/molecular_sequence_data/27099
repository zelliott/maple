Red zzso zzso zzso leaves accumulate several zzso zzso fresh weight of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of such zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso prevents breakdown of forage protein during zzso zzso crops like alfalfa zzso zzso lack both zzso zzso and zzso and breakdown of their protein upon harvest and storage results in economic losses and release of excess nitrogen into the zzso zzso how red zzso zzso zzso such as zzso acid will help in the development of forage crops utilizing this natural system of protein zzso A possible zzso for zzso acid zzso predicts a zzso zzso zzso capable of forming zzso and/or zzso zzso with zzso Genes zzso two distinct zzso were identified in red zzso zzso shares more than zzso zzso acid identity with a number of zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso zzso shares only zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso and has limited sequence identity to any previously identified zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso zzso accumulates to zzso higher levels in stems than in leaves, whereas zzso zzso accumulates to zzso higher levels in leaves than in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso proteins expressed in zzso coli indicate that zzso transfers zzso or zzso zzso from a zzso zzso to zzso but not zzso whereas zzso transfers zzso or zzso zzso from a zzso zzso to zzso but not zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso is involved in zzso zzso and zzso is a novel zzso likely involved in zzso acid zzso
