We have isolated and characterized zzso and zzso clones that zzso a 70 zzso heat shock protein zzso from the zzso human zzso fungus zzso zzso The gene encodes a zzso protein showing high identity with other members of the zzso gene zzso The zzso gene is induced during both heat shock of zzso cells at 42 degrees C and the zzso to zzso zzso A differential expression of this gene can be observed between zzso and zzso forms, with a much higher level of expression in the zzso We found two zzso of 178 and 72 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso is regulated during the heat shock process and possibly during zzso In order to zzso the differential zzso of zzso zzso following cellular differentiation and/or heat zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso experiments were carried zzso The zzso zzso to zzso transition results in the transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, after adaptation at 36 degrees C, seem to be more zzso at zzso at least with respect to zzso zzso because, during a severe heat shock zzso degrees zzso the zzso form of this zzso does not zzso The zzso to zzso differentiation will have the zzso effect of increasing the resistance of the zzso to environmental stress, which may be necessary for zzso survival in the zzso zzso
