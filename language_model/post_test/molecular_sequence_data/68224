Two zzso with zzso zzso activity, designated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and partially zzso respectively, from zzso zzso of zzso male zzso Both zzso zzso with an apparent molecular weight of zzso were associated with another protein with an apparent molecular weight of zzso which was designated 29 zzso The zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso showed a peak at zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso were the same as the zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso deduced from the zzso respectively, except for the lack of a terminal zzso for zzso zzso In a zzso systems, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of the 29 zzso The zzso and zzso values for zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso which also zzso with zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso in liver zzso from zzso male rats, but had little effect on zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso male rats was zzso by zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso not containing 29 zzso was obtained as the zzso fraction from zzso zzso The activities of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso system with zzso zzso without 29 zzso were one-fifth of those of zzso zzso containing 29 zzso at the same zzso zzso These findings suggested that the 29 zzso was essential to express the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso activity in a zzso system with zzso zzso containing 29 zzso and in zzso zzso were not inhibited by 29 zzso zzso
