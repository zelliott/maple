zzso zzso are a class of zzso small zzso zzso of zzso zzso that play a key role in diverse biological zzso Japanese zzso undergo dramatic metamorphosis in their early zzso The metamorphosis is characterized by zzso transformation from a zzso symmetrical to an zzso body shape zzso with extensive zzso and zzso zzso of zzso So far, only a few zzso have been identified in fish and there are very few reports about the Japanese zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing technology was used to perform high zzso sequencing of the small zzso library from the zzso period of Japanese zzso zzso aligning these sequencing data with zzso known zzso we characterized 140 zzso zzso and 57 zzso zzso pairs from the small zzso zzso Among these 57 zzso zzso pairs, zzso zzso zzso precursors were amplified from zzso zzso We also demonstrated evolutionary conservation of Japanese zzso zzso and zzso in the animal evolution zzso Using zzso zzso we identified 66 zzso expressed zzso at two zzso stages (17 and 29 days post zzso of Japanese zzso The results show that zzso might play a key role in regulating gene expression during Japanese zzso zzso 

We identified a large number of zzso during zzso zzso some of which are zzso expressed at two different zzso zzso The study provides an opportunity for further understanding of zzso function in the regulation of zzso metamorphosis and gives us clues for further studies of the mechanisms of metamorphosis in Japanese zzso
