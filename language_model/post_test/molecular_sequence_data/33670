zzso encodes a putative zzso zzso named zzso which regulates tissue zzso zzso is a zzso protein with at least 8 predicted zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals a possible zzso zzso motif immediately after the last zzso zzso Here we aim to determine the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso tissue and identify zzso using zzso body zzso 

Using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells we investigated the expression and zzso of zzso using zzso Western zzso and zzso 

Here we confirm zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein in whole mouse kidney as well as mouse zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and the zzso cell line zzso Using zzso directed towards zzso we confirm zzso and zzso body zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, in addition to a zzso zzso in dividing zzso zzso We also establish that the zzso cell line zzso forms an zzso cell layer, with zzso complex formation and primary zzso zzso zzso is also seen within zzso and zzso body structures of zzso zzso An zzso construct expressed in zzso cells also zzso to the primary zzso body complex confirming this zzso 

We conclude that the zzso protein zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso body structures, and zzso a sensory role at this zzso
