zzso zzso zzso are highly specific for zzso or zzso the target zzso In zzso coli, there are very few zzso acting zzso and only one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified to zzso Among the zzso zzso the zzso responsible for the zzso synthesis at zzso 37 in a zzso set still remains zzso zzso is also present at position zzso in the zzso zzso center of zzso zzso where it is introduced by zzso a radical zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso coli zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso lacks zzso in both zzso types, whereas the expression of zzso zzso from a zzso introduced into this zzso restores zzso zzso Moreover, zzso performs zzso synthesis in zzso using a zzso zzso as a zzso This zzso has also proved useful to characterize some zzso identity zzso for zzso and other zzso modification zzso Our data suggest that zzso works in a late step during zzso maturation by recognizing a precise zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of a zzso stop zzso Since loss of zzso from zzso is expected to produce a zzso zzso we believe that the zzso zzso exhibited by the zzso zzso is due to loss of zzso from zzso zzso and, zzso that the zzso modification plays a crucial role in the zzso step occurring at the zzso zzso zzso
