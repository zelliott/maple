The zzso sequences of zzso for the zzso zzso but highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been determined for the zzso zzso and zzso As a zzso zzso zzso is zzso throughout the cell cycle at a constant rate, zzso to DNA zzso and at a much lower rate in zzso zzso Each of the zzso zzso encodes the entire zzso zzso The human isolate is about zzso zzso zzso It contains a coding region of zzso zzso flanked by 106 zzso of zzso and 376 zzso of zzso which contains a zzso signal followed by a zzso A zzso The bovine and rat zzso have 97 and zzso zzso zzso identity to the human zzso in the coding region and zzso in the zzso 376 zzso of the zzso which includes the zzso zzso A potential zzso sequence zzso in a direct repeat is found centered at 261 zzso into the zzso Each of the zzso clones could be transcribed and translated in zzso to yield zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso coding sequences are approximately zzso similar to those in chicken and zzso to those in sea zzso
