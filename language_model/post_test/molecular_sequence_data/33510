The maintenance of zzso in zzso embryonic stem cells depends upon the expression of regulatory genes like zzso and zzso While zzso of these genes are also characterized in zzso zzso like birds, zzso and fish, existence and function of zzso zzso associated genes zzso in lower zzso have not yet been zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso in zzso The protein contains a zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso produces similar zzso zzso in zzso zzso while injection of zzso zzso generates a loss of zzso closure and neural fold zzso zzso die up to zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso closure and zzso defects caused by zzso but does not prevent subsequent death of zzso Although zzso exhibits a zzso expression pattern and is indispensable for zzso analyses of various marker genes make its role as a zzso factor rather zzso Both the gain and loss of function effects until the end of zzso are caused by the zzso zzso region but not by the zzso zzso The zzso domain is required for association of zzso to zzso and for embryonic survival at later stages of development suggesting zzso programming zzso
