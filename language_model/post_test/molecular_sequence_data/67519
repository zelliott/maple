Light is an important environmental signal for all organisms on earth because it is essential for zzso zzso and the regulation of most biological zzso zzso found in zzso ponds zzso various zzso zzso and thereby harvest various zzso of light either for zzso transportation or as sensory zzso zzso zzso one of the microbial zzso senses yellow light and zzso zzso or other zzso into the zzso to maintain the zzso balance during cell growth, and it exists almost zzso in all known zzso To date, only two zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso In the present study, two new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were functionally zzso in zzso coli, and the maximum zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso affinity were zzso The results showed them to have similar properties to two zzso reported zzso However, the zzso of zzso is extremely consistent in a wide range of zzso zzso which had not been observed zzso A zzso sequence alignment identified a single zzso zzso at zzso zzso which is typically a zzso zzso in all other known zzso A zzso to zzso replacement in zzso eliminated the zzso zzso zzso whereas an zzso to zzso zzso in zzso transformed it to have zzso zzso tuning similar to that of zzso Thus zzso is a key zzso for the mechanism of zzso zzso tuning in zzso
