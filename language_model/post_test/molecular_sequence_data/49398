Several zzso models for zzso zzso mobility have been tested for zzso zzso zzso separation with a positively charged zzso using zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso In the current system with pH zzso the expression zzso provided the best correlation with the zzso mobility in the analysis of a set of 18 standard samples, where zzso is the calculated net charge and M is the molecular zzso The peptides resulting from various zzso of horse heart zzso or bovine zzso were used to demonstrate the zzso of this zzso zzso modified peptides from zzso digest of human zzso basic protein were also investigated and were found to provide excellent correlation with the linear plot when the total charge of the zzso was correctly zzso If the total charge was not properly calculated then the zzso modified peptides fell off the linear zzso Using this method five zzso zzso zzso 5, 49, 54, 97 and zzso were found to be partially zzso four zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso 121 and zzso were found to be partially zzso and both zzso at zzso 21 and 167 were found to be partially zzso Three peptides were found with zzso zzso zzso 98 to zzso zzso zzso 114 to zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso at 107 was found to be partially zzso or zzso The method may provide an excellent means of identifying the presence of peptides with zzso modifications in conjunction with zzso
