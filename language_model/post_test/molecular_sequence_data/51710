We recently reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso analogue of zzso with a reduced zzso bond in position zzso was about 3 times more potent than zzso in binding to mouse brain zzso and in contracting the guinea-pig zzso and was markedly more resistant to degradation than zzso when exposed to rat brain zzso In the present study, we compared the time courses and zzso relationships for the ability of zzso injected zzso and zzso 449 to elicit zzso and analgesia zzso zzso in the zzso The results show that the zzso analogue behaved as a highly potent and long-lasting zzso zzso in these two in zzso zzso The analogue should prove very useful for studying the effects of chronic zzso zzso stimulation in zzso and in zzso
