The gene zzso coding a human zzso membrane protein zzso was isolated from a human zzso zzso expression library using zzso found in the serum of an zzso zzso zzso was localized to a single locus on zzso 9 and assigned to band zzso by fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso mapping and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso cell hybrids and zzso zzso of human zzso In zzso a zzso zzso zzso expression library, the full-length zzso zzso and several truncated zzso with zzso regions were isolated from positive zzso The zzso consisted of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso These zzso truncated fragments may be produced by alternative zzso of zzso Two zzso zzso expression zzso were constructed with one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without the alternative zzso zzso coli zzso with the construct containing the alternative zzso failed to produce the zzso product, whereas those zzso with the zzso lacking the zzso produced zzso zzso analysis of the structure of zzso zzso suggests that the zzso has a stable secondary zzso that may maintain the zzso in an zzso state, zzso hindering its translation and preventing the expression of the zzso
