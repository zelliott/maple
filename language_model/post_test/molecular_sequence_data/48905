We have performed the isolation, functional zzso and expression analysis of zzso in roots and leaves of zzso zzso in order to evaluate their roles in tolerance to water zzso Five zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso A zzso analysis of deduced proteins confirmed that they belong to the water channel proteins zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso functional water channel zzso as indicated by expression zzso in zzso zzso showing divergent roles in the transport of water, zzso and zzso The expression patterns of the genes isolated from zzso zzso and of a previously described gene from zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso and zzso plants cultivated under zzso or zzso zzso Some of the studied zzso were subjected to fine-tuned expression only under zzso zzso A beneficial effect on plant zzso parameters was observed in zzso plants with respect to zzso zzso Moreover, stress induced a change in the zzso type formed, which was more zzso under drought zzso The combination of a high zzso zzso together with the fine-tuned expression of zzso could result in a zzso adaptation of this zzso to drought zzso
