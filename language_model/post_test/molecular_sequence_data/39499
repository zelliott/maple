The bacterial communities associated with 11 different zzso samples zzso to eight different zzso from different zzso were zzso The zzso zzso fraction of the bacterial communities was isolated from nine zzso samples on protein-rich and zzso zzso Thirty-four bacterial zzso were zzso and pooled into groups zzso by analysis of the zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso Twenty five zzso were identified, each zzso between one and three zzso One isolate of each zzso was partially zzso and the resulting zzso zzso gene sequences were compared in a zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso four of zzso and three of zzso were zzso Two zzso belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were not identified at zzso zzso Some bacterial zzso were retrieved frequently in different zzso species sampled in the same or different zzso zzso and zzso zzso seem to be common in zzso zzso zzso was found in three different zzso of two different zzso In a zzso approach, total DNA was extracted from 11 zzso zzso zzso fingerprints of the bacterial communities were obtained by zzso of the internal transcribed zzso region, and sequencing of selected bands indicated the presence of additional zzso
