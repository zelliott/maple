Three strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from human oral zzso tissue were subjected to a comprehensive range of zzso and zzso tests and were found to comprise a homogeneous zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis and zzso zzso revealed that the strains constituted a novel group within the zzso zzso being most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso A novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate these zzso zzso zzso is zzso and produces zzso acid and zzso acid as major end products of zzso and trace to minor amounts of zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA of the type strain is 43 zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
