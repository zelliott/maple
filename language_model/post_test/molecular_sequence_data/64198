This chapter describes the production of a zzso expression library from human fetal brain, the construction of a zzso protein array from such a library, and two applications to screen the array for binding zzso After producing the library and zzso the expression zzso one can pick thousands of expression clones with a laboratory robot and can deposit them into zzso plates in an ordered zzso Such ordered clone libraries are the starting material for the construction of a zzso protein zzso This array is constructed by spotting the expression clones onto a zzso zzso Following cell growth and induction of protein expression on the zzso the cell spots are zzso and their zzso protein immobilized on the zzso The zzso array carries thousands of proteins without the need to zzso zzso and spot individual zzso Such zzso allow one to screen for numerous protein functions in a zzso zzso
