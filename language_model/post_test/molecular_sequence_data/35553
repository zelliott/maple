zzso group zzso zzso have been suggested to be receptors or zzso for human zzso zzso expressed on the zzso zzso We isolated an enteric zzso strain zzso closely related to zzso zzso bearing zzso substances from a zzso sample of a healthy individual by using a zzso technique with zzso zzso The binding capacities of four zzso of zzso particles zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso demonstrated that zzso bound mainly to zzso zzso substances zzso of zzso zzso zzso where the zzso substances were zzso zzso that contained zzso substances extracted from zzso zzso zzso was shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso to be capable of binding to zzso of a zzso zzso strain zzso and a zzso strain that can recognize A zzso but not to an zzso zzso zzso strain zzso that loses the ability to bind to A zzso zzso zzso of terminal zzso zzso in the bacterial zzso weakened bacterial zzso binding to the zzso zzso strain zzso These results indicate that zzso substances in the bacterial zzso play a key role in binding to zzso Since the specific binding of zzso to zzso enteric bacteria is likely to affect the transmission and infection processes of zzso in their hosts and in the environment, further studies of human enteric bacteria and their binding capacity to zzso will provide a new scientific platform for understanding interactions between two types of microbes that were previously regarded as biologically zzso
