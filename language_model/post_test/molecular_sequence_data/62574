To determine the full-length complementary DNA zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and to develop zzso zzso to differentiate zzso EPO zzso and human EPO zzso 

zzso and zzso extracted from zzso zzso of an adult zzso 

zzso zzso was determined by use of a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and a rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was compared with sequences of EPO reported for other zzso Furthermore, 4 synthetic peptides were designed in 2 distinctive parts of the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences to obtain zzso specific for zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso was tested against zzso of zzso zzso kidney and zzso zzso zzso by use of western zzso zzso 

Analysis of the zzso zzso in the zzso sequence revealed that zzso was a zzso of 192 zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acid sequences of EPO from other species was zzso to zzso zzso were specifically recognized by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso specifically recognized zzso In contrast, zzso zzso to zzso zzso reacted with the zzso kidney zzso 

We determined the zzso and zzso acid sequence of zzso and developed zzso zzso that specifically recognized zzso or zzso These zzso may be useful in distinguishing zzso from zzso in a test to detect the misuse of zzso in zzso
