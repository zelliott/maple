The zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso protein found in the milk of a number of zzso We have isolated and zzso a zzso zzso clone from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and examined its expression in the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso from the zzso and another zzso the zzso zzso share zzso identity, however, less sequence identity exists between the zzso and zzso zzso sequences zzso The zzso and zzso zzso genes consist of three zzso core zzso zzso with a zzso motif at the beginning of each zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso sequences consist of two zzso zzso with the zzso motif only present in the second zzso This zzso motif is also present in a number of zzso zzso found in a wide range of zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso sequences suggests that the ancestral zzso gene has three zzso and that one of the zzso has been deleted from the zzso zzso The profile of zzso gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso changed throughout zzso with zzso zzso levels reaching a peak between days 106 and 177 of zzso The level of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso appeared to be correlated with the level of circulating zzso in the zzso female and was different to that observed for several other zzso protein zzso Overlapping expression of the zzso and early zzso protein zzso both of which are putative zzso zzso may provide protection of milk zzso that are required for the prolonged period of passive immune transfer to the zzso zzso zzso
