zzso zzso zzso is expressed at various levels in a wide range of zzso suggesting that a complex network of zzso regulates its zzso We explored the interactions between the upstream zzso regulatory regions in the first zzso and the zzso region and immediate downstream zzso sequences of the zzso gene (the zzso zzso and compared the results with those obtained previously in conjunction with the bovine growth hormone zzso zzso The statistical analysis of these interactions revealed that the zzso tail was required for full zzso activity of the combination of the upstream zzso and either the middle or the zzso zzso The zzso tail also prevented a productive interaction between the upstream zzso and the zzso element, whereas the zzso tail did not, suggesting that the zzso element is a regulatory element that needs to be silenced for full zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso and zzso experiments, we established that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal is approximately zzso more efficient than the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso levels of both zzso are similar, the intervening zzso elements destabilize the long zzso Indeed, one but not all zzso containing these elements had a shorter half life in zzso zzso A construct containing only 300 bases before and 100 bases after the zzso zzso zzso zzso site zzso for zzso zzso A stretch of 21 zzso inside this zzso zzso in conjunction with the upstream zzso and the zzso of the first zzso sensitivity of zzso expression to ambient zzso
