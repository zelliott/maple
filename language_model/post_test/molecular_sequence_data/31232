The differences in zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its inactive zzso zzso have been analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso All zzso zzso for both peptides were assigned by means of the sequential assignment zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso in solution had previously been determined by distance geometry calculation using distance constraints derived from nuclear zzso effects zzso Here, the three-dimensional structure of zzso was zzso The zzso differences between these two molecules were as zzso three segments of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have some ordered zzso In zzso the zzso region has a similar zzso while the remaining two regions do not have the ordered structure found in zzso It is suggested that the zzso zzso of the zzso region is required for binding to the zzso zzso and that the slight biological activity of zzso is due to loss of the ordered structures evoked in the zzso and zzso regions of zzso
