In zzso bitter taste is zzso by zzso zzso which belong to the large family of seven zzso G zzso zzso Because zzso are directly involved in the interaction between zzso and their dietary sources, it is likely that these genes evolved to reflect zzso specific diets during zzso zzso Here, we investigated the sequences of all 28 putative functional zzso zzso genes zzso in 46 western chimpanzees to compare the zzso variations in chimpanzees to those already known for all 25 human functional zzso genes zzso The numbers of functional genes varied among individuals in western zzso and most chimpanzees had two or three more functional genes than zzso zzso to zzso zzso showed high zzso diversity along with a large number of zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso substitution patterns in zzso with those in five zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso zzso regions among the same individuals revealed that the evolution of zzso genes was almost identical to that of putative neutral regions with slight but significantly positive zzso D values, suggesting that selective constraint on these genes was relaxed with weak balancing zzso These trends have resulted in the occurrence of various divergent zzso of zzso within the western zzso populations and in zzso individuals who might have the ability to taste a broader range of zzso
