zzso evidence favors a role for zzso as a key zzso in zzso In the zzso two zzso zzso zzso Most studies point to zzso 2 as the major zzso recognized by T cells in the zzso zzso We studied mice in which a zzso zzso 2 zzso was transferred from zzso zzso 129 mice onto the zzso background along with 16 genetic markers (including zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso mice from the fourth zzso generation showed that zzso zzso mice develop accelerated zzso and zzso The high prevalence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice indicates that diabetes acceleration relates to altered recognition of zzso The prevalence of zzso acid zzso zzso and of zzso is not increased in zzso zzso zzso We give evidence that zzso 2 expression leads to zzso of T cells specific for an zzso shared by zzso 1 and zzso zzso In the human, zzso located in the zzso region zzso the insulin gene control beta cell response to zzso and zzso expression in the zzso and are key zzso of diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso mice provide a model to study the role of zzso expression of insulin in zzso to zzso
