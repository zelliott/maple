The zzso position of a zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from a soil sample from zzso Valley in the Indian Himalayas, was determined using a zzso zzso The strain had zzso and chemical properties that were consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso with sequences from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed similarities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the level of zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso The novel strain could be distinguished from type strains of the three species of the zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on these differences, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified as the type strain of a novel species of zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
