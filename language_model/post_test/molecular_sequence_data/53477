zzso zzso VI zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and its internal zzso acid sequences were zzso The cloned zzso of zzso VI indicates an open reading frame coding for 20 zzso acid signal sequences and a mature protein of 319 zzso zzso Its zzso region has two zzso zzso and a zzso zzso region, suggesting that zzso VI is a member of the paired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells contained zzso and zzso against zzso zzso zzso protein bands that migrated at the same position as zzso zzso VI in zzso These data indicate that the protein deduced from the cloned zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso
