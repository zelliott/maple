We present here rapid and efficient methods for the analysis of multiple variable zzso zzso B zzso using zzso chain reaction based zzso For illustrative purposes, we have applied these methods to establish an association between these zzso and the zzso B zzso zzso zzso The 5 DNA zzso include 3 restriction zzso sites (for zzso zzso and zzso a variable number of tandem repeat zzso locus at the 3' end of the zzso B zzso and an zzso zzso involving the signal zzso region of zzso zzso The latter two newly described zzso are directly zzso following amplification and may have zzso effects on zzso B expression because of their critical zzso All of these sites were typed using zzso zzso and the newly developed zzso chain zzso zzso products were typed either directly zzso zzso and signal zzso zzso zzso or following specific zzso zzso (for the restriction zzso or by zzso specific zzso The detailed methods presented will prove generally useful for rapidly typing DNA variation in the zzso B zzso Using these techniques, we found a significant linkage zzso between the zzso locus and the 3' zzso and the zzso locus and the signal zzso length zzso Future association studies using these DNA zzso should take into consideration that observed effects may be related to its linkage zzso with the zzso zzso and vice zzso
