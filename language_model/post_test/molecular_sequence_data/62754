zzso family zzso which mediate the zzso zzso of zzso by plant cells, zzso and bacteria, resemble primitive zzso channels in sequence and have recently been proposed actually to fold like zzso channels in a zzso motif zzso zzso zzso and Guy, zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso 77, zzso - zzso instead of like conventional zzso porters in the zzso motif zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso The known zzso members of this family possess a very long zzso loop, positioned zzso in the zzso model and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This and two shorter zzso segments have been tested as zzso markers for the true folding pattern of zzso proteins using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tags were inserted into all three zzso and the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was fused to the C zzso of zzso The gene zzso were expressed from a high copy zzso and zzso of the tags was determined by native zzso zzso indirect zzso and zzso zzso Both the zzso tag and the zzso zzso fusion allowed abundant protein to reach the plasma membrane and support normal zzso zzso In all zzso the zzso tag was localized to the inner surface of the zzso cell plasma zzso thus strongly supporting the zzso folding zzso Additional observations showed zzso zzso zzso to lie in zzso zzso zzso significant zzso zzso expressed from the zzso to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppression of such clusters by zzso growth in zzso zzso This zzso effect may assist other membrane proteins zzso or zzso zzso to function within the zzso plasma zzso
