For almost a decade, in zzso selection experiments have been used to isolate novel zzso zzso peptides and proteins according to their zzso zzso experiments have altered our perception of molecular mimicry and zzso and they appear to be more facile than rational design at generating zzso with desired zzso New methods that have been developed improve the power of functional strategies in ways that nature has already discovered - by expanding library size and zzso the zzso of positive zzso Recent structural information on a number of selected and evolved molecules highlights future challenges for design via rational zzso
