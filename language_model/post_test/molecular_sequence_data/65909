zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso zzso regulatory protein consisting of four zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso binds zzso metal zzso however, zzso is a mixed zzso site, and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Through the generation of several zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the importance of the last zzso zzso position of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with respect to the binding of zzso to zzso zzso and its biological target, the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso had reduced zzso and zzso affinity at zzso but retained affinity for the zzso zzso A zzso zzso had increased zzso and zzso affinity at zzso but unexpectedly, the affinity for the zzso domain was too low for binding to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed no and weak zzso binding at zzso respectively, and each zzso had reduced zzso affinity at zzso and showed moderate zzso differences in affinity for the zzso zzso Finally, a zzso zzso bound zzso and zzso in a manner similar to that of zzso but like that of zzso the affinity for the zzso domain was reduced below the detection zzso These data, combined with a zzso structural comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes, suggest that the zzso and zzso zzso have a disruptive effect on zzso binding since they expand the zzso loop and change the zzso positions in zzso zzso upon replacement of the ancestral zzso with zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso gained affinity for zzso and the zzso affinity of zzso shifted into a range where the protein is able to act as an zzso zzso zzso
