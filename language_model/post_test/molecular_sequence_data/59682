In zzso zzso the zzso gene encodes the large zzso of DNA zzso III, the analogue of zzso DNA zzso zzso We have isolated DNA fragments from a library of zzso zzso zzso DNA in the zzso zzso that rescue temperature sensitive zzso zzso in zzso zzso These fragments contain an zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The predicted protein shows zzso to a number of zzso DNA zzso with zzso identity over its length to the zzso zzso zzso zzso It also contains a number of motifs which are characteristic of DNA zzso in general and viral zzso in particular, as well as the zzso motif which interacts with zzso cell nuclear zzso These results indicate that this gene is zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the expression of zzso zzso zzso revealed that the transcript is present throughout the zzso cell cycle, which contrasts with the expression of zzso zzso zzso
