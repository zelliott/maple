zzso metabolism is essential to provide activated zzso units in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The major forms of zzso in zzso are zzso zzso In organisms that zzso folate zzso de zzso the addition of the zzso side chains is achieved by the action of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report here the characterization and molecular analysis of the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso catalyzing the binding of the first zzso side chain to zzso yielding zzso is zzso by the zzso gene that we propose to zzso zzso zzso cells bearing a zzso zzso require zzso acid for growth and have no zzso zzso zzso We show also that zzso zzso which zzso the extension of the zzso chains of the folate zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is required for zzso synthesis and for maintenance of zzso zzso We have tested whether two zzso zzso could be zzso by the zzso zzso by the use of alternative initiation zzso Our results show that the loss of zzso functions in zzso zzso cells is not because of the absence of a zzso zzso zzso
