The importance of the various structural elements zzso a zzso A chain zzso to the stability of the zzso bond between the zzso and A chain was examined using a panel of zzso prepared with the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso of the standard zzso A chain zzso prepared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso made with zzso zzso the zzso zzso with zzso zzso the hindered zzso zzso with a zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso or with the zzso corresponding to the zzso of zzso A zzso The zzso activities of the zzso and their zzso to reduction by zzso in zzso were zzso The zzso zzso could not be zzso by zzso in zzso and had low zzso zzso consistent with the requirement of a zzso zzso linkage for zzso The hindered zzso zzso was zzso more stable to reduction than the zzso containing a standard zzso zzso linkage, but the zzso activities of the two zzso were zzso The introduction of a flexible zzso zzso between zzso and the zzso linkage introduced by zzso had no deleterious effect on zzso activity and no effect on the zzso of the zzso linkage to zzso This finding suggests that the enforced proximity of the A chain to the zzso caused by the use of a short chemical zzso in a conventional zzso has no influence on either of these properties in this zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
