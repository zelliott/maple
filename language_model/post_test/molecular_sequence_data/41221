zzso 5 zzso and membrane zzso protein are the major proteins in the envelope of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso Although viral zzso zzso are reported in zzso and M of type 2 zzso their significance as targets of zzso zzso immunity is not well zzso Thus, we constructed zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso to examine their involvement in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso whose zzso did not correlate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso serum bound virus but did not neutralize zzso Furthermore, zzso of pigs with zzso zzso raised specific zzso and provided partial protection without a zzso zzso zzso Finally the zzso did not block infection of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso are accessible for host zzso recognition, but are not associated with zzso virus zzso
