We report the isolation and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of this protein shows extensive zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso is expressed zzso and is zzso distributed during the early stages of zzso zzso with a possible role in zzso induction and zzso interference with the normal expression of the zzso by zzso in the early zzso results in the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso the zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso brain and spinal cord, suggesting an additional function for zzso in zzso
