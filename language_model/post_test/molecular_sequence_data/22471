We recently reported the unprecedented occurrence of a zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Here we investigate the structure and evolution of the zzso gene in other zzso zzso We cloned and zzso zzso genes and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso and identified the zzso gene sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso Gene structure zzso in zzso positions zzso and zzso gene zzso and sequence of zzso are highly zzso with high zzso ratios indicating strong zzso zzso The data suggest an important role of the zzso protein in zzso which may be the control of oxygen flow from the zzso zzso Furthermore, we identified two additional zzso genes zzso and zzso in the zzso Although the sequences are highly zzso the zzso acids required for zzso and zzso are zzso In contrast to other known insect zzso the zzso and zzso genes zzso both zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso Both genes are zzso in various zzso species, but only expression of zzso could be demonstrated by western zzso and zzso zzso analyses show that the zzso leading to zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso first in the evolution of zzso zzso zzso is closely related to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso derive from this zzso
