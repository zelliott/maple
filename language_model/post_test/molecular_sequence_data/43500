The zzso zzso motif occurs in a variety of zzso that zzso plants and consists of three zzso zzso connected by a highly zzso central zzso A zzso zzso called the extended zzso is found in satellite 2 transcripts from a variety of zzso zzso The extended zzso has the same core as the zzso zzso but has unusually zzso sequence and structural elements in its peripheral zzso Here we present the results of a zzso substitution interference analysis of the zzso zzso oxygen requirements in the two zzso zzso Five zzso zzso zzso all in the central core, were found to be important for zzso by the zzso zzso A similar set of core positions were important for zzso by the extended zzso but five zzso positions were also found to be zzso zzso at one of these positions had the most severe effect on zzso observed in this zzso zzso did not alleviate this negative effect, indicating that this position was not part of a zzso zzso binding zzso We propose that novel zzso interactions in the extended zzso help form the same zzso core structure as that used by the zzso plant virus zzso
