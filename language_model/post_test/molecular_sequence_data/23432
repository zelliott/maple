zzso of oral zzso and zzso zzso have a common pattern of structural organization and characteristically contain a domain with a series of tandem zzso acid repeats in which certain zzso are highly zzso particularly aromatic zzso acids and zzso In some zzso zzso the repeat region has been identified as a zzso binding domain zzso Such zzso are also found in several zzso binding proteins zzso of oral zzso that do not have zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of 20 zzso and zzso showed the widespread conservation of the zzso A repeat first identified in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of individual highly zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated the importance of the first zzso and the zzso pair in the binding of zzso as well as the essential contribution of a basic zzso zzso or zzso A zzso binding zzso was developed to measure the binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was shown to be capable of binding zzso with predominantly zzso or zzso zzso as well as alternating zzso and zzso links zzso Western zzso experiments using zzso zzso or zzso as zzso demonstrated a difference between the binding of zzso zzso and zzso and that of zzso zzso Experimental data and zzso analysis showed that the A repeat motif is distinct from the zzso CW zzso which also has zzso aromatic zzso acids and zzso and which occurs in the zzso proteins of zzso zzso and other zzso
