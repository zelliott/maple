We have examined the zzso selectivity of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso in comparison with that of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso Both proteins catalyze active transport of zzso or zzso with comparable affinity and zzso However, zzso does not transport the analogue zzso zzso which is a very efficient zzso in zzso We show that zzso binds zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso binding zzso but fails to transport this zzso Based on zzso zzso organization of the putative zzso sugar binding site is the same as that in zzso and zzso irreplaceable for the zzso mechanism are zzso Moreover, only zzso of the zzso where a zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso differ in zzso Using zzso zzso at these positions and engineered zzso zzso we show that zzso at the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso contributes in defining the zzso selectivity zzso Replacement of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso leads to impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso also leads to impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is restored by the zzso of a zzso in the background of zzso zzso Much less prominent effects are found with the same zzso and zzso for the transport of zzso or zzso
