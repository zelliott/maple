In this study, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso an zzso strain, consisting of three genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso class I zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso genes revealed that they shared more than zzso zzso and zzso identity, respectively, with zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were successfully cloned in a zzso host, zzso coli zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be functionally active zzso 33 zzso and 17 zzso of zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the three genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of native promoter from zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso when fed with zzso and volatile mixed organic acids zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso could accumulate zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso contents of zzso and zzso were achieved by using zzso of zzso and mixed organic zzso zzso
