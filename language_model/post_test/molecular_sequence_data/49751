zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso by interacting with the zzso binding zzso zzso We show here that zzso forms zzso in zzso zzso zzso in its putative zzso interface result in a zzso form of zzso Both the zzso and zzso forms of zzso bind to zzso with similar affinity and form complexes with zzso When zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso cells, the zzso channel activity is similarly modulated by zzso of either the zzso or the zzso form of zzso In addition, zzso is still modulated by zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso which does not itself bind to zzso but forms zzso with the zzso zzso These data, taken together, suggest that zzso zzso is capable of modulating zzso channel activity in this regulatory zzso
