The zzso zzso of the type III group B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits unique properties which can be ascribed to the presence of zzso acid in its structure and the requirement for an extended binding zzso By means of zzso and molecular dynamics studies on zzso III and its fragments, the extended zzso of zzso III was further zzso The influence of zzso acid on the zzso properties of zzso III was examined by performing zzso analysis on zzso zzso III, which is identical to the zzso of zzso zzso type 14, and also on oxidized and reduced zzso zzso zzso changes were zzso by zzso and zzso chemical shift analysis, zzso zzso selective zzso experiments, zzso and zzso variations, and zzso of OH zzso Changes in mobility were examined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecular dynamics simulations with explicit water using the zzso force field and the zzso zzso set were used to assess zzso and dynamic zzso models, simulate the zzso zzso parameters and calculate zzso zzso zzso III was found to be capable of forming extended zzso zzso the length dependence of the zzso zzso could be explained by its location on extended zzso within the random zzso structure of zzso zzso The interaction of zzso acid with the backbone of the zzso was also found to be important in defining the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
