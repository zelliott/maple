A cholesterol 7 zzso gene containing 8 zzso of the zzso region and 5 zzso of the zzso region which covers zzso 1 to 5 was isolated from a rat zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso from the start zzso was zzso This zzso region contains many zzso or zzso elements zzso zzso putative hormone responsive elements zzso zzso zzso or zzso and ubiquitous zzso factor binding sites zzso zzso In addition, 21 CA repeats which have potential to form the zzso structure were found in this zzso These putative regulatory elements and repetitive motifs may play roles in the regulation of cholesterol 7 zzso gene in the zzso The sequence identity of the rat gene to the human gene in this region is zzso Only zzso elements are zzso in the cholesterol 7 zzso zzso
