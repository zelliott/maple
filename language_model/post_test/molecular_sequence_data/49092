zzso are natural tools for bacterial evolution and zzso Their involvement in the capture and dissemination of zzso genes among zzso bacteria is well zzso Recently, massive ancestral versions, the zzso zzso were discovered in the zzso of diverse zzso zzso zzso gene zzso with an identifiable activity zzso proteins related to simple zzso functions, including resistance, zzso and zzso activities, and their recruitment was interpreted as providing the host with an zzso zzso Here, we present extensive comparative analysis of zzso identified among the zzso Each was at least 100 zzso in size, zzso the participation of zzso in the zzso plasticity and zzso of these zzso zzso and zzso data supported the sedentary nature of the functional zzso platform and its zzso with the host zzso zzso comparative analysis of the zzso zzso was indicative of both a wide range of origin for the zzso genes and of an active cassette assembly process in these bacterial zzso The signature zzso sites of each species displayed zzso structural characteristics indicating that symmetry rather than sequence was important in the recognition of such a varied collection of target zzso sequences by a single zzso zzso Our discovery of various addiction module zzso within each of the different zzso indicates a possible role for them in the overall stability of large zzso cassette zzso
