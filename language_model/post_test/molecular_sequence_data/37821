zzso zzso channel zzso must reach the plasma membrane to zzso action zzso Yet the efficiency of cell surface targeting varies among zzso zzso with some requiring auxiliary zzso for optimal zzso Here we identify a zzso motif located in the variable zzso region of zzso channels that controls the efficiency of functional channel zzso Variations among wild type channels in the optimal sequence zzso produce differences in distribution and the requirement for auxiliary zzso Furthermore, deletion of this motif decreases zzso zzso and surface zzso but does not prohibit zzso zzso Finally, the action of the essential sequence is shown to be independent of the zzso effect of zzso zzso Thus, the newly identified zzso motif zzso processing and cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso
