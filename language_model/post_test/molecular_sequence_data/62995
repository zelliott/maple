Many diverse systems for sex determination have evolved in plants and zzso One involves physically distinct zzso sex zzso zzso and Y, or Z and zzso that are zzso in one sex (usually zzso and zzso in the other (usually zzso Sex zzso evolution is thought to involve suppression of zzso around the sex determination zzso rendering permanently zzso a zzso region that may then accumulate deleterious zzso zzso by zzso zzso and fix deleterious zzso by zzso as nearby zzso zzso are selected on the Y zzso Over time, these processes may cause the Y zzso to zzso and to diverge from the X zzso over much of its zzso for example, only zzso of the human Y zzso still shows zzso zzso Here we show that zzso contains a primitive Y zzso with a zzso region that accounts for only about zzso of the zzso but has undergone severe zzso suppression and DNA sequence zzso This finding provides direct evidence for the origin of sex zzso from zzso
