Recently, we reported the zzso zzso association of zzso repeats, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that the distribution of zzso repeat sequences in a single representative zzso can be used to identify zzso hotspots and zzso suitable for population zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using information on the location of zzso repeats in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso we designed 30 primer pairs to amplify and sequence zzso zzso The zzso have been tested in a range of zzso to zzso zzso including ten zzso samples zzso zzso from diverse geographical locations, four other zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and three other zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignments for the zzso comparison revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso at all 30 zzso and zzso zzso at 14 zzso The primer pairs reported here reveal levels of genetic variation suitable for high-resolution zzso and evolutionary studies of zzso and other closely related zzso Our results confirm that information on repeat distribution can be used to identify zzso suitable for such studies, and we expect that this approach can be used in other plant zzso
