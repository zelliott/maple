Native rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind with high affinity and to increase zzso levels of zzso in cultured rat zzso tumor zzso A linear analog of zzso which lacks the zzso bridge structure also bound with high affinity but did not increase levels of zzso zzso or antagonize the increase of this zzso zzso by zzso These data are consistent with the existence of two functional zzso of zzso receptors on cultured rat zzso tumor zzso one which is capable of zzso zzso zzso and one which is not linked to this zzso
