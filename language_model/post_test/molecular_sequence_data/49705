The mechanisms governing zzso zzso remain poorly zzso We identified a gene called zzso that is essential for this process in zzso zzso zzso encodes a predicted zzso protein that zzso to a tiny dot in the center of zzso throughout the cell zzso zzso experiments with zzso transgenic zzso reveal that zzso is recruited to the zzso once per cell cycle, at the time of zzso zzso Additional evidence indicates that zzso is recruited to the daughter zzso or a closely associated zzso These findings identify zzso recruitment as a key step in the zzso zzso zzso
