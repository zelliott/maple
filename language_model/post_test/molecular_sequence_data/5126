zzso that function in the zzso of the zzso zzso have been characterized zzso However, zzso expression in an adult insect gut has not been zzso Here we report on the initial characterization and cloning of a novel zzso gene that is expressed specifically in the zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso is zzso into the gut zzso as an inactive zzso that is later activated by zzso Thus, zzso regulation of zzso activity is tightly coupled to the zzso pattern of zzso zzso The zzso may play a role in structuring the zzso zzso zzso zzso whose formation is also induced by zzso A zzso zzso was cloned from a library enriched for zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso acid protein comprised of a putative zzso domain at the N zzso a putative zzso domain at the C zzso and a zzso zzso acid stretch in between zzso Northern analysis indicates that this zzso is expressed exclusively in the guts of adult females and not in adult carcasses or in any zzso or zzso zzso The present findings suggest the possibility of using this zzso as an zzso for a malaria zzso zzso
