The use of zzso zzso has recently been employed for the detection of minimal residual disease in zzso and zzso acute zzso zzso However, these methods are predicated upon the successful amplification of the zzso zzso in the zzso of the tumor cells by the zzso chain reaction zzso In order to determine whether the type of zzso zzso zzso influenced the rate of success of amplifying the region of the zzso heavy chain gene zzso in these zzso we studied 41 zzso and zzso well characterized zzso zzso DNA was extracted from frozen tissue of the zzso and zzso and subjected to zzso amplification using a zzso zzso heavy chain gene variable region consensus zzso 3 region zzso zzso and a 3' consensus primer for the zzso heavy chain joining zzso One or two distinct bands, representing the rearranged zzso heavy chain zzso were detected in six of six small zzso cell zzso five of five small zzso zzso four of six acute zzso zzso four of six zzso zzso three of six diffuse mixed small and large cell zzso one of six diffuse large cell zzso and one of six zzso large cell zzso all control cases of zzso zzso Hodgkin's disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso We therefore conclude that the type of zzso zzso influences the ability to detect zzso gene zzso by zzso with currently used consensus zzso
