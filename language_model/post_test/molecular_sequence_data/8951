We have studied the responses of honey bees at different life stages zzso zzso to controlled infection with acute bee paralysis virus and have identified the zzso of infected larvae and adult worker bees as the compartment where massive propagation of zzso zzso zzso respond with a broad spectrum of induced innate immune reactions to bacterial infections, whereas zzso mechanisms based on zzso interference play a major role in zzso zzso In this study, we have determined that honey bee larvae and adult workers do not produce a zzso immune reaction upon artificial infection with zzso in contrast to control individuals challenged with zzso zzso zzso bees produced neither elevated levels of specific zzso peptides zzso such as zzso and zzso nor any general zzso activity, as revealed by zzso zzso Additionally, adult bees did not generate zzso zzso upon zzso infection, an important cellular immune function activated by bacteria and viruses in some zzso Challenge of bees with both zzso and zzso coli showed that innate zzso and cellular immune reactions are induced in mixed infections, albeit at a reduced zzso
