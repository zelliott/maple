zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso examined to date, but currently the function of the zzso protein is zzso zzso various zzso in the zzso gene lead to two similar diseases in zzso zzso dominant inherited zzso zzso and cataract zzso and a zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso Early onset bilateral zzso zzso is a common characteristic of both disorders; retinal zzso cells are lost and visual acuity is impaired from an early zzso In order to investigate the function of the zzso zzso we have generated a novel zzso zzso mouse carrying a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in zzso 2, causes an zzso acid change zzso zzso which is predicted to alter zzso protein zzso In the zzso state, the mice appear uncompromised zzso in the zzso state mice display some of the features of zzso Visual function is severely reduced, consistent with significant loss of retinal zzso cells and zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso there was evidence of increased zzso activity, as demonstrated by the increased presence of zzso marker zzso C zzso zzso zzso Mice zzso for the zzso zzso also display a severe zzso disease characterized by reduced lifespan zzso dying before 4 zzso decreased weight, zzso zzso zzso dysfunction and gross zzso zzso All of these defects are synonymous with the zzso characteristics of Type III zzso found in zzso This model will be of major importance for future studies of the specific function of the zzso zzso
