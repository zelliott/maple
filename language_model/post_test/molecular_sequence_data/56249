To characterize the differences between zzso zzso of drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso that show nuclear DNA amplification and zzso of zzso without nuclear DNA amplification, we zzso zzso from repeatedly cloned zzso The dominant zzso from zzso and zzso zzso with DNA amplification were found to zzso as minor zzso divergent classes in parental zzso zzso These classes shared very limited similarity with the zzso zzso zzso sequences or sequences from drug resistant zzso without zzso These minor classes were zzso selected to replicate in zzso with DNA amplification and subsequently became the dominant sequences in these zzso zzso studies of the correlation between amplification and zzso of the nuclear DNA and the switch in zzso zzso dominance indicated that zzso other than the amplified zzso DNA itself caused the zzso to zzso Treating the zzso networks isolated from cells at the switch transition period with single zzso zzso specific for either zzso or zzso zzso resulted in structural modifications consistent with both zzso sequence classes being present simultaneously in the same zzso This establishes the zzso nature of the zzso
