An insert zzso of zzso zzso , zzso zzso zzso 1 , results in significant reduction of its transcript levels, and therefore zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in higher plants zzso the degradation of zzso to zzso zzso precursor and its roles zzso the zzso control of flowering in rice have been zzso However, its involvement in regulating rice zzso zzso synthesis is not fully zzso In this study, we isolated a rice zzso named zzso leaf 2 zzso from a zzso zzso zzso grown zzso zzso showed zzso leaves with reduced contents of zzso and zzso zzso whereas an increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated zzso were poorly stacked in zzso zzso resulting in underdevelopment of zzso The zzso locus was mapped to zzso 6 and isolated via zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that it encodes the rice zzso and its identity was verified by transgenic zzso test and zzso zzso A zzso zzso was found in the first zzso of zzso resulting in significant reduction of zzso expressions in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in a variety of rice zzso with the highest levels in leaves and regulated by zzso In addition, we found expression levels of some genes associated with zzso zzso and photosynthesis were zzso altered in zzso zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso has a vital function in rice zzso zzso
