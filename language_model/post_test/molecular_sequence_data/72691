Using a sensitive primer extension technique, we have carried out studies to zzso the start site of replication of the zzso zzso In the course of these studies, we have found evidence that supports the hypothesis that zzso is an integral component of the initiation of zzso On the basis of our findings, we suggest that the transcript is processed to act as a zzso and therefore we propose that the transcript has a dual role as primer of replication and zzso for the zzso zzso We present a model, based on our evidence, for the initiation of replication of the zzso zzso This model provides as well an alternative explanation for what has been called the zzso action of zzso and we show that zzso may act in trans as well as in zzso
