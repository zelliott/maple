zzso disease is strongly associated with the zzso class II zzso zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, by restriction zzso length zzso analysis, greater than zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso disease patients have a zzso zzso zzso I zzso B gene DNA zzso The present study sought to determine if there is a unique zzso class II zzso A or B gene structural zzso on the zzso zzso zzso found in zzso zzso The zzso second zzso of the coding zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso genes in zzso disease patients with the zzso zzso zzso were zzso after amplification by the zzso chain zzso To define the zzso B genes associated with zzso disease, the second zzso of the coding zzso B genes from 27 zzso disease patients were amplified similarly and zzso by using a panel of sequence specific zzso The zzso zzso and zzso A and B gene second zzso sequences of zzso disease patients were noted to be identical to sequences that can be found also, although at a significantly lower frequency, in unaffected zzso This is compatible with a disease model wherein the zzso class II genes on the zzso zzso zzso are necessary, but not zzso for the zzso expression of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso B genes revealed a significant increase in the frequency of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the increased frequency of the zzso zzso I zzso B gene restriction zzso length zzso in zzso disease can be accounted for by the overrepresentation in disease of the zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso to zzso disease appears to be zzso with specific, but structurally normal, zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso contributing to disease zzso
