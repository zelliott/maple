Type IV zzso zzso are polar surface structures that play important roles in bacterial zzso zzso formation, and zzso The protein zzso and its zzso are known to mediate zzso formation in the human pathogen zzso zzso and some other bacterial zzso It was reported recently that zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso directly through the zzso zzso domain of zzso Here we present experimental data to reveal that the strong interaction between zzso and zzso is not zzso in zzso zzso and likely other zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso binding experiments showed that the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso is below the measurable zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso further confirmed that the interaction between the zzso zzso proteins is at least more than 3 orders of magnitude weaker than that between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso lobe region of zzso was identified as the binding surface for zzso by zzso zzso exchange and zzso zzso zzso Lack of several key zzso in the zzso lobe region of the zzso domain of zzso is likely to account for the greatly reduced binding affinity between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso All together, the results suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso species is not zzso in zzso zzso due to the evolutionary divergence among the zzso zzso The precise roles of zzso and zzso in bacterial zzso and zzso zzso are likely to vary among bacterial zzso
