zzso genes that exist within an apparent zzso organization were evaluated as examples of zzso zzso regions that contain zzso incongruous genes and coexist with genes outside the zzso that are zzso A zzso cluster in zzso zzso includes genes zzso the two zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso A second gene block, present in the zzso zzso but not in other zzso contains a near-complete zzso zzso zzso within an apparent zzso containing other zzso zzso 

The gene block in zzso zzso exhibits a sharply delineated zzso zzso This, as well as bias of zzso usage and zzso zzso analysis, strongly implicates lateral gene transfer zzso In contrast, zzso studies and protein tree zzso did not support the zzso of the zzso gene block by zzso 

Judging from the apparent minimal zzso the zzso gene block in zzso zzso probably originated by zzso at a relatively recent zzso The surprising inability to pinpoint a donor lineage still leaves room for alternative, albeit less zzso explanations other than zzso On the other hand, the large zzso gene block does not seem to have arisen by zzso We suggest that the contemporary zzso array of divergent zzso represents an ancient ancestral state of zzso zzso with extensive streamlining by gene loss occurring in the lineage of descent representing other zzso zzso
