zzso B virus zzso core gene zzso products were zzso previously in the zzso and/or in the zzso of infected zzso We investigated in naturally infected human zzso whether this variation in the zzso expression is due to differences in the presence of assembled core particles and other core gene derived zzso the expression of zzso and the processing of liver zzso By zzso of liver specimens infected with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso specific for assembled core particles and for various zzso on zzso core zzso it was shown that virtually all zzso core gene products are assembled into core zzso The latter are present both in the zzso and in the zzso of zzso independent of the infecting virus zzso A marked reduction or absence of zzso observed with some zzso zzso was shown to result from zzso sequence variations within or close to the corresponding zzso These results demonstrate that zzso products, derived from the zzso core zzso in the zzso and zzso of human zzso represent assembled core particles and that zzso zzso with known recognition sites can reveal zzso core gene variation of the infecting zzso zzso
