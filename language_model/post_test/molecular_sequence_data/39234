zzso comprise a large family of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso receptors that mediate diverse essential biological zzso Higher zzso possess a single zzso zzso and the zzso zzso associates with a large number of alpha zzso to form the major class of zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the fact that the zzso zzso zzso is a rapidly emerging model zzso of choice for zzso biology and for models of human disease, little is currently known about zzso zzso sequences and functions in this zzso 

Using zzso complete coding sequences of zzso zzso zzso were obtained from zzso zzso or adult zzso The results show that zzso possess two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have a high degree of identity to other zzso zzso zzso In addition, a third, more zzso zzso zzso is present zzso which may have altered zzso zzso zzso also have other divergent zzso zzso which are zzso truncated forms lacking the zzso and zzso zzso Together with zzso these truncated forms comprise a novel group of zzso zzso all of which have a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicate that the zzso that gave rise to zzso and zzso occurred after the divergence of the zzso and fish zzso while a subsequent zzso of the zzso of zzso may have given rise to zzso and an ancestral truncated zzso A very recent tandem zzso of the truncated zzso zzso appears to have taken zzso The different zzso zzso zzso have varied patterns of zzso expression during zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in adult zzso whereas the other zzso zzso generally show more restricted patterns of zzso 

zzso have a large set of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may share the roles of the solitary zzso zzso found in other zzso whereas zzso and the truncated zzso zzso may have acquired novel zzso
