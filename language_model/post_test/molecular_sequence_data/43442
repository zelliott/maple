Limited zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso zzso the protein at zzso 221 and near the zzso producing stable 25, zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The 25 and zzso zzso zzso remain associated to form a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso This zzso protein form maintains the ability to bind zzso but exhibits altered zzso efficiency toward the zzso of various zzso acids when compared to native zzso Changes in zzso specificity were first monitored by measuring the activity in the presence of different zzso acid zzso at various times during zzso Three zzso acid zzso were then selected for further analysis of the properties of the zzso zzso acid zzso species produced by limited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three zzso acids represented limiting cases of the observed changes of zzso activity on zzso loss of activity, increase of activity, and minor activity changes, zzso zzso was found to be no longer a zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso exhibited a zzso increased apparent maximum zzso although its zzso value increased zzso with the zzso zzso in comparison to the native zzso zzso was oxidized zzso faster by the zzso zzso acid zzso at infinite zzso zzso and its zzso value increased approximately zzso The zzso for zzso which was determined zzso with zzso as the zzso zzso increased zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso kinetic isotope effects on V and zzso during the zzso of zzso were also zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso on zzso while zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso All the observed changes of the values of the kinetic parameters and of the observed isotope effects are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso of zzso acid zzso at position 221 decreases the strength of binding of both zzso and products to the zzso active zzso The information obtained by limited zzso zzso nicely zzso that gathered from the analysis of the three-dimensional structure of zzso acid zzso in complex with zzso which was recently determined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 93, zzso zzso 221 is part of the zzso loop that covers the active site and contributes zzso to zzso binding and zzso The limited zzso data support the hypothesis that this loop acts as a lid on the active site and controls both zzso specificity and the rate of turnover of zzso acid zzso
