The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso receptors mediates many zzso and zzso interactions whose functions are believed to be critical for normal zzso and zzso By eliminating the beta 1 zzso gene through zzso zzso we have assessed the role of the beta 1 zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso model for zzso zzso zzso cells were unexpectedly found to maintain three copies of the beta 1 gene and complete elimination required three sequential rounds of targeting to generate triple knockout lines zzso 1 zzso zzso of the beta 1 zzso family of zzso receptors from zzso cells resulted in reduced zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but strongly enhanced zzso to zzso The absence of beta 1 zzso did not promote significant zzso zzso of either beta 3 or beta 5 zzso both of which are known to act as zzso receptors when associated with alpha zzso The loss of beta 1 zzso severely affected zzso differentiation when the beta zzso cells were induced to differentiate to either zzso or visceral zzso zzso zzso derived from beta zzso cells retained a rounded zzso and migrated poorly on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso derived from beta zzso cells were also unable to form a normal, zzso zzso zzso instead, a zzso layer containing zzso of zzso cells was zzso However, loss of beta 1 zzso did not interfere with induction by zzso agents of zzso gene products for either visceral or zzso zzso These results suggest that beta 1 zzso mediate zzso differentiation zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso gene expression in induced zzso cells, and that these two processes are not necessarily linked in this zzso
