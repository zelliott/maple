zzso zzso zzso adapts to zzso of zzso upon incubation with zzso as the major carbon zzso zzso zzso has a cluster of genes zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso transcribed regulatory gene zzso but these genes are silent until adaptation zzso We found another regulatory gene zzso downstream of zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso All adapted strains were found to have zzso in the zzso gene or in the zzso intervening zzso The adapted strains expressed zzso zzso and zzso 2, zzso activity in the presence of zzso The zzso activity of both the zzso and the zzso promoters was elevated in the adapted zzso A strain whose zzso gene was artificially disrupted was found to be able to grow using zzso and the cells showed high levels of the zzso zzso and zzso activities, indicating that adaptation was caused only by the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso bound to two specific sites in the promoter region between zzso and zzso These results indicate that the active zzso gene product acts as a zzso factor and zzso zzso of the zzso genes in strain zzso
