zzso zzso zzso transport zzso particles can be zzso resolved into two smaller zzso complexes A and B, that contain up to six and 15 protein zzso zzso We provide here the zzso and zzso analyses that verify the identity of all six zzso A zzso Using zzso density zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that all six A zzso are associated in a 16 S complex in both the cell bodies and zzso A significant fraction of the cell body zzso however, exhibits a much slower zzso of zzso S and is not associated with the zzso A zzso To identify interactions between the six A zzso we combined exhaustive zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso protein expression in zzso coli, and analysis of the newly identified complex A zzso zzso and zzso We show that zzso and zzso interact directly and provide evidence for additional interactions between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso analysis further allows us to propose that a subset of complex A zzso zzso can form a stable 12 S zzso that we refer to as the zzso A zzso Based on these results, we propose a model for the spatial arrangement of the six zzso A zzso
