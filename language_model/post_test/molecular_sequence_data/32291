The field of zzso structure prediction has experienced significant advances in the past several years, thanks to the availability of new experimental data and improved zzso zzso These methods determine zzso secondary structures and zzso from sequence zzso zzso dynamic programming zzso genetic zzso and combined zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional modeling uses this information in conjunction with manual zzso constraint satisfaction methods, molecular mechanics and molecular zzso The ultimate goal of automatically producing zzso three-dimensional models from given secondary and zzso structure data, however, is still not fully zzso Recent developments in the zzso prediction of zzso structure have helped bridge the gap between zzso secondary structure zzso including zzso and three-dimensional modeling of zzso
