In the course of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing project, we identified an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso This protein shows, respectively, zzso and zzso identity with the zzso coli regulatory proteins zzso and zzso zzso analysis suggests that it represents a new group in the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso experiments, lead to the conclusion that the product of this zzso zzso zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso first one to be detected in zzso zzso When expressed in zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso protein is able to zzso by about zzso the expression of the zzso zzso which is normally regulated by zzso coli zzso indicating functional similarity in their regulatory zzso zzso growth of a zzso zzso zzso zzso is not affected in rich zzso However, the zzso zzso causes a zzso zzso of growth in minimal medium in the presence of zzso and zzso which is relieved by zzso This points to a possible role in regulation of zzso acid zzso In addition, zzso occurs earlier in the zzso zzso than in the reference strain, zzso that the B zzso zzso protein plays a role in the growth phase zzso
