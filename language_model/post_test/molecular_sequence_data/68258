zzso zzso leukemia zzso cell growth may be inhibited by exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso Our initial studies targeted the zzso zzso and were carried out on cells derived from patients in zzso blast zzso zzso we extended these studies to cells isolated from patients in chronic disease zzso We found that zzso AS zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso in a dose dependent, sequence specific manner in approximately zzso of cases zzso zzso expression was either greatly decreased or zzso in the residual colonies and no residual zzso zzso were zzso upon zzso of treated zzso AS zzso that target the zzso zzso also inhibit zzso zzso and lead to zzso of zzso in responding cells in approximately 50% of zzso zzso AS zzso may prove to be useful zzso zzso Most recently, we have treated zzso mice zzso with zzso expressing human zzso cell leukemia with zzso modified AS zzso We have found that treated mice survive three to eight times longer than their zzso or sense treated zzso In aggregate, these results suggest that AS zzso may prove useful for both ex zzso and in zzso treatment of patients with zzso
