The zzso lens capsule is a smooth, transparent basement membrane that encapsulates the lens and is composed of a rigid network of interacting structural proteins and zzso During cataract surgery, the anterior lens capsule is routinely removed in the form of a circular zzso We considered that the excised capsule could be easily prepared for zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool to zzso the spatial distribution of small zzso zzso and proteins within zzso Here, we apply this molecular imaging technique to analyze the freshly excised human lens capsule en zzso We demonstrate that novel information about the distribution of proteins by zzso can be obtained from this highly compact zzso zzso having no evident zzso zzso zzso zzso carried out zzso is shown to improve zzso analysis of human lens capsules and zzso high zzso Most importantly, zzso analysis reveals a concentric distribution pattern of proteins such as zzso E zzso and collagen IV zzso on the anterior surface of surgically removed lens zzso which may indicate direct or indirect effects of environmental and mechanical stresses on the human zzso zzso
