Members of the zzso family play a central and evolutionary role in programmed cell death zzso which removes zzso damaged and dangerous cells during development to maintain zzso In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of a zzso from the cotton zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso The zzso zzso full-length zzso contains an zzso zzso open reading frame zzso that encodes a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ICE and has the highly zzso zzso zzso the recognized zzso site of zzso suggesting that it is an zzso zzso of the cotton zzso Northern zzso and zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso is expressed in zzso and the fat body, zzso and zzso of feeding and wandering zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso appears to be correlated with the pulse of zzso and it is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso
