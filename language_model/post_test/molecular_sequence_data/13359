Human zzso zzso zzso is a member of a family of zzso zzso hormones that have a common alpha zzso but differ in their zzso beta zzso The common alpha zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso To study the function of carbohydrates on in zzso zzso of alpha zzso and zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso from zzso zzso The expression zzso was constructed by inserting zzso zzso coding for the mature form zzso into a zzso zzso which contains a 6 zzso His sequence immediately before the zzso of zzso zzso for subsequent zzso of zzso The zzso expressed in inclusion bodies was efficiently zzso by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso demonstrated the expression of zzso Its alpha molecular weight on zzso was zzso zzso under reducing conditions and 15 zzso for a zzso accompanied with some higher molecular weight zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso with native zzso and zzso occurred in very low yield under standard zzso However, the zzso system zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso facilitated both the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso with native zzso to regain partially correct zzso These were revealed by zzso sensitive zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso were more effective in the zzso of zzso with zzso as indicated by a zzso decrease in the amount required to cause a 50% competitive zzso in zzso zzso They have no effect on assembly of zzso with zzso Our results suggest the zzso zzso zzso greater zzso flexibility to the backbone of the beta zzso and the relative rigidity of the beta zzso may serve as a zzso template of the alpha zzso The present approach has made it possible to prepare the zzso zzso alpha zzso in adequate amounts for further study on their biological and topographical features in complete absence of zzso
