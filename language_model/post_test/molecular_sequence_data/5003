zzso of protein zzso by cellular zzso is a crucial step in the initiation of a zzso immune zzso But still little is known about the zzso responsible for the processing of zzso including their zzso In this paper, we show that the combination of automated zzso sequencing with a newly developed method for zzso sequencing of zzso pools generated by the zzso zzso zzso D and E is a fast and easy method to obtain detailed information of the zzso specificity of these zzso Using a zzso synthetic zzso library and a native protein as zzso we confirm and extend the knowledge about the zzso motif of zzso E where positions zzso and zzso of the zzso must be occupied exclusively by zzso zzso acids with aromatic or zzso side zzso However, Val and zzso zzso are not allowed at position zzso zzso zzso accepts a broad range of zzso zzso including charged and polar zzso Additional requirements concerning the zzso positions zzso and zzso were also defined by pool zzso Furthermore, pool sequencing analysis of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso D and E provided evidence that both zzso share the same zzso zzso identical to the one derived from the zzso library and the native zzso zzso pool sequencing analysis is a valuable and fast tool to determine the zzso specificity of any zzso
