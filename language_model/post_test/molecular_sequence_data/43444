zzso acid zzso zzso is the zzso of the zzso zzso It zzso the zzso zzso of various zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso We have carried out the X-ray analysis of reduced zzso in complex with the reaction product zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso generated by the zzso reaction of the zzso with zzso acid zzso These structures were solved by combination of zzso density averaging and zzso refinement zzso The zzso zzso state of zzso zzso was assessed by zzso polarized zzso zzso zzso binds to the reduced zzso with the zzso C zzso C, and C beta atoms positioned zzso A from the zzso side of the zzso The zzso side chain points away from the zzso and is bound in the active site through a rotation of zzso This zzso plays a crucial role in that it adapts its zzso to the size of the active site zzso providing the zzso with the plasticity required for binding a broad range of zzso The zzso binding mode is fully consistent with the proposal, zzso from the analysis of the native zzso structure, that zzso zzso occurs via direct hydride transfer from the C alpha to the zzso zzso zzso In this regard, it is remarkable that, even in the presence of the bulky zzso zzso the active center is made zzso zzso by loop zzso This loop is thought to switch between the zzso zzso observed in the crystal structures and an zzso state required for zzso binding and product zzso zzso closure is likely to have a role in zzso by increasing the zzso of the active site, thus making the hydride transfer reaction more zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso acid zzso and formation of a zzso bond between the zzso acid C alpha and the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso characterized by a 22 degrees angle between the zzso and zzso zzso Thus, in addition to an adaptable zzso binding site, zzso has the ability to bind a highly distorted zzso This ability is relevant for the zzso function as a highly efficient zzso
