zzso of the mouse from three zzso zzso zzso day 16 zzso zzso stage one week zzso and eight weeks zzso were distributed to different laboratories for a collaborative zzso analysis (The Human Brain zzso zzso As one of the laboratories involved in this project, we separated total protein extracts of the brains by large gel zzso From the zzso protein patterns a section was evaluated for each of the three stages according to resolution, zzso and quantitative changes using an image analysis zzso The evaluated pattern section was selected to allow comparisons of zzso patterns between different laboratories on the basis of optimum zzso Changes in protein expression were zzso within two zzso of development: Stage zzso versus stage zzso and stage zzso versus stage zzso Out of the 200 protein spots evaluated zzso showed quantitative changes in the range of zzso or zzso zzso between two zzso The relationship in the frequency of zzso and zzso protein spots differed between the two investigated zzso Most of the protein spots which showed altered expression between two stages were identified by zzso High quality in protein separation and evaluation is zzso
