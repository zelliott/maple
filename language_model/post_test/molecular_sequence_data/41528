zzso zzso are found in all the known structures of peanut zzso The zzso fragments, which survive gastrointestinal zzso of the zzso and are absorbed intact, are hypothesized to zzso and form stable zzso zzso in the zzso which could elicit a specific zzso response resulting in peanut zzso The hypothesis is supported by the finding of a diminished zzso of an zzso of the peanut zzso zzso h 3, which has a major zzso A very probable consequence of this deletion is the reduced tendency to form a stable zzso zzso The discovery of structurally disrupted zzso of the other peanut zzso and the breeding of plants that contain only those zzso could lead to the elimination of peanut zzso
