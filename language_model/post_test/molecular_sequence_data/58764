The zzso half of zzso 1 and whole of zzso 2 of barley mild mosaic zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso to give together with the published data its complete zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 consist of zzso and zzso zzso excluding the 3' zzso A tails, zzso zzso 1 encodes a single large zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso containing eight putative functional zzso and zzso 2 also encodes one zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso containing two functional zzso These functional proteins are arranged in the same manner as in zzso 1 and zzso 2 of barley yellow mosaic zzso zzso and significant zzso acid sequence zzso zzso exists between the proteins of the two zzso The zzso proteins show less zzso acid sequence zzso zzso with the corresponding proteins of zzso or zzso than with those of zzso Comparisons of the zzso proteins with the corresponding proteins of other partially zzso zzso zzso show zzso zzso acid sequence zzso There is zzso zzso sequence identity between the 3' zzso regions zzso in zzso 1 or zzso 2 of zzso and other zzso zzso but only zzso identity between the zzso zzso in zzso 2 of zzso and other zzso zzso
