zzso or zzso in the shell of zzso zzso is composed of zzso calcium zzso and zzso organic zzso In this study, we developed an original technique to characterize the genes zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso by combining suppression zzso zzso zzso to establish a zzso zzso library, with rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso specific zzso sequences have been obtained so zzso These include a protein containing two zzso zzso zzso which was completely zzso after amplification by zzso Its specific expression as well as the specificity of the zzso method was confirmed by zzso zzso on NFC and mantle zzso
