zzso zzso zzso coli zzso are important zzso causing severe diseases such as zzso colitis and zzso syndrome in zzso The majority of zzso strains of zzso zzso zzso or zzso associated with severe cases of these diseases possess a zzso island termed the locus of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for the formation of zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells, is important for the full zzso of zzso Nonetheless, zzso zzso strains have repeatedly been reported to be associated with severe diseases in zzso In this study, we characterized zzso to cultured zzso cells of certain zzso zzso isolated from humans with or without bloody zzso Several zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso showed an unusual, zzso zzso pattern to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we identified the gene essential for the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso identified a novel zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso with a high degree of similarity to the zzso coli zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso was designated zzso Laboratory zzso coli strain zzso transformed with a zzso zzso carrying zzso showed zzso zzso to zzso cells, and zzso zzso of the strain bound to zzso zzso G zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso acts as an zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as an zzso of zzso zzso
