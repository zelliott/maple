zzso tests of neutrality on zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso and a variety of zzso usually show excess (over the neutral zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso These results are of great interest because they are the opposite of what is usually found for nuclear zzso in which the neutral pattern or evidence of zzso divergence between species is usually zzso However, only zzso and insects have been tested so far, so it is not clear whether this intriguing pattern is typical for zzso in all zzso Here I tested three pairs of zzso species and found that they all show a deficit of replacement zzso Taken at face value, this result suggests that zzso evolution proceeds more efficiently in zzso zzso than in zzso of zzso or zzso An alternate explanation is that the zzso pattern is an artifact of zzso zzso that results from the rapid and zzso way in which zzso zzso zzso Further studies are needed to distinguish between these two zzso
