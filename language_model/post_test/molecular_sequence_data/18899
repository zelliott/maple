zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated by fusing zzso zzso myeloma cells and zzso cells from zzso mice zzso with the zzso suspension of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed strong zzso with 15 zzso reference strains of zzso zzso using zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso and protein spectral analysis indicated that zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso A zzso belongs to the zzso binding cassette zzso zzso In addition, a linear zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso was identified by the screening of a zzso zzso random zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was recognized by zzso peptides with the consensus motif zzso zzso means variable zzso zzso Its zzso acid sequence matched zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso A series of progressively truncated peptides were zzso to define the minimal region that was required for zzso zzso zzso The zzso was highly zzso in zzso protein sequences from the isolated zzso zzso zzso which was confirmed by alignment zzso Furthermore, the minimal linear zzso was highly specific among 75 different bacterial strains as shown in sequence zzso These results indicated zzso zzso might be potentially used to develop zzso diagnostic tools for zzso zzso
