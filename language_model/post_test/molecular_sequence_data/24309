zzso in the discrete mode and size of contact areas of a wide range of protein complexes allows us to suggest the existence of a limited number of types of zzso zzso zzso of structures of bound zzso indicates that the zzso zzso type of motif is widespread in recognition zzso Thus, in many cases, the sites of zzso recognition are formed by two significant zzso acids and separated by insignificant zzso Typical examples of such motifs are the zzso sequence of some adhesive and zzso zzso the primary sites for zzso zzso on the zzso network, the zzso sites of protein zzso of zzso zzso and the sites for zzso of the zzso of protein zzso and zzso It is assumed that there is widespread zzso zzso in many zzso zzso
