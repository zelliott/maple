zzso of the major zzso complex zzso influences zzso to experimental zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso basic protein zzso in zzso Current concepts relate such influences to the capacity of class II molecules to present relevant peptides to zzso T zzso We have here analyzed the zzso influence on the immune response and the development of zzso after zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso LEWIS strains showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso for disease zzso whereas zzso and zzso are zzso All zzso responding strains showed zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso but no early significant tendency to express zzso zzso or transforming growth factor zzso zzso in zzso in response to the zzso zzso 7 days post zzso zzso Later, 14 days zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso occurred in zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso only the zzso rats showed an immune response to zzso zzso This response, however, was zzso different from the immune response in the zzso zzso Thus, there was no proliferation and only moderate zzso production in response to zzso but in contrast, a significant and early zzso zzso and zzso response was zzso The data suggest that the zzso zzso to zzso is partly related to the ability to mount a zzso immune response while the zzso zzso resistance may either be related to zzso zzso zzso or to zzso recognition and induction of a zzso different and disease zzso immune zzso
