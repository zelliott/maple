The major zzso agent of zzso poisoning is zzso formed by bacterial zzso of zzso We reported previously that zzso was exclusively formed by the zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso in zzso fish during storage at or below 10 degrees zzso Moreover, zzso ability was affected by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso coli and zzso A sequence analysis of the DNA corresponding to the zzso gene revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso of 380 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences formed a zzso zzso with strong zzso support and revealed high sequence similarities among the zzso zzso isolate and species of the family zzso and a separate zzso branch with the lowest sequence similarity between the isolate and the zzso closer zzso zzso The zzso promoter was used to zzso the zzso gene in zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso zzso coli zzso displayed significant levels of zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was suggested to code the zzso zzso therefore, the optimum reaction conditions of the zzso zzso were similar to those of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, a putative zzso protein binding site, zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene were found in zzso regions of the zzso zzso
