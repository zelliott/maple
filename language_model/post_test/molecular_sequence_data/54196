zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso are being rapidly developed for use in consumer products, wastewater treatment, and chemotherapy providing several possible routes for zzso zzso exposure to humans and aquatic zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso undergo rapid dissolution to zzso but the relative contribution of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and toxicity is not zzso We show that a fraction of the zzso zzso in suspension zzso and this fraction cannot account for the toxicity of the zzso zzso suspensions to zzso zzso Gene expression profiling of zzso magna exposed to zzso zzso or zzso at zzso zzso revealed distinct modes of zzso There was also little overlap in gene expression between zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting specificity for the zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of genes involved in zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso A specific pattern of differential expression of three zzso genes including a zzso zzso and zzso containing gene were confirmed for zzso zzso exposure and provide a suite of zzso for identifying environmental exposure to zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
