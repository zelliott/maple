To isolate genes involved in tumor formation and in zzso a zzso zzso library was constructed from a zzso mouse brain zzso A gene isolated in this screen, named zzso zzso membrane zzso codes for a putative zzso with four zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to be highly expressed in brain tumor cells but not in normal zzso It is also expressed at high levels in zzso embryonic stem cells, but markedly zzso in these cells after their differentiation into zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence bears high zzso to the growth arrest specific protein zzso which is involved in several human peripheral zzso The expression patterns of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso were compared at different proliferation zzso The results suggest an inverse pattern of expression for the two zzso zzso expression being high during cell proliferation and zzso expression being high during growth zzso To further characterize the zzso gene we have isolated its human zzso and examined its expression in embryonic and adult zzso In our search for human sequences zzso to zzso and zzso we identified two new genes which we have named zzso and zzso Thus, we present a novel family of membrane zzso one member of which is closely associated with proliferation and another with growth zzso
