zzso of the tail in developing zzso is a complex process involving the organization of the zzso transport of zzso proteins from the zzso to the tail, and assembly of the outer dense fibers and zzso zzso Although detailed zzso descriptions of these events are available, the molecular mechanisms remain to be fully zzso We have isolated a new zzso named zzso 1, from a zzso germ zzso zzso library of mouse zzso and also its human zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso is zzso zzso long, carrying a zzso pair open reading frame that encodes zzso 1, a zzso protein predicted to consist of 254 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence includes 6 zzso repeats, which are also present in the human zzso protein zzso 1) as well as in 2 other newly reported proteins of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 is exclusively observed in zzso germ zzso zzso raised against zzso 1 identified a zzso zzso 32 zzso zzso band in Western zzso zzso The protein was further localized in the zzso of the zzso zzso and along the entire length of the tail in mature zzso zzso 1 in zzso is resistant to treatment with zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso core proteins of the mouse zzso zzso
