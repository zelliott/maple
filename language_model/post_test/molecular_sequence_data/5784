zzso was made of the effect of zzso V on zzso movement into large zzso zzso zzso using zzso a zzso fluorescent zzso To avoid the possible difficulties relating to the addition of zzso V and/or zzso in zzso zzso the burst method was zzso zzso zzso with rat zzso V in the presence of zzso were collected by zzso and zzso and then burst with zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso movement across the artificial zzso membrane was measured by determination of zzso zzso due to the leaked zzso from zzso zzso The observed zzso signal increased dependent on zzso V and zzso zzso whereas bovine serum zzso did not affect this signal up to 1 zzso Thus, zzso V shows zzso channel activity in zzso zzso a novel zzso inhibited inward zzso movement into zzso caused by zzso V in a zzso zzso In the presence of 50 zzso zzso V and 400 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso showed significant zzso of zzso movement due to zzso zzso and 50% zzso was achieved at 25 zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso had no such effect even at 30 zzso zzso is thus shown to have zzso activity on inward zzso movement due to zzso V in artificial zzso and may prove useful as a probe for zzso the functions of zzso V in zzso
