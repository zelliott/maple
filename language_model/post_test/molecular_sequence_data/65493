In comparative zzso one analyzes jointly zzso related species in order to identify zzso and zzso sequences and to zzso their zzso While such studies enabled the detection of zzso sequences in large zzso the evolutionary dynamics of regulatory regions as a whole remain poorly zzso Here we present a zzso model for the evolution of promoter regions in zzso combining the effects of regulatory interactions of many different zzso zzso The model expresses explicitly the selection forces acting on zzso factor binding sites in the context of a dynamic evolutionary zzso We develop zzso to zzso likelihood and to learn de zzso collections of zzso factor binding motifs and their selection parameters from zzso Using the new techniques, we examine the evolutionary dynamics in zzso species zzso zzso of an evolutionary model constructed using all known zzso factor binding motifs and of a model learned from the data automatically reveal relatively weak selection on most binding zzso Moreover, according to our estimates, strong binding sites are constraining only a fraction of the zzso promoter sequence that is under zzso Our study demonstrates how complex evolutionary dynamics in zzso regions emerges from zzso of the evolutionary consequences of known regulatory zzso
