The zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso It encodes the zzso zzso a central zzso regulator belonging to the zzso family of bacterial zzso and shows zzso identity with zzso proteins from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene was able to complement a zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased doubling times and a relief of the zzso repression of some zzso activities, such as zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso activity was performed by using the promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is subject to zzso repression and contains a zzso responsive element zzso consensus zzso zzso of this zzso site or the presence of the zzso zzso abolished the zzso repression of a zzso zzso These data support the role of zzso as a common regulatory element zzso zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso
