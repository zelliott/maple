zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key player in zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso expression of multiple zzso zzso resulting from the alternative zzso of zzso A, B, and C, which zzso part of the zzso domain, is an important feature of zzso zzso We report a novel zzso that results from the alternative zzso of a previously undiscovered zzso between the zzso spliced zzso 3 and the alternatively spliced zzso zzso This zzso zzso encodes 41 zzso acids and is unlikely to undergo zzso extensive zzso seen for the regions zzso by zzso A, B, and zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction demonstrates that this zzso is expressed in human peripheral blood zzso cells and cell lines of zzso origin, but with a clearly different pattern to that of the zzso caused by zzso A, B, and C, zzso a different regulatory zzso
