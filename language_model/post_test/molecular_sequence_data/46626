A group I zzso has recently been shown to have invaded zzso zzso genes by horizontal transfer many times during the broad course of zzso zzso To investigate the frequency of acquisition of this zzso within a more closely related group of plants, we determined its distribution and zzso its evolutionary history among 14 zzso of the zzso family zzso Southern zzso zzso showed that 6 of the 14 zzso contain this zzso in their zzso zzso zzso sequencing showed that these six zzso are highly similar in sequence zzso zzso and identical in length zzso zzso zzso evidence from zzso reconstructions of zzso distribution and zzso analyses of zzso sequences is consistent with a largely vertical history of zzso transmission in the family; the simplest scenarios zzso but one zzso gain and two zzso Despite this, however, striking differences in lengths of zzso zzso zzso coupled with the absence of zzso in zzso zzso indicate that the six zzso zzso probably acquired their zzso by at least three and quite possibly five separate horizontal zzso The highly similar nature of these independently acquired zzso implies a closely related set of donor zzso
