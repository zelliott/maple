We introduce a method to follow DNA repair that is suitable for both clinical and laboratory zzso An zzso construct with a unique zzso zzso base at a defined position was prepared in zzso using zzso zzso harboring a zzso tract from zzso 5 to 9 of the human zzso zzso zzso curve experiments showed that the real-time zzso method has a linear response to damage, suggesting that it is useful for DNA repair zzso The zzso construct with a unique zzso base was introduced into zzso cells or human peripheral blood zzso cells, and plasmids were recovered as a function of zzso The quantitative real-time zzso zzso demonstrated that repair of the zzso was zzso complete in less than 48 h in zzso zzso zzso of small interfering zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and reduced the repair of zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso into zzso white blood cells showed that zzso repair had a zzso of 2 to zzso This method is a zzso zzso and robust way to monitor repair of specific zzso in virtually any cell zzso
