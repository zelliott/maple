A novel zzso designated zzso which encodes the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso open reading frame zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso Major properties of the zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso were the same as those described for the native zzso zzso He and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows up to 57% identity and up to zzso similarity to hypothetical proteins deduced from zzso in zzso from bacteria and zzso suggesting a possible novel gene zzso
