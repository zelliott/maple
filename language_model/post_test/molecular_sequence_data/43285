zzso multiple zzso zzso is a genetically zzso bone disorder caused by genes segregating on human zzso 8, 11, and 19 and designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, the zzso gene has been isolated and partially characterized and appears to zzso a tumor zzso zzso We have identified six zzso in the human zzso gene from six unrelated multiple zzso families segregating for the zzso gene on zzso zzso One of the zzso we detected is the same zzso deletion in zzso 6 that was previously reported in two independent zzso zzso The other five zzso in zzso 1, 6, 9, and the zzso junction at the 3' end of zzso 2, are zzso In each case, the zzso is likely to result in a truncated or zzso zzso zzso These results corroborate and extend the previous report of zzso in this gene in two zzso families, and provide additional support for the zzso gene as the cause of zzso multiple zzso in families showing linkage to zzso zzso
