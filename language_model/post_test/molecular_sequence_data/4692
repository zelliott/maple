zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso channel to zzso zzso of known dimensions was studied in zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells by using the patch clamp zzso zzso reversal zzso measured with external zzso zzso gave the zzso ratio zzso sequence NO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same selectivity sequence but somewhat higher zzso ratios were obtained when zzso were tested from the zzso zzso zzso zzso methane zzso ethane zzso and zzso were not measurably zzso zzso zzso zzso from either side of the zzso The relationship between zzso ratios from the outside and zzso diameters suggests a minimum functional pore diameter of approximately zzso zzso zzso ratios also followed a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of two adjacent zzso in zzso to smaller, less polar zzso led to a significant zzso increase in single channel zzso and elevated zzso to several large zzso suggesting that these zzso do not strongly bind zzso zzso but may contribute to the zzso part of the zzso
