zzso is a central hormone that exerts zzso effects on plant growth including the development of roots, zzso flowers and zzso The perception and signaling of the plant hormone zzso rely on the cooperative action of several zzso among which zzso acid zzso proteins play a pivotal zzso In this study, we identified and zzso analyzed the entire zzso gene family in tomato zzso zzso a reference species for zzso plants, and the model plant for zzso fruit zzso zzso characterization using a dedicated single cell system revealed that tomato zzso proteins function as active zzso of zzso gene transcription, with, however, different zzso members displaying varying levels of zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene family is slightly contracted in tomato compared with zzso with a lower representation of zzso zzso zzso genes display distinctive expression pattern in different tomato zzso and zzso and some of them display differential responses to zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in linking both hormone signaling zzso The data presented here shed more light on zzso genes and provides new leads towards the zzso of their function during plant development and in zzso hormone zzso
