zzso zzso of the marine zzso zzso and zzso vary widely in their zzso compositions and growth responses to light and zzso yet show greater than zzso identity in their zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso In order to better define the genetic variation that accompanies their zzso diversity, sequences for the zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso region were determined in 32 zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso from around the zzso Each strain examined yielded one ITS sequence that contained two zzso zzso zzso variations in the length and zzso content of the zzso were observed among the zzso particularly among zzso zzso zzso models of the ITS were predicted in order to facilitate alignment of the sequences for zzso zzso The previously observed division of zzso into two zzso (called high and zzso after their differences in zzso zzso were supported, as was the subdivision of the zzso zzso into four genetically distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso marine cluster A zzso into six zzso three of which can be associated with a particular zzso zzso chromatic adaptation, and lack of zzso The pattern of sequence divergence within and between zzso is suggestive of a mode of evolution driven by zzso sweeps and implies that each zzso represents an ecologically distinct zzso Furthermore, many of the zzso consist of strains isolated from disparate regions of the world's zzso zzso that they are geographically widely zzso These results provide further evidence that natural populations of zzso and zzso consist of multiple zzso zzso genetically closely related but zzso zzso which may vary in relative abundance with changing environmental zzso
