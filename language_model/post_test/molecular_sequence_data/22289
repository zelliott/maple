zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by growth zzso skin and skeletal zzso and a predisposition to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso one of five human zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso have been identified in a subset of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso patients show high levels of zzso instability, implicating this protein in the maintenance of zzso zzso However, zzso is the least characterized of the zzso zzso family with regard to its molecular and zzso zzso We have expressed the human zzso protein in zzso coli and zzso it to near zzso We show that zzso has an zzso function that is activated by DNA, with zzso being much more effective than zzso in this zzso We have determined that a DNA length of 60 zzso is required to zzso activate zzso zzso by zzso while the minimal site size for zzso binding by zzso is between 20 and 40 zzso Interestingly, zzso possesses a zzso DNA zzso activity that is inhibited by the zzso DNA binding protein zzso Unlike the previously characterized members of the zzso family, zzso lacks a zzso DNA zzso zzso
