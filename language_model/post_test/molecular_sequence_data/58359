In order to clarify the nature of T zzso zzso the pancreatic zzso of patients with zzso diabetes zzso zzso we zzso T cell zzso zzso gene transcripts expressed in pancreatic biopsy specimens of patients with zzso zzso We also investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso The zzso V beta repertoire was not restricted either in the zzso or the peripheral zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso V alpha repertoire was restricted in the zzso but not in the peripheral blood zzso of zzso zzso The sequence analysis of the zzso region 3 zzso of the zzso alpha revealed the presence of dominant zzso in alpha chains of T cells in the zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in the zzso of zzso patients, while zzso zzso was zzso A lower level of expression of zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso than in the control zzso These results indicate that T cells bearing a distinct zzso alpha chain are selectively retained and activated within the zzso of zzso zzso
