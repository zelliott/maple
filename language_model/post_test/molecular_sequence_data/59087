zzso of zzso genes may contain a zzso which is a zzso element with a core sequence related to the zzso but split by a zzso of about 14 zzso Here we describe zzso a zzso protein that specifically interacts with a zzso element located zzso to the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso IV zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a basic zzso zzso zzso domain that displays structural features distinct from that of zzso binding factors zzso zzso shift experiments showed that zzso zzso does not efficiently bind to the continuous zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis indicated that zzso transcripts are zzso and accumulate to the highest levels during late zzso development in a zzso zzso During the same time period, zzso IV transcript levels decreased zzso suggesting that zzso acts as a zzso zzso negative regulator of zzso IV gene expression in rape zzso
