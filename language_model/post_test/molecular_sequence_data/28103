The primary human and zzso structure of the novel zzso zzso is zzso These peptides were, therefore, isolated by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso using a specific zzso against rat zzso The sequences of the peptides were deduced by mass zzso (for both human and zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation (for zzso zzso In both species, two molecular forms were zzso In the human, the major form corresponded to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the total) and the minor form, to the zzso zzso In the zzso however, both molecular forms were present in approximately equal zzso The finding that the sequences of human and zzso zzso are identical to that of the rat suggests that strong evolutionary pressure has acted to conserve this zzso
