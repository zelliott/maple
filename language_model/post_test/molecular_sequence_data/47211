In adult bone zzso zzso stem cells are found in close association with distinctive zzso cell zzso This association is necessary for maintenance of zzso but the precise mechanisms underlying the zzso between zzso cells and zzso stem cells are poorly zzso In this study, we used a bone zzso zzso cell line zzso that is able to support human long-term zzso This zzso activity cannot be related to expression of known zzso and is abolished by addition of zzso Using a gene trap strategy that selects genes zzso zzso or zzso proteins expressed by zzso cells, we obtained several insertions that produced fusion zzso In one zzso fusion protein activity was zzso in the presence of zzso and we show that zzso of the trap zzso has occurred into the zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells, in other zzso cell lines, and in primary zzso cells but not in primitive zzso zzso We show that zzso acts as a functional zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso III and zzso zzso can bind to these cells, and the addition of zzso 165 to zzso cells increases expression of 2 zzso known to regulate early zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we show that zzso cells and immature zzso cells express different zzso zzso We propose that zzso may act as a novel zzso on zzso cells by zzso interactions between zzso and primitive zzso zzso
