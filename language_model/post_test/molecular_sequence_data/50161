The major protein zzso into the zzso of tobacco plants zzso I) is a zzso protein that has zzso zzso zzso We have isolated the gene zzso zzso I zzso and analyzed the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso marker gene driven by its promoter in transgenic zzso zzso plant lines that expressed the zzso gene under control of the full-length zzso promoter showed high levels of zzso expression in mature floral zzso zzso specificity of zzso expression demonstrated that the construct was expressed uniquely in zzso with a small level of expression in zzso Further, analysis of its zzso expression showed that the construct is expressed uniquely during those times when zzso is actively being zzso from zzso An examination of the zzso start site verified that the initiation site of the zzso zzso in transgenic plants is identical with that of the native gene in zzso Two promoter deletion zzso were also prepared and zzso Analysis in transgenic plants revealed that the zzso expression is the result of multiple promoter elements and suggests that zzso zzso and flower opening may be zzso zzso
