Our aim was to characterize and determine the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso in human vascular zzso zzso zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso detected the presence of zzso zzso both ETA and zzso receptors in the media from zzso and pulmonary and coronary zzso In zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso for both zzso in the media of coronary zzso zzso binding zzso using zzso found a single population of zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso three patients, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso 4 zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso 10 zzso zzso and coronary arteries zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 71 zzso 21 zzso zzso Using media from coronary zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso both produced zzso competition binding zzso against zzso confirming the presence of zzso and zzso sites corresponding to the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a significant parallel rightward shift of zzso zzso of coronary arteries in zzso but zzso and zzso failed to show any zzso activity when tested at zzso of zzso or zzso 3 zzso in three zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
