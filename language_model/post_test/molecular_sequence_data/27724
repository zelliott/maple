Several proteins with an affinity to zzso contain a zzso sequence of 8 zzso acids which is zzso as being important for zzso zzso An zzso of 11 zzso acids containing this sequence is shown to bind zzso zzso zzso in a filter binding zzso High zzso of zzso compete for this zzso 10 other peptides with different sequences do not exhibit affinity to zzso in this zzso These results support the relevance of the zzso zzso sequence in the binding of proteins to zzso
