zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso group of zzso by zzso zzso zzso to yield zzso and zzso in the first step of de zzso zzso zzso Apart from its key role in zzso zzso the zzso is generally regarded as a model system in the study of proteins exhibiting zzso zzso Here, the successful preparation, zzso and zzso data collection of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso To date, there is no structural representative of a zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso zzso is thus expected to provide important insights into the molecular basis of zzso activity at low zzso Furthermore, through comparisons with the recently reported structure of an extremely zzso zzso from zzso zzso it is hoped to contribute to general principles governing protein adaptation to extreme zzso A complete native data to zzso A resolution showed that the crystal belongs to space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, alpha zzso beta zzso 90, gamma zzso 120 degrees, and that it contains three zzso and three regulatory zzso per zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso coli zzso was sufficient to solve the structure of the zzso zzso zzso via the zzso method and to obtain electron density of good zzso
