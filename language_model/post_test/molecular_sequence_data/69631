The zzso inner membrane zzso is required for the maturation of zzso proteins that are delivered to the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso this zzso is now shown to be a complex that contains two zzso zzso zzso and the previously identified zzso zzso structure similarity indicates that zzso and zzso are related to each other and to the family of zzso and zzso signal zzso zzso and zzso have separate, zzso zzso zzso In addition to its catalyzing the zzso of zzso space sorting signals, zzso is required for the stable and functional expression of zzso Thus, inner membrane zzso and by zzso zzso zzso signal zzso may have acquired multiple zzso zzso by gene zzso to broaden their range of zzso zzso
