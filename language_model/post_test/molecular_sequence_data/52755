The zzso C1 and C2 proteins are among the most abundant proteins in the nucleus, and as ubiquitous components of zzso complexes, they have been implicated in many aspects of zzso zzso In this report, we have characterized a zzso zzso induced in embryonic stem cells by zzso of the zzso gene trap zzso into the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C1 and C2 were zzso and the predicted protein sequences were found to be highly zzso among zzso A human consensus zzso generated from over 400 expressed sequence zzso suggests two revisions to the previously published human zzso In addition, alternatively spliced zzso expressed only by the zzso zzso zzso four novel zzso zzso of C1 and C2 with either seven additional zzso acids or one fewer zzso acid in a region between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The disrupted gene was transmitted into the germ line and is tightly linked to a zzso embryonic lethal zzso zzso zzso zzso fail to develop beyond the egg cylinder stage and are zzso by zzso days of zzso a zzso consistent with a fundamental role in cellular zzso However, zzso C1 and C2 are not required for cell zzso zzso stem cell lines established from zzso zzso zzso did not express zzso levels of either protein yet were able to grow and differentiate in zzso albeit more slowly than zzso zzso These results indicate that the C1 and C2 zzso are not required for any essential step in zzso zzso however, the proteins may influence the rate and/or zzso of one or more zzso
