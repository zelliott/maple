zzso is one of the preferred carbon sources of zzso coli, and two sets of zzso genes zzso the zzso and zzso systems) are involved in its transport and zzso zzso zzso the zzso genes zzso and zzso whereas zzso was previously suggested to be an zzso for the zzso genes zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of the two regulators zzso and zzso exhibit extensive zzso The similarity between the two regulators prompted analysis of the zzso of the zzso genes by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso as well as zzso was indeed observed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso High zzso zzso from cloned zzso or induced through zzso was required to observe repression of zzso zzso Two zzso elements were identified in the zzso region of zzso and were also shown to be the target sites of zzso by zzso zzso However, the zzso genes were not induced by zzso in the presence of enhanced amounts of zzso whereas repression by zzso was relieved by zzso The repression of zzso genes by zzso is thus unusual in that it is not relieved by the availability of zzso These results led us to propose that zzso activates zzso and zzso the zzso genes in the presence of zzso derived from zzso allowing the zzso to switch from the zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso may explain the progressive changes in zzso gene expression along with zzso of cell growth in the presence of zzso
