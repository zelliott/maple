zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso of varying molecular weights by selecting the zzso of zzso and zzso as well as the zzso Four zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso and zzso five zzso zzso zzso 50, 100, 200 and zzso and two temperatures zzso and zzso were zzso The highest amount of zzso zzso with the lowest concentration of zzso zzso and the lower temperature of zzso gave the lowest zzso molecular weight zzso of zzso zzso As the zzso concentration was increased, zzso zzso and zzso the zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The next zzso concentration zzso gave a similar upward trend, starting at zzso and ending at zzso at zzso and zzso and ending at zzso at zzso The upward trend continued for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso An increase in the temperature had the overall effect of increasing the zzso for each decreasing concentration of zzso and increasing concentration of zzso For zzso and zzso zzso at zzso the zzso was zzso The results of the study show that the molecular weights of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso to the concentration of the zzso and directly zzso to the concentration of zzso and the zzso
