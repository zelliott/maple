We have cloned and zzso an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence indicates a gene cluster that encodes four zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso genes zzso zzso and the zzso region of the zzso zzso The arrangement of these seven genes is zzso The zzso and zzso frames overlap by 131 zzso The zzso and zzso genes are separated by a zzso zzso A zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso is very similar to the corresponding gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso for each zzso protein zzso and for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to a common zzso of an estimated size of 10 zzso indicating that these seven genes may be expressed as a single zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso zzso may function as a zzso zzso similar to the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli and to the zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso
