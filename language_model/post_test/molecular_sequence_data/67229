The retinal zzso zzso gene plays an essential role in retinal zzso An zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso has been zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze the function of zzso in the developing zzso 

zzso properties of zzso were analyzed by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso with in zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression pattern was analyzed by in zzso zzso using whole or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of function was studied by using zzso zzso zzso targeted to the zzso translation initiation zzso zzso injected with control or zzso zzso were analyzed at stage 41 or zzso 

zzso shares zzso with zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but lacks an zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the developing zzso beginning in the early zzso zzso In the maturing zzso zzso expression is restricted primarily to the developing zzso layer and the zzso marginal zzso zzso can bind a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an element zzso among all known zzso gene zzso In a promoter activity zzso zzso functions as a stronger zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression resulted in a decrease in zzso and red cone zzso expression levels in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso also resulted in a decrease in the length of both rod and cone outer zzso 

The results suggest that zzso functions to regulate rod and cone development by zzso zzso gene zzso
