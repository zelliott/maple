zzso zzso are the most prevalent zzso zzso zzso In this study, we originally identified authentic zzso and their zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso A zzso encodes two zzso zzso and zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso of the neural extract revealed the production of both zzso zzso contains several zzso P zzso zzso zzso whereas a zzso is exceptionally located at position 4 from the C zzso of zzso The zzso gene encodes both zzso in the same zzso indicating no alternative generation of zzso unlike the zzso zzso These results suggested that the alternative zzso of the zzso gene was established during evolution of zzso The only zzso zzso zzso was zzso activated by zzso SP, and zzso A at zzso zzso whereas zzso showed zzso less potent activity, indicating that the zzso selectivity of zzso is distinct from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso like SP, also zzso the typical contraction on the guinea pig zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso of the brain zzso small cells in the zzso and the zone 7 in the zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was distributed in these three zzso plus the zzso These results showed that zzso play major roles in sexual behavior and feeding in zzso as zzso peptides and zzso zzso Taken together, our data revealed the zzso and structural origins of zzso zzso and their zzso
