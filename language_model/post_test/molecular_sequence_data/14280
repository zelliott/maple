zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease, with a characteristic hypersensitivity to zzso radiation that is caused by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a gene zzso a protein zzso critical for the induction of cellular responses to DNA damage, particularly to DNA double strand zzso A long known characteristic of zzso cells is their ability to zzso DNA even in the presence of zzso zzso DNA damage, a phenomenon termed zzso DNA zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso protein zzso blocks sister zzso exchange following DNA zzso We now show that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso protein zzso also zzso DNA zzso zzso a potential physical interaction of zzso with the DNA replication machinery, we found that zzso zzso with zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso from cellular zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso translated zzso we showed that the interaction is direct and zzso by the C zzso of zzso Indeed, a zzso acid region close to the zzso domain is sufficient for strong binding to zzso This binding is specific to zzso because the zzso regions of other zzso members, including the closely related zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not bind zzso zzso was found to bind two regions in zzso To examine the functional significance of the interaction between zzso and zzso we tested the ability of zzso to stimulate DNA synthesis by DNA zzso zzso which is implicated in both DNA replication and DNA repair zzso zzso was observed to stimulate DNA zzso activity in a zzso zzso
