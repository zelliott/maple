The structure and accessibility of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied in zzso zzso zzso using both chemical and zzso zzso and in zzso using zzso as the zzso The results obtained show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of a short zzso domain with two zzso structures containing the zzso zzso boxes zzso and A and a large zzso 3' domain containing boxes B, C, zzso and zzso A precise identification of zzso contacts is zzso Protection by proteins in the zzso and in zzso are nearly identical and were exclusively found in the 3' zzso There are two distinct protein zzso sites: zzso box zzso and its surrounding region, this site probably includes box D, zzso the boxes B and C pair and the bases of zzso 2 and zzso Box zzso is wrapped by the zzso zzso interactions are more loose at the level of boxes C and D and a box C and D interaction is preserved in the zzso In zzso with this location of the protein binding sites, an in zzso zzso analysis showed that box zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso in the zzso domain have little effect on zzso zzso Our in zzso probing experiments strongly suggest that, in zzso growing cells, most of the zzso zzso molecules are involved in the zzso interaction with the zzso region and in two of the interactions recently proposed with zzso zzso zzso Our experimental study leads to a slightly revised version of the model of interaction proposed by zzso zzso zzso segments linking the zzso zzso are highly sensitive to zzso in zzso and their functional importance was tested by a zzso zzso
