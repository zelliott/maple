A zzso library of zzso microbes from the zzso River in China was constructed, and a novel zzso designated as zzso was isolated and zzso zzso had 423 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of 44 zzso and zzso of zzso It zzso various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its best zzso was zzso zzso zzso The optimum pH for zzso activity was zzso and the optimum temperature was 50 degrees zzso Metal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly inhibited the activity of zzso whereas zzso was required for zzso zzso zzso remained in the presence of zzso alcohol, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso revealed that it had 7 closely related zzso zzso Moreover, a sequence analysis showed that zzso like its 7 relatives, did not belong to any known zzso zzso zzso
