This study provides data on the zzso of bacterial and zzso communities in an active methane zzso at the zzso mud zzso in the deep Eastern Mediterranean zzso Layers of varying depths in the zzso sediments were investigated in terms of zzso chemical parameters and zzso zzso microbial population zzso The latter was accomplished by analyzing the sequences of directly amplified zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso of organisms potentially associated with processes such as zzso methane zzso and zzso reduction were thus zzso Overall, the zzso layers revealed the presence of sequences of quite diverse bacterial and zzso communities, which varied considerably with zzso zzso types revealed in these communities are known as key organisms involved in the following zzso zzso zzso methane zzso and zzso reduction, zzso zzso zzso and zzso a range of zzso zzso zzso In the communities in the lowest zzso layer sampled zzso zzso zzso bacteria and zzso of the zzso cluster zzso involved in zzso methane zzso were zzso whereas zzso organisms abounded in the top zzso layer zzso zzso Communities in the middle layer zzso zzso contained organisms that could be linked to either of the aforementioned zzso We discuss how these zzso zzso findings can support the ongoing molecular work aimed at unraveling both the functioning and the functional zzso of the communities under zzso
