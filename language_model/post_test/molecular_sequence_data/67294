zzso zzso high diversity of zzso as well as zzso zzso bacteria that contribute significantly to CO2 dynamics in zzso In this study, we used culture dependent and independent methods to assess the community structure and diversity of zzso in agricultural and coastal barren saline zzso zzso and high zzso We studied the composition and distribution of zzso by means of functional marker gene zzso zzso large zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso marker zzso zzso zzso The zzso form zzso and zzso genes associated with carbon fixation were analyzed to gain insight into zzso potential of zzso in three soil types of coastal zzso which had a very different salt load and zzso zzso 

In zzso libraries, the zzso form zzso was retrieved only from high saline soil whereas form zzso was found in all three soil zzso The form zzso zzso was also amplified from bacterial zzso obtained from all soil zzso A number of novel zzso lineages affiliated with form zzso and zzso zzso trees were zzso These were zzso related to the known zzso sequences from zzso volcanic ashes and marine zzso In zzso zzso clone libraries, the agricultural soil was dominated by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso dominated saline zzso Environmental specificity was apparently visible at both higher zzso levels zzso and lower zzso levels zzso and zzso The differentiation in community structure and diversity in three soil zzso was supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

This study may provide fundamentally new insights into the role of zzso and zzso bacterial diversity in zzso carbon cycling in barren saline zzso The bacterial communities varied greatly among the three sites, probably because of differences in zzso carbon and zzso zzso The zzso form zzso zzso zzso were found only in high saline soil clone library, thus giving the indication of zzso availability in this soil zzso This is the first comparative study of the community structure and diversity of zzso bacteria in coastal agricultural and saline barren zzso using functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso marker zzso
