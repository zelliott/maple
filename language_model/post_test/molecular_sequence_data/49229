The majority of cloned animals derived by nuclear transfer from zzso cell zzso develop to the zzso stage but die after zzso Mouse zzso that lack an zzso zzso which plays an essential role in control of zzso zzso develop to the zzso stage and also die after zzso because they lack zzso embryonic zzso Based on this zzso we zzso that cloned zzso derived from differentiated cell zzso fail to establish a population of truly zzso embryonic cells because of faulty zzso of key embryonic genes such as zzso To explore this hypothesis, we used an in zzso approach to identify a set of zzso genes whose zzso expression pattern is similar to that of zzso When expression of zzso and 10 zzso genes was analyzed in individual zzso zzso cloned zzso only zzso correctly expressed all tested zzso In contrast to this incomplete zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned zzso and normal control zzso expressed these genes zzso zzso the contrast between expression patterns of the zzso genes correlated with efficiency of embryonic development of zzso and zzso zzso cloned zzso to zzso These observations suggest that failure to reactivate the full spectrum of these zzso genes may contribute to embryonic zzso in zzso zzso
