The zzso chain reaction with prior reverse zzso of zzso into zzso was applied to zzso C virus zzso detection in human serum samples of different zzso In order to eliminate false negative results, the following steps were zzso zzso zzso reverse transcription, and zzso primer zzso We compared different zzso extraction methods using zzso zzso and zzso K zzso zzso and tested virus particle enrichment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso extraction with zzso zzso was the most efficient zzso zzso of single samples did not improve zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso produced zzso from fewer samples than did zzso zzso zzso virus reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso region of the zzso C virus zzso amplified zzso from more samples than did zzso from the coding zzso Thirty six zzso C virus zzso positive samples were zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 to zzso and 15 to zzso yielded 21 zzso whereas zzso from the coding region produced 16 zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The most efficient combination of steps was zzso extraction with zzso salt solution, reverse zzso with zzso zzso zzso virus reverse zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction primed with zzso from the zzso zzso region of the zzso C virus zzso Other combinations produced more false negative zzso Three different groups of zzso C virus zzso positive individuals had markedly different zzso zzso zzso C virus zzso was detected in the zzso of only zzso of zzso C virus zzso positive blood donors, but in zzso of zzso C virus zzso positive patients with clinically manifest zzso C, and zzso of zzso C virus zzso positive zzso who had received plasma products in the past which had not been zzso No zzso C virus zzso could be detected in the zzso of 450 zzso C virus zzso negative blood donors with elevated serum zzso zzso zzso zzso
