We have previously shown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plant zzso zzso zzso zzso that the strong, sweet fragrance of zzso zzso zzso an annual plant native to California, consists of 8 to 12 volatile compounds, including 4 zzso Although some zzso zzso plants emit all 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso other zzso zzso plants do not emit the latter 2 zzso Here we report that zzso tissue was responsible for the bulk of the zzso zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso that zzso the zzso of the zzso of both zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso respectively, was also highest in zzso zzso zzso activity was absent from floral zzso of plants not emitting zzso A zzso zzso zzso clone zzso zzso was isolated, and its sequence was shown to have zzso identity to zzso acid zzso The protein zzso by this zzso can use zzso and zzso as zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were positively correlated with levels of zzso activity in the zzso and no zzso zzso was observed in flowers that do not emit zzso Overall, the data show that the floral zzso of zzso is controlled at the site of zzso that a positive correlation exists between volatile zzso and zzso activity, and that control of the level of zzso activity is exerted at a zzso zzso
