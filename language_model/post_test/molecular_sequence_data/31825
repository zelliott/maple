zzso display methods are increasingly being used to produce human zzso zzso for disease zzso Rapid screening and isolation of specific human zzso genes are valuable for producing human zzso zzso showing high specificity and zzso In this report, we describe a novel zzso cell display method in which whole human zzso is displayed on the cell surface of zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso human zzso zzso with high affinity on the cell surface after normal folding and zzso modification were screened using a cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells were then converted to zzso cells by zzso with a zzso coding zzso zzso This zzso cell display method was applied to in zzso affinity maturation of zzso zzso zzso specific to the human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso heavy chain variable region gene was randomly zzso and inserted into zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso cell display library consisting of zzso independent clones was zzso zzso cells showing high zzso to zzso zzso were screened by the cell zzso resulting in the establishment of a zzso cell line producing with higher zzso than the parent zzso zzso
