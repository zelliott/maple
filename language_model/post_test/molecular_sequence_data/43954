zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso and the female zzso zzso Although little is known about the zzso regulation of the zzso (the zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso promoter has revealed a number of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the gene zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is responsive to zzso zzso complexes, zzso zzso containing deleted portions of the zzso promoter fused to a zzso reporter were zzso zzso along with zzso and zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso Analysis of these deletion zzso revealed that the zzso promoter of zzso is highly zzso by zzso and zzso proteins (typically zzso with a reporter construct containing zzso sequences from zzso to zzso zzso This stimulation was lost when a similar construct containing sequences from zzso to zzso zzso was zzso zzso start site analysis using reverse zzso verified that the zzso initiation of the zzso deletion zzso with or without zzso zzso was the same as that observed in zzso Computer analysis of zzso sequences from zzso to zzso zzso identified four putative zzso zzso located at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso corresponding to the four putative zzso sites revealed that only zzso and zzso sites in zzso bound zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sites showed that each element was required for stimulation by zzso and zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso in transient zzso zzso Finally, zzso dual labeling was used to show that more than zzso of all zzso cells in zzso zzso sections from cycling zzso contained nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data, taken together, show that zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso and zzso proteins via two functionally linked zzso sites in the zzso zzso promoter and that these sites are likely to be important regulators of zzso production in zzso
