The small zzso zzso increases the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso by stabilizing the active sites generated by four large zzso zzso zzso This stabilization appears to be due to an influence of S on the reaction intermediate zzso which is formed after the abstraction of a zzso from the zzso zzso We tested the functional significance of zzso that are zzso among most species in the zzso part of S and analyzed their influence on the kinetic parameters of zzso zzso The replacements in S zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso activities ranging from 95 to zzso of wild zzso The specificity factors for the three zzso zzso were little affected zzso of wild zzso but zzso values increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso with replacements zzso and zzso showed increased zzso relative to zzso of the zzso zzso forming 2 to 3 times more zzso per zzso zzso than zzso or zzso zzso The results suggest that specific zzso of the zzso zzso and of the zzso core of S are transmitted to the active site by long-range zzso S interactions with L may restrict the flexibility of zzso zzso in zzso
