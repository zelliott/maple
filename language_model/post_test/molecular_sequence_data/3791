The zzso protein of zzso coli is a DNA zzso zzso that resolves Holliday junction zzso formed during DNA zzso zzso and repair by introducing zzso paired incisions zzso to zzso zzso It is zzso by the defective zzso zzso which raises the possibility that it may be of zzso zzso We show that zzso sequences are indeed often associated with zzso sequences in the zzso of several bacterial zzso They are also found in many zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso is also present in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this case, there is no obvious association of zzso with zzso zzso Given the ancient lineage of zzso zzso this observation provides the first indication that zzso may be of bacterial zzso The zzso proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and shown to resolve Holliday zzso The zzso zzso also promotes DNA repair in strains lacking the zzso zzso Both zzso cleave junctions in a zzso manner, but the zzso zzso zzso shows a different sequence preference zzso to zzso from the zzso coli protein zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso has relaxed sequence zzso requiring only a single zzso
