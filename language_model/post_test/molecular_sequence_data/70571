As a result of recent zzso sequencing projects as well as detailed zzso molecular genetic and zzso zzso on representative transport zzso we have come to realize that all organisms possess an extensive but limited array of transport protein types that allow the zzso of nutrients and zzso of toxic zzso These proteins fall into zzso families that presumably reflect their evolutionary zzso Some of these families are restricted to a single zzso group of organisms and may have arisen recently in evolutionary time while others are found zzso and may be zzso In this study we conduct systematic zzso analyses of 26 families of transport systems that either had not been characterized previously or were in need of zzso Among the families analyzed are some that are zzso others that are zzso and others that are zzso They can function by either a zzso or a zzso zzso and in the latter case, they are frequently energized by zzso zzso transport to the flux of an zzso down its zzso zzso We zzso the currently zzso members of the 26 families zzso describe the properties of these families, and present partial multiple zzso signature sequences and zzso trees for them zzso
