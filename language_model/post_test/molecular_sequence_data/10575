We report the zzso zzso partial zzso organization, and expression pattern of zzso a novel zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso have been isolated, which are likely to result from alternative zzso The predicted protein sequences exhibit approximately zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso gene products, which are involved in zzso leukemia in zzso mice, and one of the zzso zzso zzso to the recently published zzso sequence zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is identical to that of zzso and is most closely related to those of the zzso zzso gene zzso By in zzso zzso analysis, we show that the zzso gene displays zzso restricted expression patterns in the developing nervous system, zzso face, and in various zzso In adult mice, zzso is mainly expressed in the brain and female zzso zzso with a different distribution of the alternative zzso forms in these zzso
