Increased expression of the zzso resistance gene zzso zzso zzso is a major cause of tumor cell zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso pump to reduce the cellular zzso of specific zzso zzso human breast cancer cells that have been zzso with zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso express high levels of the zzso zzso zzso and exhibit increased resistance to the zzso agent zzso via zzso zzso We have recently discovered that the widely used zzso zzso zzso which is specific for zzso may zzso with zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we have investigated the nature of this zzso 

zzso experiments involving the use of breast cancer cells that express different levels of zzso were performed, and zzso was used for western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed on zzso slides of human breast cancer zzso zzso sequence comparisons and zzso zzso zzso were performed to determine the molecular basis of zzso zzso with zzso 

The zzso of zzso with zzso was demonstrated by both western zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons revealed that zzso recognizes an zzso in zzso zzso zzso that shares sequence zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso recognizes synthetic peptides derived from both the zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso region in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso through a zzso sequence in zzso that is zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso
