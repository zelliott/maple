In the work reported here we have analyzed the role of the zzso factor zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso activity of zzso zzso a domain boundary element from the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso One of the three zzso hypersensitive sites in the zzso boundary, zzso contains multiple zzso sequences for the zzso factor, a protein known to be involved in the formation and/or maintenance of zzso regions of zzso zzso protein has been shown to zzso to the zzso boundary in zzso and we show that it recognizes sequences from zzso in zzso Using two different zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso sites are necessary but not sufficient for full zzso zzso zzso We show that distinct zzso sites are required for different zzso activities at different stages of zzso We also show that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso boundary is sensitive to zzso in the gene zzso the zzso factor zzso
