Previous studies suggested that the zzso zzso portions of inward zzso K channels could contribute significant resistance barriers to zzso zzso To explore this question further, we exchanged portions of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and measured the resulting single-channel zzso zzso the entire zzso zzso of zzso with that of zzso decreased the chord zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso from 34 to 21 zzso The slope zzso measured between zzso and zzso zzso was also reduced from 43 to 31 zzso Analysis of zzso channels suggested that a region between zzso 232 and 275 of zzso contributes to this zzso Within this region, the point zzso zzso zzso in which a single zzso acid was exchanged for the corresponding zzso of zzso reduced the slope zzso to 30 zzso and the chord zzso to 22 zzso mimicking the effects of replacing the entire zzso zzso This zzso had gating and zzso properties indistinguishable from those of the zzso suggesting that the structure of the protein was not zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not affect block of the channel by zzso suggesting that the selectivity filter was not strongly affected by the zzso nor did it change the sensitivity to zzso zzso To test whether the decrease in zzso was independent of the selectivity filter we made the same zzso in the background of zzso in the pore region of the channel that increased single-channel zzso The effects were similar to those predicted for two independent zzso arranged in zzso The zzso increased zzso ratio for zzso accounting for previous observations that the zzso zzso contributed to zzso zzso zzso the location onto the crystal structure of the zzso parts of zzso indicated that position 240 lines the inner wall of this pore and affects the net charge on this zzso This provides a possible structural basis for the observed changes in zzso and suggests that this element of the channel protein forms a zzso barrier for zzso zzso
