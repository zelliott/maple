The gene zzso zzso a major outer membrane protein in zzso species (formerly known as type 1 zzso was thought to be zzso transcribed from a single zzso 70 promoter immediately upstream of the zzso We now report the identification of a novel putative zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso located immediately upstream of zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and show that disruption of this gene significantly reduces zzso zzso In zzso zzso Northern analysis demonstrated that this reduction was a result of an effect on zzso of zzso zzso combined with a polar effect due to termination of a transcript containing zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cell transcripts by primer extension indicated that zzso zzso of zzso occurs from two overlapping zzso one that is zzso and resembles zzso zzso factor promoters in its zzso region and another promoter that is independent of zzso and is analogous to the zzso zzso promoter previously zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso did not resolve the zzso associated with this zzso which included a markedly reduced zzso growth rate in rich medium zzso to that in minimal zzso further reduction of the growth rate in a zzso environment, zzso of an unidentified zzso and increased sensitivity to the zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is involved in the regulation of other genes in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso also had an effect on the zzso growth rate in rich zzso A zzso zzso gene was also identified in a zzso zzso isolate and six zzso zzso clinical zzso zzso these data indicate that an zzso zzso factor plays a role in the regulation and expression of zzso and also affects other zzso
