To characterize properties of zzso a novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was identified in a zzso library of transcripts expressed in the zzso of the rat eye zzso zzso The expression pattern of the zzso gene was studied by Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso zzso interacting with zzso were identified by pull-down zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso of zzso was investigated by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso protein belongs to the zzso zzso of proteins containing the zzso domain in the zzso portion and the zzso domain in the zzso portion of the zzso The zzso gene was specifically expressed in the zzso zzso cells, but not in the zzso zzso and zzso nor in other zzso zzso zzso was also expressed in the zzso In rat zzso and lung zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso heavy zzso 9 were zzso with zzso zzso VI was zzso with zzso from zzso but not lung zzso zzso were the most abundant among zzso zzso zzso interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso was confirmed using pull-down zzso and gel overlay zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso mainly to stress fibers after zzso into zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, complexes of zzso and zzso were zzso located along the zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso like other zzso zzso members, may act as an adapter that directs other proteins to the zzso
