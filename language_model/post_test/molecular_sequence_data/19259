zzso protein zzso zzso signaling plays a central role in zzso zzso stimuli into zzso responses, but its role in zzso plant responses to zzso attack remains largely zzso When zzso zzso larvae attack their host plant, zzso zzso the plant's wound response is reconfigured at zzso zzso and defensive levels due to the introduction of oral zzso zzso into wounds during zzso We show that zzso dramatically amplify zzso zzso activity and that fatty zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso are the zzso zzso gene zzso of salicylic zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso revealed their importance in zzso wound and zzso hormonal responses and zzso regulation of zzso zzso We found that after applying zzso to wounds created in one portion of a zzso zzso is activated in both wounded and specific zzso regions of the leaf but not in zzso connected adjacent zzso We propose that zzso zzso attack elicits a mobile signal that travels to zzso regions of the attacked leaf where it activates zzso signaling and, thus, downstream zzso zzso a different signal is transported by the vascular system to systemic leaves to initiate defense responses without zzso zzso in systemic zzso
