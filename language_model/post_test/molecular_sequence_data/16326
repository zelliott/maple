An expression system was developed for measuring in zzso promoter strength at the single copy level and this system was used to compare the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This system employs zzso zzso activity as a measure of promoter strength and zzso expression for internal copy number zzso zzso fragments are inserted into a cloning zzso and subsequently zzso on to zzso zzso by genetic zzso Single zzso are then prepared and used in zzso zzso The strength of several promoters was determined using this zzso Among the promoters tested, the zzso coli zzso promoter was the zzso it was four times more active than the zzso promoter and about ten times stronger than the zzso and zzso zzso To validate measurement of zzso zzso activity as an indicator of promoter strength, zzso zzso activity was compared with the level of zzso zzso There was excellent correspondence between the two, suggesting that with this system zzso zzso activity accurately reflects promoter zzso We also examined a zzso zzso measuring system in which the zzso zzso lacked a 104 zzso DNA zzso that was present immediately downstream from the zzso site in our preferred zzso We found that the zzso was zzso the transcribed region accompanying a cloned promoter apparently affected zzso zzso efficiency and/or zzso zzso zzso
