The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso N zzso zzso is characterized by the presence, near the zzso end of the zzso of a highly zzso sequence of 10 zzso acids zzso that has been termed the zzso zzso In order to examine the function of this zzso which is predicted to adopt an zzso structure, we have isolated a number of zzso that alter zzso within the box and examined the properties of the zzso N derivatives zzso by zzso Certain zzso that alter charged and potentially exposed zzso within the motif result in zzso inactive proteins with impaired promoter recognition but no impairment in core zzso zzso zzso We therefore suggest that the zzso box could play a direct or indirect role in recognition of the zzso zzso promoter consensus that is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso
