The levels of beta zzso zzso I and II activities in cultured cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Apart from initial experiments with Man zzso alpha zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso I activity was measured with a zzso zzso method using zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso It was shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis that the product obtained with zzso contained a terminal zzso zzso linked beta zzso to the alpha zzso arm of the zzso Compared to the zzso from the human zzso cell line zzso insect cell zzso I exhibited a much higher preference for the zzso zzso The zzso I from zzso cells had apparent zzso and zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and of zzso and zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso When zzso was used as the zzso zzso the levels of zzso I activity in the four insect cell lines ranged between zzso and zzso zzso of cell zzso and thus were comparable to that of zzso zzso Evidence is presented for the dependence of zzso zzso on the presence of terminal zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
