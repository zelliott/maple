We have examined the zzso expression of the zzso breast and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso to investigate its role in the control of cell growth and zzso Specifically, we have zzso zzso expression during embryonic development, in adult zzso and during zzso zzso zzso development, particularly in response to zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is expressed in rapidly zzso cell types undergoing zzso In the zzso zzso zzso expression is induced during zzso pregnancy, and following treatment of zzso animals with 17 zzso and zzso These observations imply that zzso is involved in the processes of proliferation and differentiation in multiple zzso notably in the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso
