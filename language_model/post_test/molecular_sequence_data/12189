T4 zzso V is a DNA repair zzso from zzso T4 that zzso the first reaction step of the zzso zzso base zzso repair zzso The crystal structure of this zzso zzso with a duplex DNA zzso containing a zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A zzso The atomic structure of the complex reveals the unique zzso of the DNA duplex, which exhibits a sharp zzso with a 60 degree inclination at the central zzso zzso The zzso base complementary to the zzso side of the zzso zzso is completely flipped out of the DNA duplex and trapped in a cavity on the protein zzso These structural features allow an understanding of the zzso mechanism and zzso a general mechanism of how other repair zzso recognize damaged DNA zzso
