zzso of zzso DNA from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with restriction zzso zzso releases a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso from both zzso was cloned onto zzso coli zzso zzso Using representative clones as DNA zzso zzso it was found that zzso the zzso fragments zzso zzso a zzso with multiples of zzso zzso was evident in both species after zzso to zzso DNA and zzso the zzso copy number of zzso elements is 150 and 195 for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso zzso and zzso revealed zzso blocks with over zzso zzso No open reading frames are present in either DNA zzso Neither zzso zzso to zzso DNA from zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso element is transcribed into zzso in zzso zzso but, is not transcribed in adult zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso share a zzso zzso zzso moderately repetitive DNA zzso
