We report here the cloning and characterization of human and mouse genes for vascular zzso growth factor C zzso a newly isolated member of the vascular zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso zzso Both zzso genes comprise over 40 zzso pairs of zzso DNA and consist of seven zzso all containing coding zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso is zzso by zzso 3 and zzso zzso 5 and 7 zzso zzso motifs of the type zzso and zzso 6 encodes additional zzso motifs typical of a silk zzso A putative alternatively spliced rare zzso form lacking zzso 4 was identified in human zzso cells, and a major zzso start site was located in the human zzso gene 523 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation zzso The upstream promoter sequences contain zzso putative binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors but no zzso box, and they show promoter activity when zzso into zzso The zzso gene structure is thus assembled from zzso zzso zzso and distinct zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso domain, and it shows both similarities and distinct differences in comparison with other members of the zzso gene zzso
