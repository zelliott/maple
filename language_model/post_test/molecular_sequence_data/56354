We reported previously that an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was capable of zzso growth in human and zzso cells, but not in rat cells zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso in newborn rats and was associated with a reduction of viral protein synthesis to about zzso of zzso virus and an absence of zzso in cultured rat zzso However, the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso accumulated to zzso levels and translated well with a cell free rabbit zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of viral protein synthesis in rat cells in zzso and in zzso but zzso is largely zzso in other types of cells, such as human and zzso zzso To analyze whether the zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso of viral zzso are involved in the regulation by zzso the viral zzso gene was replaced by a reporter zzso zzso zzso in a zzso clone of viral sequences and the protein synthesis under the control of zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso expressing plasmids and subsequently infected with zzso zzso or zzso We were able to mimic the zzso in expression that we observed in cultured cells and animals with virus zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso rat cells was about zzso lower than that in zzso rat cells, but only zzso lower or less in zzso human cells and zzso cells compared to zzso zzso These results are consistent with our previous data that zzso has a zzso zzso in the natural host of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences from zzso transcripts reduced the overall zzso expression but expression was zzso independent, whereas deletion of the terminal 3' zzso sequences of viral zzso reduced zzso expression in rat zzso These results suggest that the regulation of viral protein synthesis by zzso depends on zzso sequences in the 3' zzso
