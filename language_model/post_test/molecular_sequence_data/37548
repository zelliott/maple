The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso is able to zzso molecular nitrogen zzso as its sole nitrogen zzso We have identified and characterized a single nitrogen fixation zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso with an approximate length of 9 zzso zzso analysis revealed seven genes with sequence similarities to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar to other zzso zzso and certain bacteria such as zzso zzso with the two zzso genes zzso and zzso located between zzso and zzso zzso analysis of deduced zzso acid sequences for the zzso structural genes of zzso zzso zzso showed that they are most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and also closely resemble those for the corresponding zzso products of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso genes constitute an zzso transcribed only under nitrogen zzso as a single 8 zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso sequence at the zzso start site in front of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which may have a function in zzso regulation of the zzso zzso
