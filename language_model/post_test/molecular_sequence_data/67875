zzso the zzso of influenza infection is a key factor leading to the prevention and control of future zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso infection, although frequently mild, led to a severe and fatal form of disease in certain cases that make its zzso nature zzso Much effort has been made toward explaining the zzso of disease zzso however, no absolute reason has been zzso 

This study presents the zzso zzso of clinically similar strains of pandemic 2009 influenza virus in human zzso zzso cells and zzso The viruses were obtained from patients who were admitted in a local hospital in China with a similar course of infection and zzso The zzso and zzso viruses showed efficient replication and high zzso in mice while infection with zzso was not lethal with impaired viral zzso minimal pathology and modest zzso activity in zzso zzso analysis displayed prominent differences between zzso zzso zzso and zzso of viral zzso that might correlate with their different zzso zzso 

The study confirms that biological zzso linked with the extent of viral zzso exists among pandemic zzso strains that may serve as a benchmark for future investigations on influenza zzso
