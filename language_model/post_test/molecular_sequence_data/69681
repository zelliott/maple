Brain zzso A, a zzso zzso has been considered a zzso because it is activated by zzso and inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso The understanding of the unique specificity of zzso A was useful for the synthesis of affinity labeling compounds containing as a zzso zzso group the zzso group into zzso peptides which are among the best zzso and competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso Of the ten compounds tested, only peptides containing 8 to 13 zzso acid zzso caused irreversible zzso The fact that the most effective zzso had the zzso group either at the zzso or at zzso position zzso of Schechter and zzso would seem to argue that the zzso zzso is in the vicinity of the active site, or actually involved in the zzso zzso
