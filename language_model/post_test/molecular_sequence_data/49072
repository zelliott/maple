zzso zzso is one of 19 active genes in the common eliminated region 1 at zzso identified by zzso zzso was zzso into mouse zzso zzso Fourteen severe combined zzso zzso derived tumors from two zzso based artificial zzso zzso containing the entire zzso gene and two zzso zzso were analyzed by real time zzso chain reaction at the DNA and zzso zzso Following zzso tumor passage, zzso expression was decreased or zzso in all tumors although DNA levels did not change zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso of the zzso site may be responsible for human zzso zzso in mouse zzso derived zzso
