The zzso factor binding sequences in the zzso region of zzso zzso virus zzso have been determined by gel zzso zzso using zzso synthetic zzso The results indicate that the factor, zzso specifically binds to sequences zzso and zzso which are localized between zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso This factor is present at elevated levels in avian zzso cells compared to mouse zzso and rat 2 zzso zzso zzso binds to a sequence that is similar or identical to the sequence recognized by rat liver zzso However, the two proteins are different as judged by three criteria: zzso the zzso complex zzso slightly faster than the zzso complex; zzso zzso against zzso neither inhibit binding of zzso nor form a zzso which zzso slower than the complex formed with the factor alone; and zzso zzso is heat zzso whereas zzso is heat zzso Another factor, zzso which binds to a sequence from zzso to zzso in the zzso region is also detected mainly in zzso cells but not in mouse or rat zzso These results suggest that different zzso factors interact with different zzso regulatory sequences in the zzso region of zzso zzso
