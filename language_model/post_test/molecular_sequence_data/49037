A search for zzso zzso of protein zzso led to the identification of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that had the potential to code for an zzso protein and hence named zzso The zzso was virtually identical to its zzso zzso counterpart in gene structure and protein zzso The zzso coding sequence contained two zzso and the predicted protein contained zzso zzso acid zzso Its primary structure showed significant similarity to zzso proteins of the zzso and zzso that included two zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso 2A zzso namely zzso and zzso Like the zzso and zzso zzso it had an extremely zzso zzso The zzso was confirmed by zzso expression in zzso Native zzso zzso was zzso and was found to be highly zzso zzso specifically inhibited the zzso zzso at zzso zzso with no effect on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to elevated zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso factors zzso and zzso zzso These functional properties are also characteristic of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and protein were zzso in all the zzso asexual stages of the zzso and the protein was located mainly in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a unique zzso member of the zzso and a candidate zzso regulator of the zzso zzso
