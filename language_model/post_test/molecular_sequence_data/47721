zzso is one of the factors regulating zzso cell zzso and zzso evidence supports its involvement in the development of zzso In this study, we identified a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and we studied their involvement in zzso zzso 

zzso were characterized in membrane preparations and intact zzso cells by zzso zzso using zzso and zzso as specific zzso for zzso and zzso respectively, and by Western zzso zzso The expression of a zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso experiments and Western zzso zzso cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso was largely zzso in zzso cells, accounting for approximately zzso of the total zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was transported into zzso cells by a zzso zzso system zzso 310 zzso 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying the pharmacological properties of a zzso zzso The expression of a zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso zzso activity measured in intact cells showed that after zzso into zzso cells, zzso was zzso by zzso Finally, zzso zzso cell proliferation was significantly increased after irreversible zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso concentration and function in zzso may be regulated in part by its transport into zzso cells and degradation by zzso
