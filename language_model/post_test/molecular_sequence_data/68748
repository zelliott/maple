We have cloned a full length complementary DNA zzso of the zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso gene and expressed it in zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells was reverse transcribed with a specific zzso zzso primer to generate a single stranded zzso which was subsequently amplified by the zzso chain reaction utilizing an additional zzso specific sense zzso The resulting double stranded zzso was introduced into the zzso expression zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of the zzso cells using a standard zzso zzso or a zzso zzso The activity was zinc zzso as expected for a gene controlled by a zzso zzso The zzso was not lowered by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not human zzso and a broad zzso band of 17-19 zzso was detected using an zzso zzso serum suitable for zzso This newly developed tool will allow us to investigate the role of zzso in zzso of viral infections and zzso zzso
