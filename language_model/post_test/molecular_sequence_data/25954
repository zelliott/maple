The structural and dynamic aspects of the interaction of the zzso containing zzso zzso with an zzso were studied by high field zzso zzso Complete assignment of the zzso zzso of zzso 1 was accomplished by zzso zzso The zzso chemical shifts and zzso cross zzso in the zzso map of the zzso complex of zzso zzso and zzso reveal that the zzso ring of the zzso zzso zzso between zzso bases and the rest of the zzso resides in the minor groove of the AT rich core of zzso thus occupying the zzso sequence on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the drug has been detected by the presence of zzso zzso both in the major and the minor groove of the zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso between base zzso and zzso zzso suggested local unwinding of the binding site on the zzso From zzso and zzso methods of zzso it was established that the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is projecting into the major groove towards zzso while the zzso zzso lies in the minor groove towards the zzso base pairs of the opposite zzso The expected zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso in the zzso complex exists in a right handed zzso The presence of exchange signals along the binding site zzso indicated an exchange of the bound drug process wherein the rate of exchange between the two equivalent sites was estimated to be zzso to 130 zzso at 30 degrees C and with delta G degrees of zzso zzso zzso Force field and zzso calculations permitted a rationalization of the zzso observed binding mode in terms of preferred zzso of the zzso and repeat length in zzso compared with the DNA zzso
