zzso zzso and zzso zzso cause malaria, so proteins essential for their survival in zzso are potential zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the irreversible conversion of zzso into zzso and play a critical role in the zzso salvage pathways of zzso and their zzso zzso Currently, the number of selective zzso of zzso zzso is zzso One potent and widely used inhibitor of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a very weak inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds are thus excluded from consideration as potential zzso of zzso zzso in zzso However, zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we applied zzso molecular modeling to identify zzso recognition mechanisms unique to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our zzso experiments show that zzso is at least zzso more potent against zzso zzso zzso than against zzso The zzso zzso zzso is bound even more tightly zzso zzso These results improve our understanding of the mechanisms of zzso zzso recognition and zzso and facilitate the rational design of novel zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso To demonstrate a practical application of our findings we have zzso predicted a novel potential inhibitor of zzso that will not interact with the human zzso
