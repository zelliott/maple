The hairpin zzso is a small, naturally occurring zzso capable of folding into a distinct three-dimensional structure and catalyzing a specific zzso transfer zzso We have adapted a high zzso screening procedure entitled zzso analog interference mapping zzso to identify functional groups important for proper folding and zzso of this zzso A total of 18 zzso zzso zzso were used to determine the contribution made by individual zzso zzso and zzso functional groups to the hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso disrupted activity at six sites within the zzso and a unique interference pattern was observed at each of the 11 zzso zzso zzso In most cases where such information is available, the zzso data agree with the previously reported zzso substitution zzso The interference patterns are interpreted in comparison to the isolated loop A and loop B zzso structures and a model of the intact zzso These data provide zzso evidence in support of many, but not all, of the zzso zzso observed by zzso in each loop, and identify the functional groups most likely to participate in the zzso interface between loop A and loop zzso These groups include the zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and the minor groove edge of A9 and zzso The data also predict zzso form sugar zzso geometry at zzso and zzso Based upon these results, a revised model for the loop A zzso interaction with loop B is zzso This work defines the chemical basis of zzso zzso conservation in the hairpin zzso and provides a basis for the design and interpretation of interference suppression zzso
