The genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4 zzso have been cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formerly designated zzso zzso The gene arrangement was found to be similar to that reported in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA and derived protein sequences were compared to zzso and the other zzso zzso By zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso were found to be located on separate, zzso Not zzso DNA zzso The zzso zzso was found on the third largest Not I zzso zzso while the zzso zzso was found on the second largest Not I zzso zzso These results suggest the two zzso are not in zzso The zzso zzso transcript was shown to be zzso zzso from cells grown under constant zzso showed a decrease in zzso transcript levels to zzso levels within 2 h after the cells were placed in the zzso Upon zzso transcript levels rose to zzso over that seen initially under constant zzso
