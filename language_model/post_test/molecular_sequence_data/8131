The zzso zzso a potential tumor zzso zzso has recently been cloned and identified as a zzso zzso and an inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso zzso We undertook this study to investigate the possible role of the zzso gene in human zzso zzso zzso normal and cancer zzso from 18 patients with prostate cancer were screened for zzso zzso by zzso reverse zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso bands from three zzso but not the matched normal zzso were zzso zzso direct DNA sequencing of the zzso fragments identified four sequence zzso including a zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to A transition and two A zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso of the zzso gene occur and may be important during the zzso of human prostate zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso in a primary human zzso
