zzso zzso zzso comprise a class of zzso antioxidants zzso only in plants, algae, and some zzso The majority of zzso in zzso cells is in the alpha form, which has the highest vitamin E activity in humans, whereas the zzso zzso and delta forms normally account for a small percentage of total zzso The zzso activities of these forms of zzso differ depending on the experimental system, and their relative activities in zzso are zzso In a screen for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso double zzso of zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso lacking zzso but instead accumulating zzso The zzso zzso contains a zzso in the zzso of a zzso zzso gene found in zzso The zzso zzso zzso triple zzso with zzso survived better under zzso stress than did the zzso zzso zzso but the zzso zzso on its own did not have an obvious zzso Following transfer from low light to high light, the triple zzso showed a higher efficiency of zzso II, a higher level of cell zzso and a lower level of zzso zzso a marker for zzso stress, than did the zzso zzso zzso After zzso transfer, the level of the zzso II reaction center zzso zzso was also higher in the zzso zzso zzso zzso but the rate of D1 zzso was not significantly different from that of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the replacement of zzso by zzso in a zzso strain of zzso zzso contributes to better survival under conditions of zzso zzso
