zzso of a new type of slowly growing zzso zzso zzso were isolated repeatedly from zzso zzso true zzso and soil in zzso These strains grew at 22, 31, and 37 degrees C but not at 45 degrees C and possessed acid zzso and zzso zzso They reduced zzso tolerated zzso zzso did not split zzso and were resistant to most of the zzso drugs tested, except zzso They did not form acid from zzso and zzso Their internal zzso similarity was zzso zzso zzso The whole zzso pattern confirmed the zzso of the zzso sharing similar zzso types with several other zzso zzso However, on the basis of the nature of the major zzso zzso the zzso appeared zzso The zzso analysis based on evolutionary distance values revealed that the strains belong to a new species of slowly growing zzso The zzso zzso values confirmed that these strains differ significantly from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The strains produced a unique zzso zzso and were zzso for mice, guinea zzso and zzso but they provoked a zzso hypersensitivity reaction to bovine zzso in guinea pigs and zzso zzso they are considered a member of a new species of zzso slowly growing zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso 11 is the type strain, a culture of which has been deposited in the American Type Culture Collection as strain zzso zzso
