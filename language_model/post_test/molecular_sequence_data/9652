A zzso for the zzso zzso DNA binding protein was cloned from a library of the human gastric zzso cell line zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence zzso zzso indicates that the primary structure of human zzso is highly zzso to that of the rat zzso The potential zzso site for protein zzso (A and zzso and zzso and zzso clusters are zzso Whereas the rat zzso alpha and beta zzso genes have two and three zzso protein binding sites in their promoter regions, respectively, the human alpha zzso gene has only one binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned the zzso region of the human zzso beta zzso gene by zzso walking and found that it also has a single zzso protein binding site near the zzso zzso The zzso sites of the human alpha and beta zzso genes are recognized by the zinc finger domain of human zzso The conservation of the zzso protein binding sites suggests that they are important for the gene regulation of the human and rat zzso
