zzso zzso virus zzso zzso an zzso syndrome similar to human zzso Although the disease course of zzso zzso is generally measured in months to years, a disease syndrome that results in death in 5 to 14 days has been described in zzso zzso infected with the zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to derive an acutely lethal zzso molecular clone in order to study viral genes involved in zzso Six infectious molecular clones were zzso acutely fatal disease was induced by experimental zzso of zzso zzso with virus stocks derived from either of two zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were constructed by exchange of regions of the zzso of zzso and a nonlethal, related zzso zzso Only a zzso expressing the zzso zzso under the control of a zzso long terminal repeat induced death soon after zzso These studies suggest that multiple viral genes of zzso are critical for development of acute zzso More specifically, the zzso gene but not the long terminal repeat zzso was required for acute disease zzso however zzso must act in concert with another zzso of the zzso zzso
