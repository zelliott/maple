Satellite zzso depend for their zzso on the zzso of a host cell by a helper virus which can itself multiply independently of the zzso Four types of satellite zzso have been distinguished on the basis of the size of the zzso and what sort, if any, of protein they zzso One of them, the zzso comprises relatively large zzso which are zzso zzso for zzso zzso Many of these satellites are typified by having zzso as helper zzso In general, the presence of zzso zzso satellites in a virus culture causes little or no modification to the symptoms of infection by the helper virus and has little effect on its zzso Some satellites appear to be highly specific to a strain of helper virus but others can be helped by zzso zzso The proteins zzso by zzso zzso satellites have a zzso of 38,000 to zzso and are relatively zzso in particular in the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso However, there is little similarity in zzso acid sequence between proteins zzso by different satellites and no zzso motif could be found in all satellite zzso The results of reverse zzso experiments with satellites suggest that the zzso protein is essential for the zzso of the satellite zzso This system has considerable potential for the study of the mechanisms of replication both of satellite and helper virus zzso
