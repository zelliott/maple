zzso B, an zzso agent that interferes with the synthesis of zzso cell wall zzso was used to isolate resistant zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The resistance to zzso B always zzso as a zzso character that defines a single zzso group in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of several kinetic parameters of zzso zzso activity revealed no differences between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains except in the 50% zzso concentration for zzso B of the zzso (about a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity of both zzso after in zzso treatment with the zzso agent showed that zzso zzso were more resistant than the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso into soluble and particulate zzso and subsequent zzso indicated that the resistance character of zzso zzso resides in the particulate fraction of the zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso from zzso zzso revealed a gene identical to others recently reported zzso zzso zzso and zzso Its disruption leads to reduced levels of both zzso zzso activity and the zzso cell wall zzso zzso containing the zzso gene reverse the zzso in zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is probably part of the zzso zzso zzso
