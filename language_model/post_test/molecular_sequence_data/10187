To zzso the spatial and zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

4 female and 4 male Large White zzso 

We examined zzso expression in various zzso excised from the zzso using northern zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso were raised in rabbits and were used along with zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso 

High amounts of zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso This distribution is consistent with that of zzso zzso examined by zzso In female zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration increased remarkably in the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso then significantly decreased at day 21 after zzso Furthermore, specific zzso for zzso was observed in the zzso cells of the gastrointestinal tract of female zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso muscles, heart, brain, zzso or liver of zzso female zzso or in the zzso of male zzso 

Gene expression of zzso zzso is closely related to zzso in the zzso zzso Distribution of zzso in the zzso suggests that zzso may have a regulatory role in development of the zzso tract of male zzso
