zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso mainly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso exhibit different infection zzso in cabbage zzso zzso zzso and Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso were constructed from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso virus derived from infections with zzso induced systemic zzso and zzso symptoms in infected cabbage, but no systemic infection in zzso zzso derived from plants infected with zzso induced a mild zzso zzso in cabbage and infected zzso zzso to induce mosaic zzso By exchanging zzso fragments between the two virus zzso the zzso region was shown to be responsible for systemic infection by zzso and the symptoms it zzso in cabbage and zzso Moreover, exchanges of smaller parts of the zzso region resulted in zzso that induced complex infection zzso especially the combination of zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso zzso Analysis by tissue zzso of the zzso leaves showed that the zzso of zzso viruses differed from those of the parents, and that the origin of the zzso components affected not only virus zzso but also long-distance zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is an important factor in the infection cycle of zzso and in determining the host range of this and perhaps other zzso
