zzso of zzso zzso a prawn zzso have demonstrated multiple zzso resistance to commonly used zzso agents, such as zzso In this paper, we describe the cloning and characterization of two zzso resistance zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The first resistance zzso cloned as a zzso fragment, was identical to zzso and zzso sequences zzso on zzso zzso from zzso zzso The second zzso cloned as a zzso zzso in zzso contains two open reading zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that was predicted to have nine zzso zzso It is a novel protein which has no zzso to any other drug resistance protein but has low levels of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso were required for zzso resistance in a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso coli carrying zzso and zzso can function as an zzso zzso zzso pump but is less efficient than zzso
