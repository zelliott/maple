How zzso proteins recognize their specific sites on DNA remains zzso particularly for proteins that use indirect zzso which relies on zzso variations in DNA zzso The question remains as to whether the protein zzso the DNA zzso zzso or, zzso zzso DNA zzso are zzso accessible, which the protein captures to form the specific complex zzso zzso To distinguish between these mechanisms requires characterization of reaction zzso and, in particular, snapshots of the transition state along the recognition zzso We present such a zzso from zzso of DNA zzso dynamics in complex with zzso coli integration host factor zzso an architectural protein that zzso specific sites on zzso in a zzso by creating two sharp zzso in zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso in response to laser zzso zzso monitor DNA zzso We find that nicks or zzso that enhance DNA flexibility at the site of the zzso show 3- to zzso increase in DNA zzso rates that reflect a zzso to zzso increase in binding zzso while sequence modifications away from the zzso sites, as well as zzso in zzso designed to destabilize the complex, have negligible effect on DNA zzso rates despite zzso decrease in binding zzso These results support the scenario that the bottleneck in the recognition step for zzso is spontaneous zzso of zzso DNA to adopt a partially zzso zzso and point to zzso capture as the underlying mechanism of initial recognition, with additional zzso zzso occurring after the transition zzso
