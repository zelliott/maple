zzso zzso channels that provide protection against zzso shock are found in the zzso of organisms from the three zzso of life: bacteria, zzso and zzso Two families of ubiquitous zzso channels are zzso and these have been designated the zzso and zzso zzso A high-resolution X-ray zzso structure is available for a member of the zzso family, and extensive molecular zzso zzso and zzso studies conducted in many laboratories have allowed zzso of a gating mechanism allowing the zzso of a tightly closed state and an open state that controls zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso channel zzso which are of uniform zzso the much larger zzso family includes protein members with zzso that are predicted to vary from 3 to 11 zzso zzso segments zzso per zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal that the three zzso zzso of zzso channel proteins are zzso among family members and that the third of these three zzso exhibits a zzso motif that is shared by the zzso zzso zzso 1) of the zzso zzso We propose that this zzso zzso in zzso family zzso serves as the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso pattern for the putative zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso family proteins suggests a common structural organization, gating zzso and evolutionary zzso
