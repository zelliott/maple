Here is described the isolation of a naturally occurring zzso inclusion body zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso virus zzso obtained from a zzso outbreak in zzso The isolated virus was identified and characterized as an zzso by conventional zzso zzso characterization of the virus was done by DNA zzso using zzso virus zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso genes such as zzso growth factor, zzso zzso and zzso were amplified by zzso and zzso All sequences presented high similarity to zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso were constructed for comparison with other zzso zzso clustered consistently with zzso zzso Attempts to amplify the ATI gene zzso by zzso currently used to identify zzso were zzso zzso presented here suggest that most of the zzso gene is deleted in the zzso zzso
