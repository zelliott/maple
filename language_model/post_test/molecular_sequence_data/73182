In higher plants, light enhances the activity of zzso zzso via a cascade of zzso zzso We have examined the structural and functional role of seven zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso After zzso of zzso coli cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso mainly in the zzso fraction whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso preparations of the latter zzso zzso zzso at similar rates in the presence of 10 zzso zzso but only zzso zzso and zzso zzso were both efficient zzso at 1 zzso zzso and nearly insensitive to zzso These results demonstrate the contribution of zzso and zzso to the stability of the zzso and the participation of zzso zzso and zzso in the reductive process responsive of the zzso zzso Given that zzso at zzso and zzso neither destabilize the zzso nor affect the reductive zzso their function remains zzso
