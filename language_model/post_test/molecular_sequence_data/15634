How the crowded environment inside cells affects zzso stability and structures of proteins is a vital question, since most proteins are made and function inside zzso Here we describe how crowded conditions can be created in zzso and in zzso and how we have used this to probe effects on protein zzso We have found that folded forms of proteins become more compact in the presence of zzso crowding zzso if the protein is zzso the shape also changes zzso dictated by zzso stability and chemical zzso It was also discovered that the shape of the zzso crowding agent zzso the folding mechanism of a zzso in addition, the extent of zzso of the protein itself is an important factor in defining its folding zzso
