zzso is an zzso protein toxin zzso 107 zzso zzso by zzso coli that acts at the level of the plasma zzso of target zzso zzso The nature of the toxin interaction with the membrane is not known at present, although it has been established that zzso binding is not zzso In this work, we have studied the zzso produced by zzso zzso on pure zzso zzso in the form of large zzso zzso under conditions in which the toxin has been shown to induce zzso zzso The zzso systems containing bound protein have been examined by differential scanning zzso zzso zzso differential zzso by zzso zzso and zzso electron zzso All the data zzso in indicating that zzso under conditions leading to cell zzso becomes inserted in the target membrane in the way of intrinsic or integral zzso In addition, the experimental results support the idea that inserted zzso occupies only one of the membrane zzso zzso zzso it is not a zzso zzso The experimental data are zzso by structure prediction studies according to which as many as ten zzso zzso appropriate for zzso interaction, but no zzso zzso zzso are predicted in zzso These observations and predictions have important consequences for the mechanism of cell zzso by zzso in particular, a zzso arrangement of the toxin in the target membrane is not compatible with the concept of zzso as a zzso zzso
