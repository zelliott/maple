The origins of the beta cardiac zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso that cause familial zzso zzso zzso in 14 families have been zzso Of eight different zzso four were present in single families, while four occurred in two or more zzso To investigate the origins of the four shared zzso we defined the beta cardiac zzso zzso of each of the zzso zzso by determining the zzso present at three zzso zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso have arisen independently in each of three families, being found on different zzso zzso A third zzso zzso is associated with identical zzso in two families with Portuguese ancestors, suggesting a founder zzso zzso analysis was zzso for the fourth zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso have arisen independently in at least 12 of the 14 families zzso suggesting that the majority have arisen relatively recently as new zzso This finding predicts the prevalence of zzso beta cardiac zzso zzso to be comparable in all population zzso
