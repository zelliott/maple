zzso cancer is one of the most common zzso tumors of the gastrointestinal zzso However, the molecular pathways involved in the regulation of gastric zzso are not completely zzso In the last decade, basic cancer research has been focused on the deregulation of zzso as a central event in the process of zzso zzso and zzso are regulators of zzso and have been implicated in the development of gastric zzso The aim of the present study was to compare the expression of zzso and protein for zzso and zzso in the gastric cancer and in the cancer margin with that in normal human gastric zzso Fifteen patients with advanced gastric cancer (all zzso zzso and 15 matched control subjects with normal gastric zzso were included in this zzso The zzso specimens for zzso and for molecular analyses were taken from gastric zzso tumor surrounding gastric zzso and in normal patients from the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was very weak, but zzso in the normal gastric zzso However, at the protein level, no expression for zzso was detected in the normal gastric zzso In the biopsy specimens from tumor and surrounding gastric zzso a significant increase in zzso zzso and protein expression was zzso The expression of zzso was higher in the tumor than in the tumor zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso was detected in the gastric zzso of normal zzso In gastric cancer only the expression of zzso was observed, while the expression of active zzso was completely zzso In the gastric zzso surrounding gastric cancer, no gene and protein expression for zzso was zzso We conclude that the changes in the level of zzso and zzso play an important role in the transformation from normal gastric zzso to gastric zzso
