The zzso zzso zzso is used widely for zzso zzso Recent studies show that zzso base changes zzso in the secondary structure of zzso correlate with genetic zzso between zzso zzso zzso consists of genetically incompatible strain groups zzso groups, zzso distinguished by lack of zzso between zzso of zzso zzso analysis of internal transcribed zzso zzso sequences shows a strong correlation with AG zzso In this study, ITS sequences were zzso according to the zzso zzso and zzso regions which interact during zzso One or two zzso were detected between the zzso secondary structure of zzso potato strains as compared to zzso tobacco zzso and between these two strains and all other zzso When a zzso zzso species related to zzso was compared to the zzso of zzso zzso which were zzso zzso zzso per zzso 1-3 zzso were zzso The zzso in potato strains of zzso distinguish them from zzso tobacco strains and other zzso yielding further evidence that the potato strains of zzso originally described as zzso zzso are a species distinct from other zzso The zzso sequences were analyzed by direct sequencing of zzso products from 497 strains of zzso isolated from zzso The same 10 and 4 positions in zzso and zzso respectively, contained zzso in 425 strains zzso Nine different zzso ITS sequences zzso could be detected in a single strain by sequencing cloned zzso products indicating that concerted evolution had not zzso the zzso zzso in many zzso zzso zzso the sequence zzso did not affect the secondary structure of zzso and zzso in zzso
