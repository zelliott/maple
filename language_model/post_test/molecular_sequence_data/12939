We report on the cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from higher zzso The complete sequence of the zzso zzso was obtained after rapid amplification of zzso ends and comprises a putative zzso transit zzso zzso amplified from leaf or root zzso zzso are zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is subject to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso But when the zzso zzso is compared to a zzso zzso none of the zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso was used to raise zzso in zzso Gene expression was studied in potato zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein levels, revealing different patterns for the zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso was transcribed in all zzso tested, and the highest zzso was detected in zzso In contrast, expression of the gene zzso the zzso zzso was confined to green zzso zzso of leaves resulted in a slight increase in the expression of the gene zzso the zzso zzso and a shutdown of the zzso zzso Compared to the situation in soil, elevated zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso is found in roots of zzso grown potato plants, which is in agreement with the zzso role for this zzso in zzso zzso
