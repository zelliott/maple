The mechanism of entry of zzso virus zzso into cells is still a poorly understood zzso A zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso in the envelope of zzso mature virus zzso has been implicated in zzso attachment, zzso fusion, and virus release from zzso We have previously described the structural organization of the zzso zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso region responsible for zzso formation and a predicted zzso zzso third alpha zzso with an important role in the interaction with a zzso membrane protein zzso by the zzso zzso thought to anchor the zzso protein to the envelope of zzso zzso zzso zzso Rivas, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Esteban, zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify the functional zzso important for virus entry and release, we have generated zzso zzso containing a copy of the zzso gene regulated by the zzso zzso system of zzso coli zzso in the zzso zzso locus and a zzso form of the zzso gene in the zzso locus but expressed zzso under the control of an zzso zzso zzso zzso infected with a zzso zzso that expresses a zzso zzso form lacking the first 29 zzso acids at the N zzso failed to form zzso enveloped virus zzso zzso zzso with zzso virus confirmed that the fusion process was zzso by the zzso protein and the fusion domain to be contained within zzso acids 29 to 43 of the zzso zzso Competitive zzso of the infection process with soluble zzso and synthetic peptides and in zzso experiments with zzso zzso proteins identified the zzso binding domain within zzso acids 21 to 33, suggesting that this domain is involved in zzso binding via zzso zzso Thus, the N zzso of the zzso protein contains a zzso binding domain, a fusion domain, and a domain responsible for interacting with proteins or lipids in the zzso stacks for zzso formation and virus zzso
