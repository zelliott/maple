Duplex DNA zzso zzso (32 base zzso were prepared that contained a single zzso zzso zzso at a specific zzso or zzso site in either one or both zzso These zzso were inserted into zzso zzso form viral DNA, and the DNA from progeny virus generated by zzso of zzso coli was examined by sequence analysis at the site of zzso zzso With zzso zzso and with zzso containing only one zzso zzso no sequence zzso were found in progeny viral zzso With zzso containing two zzso zzso one in each strand and closely zzso some progeny zzso showed the original zzso zzso whereas others exhibited large deletions and illegitimate zzso zzso both of which removed the damaged zzso zzso the distance between zzso zzso in the construct reduced the frequency of zzso zzso These sequence zzso occurred in both zzso and zzso host zzso We speculate that the closely spaced zzso in opposite construct strands cause a rare distortion in DNA structure, which activates the zzso machinery, and that zzso and zzso agents other than zzso aromatic zzso may cause similar DNA zzso which induce illegitimate zzso
