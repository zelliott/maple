zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso fragments originated from zzso patients revealed novel zzso Two rare zzso were found in a zzso non-Jewish zzso zzso a zzso transition zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the active gene and a zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso These zzso were not found in any other zzso A zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso was identified in two non-Jewish patients, and was designated zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso One zzso zzso designated zzso contained four zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso a zzso transition at zzso zzso zzso creating a new zzso site zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso 456 zzso and zzso a zzso zzso at zzso acid zzso 460 zzso zzso not associated with any zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that at least part of zzso 9, zzso 9 and zzso 10 of the zzso gene derived from the zzso The other zzso zzso designated zzso contained a zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 456 and 460 described zzso at least zzso 10 of this gene originated from the zzso We zzso that the presence of the zzso close to the active gene causes transfer of zzso into the active gene via gene conversion or zzso zzso thus accounting for the high frequency of zzso observed in the zzso zzso
