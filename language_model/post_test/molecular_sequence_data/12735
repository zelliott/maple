We establish that the zzso binding protein zzso in the presence of zzso recognizes the zzso box in zzso DNA dependent on the zzso of the zzso tails of the core zzso from the zzso and the position of the zzso box within the zzso We examine zzso access to the zzso box with this sequence placed in four distinct zzso frames with reference to the zzso surface and at three distinct zzso positions at the edge, side and zzso axis of the zzso Under our experimental conditions, we find that the preferential zzso position at which zzso can bind the zzso box is within zzso DNA at the edge of the zzso and that binding is facilitated if contacts made by the zzso tails of the zzso with zzso DNA are zzso zzso binding to DNA at the edge of the zzso occurs with the zzso box in all four zzso zzso This is indicative of zzso association directing the zzso of the zzso box from the surface of the zzso zzso
