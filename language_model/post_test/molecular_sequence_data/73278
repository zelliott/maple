In order to design zzso zzso with improved zzso properties, zzso proteins with both zzso and zzso activity were constructed by fusing a zzso zzso itself comprises four zzso zzso 1, a motif directed to zzso active site, zzso 2 and a zzso of zzso which binds to the zzso site of zzso In order to improve further the zzso activity, the zzso domain was modified by substituting zzso zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso about a zzso increase in zzso activity in protein zzso compared with the parent zzso zzso carrying an zzso zzso The increase in zzso activity was also reflected in the shift of the Ki value from 159 zzso 20 zzso for zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The increased zzso activity of zzso may be due to the presence of an zzso in the zzso from the zzso zzso which may interact with one of two zzso acid zzso located at the exit of the zzso zzso binding zzso This explanation is supported by the observation that another zzso zzso carrying a zzso sequence with two zzso zzso has relatively weak zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso may be strong enough to substitute zzso zzso during zzso zzso
