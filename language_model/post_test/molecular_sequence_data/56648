We zzso peptides of the general formula zzso zzso and zzso These agents inhibited the zzso binding of zzso to zzso and the binding of zzso to zzso This zzso activity was zzso to the number of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso to which the sequence of zzso zzso had been added at the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso with an zzso sequence were found to block the binding of zzso to zzso zzso These findings indicate that the general zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso sequence inhibit the binding of zzso to activated zzso as well as the binding of zzso to zzso Thus, these peptides may behave as zzso zzso zzso
