The crystal structure at zzso A of the zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso with zzso has been zzso The zzso is a zzso with a molecular weight of 94 zzso and belongs to the class II of zzso zzso zzso The zzso unit is composed of two zzso Each zzso consists of two zzso The zzso zzso core domain contains a zzso zzso zzso sitting on two zzso which can be zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso from zzso zzso with a zzso difference on the C alpha atoms of zzso zzso The active sites of all four zzso are occupied by zzso which apparently forms during zzso The 100 zzso zzso zzso domain resembles half of a zzso and provides an independent domain oriented to contact the zzso stem and part of the zzso loop of zzso The modular domain organization of zzso zzso reiterates a repeated theme in zzso and its structure should provide insight into the ability of certain zzso to zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
