The adrenal zzso cell is a major site of action of zzso II zzso which binds to zzso receptors to stimulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the subsequent production of zzso All also influences adrenal growth and proliferation and promotes zzso incorporation in zzso zzso In primary cultures of bovine zzso cells, zzso was found to induce the expression of several early growth response genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This effect of zzso was zzso and was blocked by zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that it is zzso by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso in zzso cells, was a relatively weak zzso of zzso expression but was as potent as zzso in stimulating the expression of zzso zzso did not further enhance the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso zzso increase in generating the zzso response was suggested by the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as well as the stimulation of zzso influx by zzso with zzso were less potent stimuli of zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso which zzso the plateau phase of the zzso zzso signal without affecting the early increase due to zzso zzso enhanced the early phase of the zzso zzso response, indicating that zzso also has an zzso effect on the early gene zzso zzso of protein zzso C by zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso but the combination of zzso and zzso did not further increase the zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C by zzso or its depletion by prolonged exposure to zzso prevented the zzso response to zzso but only partially inhibited the response to zzso suggesting the involvement of other factors in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
