The structural zzso of free zzso A and deep rough zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso coli strain zzso was characterized by zzso transform infrared zzso zzso For this, the beta zzso alpha phase states and the three-dimensional zzso structures, the latter deduced from zzso zzso radiation zzso zzso were investigated at different water zzso zzso zzso and zzso The analysis of the zzso data for zzso originating from the zzso zzso shows that the beta zzso alpha zzso chain melting is strongly expressed only for the stretching and zzso modes of the zzso zzso zzso groups originating from the interface region sense the zzso chain melting well zzso zzso zzso or only zzso zzso zzso and those resulting from the pure polar zzso not at zzso From the zzso data, the existence of zzso zzso different zzso and, for zzso A and zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso structures could be proven in the temperature range zzso degrees C with cubic zzso cubic and cubic zzso zzso transitions for the zzso and L zzso zzso transitions for the zzso zzso These structural transitions can be characterized most readily by specific changes of the zzso bands resulting from the interface zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The magnitude of the changes zzso to that of the structural zzso zzso is highest for the L zzso zzso lower for the cubic zzso zzso and lowest for the cubic zzso cubic zzso The structural transitions are only marginally expressed for zzso bands of the zzso zzso Similarly, the band contours of zzso from the zzso region are no indicators of the structural zzso except for the zzso bands of zzso zzso Particularly the stretching zzso of the zzso groups are nearly completely zzso the absolute values of their half zzso however, differ significantly for zzso A and zzso zzso which seems to be of biological zzso The ability of zzso zzso to detect zzso changes also beyond the zzso by zzso zzso zzso at water contents zzso 95 to zzso is zzso
