The molecular aspects of the type 37 zzso zzso zzso a zzso composed of zzso units zzso linked by zzso bonds, have been zzso zzso the zzso of the type 37 capsule is driven by a single gene zzso located far apart from the cap locus responsible for zzso formation in all of the types characterized to date in zzso zzso However, a zzso locus virtually identical to the zzso cluster has been found in type 37 zzso although some of its genes are zzso by zzso The zzso gene has been zzso and its zzso start point zzso zzso shows sequence motifs characteristic of cellulose zzso and other zzso zzso of the zzso gene into the zzso DNA causes a noticeable zzso reorganization in such a way that genes normally separated by more than 350 zzso in the zzso are located together in clinical zzso of type zzso zzso zzso strains belonging to 10 different zzso (or zzso transformed with zzso zzso type 37 zzso leading to the formation of strains that display the zzso type of zzso Type 37 zzso constitutes the first case of a natural, genetically zzso strain and represents a novel alternative to the mechanisms of zzso zzso
