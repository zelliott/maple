zzso perfect zzso sequence identity of at least 200 base pairs zzso is potentially indicative of evolutionary or functional zzso We used a transgenic mouse zzso to compare the embryonic zzso activity of 231 zzso zzso human zzso regions with that of 206 extremely zzso regions lacking zzso zzso enhancers were equally prevalent in both zzso suggesting instead that zzso identifies a small, functionally zzso subset of similarly constrained zzso zzso
