In this study, zzso viruses zzso of zzso zzso were used to test the general assertion that communities of zzso and zzso zzso may be more zzso than communities of their zzso zzso are poorly studied in general, but can affect the fitness and ecology of the zzso and plants with which they zzso To date, zzso zzso and diversity in natural communities remain largely zzso Here, we compared the zzso and diversity of zzso associated with zzso prairie plants to the diversity and zzso of zzso within those zzso Specifically, we sampled viruses from zzso associated with a zzso plant zzso zzso and its most frequent host plant zzso zzso in a zzso prairie habitat in zzso For each plant sample we cultured zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso From the cultured zzso we extracted DNA to identify zzso and extracted zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso were further characterized using reverse zzso and sequence zzso We found at least 25 zzso zzso associated with the two plants, and zzso of these zzso contained readily zzso zzso Several zzso types were shared among zzso zzso indicating that zzso may be less specialized than originally zzso Although the virus community was not as diverse as the zzso zzso community (16 zzso species zzso rates of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso may be higher than those of their associated zzso zzso Thus, zzso represent a further layer of zzso zzso in ecological zzso
