The zzso is the zzso particle responsible for translation of genetic information into zzso The zzso component of the zzso has been implicated as the zzso entity for zzso bond formation based on zzso resistance and structural data indicating an zzso active zzso Nevertheless, zzso transfer by zzso zzso zzso alone has not been zzso In an attempt to show such activity we generated a minimal construct that comprises much of the zzso zzso zzso zzso center, including the central loop and the A- and zzso This minimal zzso domain was inactive in zzso bond formation under all conditions zzso The zzso was subsequently subjected to six rounds of in zzso selection designed to enrich for this zzso The result was a zzso zzso sequence that could catalyze the zzso linkage of an zzso and zzso zzso however, the product did not contain a zzso zzso The current study is an example of an in zzso derived alternate function of zzso zzso and illustrates the evolutionary possibility that the zzso may have used zzso acids as zzso before it gained the ability to join them into zzso Though zzso zzso activity in the absence of protein remains zzso the ease with which alternate zzso activity was selected from zzso with a small number of zzso suggests that zzso may have inherent zzso This study represents a step on the path toward zzso that native zzso
