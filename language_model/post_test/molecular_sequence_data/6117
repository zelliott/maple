zzso transformed with specific regions of the zzso disease virus zzso zzso have been constructed and analyzed with respect to viability and zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression of an active zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter has been documented by the ability of transformed cells to catalyze the processing of a zzso zzso zzso zzso transient expression but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a zzso reduction in the yield of zzso and was zzso to the expression of the zzso reporter zzso zzso No such effect was observed in zzso involving cells zzso with a deleted, inactive form of zzso The negative effect of zzso was not observed when the same reporter gene was integrated and expressed in a zzso fashion nor when its translation was directed by the internal zzso entry site element of zzso in transient expression zzso The results show that cells with a low level of expression of the zzso zzso can be zzso maintained and can provide a useful tool to study zzso zzso
