In humans and mice, there are 11 genes derived from zzso related zzso some of which are known to play essential roles in zzso zzso Interestingly, this family of zzso was thought to exist only in zzso zzso indicating their significant contributions to the zzso evolution, but at least one, zzso is zzso between zzso and zzso Here we report a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso an Australian zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein highly zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso while zzso in the South American zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso by zzso of multiple nonsense zzso This suggests that zzso zzso occurred only in the zzso lineage but acquired and retained some as yet unidentified novel function, at least in the lineage of the zzso zzso
