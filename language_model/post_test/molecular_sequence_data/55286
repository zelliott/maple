A new zzso zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso a zzso plant with constitutional tolerance to heavy metals, by rapid amplification of zzso ends and named zzso which is composed of two zzso and one zzso The full length of zzso zzso was zzso zzso including 121 zzso zzso zzso domain, 240 zzso open reading frame and zzso zzso 3' zzso The coding region of zzso represented a putative 79 zzso acid protein with a molecular weight of zzso zzso At each of the zzso and zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso were arranged in zzso zzso and zzso indicating that the putative protein was a novel type 2 zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed the zzso protein sequence shared more than 60 % zzso with other plant type 2 zzso protein zzso At zzso acid level, the zzso was shown zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso coli strain zzso Star zzso confirmed the functional nature of this zzso gene in zzso both essential zzso and zzso metals zzso and zzso and the zzso coli zzso with zzso can live in 1,000 zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso and 2,000 zzso zzso The information could provide more details of the zzso molecular and zzso mechanisms (including heavy metal zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso or a scientific basis for marine zzso environment zzso with zzso zzso This study also provides a great significance of protecting zzso species and zzso zzso
