A novel zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a nest of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso North field in the zzso zzso zzso were zzso short rods with a single polar zzso Growth was observed between 4 and 35 degrees C zzso 30 degrees zzso zzso h doubling zzso and between pH zzso and zzso zzso pH zzso The isolate was a zzso zzso zzso capable of growth using molecular hydrogen, zzso sulfur or zzso as the sole energy source, carbon dioxide as the sole carbon source, ammonium or nitrate as the sole nitrogen source and zzso zzso zzso or zzso extract as the sole sulfur zzso zzso zzso represents the first zzso zzso capable of growth by both hydrogen and sulfur zzso zzso or molecular oxygen (up to 10 % partial zzso could serve as the sole electron zzso to support zzso zzso products of nitrate reduction shifted in response to the electron donor zzso The zzso content of zzso DNA was zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the novel isolate belonged to the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the novel isolate could be differentiated zzso from zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and molecular properties of the novel zzso the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we propose the zzso of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso In addition, an zzso description of the zzso zzso is zzso
