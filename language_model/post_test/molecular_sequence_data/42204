zzso of the zzso adhesive structures of rat zzso zzso zzso upon transformation by zzso zzso virus zzso was investigated by zzso zzso In zzso culture zzso zzso cells developed focal zzso as their main adhesive structures, while zzso cells expressed peculiar close contacts along the cell periphery with the zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso These peripheral close contacts are referred to as the peripheral zzso The peripheral zzso were observed as a darker region than zzso by interference reflection zzso They were more easily destroyed by zzso the cells with zzso zzso than were the focal zzso In contrast to focal zzso and zzso zzso zzso were not detected within the peripheral zzso where zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso of the zzso was determined by the zzso composition when zzso cells were cultured in zzso culture zzso Under such conditions, zzso cells expressed the peripheral zzso within 3 hours on zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, in zzso zzso they first developed focal zzso zzso at their early stage of zzso and then the peripheral zzso were predominantly expressed within 12 zzso zzso were formed in a time course similar to that of the peripheral zzso These findings suggest that the peripheral zzso is a class of stable adhesive structure distinct from the focal zzso or zzso of zzso zzso Similar close zzso peripheral zzso with the zzso were also observed in a variety of cultured cells such as normal zzso at their zzso growth phase, zzso zzso zzso and several zzso tumor cells, with poorly organized focal zzso and stress zzso These findings further suggest that the peripheral zzso may be widely involved in the zzso of cells that zzso develop stress fibers and focal zzso
