The magnitude and duration of a zzso zzso release can potentially be altered by changing the rate of zzso zzso In plant cells, zzso zzso from the zzso is zzso by zzso and two types of zzso zzso was recently identified as a zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso of its zzso regulatory domain by a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso activity ( approximately zzso and zzso stimulation ( approximately zzso as shown by zzso zzso with zzso zzso expressed in zzso A zzso zzso site was mapped to zzso near a zzso binding site, using a fusion protein containing the zzso domain as an in zzso zzso for a zzso zzso In a full-length zzso an Ala substitution for zzso zzso completely blocked the observed zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso An zzso substitution zzso zzso zzso indicating that a negative charge at this position is sufficient to account for zzso Interestingly, prior binding of zzso blocked zzso This suggests that, once zzso binds zzso its zzso state becomes resistant to zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso activity is regulated as the balance between the initial zzso of zzso stimulation and zzso zzso providing an example in plants for a potential point of zzso between two different zzso zzso
