zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso strain of zzso C virus zzso are capable of autonomous replication in cultured zzso cells zzso et zzso Science zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and/or zzso proteins are required for efficient replication of these zzso and increase by orders of magnitude the numbers of zzso colonies selected following zzso of zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that a zzso zzso zzso derived from an infectious molecular clone of a second zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso is also capable of efficient replication in zzso zzso zzso cells selected following zzso with zzso zzso contained abundant zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by Northern zzso zzso zzso in one of three zzso isolated cell lines contained no zzso in the zzso zzso confirming that zzso zzso are not required for efficient replication in these zzso However, the deletion of a unique zzso zzso that is present within the zzso zzso region zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso drastically decreased the number of zzso colonies obtained following zzso of zzso zzso This effect could be reversed by inclusion of a previously described zzso cell zzso zzso zzso confirming that this natural zzso has a controlling role in determining the replication capacity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the full-length zzso zzso were also capable of replication and gave rise to zzso cell clones following zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso derived from this documented infectious molecular clone has a unique capacity for replication in zzso cells in the absence of additional cell zzso zzso
