zzso A zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso and zzso of fatty zzso The eighth member of this family, zzso zzso the zzso zzso In this study, the bovine zzso full-length zzso and zzso DNA sequence were obtained and its gene structure was determined through alignment of the zzso DNA sequence to the zzso zzso The zzso sequence consisted of a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso flanked by a 37 zzso zzso region zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and its full-length zzso DNA sequence was zzso zzso in length and included 11 zzso and 10 zzso One zzso single zzso zzso zzso was revealed at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the bovine zzso gene by sequencing the zzso chain reaction zzso products of 6 randomly selected individuals from the sample zzso Different zzso were determined by restriction zzso length zzso zzso The association analysis of this zzso in bovine zzso with production traits in 178 unrelated zzso from 5 breeds showed that it had a significant effect on the daily gain and the beef tenderness zzso zzso zzso Cattle with the G zzso grew more rapidly and the beef they produced was more tender than those with the A zzso Thus, this zzso of the bovine zzso gene can be used as an indicator to improve the growth rate and the beef zzso
