Several investigators have independently identified zzso zzso in the zzso of insect larvae as the initial interacting zzso to the zzso crystal proteins of zzso zzso Though several zzso of zzso have been identified from the zzso of an insect and their corresponding zzso zzso only one of the zzso has been expressed zzso and studied for its binding to zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and expression of two zzso N from zzso zzso (American cotton zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in size and encodes a zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in size and zzso to a zzso zzso zzso these proteins show sequence similarity to other insect zzso and possess characteristic zzso zzso Both the genes have been expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells using a zzso expression zzso The expressed zzso are zzso zzso active and zzso zzso analysis of both these zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins displayed differential zzso All the three toxins bound to zzso whereas only zzso zzso with zzso This is the first report demonstrating differential zzso abilities of two different zzso from a susceptible zzso
