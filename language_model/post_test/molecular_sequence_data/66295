zzso zzso zzso are the major cause of epidemic zzso zzso in humans, but the mechanism of zzso zzso is unknown and no structure of an infectious zzso has been zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso that can be grown in tissue culture, studied in an animal model, and reverse engineered via an infectious clone and to which zzso zzso have been zzso Presented here are the zzso zzso structures of an zzso zzso and the zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso The most striking differences between zzso and previous zzso structures are that the protruding domain is lifted off the shell domain by approximately zzso and rotated approximately 40 degrees in a zzso fashion and forms new interactions at the zzso base that create a zzso structure engulfing the shell zzso zzso zzso fragments cover the outer surface of each copy of the zzso protein zzso zzso without causing any apparent zzso zzso These unique features of zzso suggest that at least some zzso undergo a zzso maturation process akin to that observed with other plant and bacterial zzso
