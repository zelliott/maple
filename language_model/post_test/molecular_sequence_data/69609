The major component of senile plaques found in the brains of zzso disease patients is the zzso zzso which is derived from a larger zzso precursor protein zzso Recently, a number of zzso and zzso proteins have been identified in different organisms and constitute the family of zzso zzso We have isolated several zzso zzso an zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso and have designated the corresponding gene as zzso The zzso transcripts undergo two forms of zzso zzso zzso and alternative zzso In zzso translation of an zzso zzso results in a protein of approximately the expected zzso Similar to the zzso human, and mouse zzso zzso zzso does not appear to contain the zzso zzso Because zzso proteins seem to be zzso through evolution, the zzso gene from zzso zzso should be important for determining the normal function of human zzso
