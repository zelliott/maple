Unlike zzso the zzso of the medicinal zzso can zzso damaged zzso thus restoring neural zzso Our group recently demonstrated that the injured zzso nerve zzso is able to mount an immune response, which promotes the zzso zzso This defense mechanism is zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is able to discriminate among microbial zzso We report here the characterization of two receptors potentially implicated in this zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso presents an zzso distribution in zzso and appears as a zzso combining the zzso zzso domain of zzso and the zzso section of zzso while zzso is zzso and has the highest zzso to zzso zzso Both receptors show patterns of induction upon stimulation that suggest their involvement in the zzso zzso zzso This work constitutes the first demonstration in an zzso of zzso an zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso related to the zzso zzso
