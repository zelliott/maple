In zzso zzso zzso sodium channels specifically cluster at the zzso of zzso while zzso zzso channels are located at the zzso These characteristic zzso are influenced by zzso During development, zzso first appears in the predicted zzso during zzso and zzso replaces it in the mature zzso Such replacements may be important zzso We examined the influence of the zzso junction on switching of sodium channel zzso using the zzso zzso This zzso displayed disruption of zzso zzso junctions and altered zzso lengths and channel zzso The initial switching of zzso to zzso occurred in the zzso zzso zzso however, the number of zzso clusters was significantly higher than in zzso zzso Although no signs of zzso were observed at least up to 36 weeks of age, sodium channel clusters decreased markedly with zzso Interestingly, zzso stayed in some of the zzso regions, especially where the zzso lengths were zzso while zzso tended to remain in the zzso zzso The results in the zzso zzso nerves suggested that zzso junction formation may be necessary for complete replacement of zzso zzso to zzso during development as well as maintenance of zzso clusters at the zzso Such zzso zzso was not observed in the zzso zzso where zzso disruption was zzso Thus, the zzso junction significantly influences the retention of zzso in the zzso which is followed by disorganization of zzso zzso However, its importance may differ between the central and peripheral nervous zzso
