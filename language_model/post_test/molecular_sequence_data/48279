zzso zzso are zzso sequences of zzso zzso acid zzso found principally within zzso nuclear zzso but which also exist in certain zzso The zzso domain is thought to mediate zzso zzso but its mode of action has yet to be zzso Here, we show that the two highly divergent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso involved in cell cycle checkpoint control, possess zzso zzso We also demonstrate that other zzso zzso bind peptides in a zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso domain is a zzso zzso interaction motif and have important implications for mechanisms of zzso signaling in both zzso and zzso
