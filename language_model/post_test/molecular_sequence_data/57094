Isolation of zzso clones for human zzso B4 zzso zzso clearly demonstrates that the zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones isolated from a human zzso zzso library with zzso zzso as a probe zzso a protein of 520 zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain near the C zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso The zzso from zzso cells zzso with an expression zzso zzso carrying isolated zzso zzso the zzso of zzso with a zzso value of zzso zzso and its activity was significantly inhibited by carbon monoxide and by zzso against zzso consistent with the properties previously reported with zzso zzso in human zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso similarity to those of zzso zzso and zzso whereas less than zzso similarity was observed with any of the other zzso zzso According to the systematic zzso of the zzso zzso zzso omega is classified into the zzso family but does not belong to any of the known zzso zzso This zzso composes a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso to the zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso as well as zzso from four zzso Isolation of the zzso opens the way to investigate the zzso role and to regulation of the zzso in the inflammation zzso
