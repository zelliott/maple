zzso zzso for a zzso zzso designated zzso was cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso expression library using zzso to human zzso surface zzso belonging to zzso zzso molecular zzso These zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso binding and have zzso zzso zzso Computer generated translation analysis of zzso zzso yielded an open reading frame zzso of 152 zzso with first zzso Met start zzso at zzso 32 and the stop zzso zzso at zzso zzso The translated protein has a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso and a potential zzso zzso site at zzso zzso besides at least two zzso zzso zzso The zzso plot generated from the deduced zzso sequence indicated it to be a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso that is characteristic of a signal zzso zzso computer search in the zzso zzso and Swiss sequence banks, indicating it to be a novel zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated zzso expression of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso T zzso and expressed in zzso gene fusion system to obtain the zzso zzso The zzso protein specifically reacted with the original zzso raised against the native zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may find applications in the development of a contraceptive zzso and in studying the normal and abnormal zzso function and the signal zzso zzso
