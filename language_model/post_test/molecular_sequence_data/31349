The interaction of the zzso fragments zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso with bovine zzso was studied by use of one- and two-dimensional zzso techniques in zzso zzso zzso zzso specific line broadening of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso of the synthetic zzso fragments zzso and zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso are the zzso binding site of zzso fragments with zzso zzso fragments take on a zzso structure when bound to zzso as indicated by several long-range transferred zzso between the backbone and zzso zzso of the zzso but they are not structured when free in zzso zzso transferred zzso exist between the alpha zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso between the alpha zzso zzso of zzso and the beta zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso and between the alpha zzso zzso of zzso and the gamma zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso These zzso are characteristic of an zzso structure involving zzso zzso to zzso There are also zzso between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso geometry calculations suggest that in the structure of the zzso zzso peptides all the charged zzso lie on the opposite side of a zzso cluster formed by the zzso side chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
