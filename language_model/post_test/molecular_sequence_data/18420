zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso I zzso a sea zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso The zzso were selected to probe the importance of charged zzso in the zzso zzso zzso side chains were replaced with a corresponding neutral zzso zzso acid side zzso Following zzso of the three zzso bonds and zzso the zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectral analyses indicate that the zzso have folded structures very similar to the native zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso of zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 is essential for activity, as replacement of any of these side chains with the corresponding zzso reduces toxicity and binding at least zzso zzso at zzso 4 or zzso 11 reduces biological activity at least zzso these zzso are apparently not as critical as the zzso zzso zzso the zzso Ala zzso with a zzso zzso has only a slight effect upon crab toxicity and zzso zzso Our results suggest that several zzso acid side chains near the zzso of this sea zzso zzso are important for binding to crab zzso sodium zzso
