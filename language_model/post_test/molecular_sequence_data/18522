Little is known of the impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso on the binding of human zzso and nothing is known of this interaction in the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is used in zzso evaluation of vaccines and therapeutic zzso We defined the sequence and zzso binding characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and predicted their structures using the zzso crystal zzso Large differences were observed in the binding of zzso by zzso and zzso compared with their human zzso zzso zzso has markedly impaired binding of zzso and zzso immune complexes compared with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso has enhanced binding of zzso and broader zzso as, unlike zzso it avidly binds zzso zzso and molecular modeling of zzso showed that zzso and zzso impair the critical zzso loop interaction with zzso The enhanced binding of zzso and zzso by zzso was shown to be dependent on zzso and zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are zzso across zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We identified functionally significant zzso of zzso wherein zzso at position zzso also an important zzso site in zzso almost abolished binding of zzso and zzso and reduced binding of zzso compared with zzso zzso These marked zzso differences in zzso binding between human and zzso zzso and zzso within species have implications for zzso evaluation of zzso and vaccines in zzso
