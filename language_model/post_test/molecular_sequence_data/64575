The zzso carriers are a family of transport proteins that, with a few exceptions, are found in the inner zzso of zzso They shuttle zzso and zzso through this zzso and connect zzso functions with others in the zzso SAM zzso has to be transported into the zzso where it is converted into zzso in zzso reactions of DNA, zzso and zzso The transport of SAM has been investigated in rat liver zzso but no protein has ever been associated with this zzso By using information derived from the zzso distant zzso zzso carrier for SAM and from related human expressed sequence zzso a human zzso sequence was zzso This sequence was zzso in bacteria, and its product was zzso zzso into zzso zzso and identified from its transport properties as the human zzso SAM carrier zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso zzso virtually only zzso exhibited a higher transport affinity for SAM and was strongly inhibited by zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed in all human zzso examined and was localized to the zzso The zzso role of zzso is probably to exchange zzso SAM for zzso zzso This is the first report describing the identification and characterization of the human zzso and its zzso
