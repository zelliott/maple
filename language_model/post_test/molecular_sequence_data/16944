zzso 1 or zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso form high molecular weight complexes that play a pivotal role in the zzso of various Type I zzso zzso including the zzso precursor zzso The specific function of zzso is zzso To explore its function and zzso zzso we conducted deletion and zzso studies on a series of zzso zzso at the C zzso of zzso These studies suggest that: 1) both the presence and zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso domain at the C zzso of zzso zzso zzso is critical for binding zzso to other components in the zzso complex and 2) the overall length of the exposed C zzso is critical for functional zzso zzso
