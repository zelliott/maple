The crystal structure of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso revealed three main zzso a zzso domain, composed of a zzso parallel zzso surrounded by zzso and two peripheral zzso involved in covering the zzso in the active site zzso and binding of the zzso zzso We initiated a long-term zzso study aiming to characterize the solution structure, binding mechanism and internal dynamics of the various zzso Using single zzso and zzso zzso and zzso samples and double- and zzso zzso experiments we assigned zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso backbone zzso and zzso and zzso zzso for more than zzso of the side chains in the free zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso in complex with the zzso analogue zzso zzso resulted in the assignment of zzso of the backbone zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the side chain zzso Based on short-range zzso and zzso and zzso secondary chemical shifts, we identified the elements of secondary structure and the zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso of the parallel zzso in solution have the same limits zzso 1 zzso as those observed in the zzso The first zzso zzso appears to have a frayed zzso zzso zzso differences relative to the crystal were noticed in the zzso domain, which in solution exhibits four zzso zzso The secondary structure of the zzso form, as deduced from zzso zzso and the zzso chemical shifts, is similar to that of the free zzso The largest chemical shift differences allowed us to map the regions of zzso zzso zzso exchange experiments performed on free and zzso zzso showed a general decrease of the structural flexibility in the complex which is accompanied by a local increased flexibility on the zzso of the parallel zzso
