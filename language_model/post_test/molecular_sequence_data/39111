The patterns of expression of zzso gated zzso channel genes of the Shaker family have been mapped in identified zzso of the lobster zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso using a single cell reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Using specific zzso derived from the sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we detected the corresponding zzso channel DNA fragments from zzso zzso The zzso DNA fragments are zzso identical at the zzso level to the zzso DNA zzso We used the zzso zzso to measure the complement of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in single identified cells that use zzso zzso zzso or zzso as chemical zzso Shaker and zzso zzso were found in all four identified zzso types but zzso zzso was not detected in zzso cells under the present experimental zzso All cells expressed zzso zzso which serves as an internal control suggesting that cells are intact after zzso In zzso cells that surround the zzso cell bodies, the zzso channel genes are expressed at low to zzso zzso
