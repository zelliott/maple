zzso constants, zzso were measured by equilibrium dialysis at 5 degrees C for a series of zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are zzso for the 3' zzso zzso site, the zzso site, and the zzso G that zzso group I zzso zzso has a zzso of 17 zzso zzso the zzso to zzso and zzso enhances binding but by less than expected from potential base zzso zzso groups on the zzso G of zzso were replaced with H to test their effect on zzso zzso binds slightly tighter than the zzso zzso but shows no zzso as a zzso zzso binds weaker than zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the 3' position weaken binding by 16- and zzso respectively, but both zzso are zzso Thus hydrogen bonds to zzso pairing positions of the zzso of zzso contribute 1-2 zzso to the free energy change for zzso Similar results are found in comparisons of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso includes a zzso bond 3' to the zzso that is the site of chemistry for the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds 50 times more zzso than zzso A similar result is obtained for zzso Competition experiments show that zzso and zzso zzso bind with zzso zzso of about zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso have zzso of zzso and zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso This suggests that sugar zzso and/or interactions with zzso groups affect zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and design of zzso zzso are zzso
