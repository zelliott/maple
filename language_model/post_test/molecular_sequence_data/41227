To investigate the molecular mechanism of sex reversal in a zzso female zzso 

Clinical data was zzso zzso blood zzso were cultured for zzso zzso analysis and DNA zzso zzso region of zzso zzso gene was analyzed with zzso chain reaction zzso and DNA sequencing zzso 

Although the patient has a female appearance, he has a zzso of zzso The zzso gene can be detected in all zzso The 6th base of zzso gene coding region was deleted, resulting in a zzso zzso and premature termination of protein zzso 

The sex reversal of the patient is probably due to abnormal embryonic development caused by the zzso gene zzso
