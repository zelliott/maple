zzso proteins have a characteristic zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso of variable length and constitute a family of highly zzso nuclear zzso that can function as both essential and alternative zzso zzso zzso We have cloned a zzso zzso a novel human zzso protein designated zzso which has an unusually short zzso zzso We also cloned zzso zzso the human zzso of zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso proteins expressed from these zzso are active in zzso zzso as shown by their ability to complement a zzso cell zzso extract deficient in zzso zzso Additional zzso clones reflect extensive alternative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The predicted protein zzso lack the zzso zzso domain and might be involved in feedback regulatory zzso The ability of human zzso zzso and zzso to zzso alternative zzso in zzso was compared with that of other zzso proteins using a transient zzso zzso The zzso of individual zzso proteins in zzso cells affected the choice of alternative zzso zzso sites of zzso zzso and/or human zzso zzso The resulting zzso patterns were characteristic for each zzso zzso zzso with the zzso importance of zzso proteins in alternative zzso in zzso we demonstrate complex changes in the levels of zzso zzso the above zzso proteins upon T cell zzso zzso with changes in the expression of alternatively spliced zzso of zzso and zzso
