zzso gels of zzso zzso proteins from most zzso strains reveal the presence of up to 10 bands which are the product of only 4 zzso The proteins have been characterized by zzso zzso acid sequencing, specific zzso zzso and by taking advantage of zzso zzso zzso strains obtained by gene disruption zzso The four most basic proteins coincide with the zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso formerly named zzso and zzso zzso sequencing has shown that these two zzso have free zzso ends starting at the first zzso zzso The bands defined earlier as zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso processed forms of protein zzso beta lacking the first eight zzso zzso The formation of this truncated zzso beta form seems to be zzso by salt during protein extraction and is also favored by some modifications at the zzso zzso of the zzso On the other hand, the previously zzso band, called zzso zzso to an zzso zzso form of zzso beta which starts at the zzso in the second position of the zzso zzso Finally, the most zzso band is the zzso product of the fourth zzso protein zzso This zzso called zzso zzso which is very poorly stained by silver and zzso blue, has not been characterized in detail zzso It is also zzso in the zzso and, like zzso zzso is present as an zzso zzso form starting at the second zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
