We have examined zzso positioning on two DNA segments containing sharp zzso zzso A 223 zzso DNA from zzso zzso was cloned into two sites in zzso separated by zzso These sites were found to selectively zzso zzso zzso to zzso more effectively than the adjoining straight zzso The zzso of replication and zzso of zzso of zzso DNA are contained within a region of approximately 200 zzso centrally located in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso by electron zzso revealed a sharp curve of approximately 200 degrees in the terminal zzso zzso of zzso protein with this zzso revealed a zzso to zzso higher probability of assembling zzso in the terminal region over the adjacent zzso
