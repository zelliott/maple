The zzso zzso protein mediates interaction between the zzso zzso type III zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso following particle zzso of tobacco leaf zzso cells was used to examine the zzso zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso or several of its zzso and to examine the effects of zzso with zzso or zzso This study showed that zzso was attached to the plasma membrane at its zzso zzso and that a zzso zzso zzso or zzso (typically zzso zzso or both, was essential for this zzso zzso was zzso by zzso at two zzso zzso one releasing a large portion of zzso from the plasma membrane and both exposing zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso products by targeting them for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not affected by zzso zzso was found to be part of a protein family zzso two full-length zzso and at least 11 short zzso zzso Representatives of this family, zzso a full-length zzso zzso and two short zzso zzso zzso were also attached to the plasma membrane and zzso near their zzso zzso by zzso but in contrast to zzso the major portions of these proteins remained on the plasma zzso zzso degradation may play a minor role in zzso degradation but probably plays a major role in the degradation of zzso zzso and is, therefore, a major zzso consequence of zzso zzso
