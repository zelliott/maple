The zzso regions of human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso suggesting a functional role of the zzso acid sequence itself in regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Secondary structure evaluations revealed no indications for a zzso folding pattern within the zzso To test the potential of the zzso to serve as a target for specific binding zzso gel shift zzso were zzso In zzso zzso was incubated with zzso as well as nuclear extracts from mouse male germ zzso Evidence was obtained that such specific proteins exist in germ cell zzso zzso experiments suggested that a 30 zzso protein was involved in these binding zzso
