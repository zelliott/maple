zzso metabolism is one aspect of basic zzso which is still quite unknown in the field of zzso zzso Evidence derived from previous studies conducted in our laboratory strongly suggests that during microbial zzso an important nitrogen zzso process takes place in diseased zzso Here we describe the expression pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tomato leaves infected by the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso AS zzso probe isolated by zzso from infected leaves, we have observed a high level induction of AS expression during the course of zzso zzso a single AS zzso also accumulated in response to bacterial zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis of AS in infected leaves revealed a strong zzso in zzso cells of the main vascular zzso and in secondary veins of the leaf zzso These data correlate with those previously reported for expression of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also induced during development of the infectious zzso Taken together, our results suggest the existence of a zzso zzso representing a zzso route for transferring ammonium released from protein zzso into zzso an zzso acid that may have a major role in nitrogen zzso from diseased zzso
