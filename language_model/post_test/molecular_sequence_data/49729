zzso is a key zzso involved in regulating cellular levels of zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso and thus could zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso of the zzso domain of neutral zzso was required for zzso to the surface of plasma zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso contain a zzso domain zzso zzso which follows the zzso zzso whereas those of bacterial and zzso zzso completely lack a zzso box, suggesting that the specific domain has been acquired during zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso the zzso was not only zzso into the medium after zzso of the zzso zzso sequence but also localized at the plasma membrane as a type II integral membrane zzso zzso zzso analysis using peanut zzso revealed that the zzso box of the zzso is highly zzso with zzso Interestingly, a zzso lacking the zzso box or possible zzso sites in the zzso box was zzso into the medium but not localized at the surface of the zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso green fluorescent protein zzso but not zzso itself, with the zzso sequence was distributed on the surface of the zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso box retains proteins on the plasma zzso We also found that the zzso zzso zzso from mouse kidney is zzso whereas the zzso soluble zzso from liver is zzso These results clearly indicate that zzso modification of the zzso with zzso is zzso and helps the zzso to zzso at the surface of plasma zzso as a type II membrane zzso
