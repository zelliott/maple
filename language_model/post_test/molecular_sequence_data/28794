zzso is an essential zzso zzso protein that has a zzso zinc finger zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso had yielded zzso that lacked the capacity to bind zinc but still supported cell zzso In a continuation of an examination of the relation of the structure of zzso to its function, the contribution of zzso acid zzso in the intervening sequence between the internal zzso zzso of the motif was zzso zzso of zzso for the zzso zzso at positions 44, 45, or 48, or for zzso 49 slowed cell zzso The most severe effect was caused by a zzso zzso A zzso of zzso 55 to zzso was zzso zzso to zzso of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region decreased cell zzso the zzso zzso was zzso An in zzso zzso for binding of zzso to individual 26 S zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso fusion protein zzso was to zzso II and zzso the zzso for binding to domain II was 79 zzso for domain III it was 198 zzso There was a close correspondence between the effect of zzso in zzso on cell growth and on binding to 26 S zzso In the atomic structure of the 50 S zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso coordinates a zinc atom and the finger motif is folded and interacts mainly with domain III of 23 S zzso whereas the zzso region of zzso interacts primarily with domain zzso The zzso and genetic experiments complement the three-dimensional structure and define for the first time the functional importance of a subset of the zzso in close proximity to zzso
