We have identified several novel human zzso recruitment domain zzso containing zzso In this report, we describe one among them, zzso The zzso expression of zzso was higher in the kidney and zzso of normal zzso High expression was also detected in breast cancer, prostate cancer and zzso tumor cells but not in zzso cancer zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is able to inhibit zzso zzso induced by zzso treatment in zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso is a novel member of the zzso family and a negative regulator of cell death and inflammatory zzso The zzso locus has been assigned to zzso zzso The zzso gene consists of 14 zzso and zzso for at least five zzso zzso
