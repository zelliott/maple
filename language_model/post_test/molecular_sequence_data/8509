zzso B cells zzso in the zzso centers of peripheral zzso tissue accumulate zzso in their rearranged variable regions, a diversification process which contributes to affinity maturation of the zzso zzso The highly targeted nature of the zzso process could be explained by a zzso gene conversion zzso Well characterized examples of such an activity in B cells are seen during diversification of the chicken and rabbit zzso zzso The zzso organization, low complexity and high degree of zzso exhibited by the four members of the zzso zzso gene family suggested that these gene segments may be suitable candidates for the search of gene conversion events derived from upstream zzso zzso After an immune response to a complex T zzso zzso zzso red blood zzso rearranged zzso zzso and zzso genes were isolated from zzso zzso and zzso center B zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident in zzso and zzso zzso When these sequences were zzso as well as zzso sequences isolated from zzso zzso the observed zzso changes were not associated with any gene conversion between family members, suggesting instead that they arose by a mechanism which introduces point zzso
