zzso of a zzso interaction involves differential gene expression in both zzso In order to isolate zzso zzso genes whose expression is induced during its interaction with tomato, a comparative analysis of the expression pattern of the fungus in zzso with its expression pattern during in zzso culture was performed by differential display of zzso zzso Discrimination of zzso genes induced in zzso from plant defense genes induced in response to the pathogen was attempted by including in this comparative analysis the expression patterns of healthy tomato leaves and of tomato leaves infected with two different zzso either zzso zzso or tobacco necrosis virus zzso Using a limited set of primer combinations, three zzso zzso zzso fragments, zzso zzso and zzso were isolated representing zzso genes whose expression is enhanced in zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the transcripts detected with the zzso clones zzso and zzso accumulated at zzso levels only at late time points during the zzso The zzso clone zzso detected two different sizes of transcripts displaying zzso transient expression patterns during the zzso zzso analysis and database searches revealed no significant zzso to any known zzso These results show that the differential display procedure possesses enough sensitivity to be applied to the detection of zzso genes induced during a zzso zzso Additionally, four zzso fragments were isolated representing tomato genes induced in response to the infection caused by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso
