In most insects and some other zzso a small stretch of zzso can be removed from mature zzso zzso zzso which could create two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, during zzso the zzso profiles of these organisms may differ significantly from the standard benchmark since the two zzso zzso with the zzso zzso To understand the structure and mechanism of the zzso zzso zzso zzso partial fragments of zzso and zzso in brine shrimp zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were cloned using a modified technology based on terminal zzso zzso with the corresponding sequences of zzso zzso indicates that there are 41 zzso in zzso zzso and 42 zzso in zzso zzso absent from the mature zzso The zzso content of the gap sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso Both the gaps may form zzso zzso In zzso zzso a zzso zzso signal is identified in the loop, but it is absent in zzso zzso Thus, it is proposed that the gap processing of zzso zzso was a late zzso zzso event in the zzso zzso process based on the zzso rich gap sequence and the formation of the zzso structure to expose the processing segment, while the deletion of the gap region would not affect the structure and function of the zzso zzso zzso
