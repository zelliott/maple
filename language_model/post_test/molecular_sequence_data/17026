zzso of zzso metabolism is commonly observed in sex zzso cancer cells, yet its zzso involvement in cancer cell proliferation and progression is zzso We have found that the expression of the cholesterol zzso zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso was zzso to zzso higher in zzso than in zzso zzso human prostate cancer cells, indicating a possible relationship between the expression levels of zzso and prostate cancer zzso On the basis of real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso analysis, expression of zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso The zzso zzso blocked the effect of zzso implicating the zzso zzso in regulation of zzso expression by zzso Using an zzso zzso gene zzso zzso suppression was observed at the zzso level in zzso but not in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso appears to have a role in modulating cell proliferation because zzso of zzso expression by zzso interference in zzso cells increased their rate of zzso zzso a zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression may be one of the mechanisms by which zzso regulate proliferation in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells thus may zzso in part, to prostate cancer zzso
