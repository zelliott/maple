zzso zzso zzso structurally similar to zzso is zzso from a larger zzso zzso and has been zzso to be a novel zzso Recently, it was reported that central administration of zzso decreased food intake in zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso are identical in all zzso and chicken zzso exhibits a high zzso with zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso whether central injection of zzso or chicken zzso zzso food intake in the zzso and to compare their zzso zzso administration of zzso and chicken zzso strongly inhibited food intake of zzso However, the zzso effect of both zzso on food intake was zzso These results show that zzso with a variety of zzso acid sequences may be the most potent inhibitor of food intake in the zzso
