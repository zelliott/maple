The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso A, zzso is zzso in nature, with key roles in the control of diverse aspects of zzso cellular zzso In the case of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso has been identified and two zzso of this zzso arising from a zzso zzso event, have been characterized zzso zzso zzso and Rubin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the occurrence of zzso zzso events that, in addition to generating a zzso of zzso zzso also generate the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that we have recently characterized zzso Fisher, zzso and zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene spans more than 36 zzso and is divided into a total of 13 zzso Each of the mature transcripts contains only 7 zzso In addition to the already characterized zzso 1, the zzso region and first zzso actually contain 5 other zzso any one of which may be alternatively spliced on to zzso 2 at the zzso end of the zzso This zzso alternative zzso occurs in combination with either of the already characterized zzso alternative zzso Thus, zzso zzso expresses at least 12 different zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso The significance of this unprecedented structural diversity in the family of zzso zzso zzso is zzso
