The T4 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that blocks zzso binding to multiple T4 messages by interacting with the zzso near their respective zzso start zzso Other than the zzso there are no obvious similarities between the affected zzso High affinity zzso zzso to zzso were isolated using zzso zzso evolution of zzso by exponential zzso The selected zzso exhibited the consensus sequence zzso The zzso was zzso suggesting that it is the primary zzso of binding zzso The zzso immediately zzso to the zzso and the upstream zzso tract were highly zzso among the selected zzso zzso and zzso experiments are consistent with the consensus sequence defining the zzso zzso Interestingly, chemical modification and zzso zzso data indicate that the zzso site is zzso as if zzso discriminates between targets based on their primary zzso not their secondary zzso Minor variations from the consensus at positions other than the universally zzso zzso have little effect on zzso zzso but zzso of zzso has a profound effect on the zzso zzso of the in zzso targets for zzso to the zzso consensus suggests a repression pattern zzso the translation of individual messages is zzso halted until the least similarly affected message, the zzso gene itself, is zzso
