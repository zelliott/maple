zzso also called zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a surface protein of zzso zzso studied for its zzso properties, its capability to bind zzso zzso zzso and complement factor zzso and its activity as an zzso In this work we characterized the zzso locus of 43 zzso strains by DNA sequencing of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso designed on two unrelated open reading zzso zzso the zzso zzso it was possible to amplify the zzso locus of each of the 43 strains of zzso zzso In 37 out of 43 strains there was a single copy of the zzso zzso while two tandem copies of zzso were found in the other six zzso The sequence of the zzso locus was different in each of the 43 zzso zzso sequences were found in the zzso locus of 11 out of 43 zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso showed a common organization of the zzso zzso a 37 zzso acid leader zzso which is zzso in all zzso zzso an zzso portion which is essentially zzso and is the result of assembly of eight major sequence blocks, zzso a zzso region, and zzso a zzso anchor responsible for the cell surface zzso By sequence comparison we identified 11 major groups of zzso zzso zzso within one group displayed only minor variations of the zzso acid zzso An unexpected finding was that zzso zzso could differ in the anchor zzso While 32 of the zzso proteins displayed the typical zzso binding domain of zzso surface zzso 17 other zzso showed the zzso zzso which is typical of surface proteins of other zzso zzso This major difference in the anchor region was also observed in the adjacent zzso regions which differed considerably in size and zzso
