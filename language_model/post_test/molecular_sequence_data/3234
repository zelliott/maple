A barrier to zzso production of complex zzso in zzso coli is the lack of zzso a common zzso zzso for the zzso of complex zzso by modular zzso zzso One zzso route to zzso involves the sequential actions of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which convert zzso to zzso and then to zzso As reported zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Haller, zzso et zzso zzso zzso 39, zzso when genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli, the inactive zzso was zzso However, when cells harboring the zzso genes from zzso zzso or zzso coli were treated with the B12 precursor zzso active zzso was isolated, and zzso represented approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso When the zzso coli zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso et zzso (2001) Science zzso zzso harboring plasmids that expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso was fed zzso and zzso the zzso zzso B zzso was zzso zzso labeling studies using zzso showed that the starter unit for zzso synthesis was derived exclusively from zzso zzso while the zzso units stemmed from zzso via the zzso zzso Thus, the introduction of an engineered zzso zzso in zzso coli enabled the zzso of carbon sources used to produce starter and zzso units of zzso
