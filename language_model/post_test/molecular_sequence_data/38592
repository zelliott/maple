During zzso in zzso convergence and extension movements, zzso by zzso zzso are the driving force for early neural plate zzso Here we show that the winged zzso zzso regulator, zzso is zzso expressed in zzso neural plate precursors that undergo convergence and extension zzso These zzso zzso zzso are specified in and beyond the zzso organizer prior to zzso of the zzso zzso of the neural zzso The initiation of zzso expression zzso with the induction of zzso by zzso growth factors at the late zzso zzso Comparative expression analysis suggests that cellular zzso at the zzso stage account for zzso of the zzso organizer into head and trunk organizer zzso the latter in which zzso neural plate zzso zzso While the maintenance of zzso expression in the zzso zzso marginal zone requires zzso zzso its subsequent positioning along the zzso aspect of the zzso depends on zzso by zzso and zzso family zzso Based on these findings we propose that zzso is a trunk organizer component that might control convergence and extension movements of zzso neural plate precursors during zzso
