zzso C virus zzso carriers with normal zzso levels often show zzso chronic zzso This study was undertaken to determine the effect of zzso zzso in such zzso zzso zzso carriers with normal zzso activities and chronic zzso were zzso to receive zzso (3 million units 3 times weekly for 12 zzso or no zzso zzso was monitored by qualitative and quantitative determination of viral zzso Patients who did not clear zzso zzso after 6 months discontinued zzso In all, 9 patients constituted the control group, while 10 patients were zzso Five of these patients, still zzso after 6 months, stopped zzso The remaining 5 patients, who cleared the viral zzso within 6 months, completed the 12-month zzso Three of these patients relapsed off treatment, and 2 were still free of zzso 12 months after stopping zzso A transient zzso of zzso activities was detected in 2 patients during treatment and in 3 patients zzso None of the 9 control patients cleared the viral zzso during zzso A variable degree of sequence zzso was detected in the zzso region before therapy, and zzso treatment decreased sequence diversity in all zzso These results indicate that zzso therapy can be effective in chronic zzso carriers with normal zzso activities, inducing short-term zzso response in 3 of 10 patients and sustained response in zzso The effects of treatment on viral load and zzso complexity were similar to those reported previously in patients with increased zzso zzso
