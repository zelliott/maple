We have isolated zzso clones zzso a zzso acid zzso of the human zzso protein zzso It differs from previously determined zzso sequences by the presence of an additional repeat of 31 zzso zzso giving four, rather than three, tandem repeats in its zzso zzso The extra repeat is zzso by a separate zzso zzso derived from zzso clones zzso the three zzso I) and four repeat zzso zzso zzso protein zzso detected zzso for both forms in all adult human brain areas zzso However, in zzso brain only type I zzso was zzso Type I and type II zzso were present in zzso cells in cerebral zzso In the zzso formation, type I zzso was found in zzso and zzso zzso type II zzso was detected in most, though not all, zzso cells but not in zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso protein zzso are expressed in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein is found in the zzso core of the paired zzso filament, the major constituent of the zzso tangle in Alzheimer's zzso Taken in conjunction with previous findings, the present results indicate that both the three and four zzso zzso protein zzso are present in the core of the paired zzso zzso
