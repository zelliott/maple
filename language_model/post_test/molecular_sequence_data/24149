We analyzed the sequence variation in the coding zzso of zzso in eight unrelated south Indian zzso with one zzso individual in each zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso and zzso cloning followed by zzso Here we report two de zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the paired domain of zzso These deletions probably represent zzso or zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso as the underlying genetic factor of zzso
