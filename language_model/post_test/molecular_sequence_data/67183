In spite of their importance in zzso zzso the function of zzso proteins (including zzso zzso is poorly understood at the molecular zzso Here, we present recent progress achieved with the five zzso proteins from zzso coli, which have been particularly well zzso These zzso which have zzso in many bacteria, participate, in particular, in specific steps of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso they behave as poorly zzso zzso zzso presumably because they only unwind a few base pairs at each cycle so that stable duplexes can zzso rather than zzso Except for one of them zzso these proteins lack zzso specificity in zzso and specificity in zzso is likely zzso by partners that target them to defined zzso Interestingly, at least one of them is multifunctional, presumably because it can interact with different zzso Altogether, several aspects of the information gathered with these proteins have become zzso for our understanding of zzso proteins in zzso
