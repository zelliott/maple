An analysis of the geometry of metal binding by zzso zzso groups in proteins is zzso Such metal zzso are predominantly calcium in known protein zzso zzso tend to be located in the zzso plane, near the C zzso O bond zzso This distribution differs from that observed for water molecules bound to zzso zzso Most metal zzso are bound to zzso zzso of peptides in turns or in regions with no regular secondary zzso More zzso binding interactions occur at the zzso end of zzso or at the edges and sides of zzso where the geometrical preferences of the zzso interaction may be zzso In many proteins zzso groups that are one, two, or three zzso apart along the zzso chain bind to the same zzso these structures show a limited number of zzso zzso around the metal zzso
