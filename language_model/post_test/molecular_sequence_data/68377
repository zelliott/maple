The zzso protein zzso zzso regulates the entry into zzso by catalyzing the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso To examine the potential mechanisms for zzso regulation during the cell cycle, we have introduced a zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso into zzso egg zzso We find that the zzso protein zzso dramatic changes in its zzso state and zzso activity during the cell zzso The zzso protein zzso between an zzso 107 zzso form during zzso and a zzso 170 zzso version at zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein results in a substantial reduction in its activity as a zzso zzso zzso This zzso occurs in the zzso region of the protein that lies outside the zzso zzso domain, which was recently shown to be a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso These experiments demonstrate the existence of a zzso regulatory system, consisting of both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso which controls the zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso Moreover, these findings indicate that there are apparently two potential mechanisms for negative regulation of the zzso zzso one involving zzso of its zzso domain by the zzso protein and the other involving zzso of its zzso region by a different zzso
