zzso receptors are zzso membrane proteins that function as zzso channels gated by zzso zzso We have engineered a zzso zzso that opens within milliseconds by zzso at 440 zzso and rapidly closes at 360 zzso This requires bridging zzso zzso via zzso attachment of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso introduced into each second zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso pushes apart the outer ends of the zzso zzso and opens the channel in a zzso zzso zzso channels exhibited similar zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso and dye zzso as zzso receptors activated by zzso zzso receptors with an equivalent zzso zzso were also light sensitive after chemical zzso They showed typical rapid zzso and they could zzso with native zzso zzso in zzso cells to form zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar approach was used to open and close human zzso zzso channels zzso which are also zzso but are unrelated in sequence to zzso zzso The experiments indicate that the opening of the zzso zzso requires similar and substantial movements of the zzso zzso in both zzso receptors and zzso and the method will allow precise optical control of zzso receptors or zzso in intact zzso
