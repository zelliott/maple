zzso mosaic virus zzso is one of the most serious virus diseases of zzso However, little is known about the molecular basis of the soybean defense mechanism against this zzso We identified zzso expressed proteins in soybean leaves infected with zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein spots that showed zzso difference in intensity were identified between zzso and zzso zzso Among them, 16 spots were zzso and 12 spots were zzso in the zzso zzso We recovered 25 of the 28 zzso expressed proteins from two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso These spots were identified as 16 different proteins by zzso assisted laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and tandem zzso zzso and were potentially involved in protein degradation, defense signal transfer, zzso zzso cell wall zzso and energy and metabolism zzso Gene expression analysis of 13 genes by quantitative real time zzso chain reaction zzso showed that metabolism genes and photosynthesis genes were zzso at all time zzso One energy gene was zzso whereas another energy gene was zzso at five of the six time zzso The other interesting genes that were altered by zzso infection showed changes in zzso over zzso This is the first extensive application of zzso to the zzso zzso These results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis of zzso responses to zzso
