Although occasional DNA zzso have been observed in zzso mice, zzso and zzso mice have two zzso zzso at over 1/3 of zzso zzso zzso Since DNA zzso were not detected in zzso zzso and zzso the frequency of zzso zzso appears to be strain zzso Thus, genetic studies in zzso mice require testing for zzso zzso The zzso detected in zzso mice appear to be stable and do not represent zzso instability or a zzso zzso zzso zzso was not observed and no more than two zzso were detected per zzso zzso zzso only by zzso mating maintained seven of eight zzso over 5 zzso These data suggest that the zzso are due to an inherited trait and that the pattern of inheritance is not due to zzso zzso As breeding analysis was not performed, the pattern of zzso inheritance is zzso
