Rice zzso zzso zzso a model plant belonging to the family zzso is a staple food for a majority of the people zzso Grown in the tropical and zzso regions of the world, this important cereal crop is under constant and serious threat from both zzso and zzso zzso Among the zzso threats, zzso zzso zzso zzso causing the damaging bacterial blight disease in rice, is a prominent zzso The zzso gene in the host plant rice zzso zzso resistance to this zzso This zzso gene belongs to the zzso gene family of rice and encodes a gamma zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso In view of the importance of this gene in zzso resistance to the devastating disease, we reconstructed the zzso relationship of this zzso developed a three-dimensional protein model, followed by long-term molecular dynamics simulation studies to gain a better understanding of the evolution, structure, and function of zzso The modeled structure was found to fit well with the small zzso of zzso from human, suggesting that it may also act as a small zzso of zzso in zzso The model had a stable zzso in response to the atomic flexibility and interaction, when subjected to MD simulation at 20 zzso second in zzso zzso Further structural analysis of zzso indicated that the protein retained its basic zzso factor function, suggesting that it might govern a novel zzso responsible for bacterial blight zzso Future molecular zzso studies of zzso zzso with its corresponding zzso gene is expected to shed more direct light into zzso interactions at the molecular level and thus pave the way for richer zzso zzso
