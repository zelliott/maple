In order to develop potent shortened zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso relationship of zzso truncated zzso of zzso was investigated by examining the binding activity to rat lung zzso receptors and relaxation of smooth muscle in isolated mouse zzso zzso showed zzso zzso binding activity comparable to that of zzso but the activity of zzso was reduced to one-third of zzso The zzso binding activity of zzso to zzso was reduced in proportion to the decrease in zzso acid zzso There was a significant correlation between the number of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso binding activities of zzso and its zzso truncated zzso zzso and zzso exhibited little binding activity even at high zzso suggesting the requisite of 23 zzso acid zzso as the minimal essential sequence for the conservation of zzso zzso binding zzso The chemical modification of zzso generated a potent zzso zzso 20, zzso zzso that displayed a zzso higher zzso binding activity and zzso more potent relaxation of mouse stomach than zzso zzso In conclusion, it was shown that zzso 20, zzso zzso could be a relatively potent and stable zzso of zzso zzso The present study has provided further insight into the zzso relationship of zzso to generate novel shortened zzso zzso having a high affinity to zzso receptors and potent pharmacological zzso
