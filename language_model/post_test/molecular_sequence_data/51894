The B gene encodes a zzso factor of the basic zzso class, which controls the synthesis of the zzso zzso in zzso This zzso as well as the highly zzso R gene family, displays extensive zzso variation in that different zzso cause distinct zzso of zzso zzso in different zzso and at different zzso zzso The analysis of the expression of two B zzso with distinct zzso patterns of zzso synthesis in plant and seed zzso demonstrates that the amount of B transcripts zzso with the zzso of zzso in the various zzso The comparison of the zzso clones for the two zzso reveals high sequence identity in the coding and zzso regions zzso and approximately zzso zzso In contrast, the most zzso region of their zzso and the zzso sequences share no significant sequence zzso This result suggests that the zzso zzso from each other by complex zzso zzso rather than by simple base pair zzso We have used the high zzso zzso transformation zzso to demonstrate that the differential expression of the two zzso in the seed is determined by their zzso zzso zzso Thus, the variation in zzso zzso synthesis in plants with these different B zzso is controlled at the level of B gene zzso
