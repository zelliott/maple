This study zzso the expressed zzso class II zzso gene and its genetic variation in zzso 2 among 59 Alpine zzso zzso zzso zzso from several locations in the Eastern zzso plus one population in the Western zzso The expressed zzso gene contains all the expected characteristics including all of the zzso zzso found in other zzso zzso The isolated expressed zzso gene from zzso can be considered zzso to zzso class II zzso genes in other zzso zzso Cattle zzso yielded zzso 2 sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed 19 zzso zzso 2 zzso among 59 zzso zzso exhibited a high degree of zzso and zzso acid zzso with most zzso acid variations occurring at positions forming the zzso zzso A significantly higher rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso than synonymous zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated positive selection for diversity in the zzso zzso
