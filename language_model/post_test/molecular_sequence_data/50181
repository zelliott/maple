To investigate whether the ratio of fetal cells in the maternal circulation differs before and after the blood passes through the maternal zzso 

We performed zzso chain zzso zzso analysis of DNA derived from zzso vein blood obtained before and 2 hours after zzso delivery, and from zzso vein blood obtained during zzso of 14 women carrying male zzso 

Fetal DNA was detected in 17 tested specimens and, as estimated by comparison with parallel dilution series, the zzso DNA ratio was zzso to zzso However, there was no significant difference in the amount of zzso DNA zzso between zzso vein blood and peripheral blood after zzso chain reaction and Southern zzso In DNA derived from peripheral blood after delivery, the intensity of zzso fetal DNA sequences was also not significantly zzso 

Our results argue against the zzso hypothesis of different ratios of fetal to maternal DNA in the zzso vein versus peripheral blood, and indicate that even delivery does not seem to increase the flow of fetal cells into the maternal zzso
