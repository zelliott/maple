The purpose of this study was to investigate genetic variation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by partial sequencing of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is poorly zzso zzso only six zzso were available for zzso Additional sequences were amplified from DNA extracted from fixed zzso zzso from 26 patients with zzso evidence of zzso zzso and from the zzso of six zzso primates zzso Multiple zzso from sites along the large zzso were tested from three of the 26 zzso zzso from two zzso were closely related to those of the zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were generated from the zzso from the other 24 patients, and four from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were divided into three zzso 1, 2 and 4, with individual sequence similarities to the type strain ranging from zzso to 100 zzso All human zzso of zzso zzso were located in cluster 1, as was the sequence of the so-called zzso zzso All four zzso zzso sequences from the zzso zzso and the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso were located in cluster 4, which was zzso zzso 4 may represent a novel zzso zzso Evidence for multiple strains of zzso zzso or other zzso species was found in zzso from two zzso In the three individuals from whom multiple zzso were zzso the sequences at each zzso site were the same, indicating the presence of one dominant zzso
