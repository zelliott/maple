In the present paper we describe the identification of an zzso zzso that appears to be associated with the surface membrane of the zzso zzso zzso probably implicated in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso cells by zzso relative to a zzso zzso The zzso was specifically recognized by zzso of the zzso from 80 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins of about 60 and 40 zzso from zzso and zzso zzso forms, zzso It is likely that the zzso and zzso proteins are processed from zzso zzso since the zzso zzso protein zzso in the range of zzso zzso from in zzso translation products of zzso zzso zzso
