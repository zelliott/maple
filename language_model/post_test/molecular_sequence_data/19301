In comparative zzso gene order data is often modeled as signed zzso A classical problem for zzso comparison is to detect common intervals in permutations, that is, genes that are zzso in several species, indicating that they remained grouped during zzso A second largely studied problem related to gene order is to zzso a minimum scenario of zzso that zzso a signed zzso into zzso Several studies began to mix the two problems and it was observed that their results are not always zzso Often, zzso scenarios of zzso break common zzso If a scenario does not break any common zzso it is called zzso In two recent studies, zzso et zzso defined a class of permutations for which building a perfect scenario of zzso sorting a zzso was achieved in zzso time and stated as an open question whether it is possible to zzso given a zzso if there exists a minimum scenario of zzso that is zzso In this paper, we give a solution to this problem and prove that this widens the class of permutations addressed by the aforementioned zzso We implemented and tested this zzso on gene order data of zzso from several zzso species and we compared it to other zzso The zzso helps to choose among several possible scenarios of zzso and indicates that the minimum scenario of zzso is not always the most zzso
