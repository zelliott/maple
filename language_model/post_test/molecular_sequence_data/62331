zzso cells constantly have to fight against internal zzso In zzso this task is mainly performed by the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso which activates in a cooperative manner when cells become zzso Despite its biological importance, the mechanism of this zzso is still poorly zzso the most commonly accepted hypothesis being the existence of a zzso site on the internal face of the zzso This work zzso zzso that lead to a zzso form of the zzso and demonstrates that zzso zzso is best described by a zzso concerted mechanism for a zzso zzso During zzso zzso a zzso form of zzso is converted into a form possessing a higher affinity for zzso zzso with no requirement for an additional zzso site on the zzso This new mechanism also explains the zzso of the zzso by growth signals, which shift the equilibrium towards the zzso zzso
