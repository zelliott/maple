A zzso factor, termed zzso zzso was highly zzso directly from the plasma of zzso zzso 1,100 rats by measuring the production of zzso from a highly enriched population of rat zzso zzso cells zzso The rat plasma zzso is a zzso and strongly zzso The total activity and zzso yields obtained were about zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the two zzso fragments prepared from the zzso 19 zzso zzso were zzso and used for the cloning of rat and human zzso zzso It was found that the 19 zzso zzso was truncated but comprised at least zzso zzso zzso The sequence of human zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was identical to the zzso zzso Both rat and human zzso expressed in zzso cells exhibited significant activity toward the zzso in zzso and were active in stimulating zzso production in zzso These results indicate that a zzso factor originally found in the zzso rat plasma is a zzso for the rat zzso
