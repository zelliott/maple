zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein first recognized as having elevated zzso content in zzso cells transformed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies have implicated zzso in the control of normal cell behavior through its roles in zzso signal zzso and organization of the zzso zzso at sites of cell zzso In this study, we sought to gain new insight into normal zzso function by identifying previously zzso interacting zzso A zzso zzso screen using the zzso region of zzso as a bait identified the zzso zzso 3 zzso domain of the mouse zzso zzso to a human protein whose loss of function leads to the zzso kidney disease familial juvenile zzso The putative full-length mouse and partial canine zzso sequences were deduced from zzso zzso Additional studies using zzso mouse zzso indicated that zzso and zzso can interact in zzso cells and revealed that both proteins prominently zzso at or near sites of zzso contact in polarized zzso canine kidney zzso zzso Our findings provide novel insight into the normal cellular activities regulated by both zzso and zzso and raise the possibility that these proteins have a related function in polarized zzso zzso
