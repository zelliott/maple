In order to characterize the zzso zzso zzso and approximately 500 zzso zzso coli positions 27 to zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences of 28 type strains and 64 reference strains of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso obtained from zzso strains were divided into nine clusters zzso zzso with a similarity of zzso zzso zzso containing 17 species, was further subdivided into 22 zzso with a similarity of zzso In the zzso zzso four groups were shown according to Miyake et zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso type group, zzso the zzso zzso group, zzso the zzso zzso group, and zzso the zzso zzso group, which showed higher than zzso similarity of the zzso zzso gene sequences in each zzso Using zzso analysis, unique zzso were obtained from these species, and they could be separated by cluster zzso zzso of six zzso zzso strains were separated into different zzso and also showed diversity in zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso The nine strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into five zzso Each type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and two intermediate groups, which were suggested by zzso et zzso consisted of individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be separated by zzso using zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is able to provide another characteristic of zzso strains in addition to zzso zzso gene sequence zzso analysis, and this information suggests that zzso analysis is a useful tool for the characterization of zzso species in combination with other techniques for zzso zzso
