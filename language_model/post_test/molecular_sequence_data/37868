zzso zzso catalyze the biological zzso zzso of two zzso molecules to form zzso This is one of the fundamental categories of carbon skeletal assembly patterns in biological systems and is the first step in many zzso pathways including those which generate cholesterol, steroid hormones and zzso body energy storage zzso High resolution crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were determined zzso in the absence of active site zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso from protein zzso which were flash frozen after a short soak with zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In the latter structure, a reaction intermediate was zzso the zzso was found to be zzso at zzso and a zzso of zzso was bound in the active site zzso A comparison of the three new structures and the two previously published zzso structures reveals that small adjustments in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso allow zzso and zzso to adopt identical modes of zzso The proximity of the zzso zzso of zzso to the sulfur atom of zzso supports the hypothesis that zzso is important for zzso exchange in both steps of the zzso The zzso oxygen atom of the zzso zzso points into an zzso hole formed by the nitrogen atoms of zzso and zzso thus zzso the zzso zzso The interaction between the zzso oxygen atom of zzso and zzso assists the zzso step of zzso by stabilizing a negative charge on the zzso oxygen zzso Our structure of zzso bound to zzso also highlights the importance in zzso of a hydrogen bonding network between zzso and zzso which includes the zzso oxygen atom of zzso and extends from the zzso site through the zzso to the opposite molecular zzso This hydrogen bonding network is different in zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso properties of each zzso may be modulated by differences in their hydrogen bonding zzso
