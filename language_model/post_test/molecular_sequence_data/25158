The envelope protein of the human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso is highly zzso among the zzso zzso so far, as opposed to what is observed for the human zzso virus zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso we have produced 33 random zzso along the zzso envelope zzso cloned into a zzso expression zzso The resulting envelope products were zzso by zzso and zzso formation after zzso into zzso zzso We show here that 25 out of 33 zzso result in a zzso envelope product as assessed by the lack of ability to form zzso In the majority of these zzso the processing of the envelope zzso precursor into the mature zzso and zzso proteins was zzso We propose that zzso constraints for processing and fusion abilities tend to limit the zzso of the zzso zzso In three zzso processing was observed but no zzso were zzso These zzso might affect regions important for zzso envelope functions, such as the zzso binding zzso
