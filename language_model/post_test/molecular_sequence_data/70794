zzso provide an attractive system for the study of zzso sensory zzso We have identified a novel family of seven zzso domain zzso zzso by 100 to 200 zzso that is likely to represent the family of zzso zzso zzso Members of this gene family are expressed in zzso defined zzso of zzso sensory zzso in either the antenna or the zzso zzso zzso zzso express different zzso of zzso zzso such that individual zzso are functionally zzso The isolation of candidate zzso zzso genes along with a genetic analysis of zzso behavior in insects may ultimately afford a system to understand the zzso link between odor recognition and zzso
