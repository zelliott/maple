The full complement of zzso zzso factor zzso including genes and zzso was determined from the analysis of 10 complete zzso from flowering plants, zzso zzso zzso green algae, and red zzso Our exhaustive zzso searches resulted in the discovery in each class of a greater number of zzso genes than previously zzso All zzso genes can be zzso classified by sequence evolutionary analysis into 14 distinct classes also characterized by zzso zzso structure and by unique zzso zzso We identified many new genes belonging to previously defined classes zzso I to IV, zzso zzso zzso zzso Other newly identified genes allowed us to characterize zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes as members of four new evolutionary classes and to define two additional classes, which we named zzso and zzso Our comprehensive analysis allowed us to identify several newly characterized zzso zzso including novel zinc finger motifs in zzso and zzso Members of the zzso and zzso classes were found in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso We found representatives of the zzso zzso and zzso classes only in green plants, including zzso green algae, zzso and vascular zzso All 14 zzso gene classes were represented in flowering plants, zzso and zzso suggesting that they had already differentiated in the last common zzso of moss and vascular zzso
