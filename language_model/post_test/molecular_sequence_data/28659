zzso between sister zzso is established during S phase and maintained through zzso phase until it is resolved in zzso (for review, see zzso In zzso zzso a complex consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso called zzso mediates the connection between sister zzso The evolutionary zzso zzso protein zzso is required for establishment of sister zzso cohesion during S phase but not for its further maintenance during zzso or M zzso or for loading the zzso complex onto zzso We address the molecular functions of zzso with sensitive sequence zzso techniques, including hidden zzso model domain zzso zzso We found a zzso architecture with an zzso zzso zzso zzso domain and an approximately 150 zzso zzso domain with an apparent zzso zzso A binding motif zzso zzso tests confirm that zzso has the zzso activity in zzso In zzso zzso zzso itself and components of the zzso complex but not zzso Thus, the establishment of cohesion between sister zzso appears to be zzso directly or zzso by a specific zzso
