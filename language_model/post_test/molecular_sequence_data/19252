Cell survival depends on the cell's ability to zzso to zzso zzso zzso We studied the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso and generates zzso by comparing zzso zzso zzso cells with strains with reduced zzso zzso In the wild type, zzso zzso zzso accumulates under P zzso zzso with reduced zzso zzso zzso strains do not exhibit zzso variation under these conditions, suggesting that in the wild type zzso limits zzso zzso under P zzso zzso levels appear to be zzso by the P response regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso because in zzso zzso cells, zzso declines under P limitation and zzso expression is not zzso zzso cells begin to lose viability after 24 h of P zzso suggesting that zzso is important for cellular zzso zzso strains do not have enhanced sensitivity to other zzso or zzso zzso and their zzso and cell growth zzso are not observed under P stress with zzso a zzso analog that blocks the stress zzso In contrast with zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso levels declined under P zzso suggesting that P zzso occurs from DNA rather than zzso This unusual phenomenon, which is zzso and zzso may have evolved as a result of the zzso nature of zzso and the requirement of P for zzso degradation by zzso
