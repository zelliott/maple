zzso zzso zzso a zzso of budding zzso zzso encodes a zzso break repair zzso which is zzso for zzso zzso however, have recently obtained a cell division cycle zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso designated zzso which resulted from a point zzso in the zzso coding sequence leading to one zzso acid zzso We have subsequently isolated zzso and its novel zzso zzso as zzso zzso of this zzso zzso suppresses all the defects of cells lacking zzso zzso type zzso zzso cells lacking either zzso or zzso are viable, but those lacking both genes are zzso and arrest proliferation with a cell division cycle zzso At the zzso temperature, a zzso culture of zzso cells performs DNA synthesis without delay and arrests with zzso seemingly intact and replication completed and with a high level of zzso zzso However, zzso cells show a typical S phase arrest zzso if combined with the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso genetically interacts with zzso which encodes the large zzso of replication protein zzso zzso of zzso or the presence of zzso zzso decreases the restriction temperature of zzso cells by 4-6 degrees C and leads to cell cycle arrest with zzso incompletely zzso Thus, in zzso zzso a zzso break repair component is required for a certain step of zzso replication zzso to repair, partly via interacting with replication protein zzso
