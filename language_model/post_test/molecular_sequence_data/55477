The evidence for the existence of zzso zzso opens up a new field for a better understanding of neural zzso Based on our theory, we have discovered main triplets of zzso acid zzso in zzso receptors of marine zzso which appear also as zzso in several zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso The obtained results probably mean a general molecular mechanism for zzso interactions in zzso originated from the lowest animals zzso zzso
