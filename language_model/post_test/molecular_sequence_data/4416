An improved zzso cassette from zzso zzso has been constructed containing zzso zzso and zzso genes but excluding the zzso zzso which should results in increased stability by suppression of the zzso zzso This cassette was included in both suicide and zzso plasmids and used for integration in zzso zzso Suicide plasmids containing this cassette integrated at a single site zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso site has been determined and was identified as a putative zzso zzso zzso plasmids containing the cassette integrated both at the same zzso site and at other different sites, often giving rise to simultaneous integration at two zzso A second integration site zzso has been zzso which was located in the region zzso zzso zzso of one of the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso
