We have previously identified a zzso zzso that binds to highly zzso sequences zzso and H zzso in the 3' untranslated regions zzso of zzso zzso and suppresses in zzso translation of zzso zzso that contain these zzso This zzso zzso zzso protein zzso also is abundant in brain and binds to brain zzso whose 3' zzso contain similar zzso Here we show that zzso binds specific zzso to zzso zzso in zzso When zzso is added to zzso zzso from either crude brain extracts or from zzso zzso most of the zzso binds to zzso The association of zzso with zzso requires the assembly of zzso and is diminished by zzso zzso D, and high levels of zzso zzso from the 3' zzso of three zzso that contain the zzso sequence elements zzso for zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso basic zzso are linked by zzso to zzso whereas transcripts that lack the zzso sequences do not bind zzso We conclude that zzso serves as an attachment protein for the zzso association of specific zzso Considering its ability to arrest translation in zzso we propose that zzso functions in the storage and transportation of zzso to specific zzso sites where they are zzso
