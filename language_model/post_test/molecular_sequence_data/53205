Previous studies indicated that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso region elicits T cells capable of eliminating infected zzso in zzso zzso we report that the zzso sequence contains an zzso binding zzso which binds zzso zzso molecules in zzso with low affinity zzso 267 zzso and encodes an zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice with three doses of a multiple zzso zzso zzso construct containing four branches of zzso acids 57 to 70 linked to a zzso core zzso and zzso as the zzso induced both zzso proliferation and a zzso zzso response that was zzso specific, zzso zzso and zzso T cell zzso zzso with either DNA zzso the zzso or zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso zzso is zzso since it is not recognized in the context of whole zzso zzso The biological relevance of this zzso response was zzso by the demonstration that it could mediate genetically zzso zzso and zzso elimination of infected zzso in zzso as well as partial protection of zzso mice against zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso with low major zzso complex affinity can be used to engineer zzso vaccines and have implications for the selection of zzso for zzso zzso
