zzso binding in the minor groove of DNA by small molecules is a growing area of research with possible therapeutic zzso By selectively binding to DNA sequences required by critical zzso factors, these small molecules could potentially zzso the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso targeting of a critical zzso factor of a selected gene requires an understanding of the preferred sequence of the DNA binding zzso As new compounds are being zzso there is a need to evaluate their DNA recognition zzso We sought to establish a procedure to determine sequence preference of compounds with previously unknown binding zzso A novel procedure for determining the optimal DNA binding sequence of minor groove binding compounds is described zzso The zzso also allows for determination of the binding affinity to a particular zzso
