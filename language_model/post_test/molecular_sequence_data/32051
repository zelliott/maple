The zzso blood group is important in blood zzso Recently, an zzso zzso regulatory element has been identified in the first zzso of zzso using zzso reporter zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulatory activity of the element was dependent upon zzso zzso In addition, partial deletion of zzso 1 including the element was observed in zzso zzso obtained from 111 zzso and zzso individuals, except for one, whereas the deletion was never found among zzso individuals with the common zzso 

In this study, further investigation was performed to reveal the underlying mechanism responsible for reduction of B zzso expression in the exceptional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was carried out to amplify the zzso zzso followed by sequence zzso zzso mobility zzso and promoter zzso were performed to examine whether a zzso substitution reduced the binding of a zzso factor and induced loss of function of the zzso 

zzso determination revealed one point zzso of the zzso motif in the zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso showed that the zzso abolished the binding of zzso zzso factors, and the promoter zzso demonstrated complete loss of zzso activity of the zzso 

These observations suggest that the zzso in the zzso motif of the zzso regulatory element may diminish the binding of zzso zzso factors and down regulate zzso activity of the element on the B zzso leading to reduction of B zzso expression in zzso lineage cells of the zzso zzso
