We used zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct sequencing of the coding region of the zzso zzso and gene to detect zzso causing zzso zzso zzso in five zzso zzso zzso Four patients presented with zzso zzso one with an early infantile form of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was further confirmed in this zzso zzso zzso were observed in patients of related zzso Previously unknown zzso detected were zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso + zzso zzso showed zzso zzso inclusion of zzso 7 or skipping of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcribed from the zzso and zzso zzso was zzso We detected a zzso change in the 3' zzso region of the zzso in the zzso of the two consensus zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed equal usage of two alternative zzso zzso The zzso substitution did not influence zzso choice, nor the amount of stable zzso zzso The finding that 2 out of 30 normal controls carried the zzso zzso indicated that the zzso substitution is a harmless zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were constructed in zzso and used to zzso zzso cells zzso Both zzso completely abolished zzso zzso
