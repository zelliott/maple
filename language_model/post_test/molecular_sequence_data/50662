zzso zzso from zzso and flat zzso at different locations on the zzso zzso (10 zzso and in cervical zzso zzso zzso grades 1-2 (6 zzso were zzso for zzso types 6 and 11 DNA and zzso The presence of zzso species which could zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins was determined using the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technique with zzso that flank previously mapped or predicted zzso zzso The state of the viral DNA in the tumor zzso was established by Southern zzso zzso We could detect the various zzso species in zzso from zzso associated with both zzso zzso The size of the zzso zzso products were in agreement with the previously mapped zzso sites of zzso recovered from an experimental zzso induced by zzso The major viral transcript zzso the zzso protein was detected in all the tumor zzso From the rare transcripts the rate of detection of zzso species zzso the zzso zzso proteins was the zzso In 2 of 6 zzso zzso zzso only the major viral transcript was zzso The overall results of this study suggest that early gene products of zzso types 6 and 11 may be important in the induction of cellular proliferation and zzso differentiation but these possibly may not be required for the development of the zzso cervical zzso
