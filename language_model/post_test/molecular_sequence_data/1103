zzso protein zzso is the zzso transport protein present in zzso The available crystal structures of different forms of zzso have provided details of the interactions of this binding protein with retinol, zzso and zzso zzso one of the plasma carriers of zzso zzso The core of zzso is a zzso the cavity of which zzso retinol, establishing with its buried portions zzso zzso Instead, the zzso zzso is near the protein surface, in the region of the entrance zzso surrounding the opening of the binding zzso and zzso in polar zzso The stability of the zzso complex appears to be further enhanced when zzso is bound to zzso zzso the region of the entrance zzso represents the contact area of zzso interacting with the zzso counterpart, such that the zzso of the zzso vitamin becomes fully buried in the zzso zzso Limited protein zzso changes affecting the entrance zzso which lead to a decrease or loss of the binding affinity of zzso for zzso have been demonstrated for zzso and zzso in complex with zzso modified in the area of the zzso zzso A relatively small number of zzso acid zzso of zzso essentially confined to the region of the entrance zzso and of zzso appear to play a critical role in the formation of the zzso complex, as established by zzso studies, zzso analysis, and zzso acid sequence analysis of zzso distant zzso and zzso Overall, the available evidence indicates the existence of a high degree of zzso between zzso and zzso the contact areas of which are highly sensitive to zzso changes and zzso acid zzso
