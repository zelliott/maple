We analyzed the structure and function of the zzso zzso region of the human type 2 zzso zzso zzso Two major zzso start sites were identified at zzso from the zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso gene efficiently directed zzso in transient zzso studies, using zzso as reporter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly reduced by deleting the region containing a zzso zzso element zzso located zzso from zzso zzso treatment significantly increased zzso activity in cells zzso with zzso zzso This effect was abolished in zzso that did not contain zzso or contained the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis in zzso cells revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was markedly increased after stimulation with zzso zzso The zzso mobility shift zzso with zzso probe and zzso zzso nuclear extract showed the occurrence of a zzso complex, which was zzso by specific zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a dominant negative inhibitor of zzso completely inhibited zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso once zzso with zzso promoter construct and zzso in zzso zzso cells, which are unresponsive to zzso was able to stimulate the zzso gene zzso These results indicate the existence of a functional promoter within the zzso zzso region of zzso gene which is characterized by the presence of a zzso The specific involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso gene promoter induction also has been zzso
