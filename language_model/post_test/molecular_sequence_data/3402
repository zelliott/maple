zzso of zzso zzso were some of the most widely used zzso Despite reduction in their production and use, zzso zzso present a serious environmental zzso In this study, two bacterial zzso zzso and zzso that can grow on zzso as a sole source of carbon and energy were isolated from an enrichment zzso In liquid cultures of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso removal of zzso respectively, were achieved in 2 zzso zzso was identified as zzso zzso by zzso zzso gene sequence analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso substantially zzso both zzso and zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso in liquid zzso After 8 weeks of incubation in liquid culture, zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso declined, respectively, at an initial concentration of 150 zzso zzso In soil slurry cultures of zzso zzso simulating a soil slurry phase zzso treatment, substantial decreases in the levels of the zzso zzso were observed at zzso of zzso zzso zzso After 9 weeks, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were achieved at 150 zzso zzso Using two zzso zzso zzso targeting the 330 zzso region of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso an approximately 330 zzso zzso product was successfully amplified from DNA templates prepared from bacterial colonies and soil slurry zzso This system provides a direct and rapid zzso molecular tool for tracking zzso zzso strain zzso in water and zzso These results have implied implications for the treatment of zzso and water contaminated with zzso zzso
