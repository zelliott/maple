Analysis of a group of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveals the presence of zzso zzso that share significant zzso acid sequence zzso The data suggest that these zzso evolved from a common zzso which may be a protein containing a single zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of this zzso domain may have contributed to the functional diversification of zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicated that zzso and plant zzso binding zzso do not share significant zzso acid sequence zzso suggesting that they are not zzso However, both the zzso and the plant zzso zzso are zzso and have several highly zzso aromatic zzso In plants, zzso have been zzso in maintaining protein folding and aromatic zzso acids in interacting with zzso zzso zzso zzso G, Wright zzso (1991) J zzso zzso zzso It is likely that these zzso perform similar functions in zzso We propose that the zzso and the plant zzso zzso share similar mechanisms for folding and zzso binding and that they evolved by zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that the zzso bonds and aromatic zzso are hallmarks for zzso zzso
