We have previously described a zzso zzso zzso zzso which enhances zzso A production at the zzso zzso We have also described another zzso zzso which is transcribed zzso from zzso and interferes with the enhancement of zzso A synthesis by zzso However, the mechanisms through which zzso and/or zzso are regulated is not zzso In this study, we attempted (by using the DNA gel shift zzso to determine if zzso zzso contains a potential regulatory protein that binds specifically to the zzso or zzso upstream zzso In the initial analysis, zzso gel shift bands were detected when a probe containing the zzso zzso region was incubated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The strongest binding activity was detected with a smaller zzso that represents the zzso upstream zzso Additional deletion analysis localized the binding to a zzso zzso immediately upstream of zzso The gel shift band was not detected when the zzso zzso was incubated with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the binding band was zzso when a zzso carrying zzso intact was introduced into zzso In addition, the gel shift band was detected when the zzso zzso was incubated with a zzso of zzso coli in which zzso was zzso from the zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression was examined by using a zzso fusion zzso The level of zzso activity produced by zzso carrying the fusion zzso was zzso to fivefold higher than that produced by zzso carrying the same zzso Using zzso I zzso analysis, the binding region was specified to a zzso zzso Within the fragment, a zzso zzso sequence exists that may function as a zzso binding zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso its synthesis by binding to a specific sequence within the zzso upstream zzso
