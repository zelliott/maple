The zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso was zzso and clearly shown to have the same zzso and dynamic properties with natural zzso except for zzso with CD zzso This zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso an zzso DNA zzso drug, but was able to bind to the DNA binding domain of zzso to a similar extent with the natural zzso These results strongly suggest the importance of the other zzso than the DNA binding domain for the specific DNA recognition of zzso Thus, zzso are useful for the study of zzso zzso
