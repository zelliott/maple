zzso zzso can be zzso at zzso 23 and/or 24 in the zzso region of bovine zzso zzso When isolated freshly it is composed of a mixture of zzso two zzso and zzso zzso At neutral pH the zzso form carrying zzso at zzso 24 yields a resonance signal at zzso zzso and that carrying zzso at zzso 23 at zzso zzso the two zzso groups of the zzso form yield only one zzso signal at zzso zzso From the chemical shift dependence on zzso zzso values have been estimated to be zzso and zzso for the zzso groups at zzso 24 and zzso 23, zzso Both zzso of the zzso form exhibit very similar zzso values of approximately zzso zzso of zzso I from the complex results in a downfield shift and the appearance of two zzso signals at positions comparable to those of the two zzso zzso Complex formation of cardiac zzso I with C or T does not alter the spectrum obtained with isolated zzso zzso however, the original zzso spectrum is restored by zzso of the zzso from all three components zzso I, and zzso Two signals are also observed with a zzso synthetic zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso zzso values of about zzso and zzso have been determined for zzso 7 zzso to zzso 24 of zzso I) and zzso 6 of the zzso zzso to zzso 23 of zzso zzso
