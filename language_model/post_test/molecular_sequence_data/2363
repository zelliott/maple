The zzso circuit of zzso zzso consists of a set of zzso structural genes which zzso zzso zzso and two major regulatory genes which govern their zzso The zzso zzso regulatory gene is required to turn on the expression of the zzso zzso whereas the other regulatory zzso zzso acts in a negative fashion to repress the synthesis of the same set of zzso zzso of the zzso regulatory gene was found to be controlled by zzso and by sulfur zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene was determined and can be translated to yield a protein of molecular weight zzso which displays significant zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and sea zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the putative zzso protein has a zzso zzso zzso element plus an adjacent charged region which together may make up a zzso zzso A zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso of zzso for basic zzso acids within the charged region and thus may alter zzso properties of the zzso zzso
