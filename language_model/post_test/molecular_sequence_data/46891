In zzso zzso the genes zzso zzso zzso are organized in a cluster of about zzso zzso linked copies per zzso zzso The zzso transcripts are processed by zzso and zzso and zzso a zzso of 111 zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed during the zzso zzso and are present at higher levels in dividing zzso and zzso slender forms than in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso levels during the zzso differentiation from zzso to zzso forms revealed that the abundance of these transcripts is regulated through the zzso reaching maximum levels during zzso zzso of zzso to zzso forms in culture specifically decreased zzso zzso levels by about zzso an effect not linked to its 3' untranslated zzso zzso of protein synthesis prevented this zzso
