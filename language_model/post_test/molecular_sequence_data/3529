A model of the zzso recognition domain of the serum form of zzso protein zzso from rat zzso with zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso for the bound sugar were derived from simulated zzso protocols incorporating distance restraints zzso from transferred zzso zzso The resulting sugar zzso were then modeled into the zzso binding site, and these models of the complex were refined using molecular dynamics zzso simulations in the presence of zzso zzso These studies indicate that only one of the two major zzso of the zzso linkage found in solution is significantly populated in the bound state zzso zzso 60 degrees ), whereas the zzso linkage samples at least two states, similar to its behavior in free zzso The bound zzso allows direct hydrogen bonds to form between the sugar and zzso of zzso in addition to other zzso hydrogen zzso Estimates of binding zzso of candidate complexes based on changes in zzso surface areas upon binding support the zzso and MD zzso These estimates further suggest that the zzso gains of the additional zzso interactions in a zzso as opposed to a zzso are offset by zzso penalties, offering an explanation for previous binding zzso
