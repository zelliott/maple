In zzso gene transfer into various zzso of zzso animals has recently been zzso We applied this technique in order to map the promoter element of the zzso zzso in the zzso that responds to left zzso pressure overload in zzso Beating rat hearts were directly injected with a zzso zzso containing a zzso pair upstream regulatory element of the mouse zzso gene fused to a reporter zzso Two days after the injection, the hearts were excised and zzso Acute pressure overload was applied for 2 h by inflating an zzso zzso zzso overload increased the zzso reporter gene activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and point zzso in the serum response element zzso of the zzso promoter resulted in loss of zzso reporter gene zzso indicating that the zzso is necessary for pressure zzso The zzso alone was sufficient to zzso pressure responsiveness to the minimal zzso promoter, confirming that the pressure response element zzso with the zzso A construct containing a point zzso at the zzso binding site of the zzso did not respond to pressure overload or to a protein zzso C zzso but retained responsiveness to a calcium zzso This suggests that pressure overload may activate the zzso promoter by a protein zzso zzso zzso Thus, a directly injected gene can be regulated in the host cells by a physical stimulus to the intact zzso The in zzso DNA injection technique is a useful method to study complex organ physiology at the molecular zzso
