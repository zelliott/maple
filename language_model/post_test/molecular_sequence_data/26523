zzso is a very rare progressive zzso disorder caused by zzso of zzso zzso zzso I, resulting from zzso in the zzso zzso Until now, some zzso were reported worldwide and none of them were of Southeast Asian zzso Furthermore, most reported zzso were point zzso and a few others deletions or zzso 

This study aims at identifying the zzso zzso in the zzso gene of Malaysian patients with zzso 

We employed a series of zzso zzso and direct sequencing in order to identify the zzso We subsequently used quantitative real-time zzso to determine the copy number of the zzso zzso the zzso We blasted our sequencing data with that of the reference sequence in the zzso in order to obtain zzso insights of the zzso 

We found a novel complex zzso involving zzso inversion and gross deletion of zzso zzso zzso commonly shared by 5 patients with zzso each originating from different zzso None of the affected families share known relationship with each other, although four of the five patients were known to have zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first report of complex zzso in the zzso Further analyses showing that the patients have shared the same geographic origin within the northeastern part of Malaysia prompted us to suggest a simple molecular screening of zzso within related zzso using a long-range zzso
