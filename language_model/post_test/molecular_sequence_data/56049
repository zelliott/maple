zzso zzso insect cells zzso containing the zzso integrated human beta zzso zzso gene under the control of the zzso zzso promoter expressed up to 350,000 human zzso The number of receptors did not change with cell density or age of zzso The zzso receptors zzso in the insect cells were functional with respect to their zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso of the receptors to zzso zzso proteins is demonstrated by zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso zzso activity in the transformed insect zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso protein appears to be of the zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso alpha zzso of zzso zzso proteins zzso with the insect alpha zzso of zzso zzso which also exhibits the same apparent molecular mass as its zzso zzso The beta zzso of zzso proteins from insect cells zzso with zzso serum directed against the zzso zzso acids of the zzso beta zzso of zzso zzso but is about approximately 2 zzso larger than that of the beta zzso of zzso proteins from bovine zzso Exposure of the transformed insect cells to zzso rapidly zzso zzso and zzso of zzso of the zzso expressed zzso In contrast to the situation in zzso cells, prolonged exposure of the zzso (24 zzso does not result in down regulation of the remaining zzso of the zzso
