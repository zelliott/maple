Two major zzso are generated during the zzso of inclusion bodies of zzso bovine zzso zzso These zzso represent the major part of the inactive high molecular weight species that are formed in this zzso The structures of the two zzso are zzso determined by zzso mapping using zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso reduction zzso zzso indicate that the formation of both zzso involves the large zzso loop zzso The zzso zzso from zzso previously reported as a large loop zzso zzso was revised to be an zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the first zzso zzso is a zzso in which two zzso are held together by the interlocking of the two large zzso zzso
