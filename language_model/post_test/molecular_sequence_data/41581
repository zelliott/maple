zzso mechanisms such as DNA zzso are known to regulate important zzso processes in higher zzso However, little is known about the necessity and role of this process in early land zzso Using the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the impact of loss of zzso zzso on the overall development in zzso was zzso It is observed that various aspects of growth and differentiation during zzso development become zzso A search for the core molecular components of zzso machinery, zzso DNA zzso revealed the presence of seven zzso in the zzso zzso Five of the zzso code for zzso that are similar to corresponding proteins in higher plants, while two zzso appear specific to zzso and are closely related to human zzso and zzso zzso These proteins possess all the zzso zzso motifs characteristic of zzso and a domain of unknown function, zzso Association of these highly zzso motifs with a zzso has not been reported in any of the zzso known so zzso All the seven genes are zzso but zzso expressed in zzso at low zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins shows patterns of distribution that can be correlated with their putative cellular zzso This work bridges the knowledge of zzso in zzso and makes this simple model plant accessible for studies on zzso aspects that remain intractable in higher zzso
