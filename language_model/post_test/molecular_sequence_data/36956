zzso zzso discs are induced by the steroid hormone zzso to initiate zzso leading to formation of the adult zzso and zzso zzso at the end of the third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a set of genes that zzso zzso disc transcripts found on zzso zzso precedes and may be responsible for some aspects of the cellular changes that mediate zzso zzso in this zzso A zzso zzso transcript from one of these zzso zzso is first observed in zzso at or just prior to zzso as zzso zzso are zzso and beginning to zzso zzso is initiated in zzso areas of the zzso disc, later spreading to a more widespread but zzso distribution throughout other zzso zzso zzso zzso is not, however, expressed in other zzso target zzso such as zzso zzso or fat zzso The zzso gene encodes a novel protein product containing a signal zzso a possible zzso domain, two highly charged zzso and a zzso rich zzso zzso We suggest that the delayed timing of expression of this secondary response gene is necessary for proper ordering of cellular events associated with disc zzso
