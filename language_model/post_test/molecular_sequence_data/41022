zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso also associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the metabolism of zzso yielding both zzso and zzso zzso While not affecting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso reaction of zzso catalyzing the formation of zzso through direct zzso zzso In this study, zzso complex formation of zzso and the possible regulatory role of these complexes were zzso zzso was isolated from zzso liver and used to raise zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that, in zzso zzso is primarily found in the zzso zzso zzso fluorescent resonance energy transfer zzso studies in zzso cells confirmed the formation of zzso complexes by zzso in live zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso domain of zzso is vital for complex zzso The zzso activity of zzso was zzso by truncated zzso which is unable to form complexes when zzso in zzso cells, thereby implicating the zzso form of zzso as the active zzso This study has shown for the first time that zzso forms zzso complexes in zzso implicating complex formation as a possible regulatory mechanism in zzso
