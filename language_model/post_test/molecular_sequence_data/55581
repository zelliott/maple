zzso of the expression of the nerve growth factor zzso gene has been reported previously to be zzso via the zzso zzso zzso of the protein zzso C zzso and zzso D3 zzso has also been reported to increase the pool of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso zzso second zzso zzso antagonized the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso or serum on zzso zzso whereas it enhanced that of zzso A positive effect was also observed when serum, zzso and zzso were added together, but zzso reduced this zzso There was no close correlation between the increase in zzso zzso and that in zzso zzso suggesting that expression of the zzso zzso is not necessarily followed by induction of the zzso zzso Rather, these two genes are zzso and not zzso induced after zzso zzso It appears that regulation of the zzso gene depends on a repertoire of multiple regulatory zzso complexes arising from zzso of the second zzso zzso This suggests that zzso gene expression is under the control of a complex interplay among second zzso zzso zzso and steroid hormones such as zzso and zzso
