There is emerging evidence that human solid tumor cells originate from cancer stem cells zzso In cancer cell lines, zzso zzso are mainly found in the side population zzso that has the capacity to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso We found that zzso is expressed specifically in SP cells of human gastrointestinal zzso cancer zzso zzso sequencing revealed that zzso but not zzso was expressed in zzso cancer zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cancer cell lines promoted cell zzso while its zzso by zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso cancer zzso revealed zzso protein to be strongly expressed in 3 out of 60 zzso In these cases, zzso was found especially in an zzso part of the zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is involved in zzso cancer development in a fraction of patients, in whom it presumably acts by supporting zzso zzso
