A disturbed energy transfer involving the zzso zzso zzso across the inner zzso membrane has been suggested to be one specific zzso mechanism in zzso zzso zzso steady state expression of this protein in zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso by solution zzso The zzso or protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso were zzso Analysis was performed on specimens from the left and right zzso from six organ donor hearts, six zzso hearts with zzso zzso two zzso hearts with zzso zzso and from zzso muscles from seven patients operated on for zzso zzso 

The ejection fraction in patients with zzso zzso was zzso significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than in patients with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and in zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ from those in donor zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso was more pronounced in right zzso than in left zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso M zzso fraction was increased to a similar degree in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly decreased only in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso B zzso content was significantly higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Despite signs of increased zzso and depressed zzso zzso zzso zzso was specifically zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
