In zzso zzso a human group B zzso was first detected in 2007 in a stool zzso from a sporadic case of acute zzso in an zzso The strain was designated as zzso The full-length sequences of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were determined for genetic zzso These four zzso genes showed considerable higher sequence identities zzso to those of group B zzso detected in India zzso in 1998) and Bangladesh zzso and zzso in 2000 and 2001, zzso than to those of Chinese strains zzso zzso and zzso in 1982 and 2002, zzso zzso the four genes of zzso were clustered into the zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso were similar to those of strains zzso and zzso several zzso acids in zzso were found to be different from those of the group B zzso described zzso The first detection in Myanmar of a human group B zzso suggested endemic distribution or expansion of the group B zzso of the zzso lineage in Southeast zzso
