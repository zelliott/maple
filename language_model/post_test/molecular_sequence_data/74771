zzso of zzso to inflammatory sites involves the coordinated action of several zzso including the zzso zzso While the zzso zzso zzso has been well characterized in humans and zzso little is known about the bovine zzso Here, we report cloning of bovine zzso the gene zzso bovine zzso We also analyzed zzso sequence upstream of the zzso translation start zzso Although the bovine zzso zzso acid sequence was well zzso among species, significant differences in zzso features were found, including major differences in the N zzso zzso loop 3, and zzso domain zzso Analysis of zzso expression by flow zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated high levels of zzso on all bovine zzso and a subset of bovine zzso zzso was not expressed on resting or activated bovine zzso although zzso message was present in these zzso zzso was also expressed on a small subset of bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of bovine zzso responses showed that bovine zzso and zzso both induced zzso calcium zzso and zzso in bovine zzso with similar efficacy for both zzso Treatment of bovine zzso with zzso or zzso resulted in zzso zzso of bovine zzso and zzso to zzso 8 zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso treatment with zzso or zzso did not zzso the cells to zzso or zzso Overall, these studies provide important information regarding distinct structural and functional features that may contribute to the unique pharmacological properties of bovine zzso
