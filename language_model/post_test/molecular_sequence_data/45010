Recent advances in basic research, medicine, and biotechnology provide great motivation for the development of zzso tools to probe the behavior of target zzso in complex biological zzso zzso zzso systems are an attractive medium for such studies, because they mimic several zzso features of living cells, yet they are much more amenable to manipulation and zzso zzso However, few methods are currently available to characterize target proteins in zzso zzso We have employed zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso for the detection and characterization of two zzso expressed model zzso cold shock protein A and zzso zzso in zzso zzso We exploited a combination of multiple selective zzso patterns for the identification of both full-length proteins and their in zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso exchange, performed directly in the zzso zzso allowed the assessment of zzso global degree of zzso The above methods are straightforward in that they do not require high levels of protein expression and allow the efficient characterization of both protein identity and global degree of zzso
