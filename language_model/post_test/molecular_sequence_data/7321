The mouse zzso zzso which is expressed only from the inactive X zzso is thought to play a role in the initiation of X zzso The zzso end of this gene is fully zzso on the active X zzso and completely zzso on the inactive X zzso suggesting that DNA zzso may be involved in controlling zzso zzso of this zzso To directly investigate the importance of DNA zzso in the control of zzso zzso we have examined its zzso patterns and expression in zzso cells and zzso that are deficient in DNA zzso zzso We report here that zzso of the zzso locus in male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus establishing a direct link between zzso and expression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso cells, however, appears to be independent of its zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may only become essential for zzso repression after zzso cells have differentiated or after the zzso has undergone zzso
