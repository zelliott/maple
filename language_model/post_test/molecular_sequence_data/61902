The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is involved in zzso of zzso zzso was cloned using the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso 6 zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso open reading frame zzso encodes a type II membrane protein composed of 777 zzso acid zzso Only in the short region extending from zzso acid position 450 to 606 of zzso sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso was observed at a level of zzso The tandem repeat sequence of zzso characteristic of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso is not present in zzso To investigate the function of the zzso zzso we constructed a zzso gene zzso by replacement with an expression cassette of human zzso zzso a zzso in zzso The cell growth and zzso human zzso zzso production levels of the zzso were similar to those of zzso human zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the level of zzso blue dye cell zzso which shows the presence of zzso sugar chains on the cell surface, was also zzso However, the zzso ratio of zzso zzso on zzso human zzso decreased dramatically from zzso in zzso strains to less than zzso in the zzso zzso When the zzso gene was zzso into the zzso the zzso ratio recovered to the original zzso These results suggest that the newly cloned zzso gene promotes zzso only to zzso zzso and not to the zzso outer chain, and that it has a different function from the zzso zzso which promotes the zzso of both core and outer sugar zzso
