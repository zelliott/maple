It has been proposed that synthesis of zzso one of zzso zzso cell wall zzso is initiated by a zzso zzso zzso reaction in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Because this sugar zzso is not zzso in the zzso of the zzso we have examined whether or not zzso can be transported across the zzso zzso We have detected transport of this sugar zzso into the zzso in zzso and into zzso zzso in zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed that transport of zzso was temperature dependent and zzso with an apparent zzso of 46 zzso and a zzso of 200 zzso zzso zzso Transport was zzso specific because zzso did not enter these zzso zzso of zzso transport into the zzso zzso in zzso was accomplished by functional expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which is devoid of this zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso or zzso zzso cells, which transfer zzso to zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso of zzso II or the disruption of the gene zzso this zzso Although zzso zzso lacks zzso it contains zzso a protein with significant zzso and the same size and zzso location as zzso zzso zzso zzso lack cell wall zzso zzso and grow very zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso did not complement the zzso zzso indicating that both proteins have different functions in spite of their zzso
