zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso previously prepared in our laboratory in zzso expression zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso kit to prepare plasmids zzso for bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso coli cells transformed with these plasmids zzso large amounts of these proteins upon induction with zzso zzso The expressed zzso found in inclusion bodies, were zzso and zzso to zzso using subsequently zzso and zzso zzso All three zzso proteins showed a single band of the expected molecular mass of 16 zzso in zzso in the presence of reducing agent and were composed of zzso zzso Proper zzso was evidenced by comparing their CD zzso to those of previously prepared chicken and zzso zzso and to commercially available human zzso The zzso acid content of the zzso proteins closely resembled the predicted zzso The biological activity of bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analogue zzso was evidenced by their ability to stimulate proliferation of zzso zzso cells zzso with a long form of human zzso zzso All three zzso as well as zzso and chicken zzso but not human zzso exhibited a very high degree of zzso against zzso raised against zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, none or very low zzso was observed against zzso raised against zzso zzso in zzso
