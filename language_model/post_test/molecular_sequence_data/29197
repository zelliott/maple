zzso is a giant protein that spans most of the muscle thin zzso zzso in zzso result in zzso and zzso zzso contains approximately 200 copies of approximately 35 zzso zzso each believed to contain an zzso binding site, organized into zzso zzso The strong correlation between the number of zzso zzso and the length of skeletal muscle thin filaments in different species suggests that zzso determines thin filament zzso Little information exists about the interactions between intact zzso and zzso More insight has come from working with fragments of zzso containing from one to hundreds of zzso binding zzso However, the observed zzso of binding between these fragments and zzso has ranged from zzso to 13 zzso per zzso zzso We have used electron zzso and a novel method of zzso image analysis to characterize complexes of zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso binds as an extended structure spanning three zzso zzso and binding to different sites on each zzso Muscle regulation involves zzso movement on the surface of zzso with binding in three zzso Our results suggest the intriguing possibility that intact zzso may also be able to occupy three different sites on zzso
