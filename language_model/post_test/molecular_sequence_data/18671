The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play essential roles in regulating various cellular zzso Both the zzso between zzso and zzso through their zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso via its zzso domain are critical for the zzso of zzso zzso however, the molecular mechanisms concerning the formation and regulation of these zzso complexes remain zzso Here we determined the crystal structure of zzso in complex with a zzso zzso zzso where the massive zzso interactions between the zzso zzso motif of zzso and the basic surface of zzso as well as additional hydrogen bonds, ensure the formation of a stable and specific zzso The zzso interaction is zzso with the modification of a specific zzso of zzso by the zzso drug zzso though all four zzso zzso in the zzso domain can be modified in in zzso zzso In addition, detailed structural and zzso analyses demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso belong to the type I group, which can zzso the zzso zzso zzso into zzso of lower zzso These data together unravel the molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso and provide the basis for designing zzso of zzso zzso
