Random zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso in an attempt to isolate zzso zzso Three zzso were isolated, and the zzso zzso these proteins were zzso All zzso zzso carried the same C to T transition zzso that zzso an zzso acid substitution of zzso by zzso at position zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso and their zzso properties were zzso zzso was superior to zzso in zzso and pH zzso Furthermore, the specific activity of the zzso zzso was increased to zzso of that of the zzso In order to examine the effect of zzso acid zzso substitution at position 217 on the zzso of zzso we replaced the zzso zzso at position 217 with all of the rest of the possible zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of these substitution zzso seemed to correlate with the zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso
