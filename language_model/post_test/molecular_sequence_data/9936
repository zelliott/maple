To investigate the zzso of TAP zzso associated with zzso zzso genes among patients with primary zzso syndrome zzso in order to clarify the potential association of the zzso with disease zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in 108 Japanese SS patients were determined by analyzing TAP genes using the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso frequency of the zzso gene was not significantly different between SS patients and normal zzso In addition to all known zzso zzso a new zzso zzso which had a unique substitution at zzso 577 zzso zzso was identified in both zzso The zzso frequency of zzso was significantly higher in SS patients zzso than in normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a significantly greater frequency of zzso zzso was found among SS patients with zzso (18 of 23; zzso than among those without zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso in zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso production and could be a genetic factor that determines zzso to zzso
