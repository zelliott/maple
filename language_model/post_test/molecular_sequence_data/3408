The pathological features of Alzheimer's disease include deposition of zzso zzso containing plaques and increases in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso prevents the zzso of the zzso zzso The activity of these zzso requires the binding of a zzso component to the zzso zzso zzso This study characterizes direct interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso fragments containing the zzso zzso region could inhibit zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso The same zzso zzso fragments all increased zzso zzso of known zzso in a cell free zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso prevented the zzso of zzso zzso containing peptides in differentiated human zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso These direct interactions between zzso B1 and zzso provide potential mechanisms for the zzso of the zzso zzso
