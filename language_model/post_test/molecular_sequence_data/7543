zzso is converted into insulin by the action of two zzso Type I zzso is thought to cleave between the zzso and the connecting zzso zzso and type II zzso between the zzso and the zzso An zzso region immediately zzso to the point of zzso at the zzso junction is well zzso throughout evolution and has been suggested to be important for zzso conversion zzso zzso Kahn, zzso and zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have here compared the precise role of this region as a whole and just the first zzso zzso zzso to the point of zzso in processing of zzso by zzso To this end, several zzso were introduced in this region of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and native zzso were zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells, in which zzso is known to be the major conversion zzso and zzso of zzso conversion were studied zzso analysis of zzso zzso The results show that the zzso region following the zzso junction is indeed important for zzso zzso at this site, and that the reduced zzso observed for the zzso zzso zzso can be partially overcome by replacing the zzso region with a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso only the first zzso of the zzso region with zzso zzso zzso has no impact on conversion, whereas its replacement with zzso zzso zzso almost completely zzso zzso at the zzso junction without affecting that at the zzso zzso
