The zzso inducing zzso zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso downstream of important clinical targets including zzso zzso and zzso Despite numerous genetic studies zzso zzso of this zzso with zzso diseases and zzso zzso detailed molecular characterization of this central signaling zzso has been zzso We undertook a systematic cloning and expression effort to generate zzso zzso proteins encompassing the zzso zzso of human and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain from both species reveal an zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso consumption and zzso zzso zzso confirm that zzso of zzso does not increase zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso bound to zzso possessing two different zzso reveal zzso flexibility in the gatekeeper zzso controlling access to a zzso zzso Finally, a single zzso acid difference affects the ability of some zzso to bind zzso and human zzso with the same zzso
