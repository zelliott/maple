We have cloned and zzso the zzso zzso gene for zzso zzso This zzso contains zzso bound zzso which is essential for zzso zzso We have shown that this zzso is zzso as a Mr 46,000 zzso which is then zzso zzso to form two zzso zzso a beta zzso (Mr zzso from the zzso portion and an alpha zzso (Mr zzso from the zzso zzso The protein was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to zzso The zzso zzso contains both the alpha and beta zzso About half of the alpha zzso have zzso blocking the zzso end; the remaining alpha zzso have zzso in this zzso From a comparison of the zzso acid sequence deduced from the zzso sequence with the zzso acid sequence of the zzso portion of each zzso zzso by zzso zzso we have identified the zzso site of the zzso as the zzso bond between zzso acid 87 and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is essential for activity, is generated from zzso 88 during the zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso has essentially no zzso with zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and Tabor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and only a moderate degree of zzso with the human and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stanley, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all of these zzso are zzso zzso Despite this limited overall zzso the zzso site of the zzso zzso is identical to the zzso sites in the human and rat zzso and seven of the eight zzso acids adjacent to the zzso site are identical in the three zzso zzso
