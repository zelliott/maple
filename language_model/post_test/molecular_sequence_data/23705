The zzso and zzso activities of the novel zzso derivatives of zzso with three different degrees of substitution have been zzso in zzso in the zzso flagellate zzso zzso subjected to the action of zzso agents zzso orange and zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso derivatives exhibit zzso protective zzso activity against both zzso It is suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in its protective zzso activity in case of zzso DNA damage, as well as possible interaction with the cell membrane that prevents zzso orange from reaching the genetic compartments and subsequent damaging DNA through zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso orange on zzso derivatives was ruled out as a possible mechanism of protection on the basis of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso properties of the studied zzso derivatives on the degree of substitution was reversed in experiments involving zzso orange and zzso which also indicated different mechanisms of protection involved in these two zzso
