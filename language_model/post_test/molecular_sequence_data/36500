zzso of the regulation of zzso zzso promoter activity is limited by the absence of a good cell zzso The discovery of zzso zzso and derived peptides in the zzso tract led us to examine the cellular zzso and hormonal regulation of zzso zzso expression and to evaluate normal zzso cells as a model for studying zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated in zzso immature rats zzso h after receiving an zzso dose of zzso zzso peaked 2 days after zzso remained elevated throughout the ensuing zzso and rose again at the end of zzso In zzso zzso localized zzso expression predominantly to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of primary cultures of zzso cells revealed that the activity of the rat zzso promoter zzso to 133 base pairs zzso was increased zzso to zzso by zzso and human zzso treatments and zzso by zzso analog zzso zzso analysis identified a zzso zzso zzso as the primary zzso sequence zzso to zzso zzso containing three potential zzso zzso its deletion resulted in severely reduced zzso zzso and its zzso to zzso zzso promoter sequences completely restored zzso zzso This is an unusually zzso position for zzso elements compared to other zzso zzso These data demonstrate specific expression of zzso in zzso and zzso cells, which is under sensitive zzso regulation, and identify a zzso zzso sequence within the zzso
