We have isolated and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso of the zzso locus zzso in zzso zzso zzso a wild potato species displaying zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins of 30 zzso and 31 zzso respectively, which were previously identified based on zzso with their respective zzso in genetic zzso The zzso acid sequence zzso between the zzso and zzso is zzso This high degree of sequence zzso between zzso is a distinctive feature of the zzso zzso Of the 31 zzso acid zzso which were previously found to be zzso among three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 27 are also zzso in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These zzso include two zzso implicated in the active site of the zzso zzso six zzso four of which form zzso bonds in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which might form the core structure of the zzso The finding that these zzso are zzso among zzso with very divergent sequences suggests a functional role for the zzso activity of the zzso in zzso zzso
