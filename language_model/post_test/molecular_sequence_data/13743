zzso zzso zzso a specific component of the central nervous system localized on the zzso zzso of mature zzso is a member of the zzso zzso We report here the organization of the human zzso zzso which spans approximately 17 zzso and the characterization of six zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of the human zzso gene confirmed the zzso pattern, supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso could arise by alternative zzso of a single zzso In addition to the eight zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso the human zzso gene also zzso in the 3' region, a previously unknown alternatively spliced coding zzso zzso Alternative zzso of two zzso zzso sites for zzso VIII could produce two different zzso The zzso sequences presented here may be a useful tool to study further possible involvement of the zzso gene in zzso neurological zzso
