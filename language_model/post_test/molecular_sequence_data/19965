zzso of zzso zzso such as strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso have unusual long zzso zzso zzso zzso genes due to an zzso of approximately 100 zzso in the zzso zzso In this report, we analyzed the zzso zzso genes of different zzso strains to determine if such an zzso is a common feature of zzso We amplified this region by zzso chain reaction zzso from eight zzso strains zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and resolved each zzso product by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso All strains had from two to seven zzso zzso bands, suggesting zzso in their zzso zzso gene zzso For each strain, the zzso region of the zzso zzso genes was amplified and a clone library was zzso zzso corresponding to most zzso migration bands were zzso zzso of representative clones revealed that the zzso was generated by insertions of zzso zzso An zzso was found in at least one copy of the zzso zzso gene in all examined zzso In total, we found eight different types of insertions zzso that varied from 123 to 193 zzso in zzso zzso structural analyses of transcribed sequences predicted that all insertions would form an energetically stable zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that most of the observed insertions in the zzso strains were excised from the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso were not commonly found in bacterial zzso zzso zzso and having a different zzso in several zzso zzso gene copies borne by a single bacterial species was rarely zzso The function of these insertions is not known, but their occurrence can have an important impact in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as these insertions can be excised from zzso zzso zzso
