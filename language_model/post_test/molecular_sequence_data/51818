In this study the sequence and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso a protein of 787 zzso zzso The open reading frame contains zzso zzso followed by an zzso stop zzso zzso and 104 zzso of untranslated sequence containing a zzso addition signal 10 bases upstream of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of human zzso zzso zzso indicates a message of approximately zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignment zzso analysis of the zzso human zzso zzso acid sequence with the sequence for the zzso zzso protein zzso and the rabbit zzso zzso acid sequence demonstrates that the human sequence and the zzso sequence have extensive zzso acid zzso upstream of the rabbit initiation zzso zzso there is an zzso identity between the human and the rabbit zzso sequences when the alignment starts at the zzso of the rabbit sequence and at zzso acid 101 of the human zzso The nuclear zzso signal found in zzso and rabbit zzso is completely zzso in human zzso The first zzso domain of zzso is zzso identical and zzso similar to the human zzso zzso The second zzso domain of zzso is zzso identical and zzso similar to the human zzso zzso zzso analysis of the three sequences generated an zzso ancestral tree with two zzso indicating that fewer zzso acid changes have occurred between the zzso and the human sequences than between the zzso and the rabbit zzso In the human zzso zzso is localized predominantly in primary zzso and round zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso cells, and other zzso cells do not zzso Human zzso contain zzso in the zzso zzso Following the zzso reaction, some zzso remains in the equatorial and zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso and zzso contain a zzso protein which may play a role in regulating the early events of zzso
