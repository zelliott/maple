Although zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso 1 zzso is a leading malaria vaccine candidate, extensive zzso diversity may compromise its vaccine zzso We have previously shown that naturally acquired zzso to zzso were associated with protection from clinical malaria in this Kenyan zzso To assess the impact of zzso diversity on naturally acquired zzso we first zzso the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso from subjects with zzso mild, and severe malaria and measured zzso frequency zzso We then measured zzso to three zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and used competition zzso zzso zzso zzso to analyze zzso zzso zzso unique zzso were identified from 129 zzso zzso No zzso of zzso zzso with disease severity or year of sampling was zzso zzso in zzso zzso in clinical zzso plus mild zzso versus zzso infections were observed at 16 zzso zzso zzso frequency zzso were indicative of balancing selection, with the strongest signature being identified in domain III zzso D zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso to each of the three zzso zzso proteins were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso for all zzso zzso Although zzso to zzso zzso were abundant, zzso of selected children with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso to zzso zzso as determined by a competition zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso in zzso may contribute to clinical zzso
