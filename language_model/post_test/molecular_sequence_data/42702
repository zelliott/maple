A zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso strain zzso has been previously designated as zzso transforming region III zzso because it induced focal and zzso transformation of zzso zzso However, in two separate cell systems, zzso sequences were not retained because they were not detected in either the zzso tumor or zzso cell zzso In this report, zzso was localized to a zzso zzso DNA zzso The sequence of the zzso region was determined and compared to the zzso DNA from zzso strain zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of five open reading frames in zzso zzso two of which are zzso in strain zzso The zzso and sequence analysis of zzso will allow further investigation as to the zzso by which zzso may play a role in human zzso
