In comparison to zzso bacteria, only limited numbers of zzso sequences are available for zzso and in particular zzso zzso zzso we report the zzso and zzso sequence of zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso on wheat and zzso Based on zzso analysis of the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to other zzso zzso strains and the zzso and zzso infecting zzso zzso but shares a type III zzso system zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and more zzso related zzso zzso with an zzso zzso reporter protein demonstrate that zzso zzso is functional in delivering proteins to wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso also encodes two type VI zzso systems with one most closely related to those found in some strains of the rice infecting strain zzso zzso zzso zzso but not other zzso Comparative analysis of 18 different zzso zzso revealed 84 proteins unique to cereal zzso zzso infecting zzso and the zzso infecting zzso Genes zzso 60 of these proteins are found in gene clusters in the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso However, none of the cereal pathogen specific proteins were zzso to known zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis outside of the bacterial kingdom revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso also present in other bacteria as well as a number of zzso zzso species, suggesting that this gene may have been transmitted zzso from bacteria to the zzso lineage of zzso zzso This example further highlights the importance of horizontal gene acquisition from bacteria in the evolution of zzso
