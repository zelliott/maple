A zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a soil sample from Yunnan Province, zzso The isolate grew zzso at zzso zzso grew at pH zzso and could grow with zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso based on zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The major fatty acid zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso characteristics suggested that the zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso shared zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of the isolate was zzso zzso zzso zzso between the novel isolate and the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the pattern of zzso properties distinguished strain zzso from its closest zzso zzso It is therefore concluded that strain zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
