The production of a stable zzso copy of an unstable zzso zzso by reverse zzso is a widely used and essential technology for many important applications, such as the construction of gene libraries, production of DNA zzso and analysis of gene expression by reverse zzso zzso zzso However, the synthesis of full-length zzso is frequently inefficient, because the zzso commonly used often produces truncated zzso zzso zzso at higher temperatures, on the other hand, can provide a number of zzso These include increasing the length of zzso product, greater zzso and greater specificity during reverse zzso Thus, an zzso that remains stable and active at hot temperatures may produce zzso zzso and improve the yield of full-length zzso Described here is the discovery of a zzso designated zzso from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The gene codes for an open reading frame zzso similar to the zzso zzso by group II zzso found in zzso The gene was cloned and zzso in zzso coli, and its protein product was partially zzso Like the host zzso the zzso protein is a zzso protein with zzso activity and can reverse transcribe zzso at temperatures as high as 75 degrees zzso
