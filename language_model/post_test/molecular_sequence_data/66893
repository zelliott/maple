zzso are widely used in genetic and evolutionary zzso but their own evolution is far from zzso The mechanisms maintaining the zzso patterns of simple repeats and the typical stable zzso zzso are still poorly zzso zzso lineages may provide particularly zzso models for the indirect study of zzso evolution, because their zzso act as complete linkage groups, with zzso being the only source of genetic zzso Here, we study the direction of accumulated zzso zzso zzso in wild asexual lineages of zzso zzso zzso Whereas the overall number of zzso is not significantly different from that of expansions, the zzso frequency of zzso but not of expansions, significantly increases with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso is positively correlated with zzso zzso but this relationship is due solely to the influence of contraction zzso Such zzso may explain length constraints generally observed with zzso and are consistent with stable, zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso the zzso zzso lineages show zzso patterns resembling the trends observed in a broad range of organisms, including zzso and zzso suggesting that, even if not of zzso origin, the zzso in these zzso may be the consequence of similar zzso
