zzso are the most diverse of all animal cell types, and much of the diversity in zzso design is thought to reflect adaptations to the highly variable conditions under which zzso function and compete to achieve zzso Recent work has shown that these conditions often evolve rapidly as a consequence of multiple zzso suggesting a role for sexual selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of zzso zzso However, very little of the striking diversity in zzso design is understood zzso particularly in internally zzso zzso We use zzso comparative analyses covering 16 species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to show that a complex zzso design is associated with zzso mating and that this complexity is lost zzso when zzso zzso injection through the zzso Specifically, the complex zzso design, which includes stiff lateral zzso is likely a male persistence trait associated with sexual conflicts over the fate of received zzso and linked to female resistance traits, namely an intriguing zzso sucking behavior and a thickened zzso of the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the interactions between zzso zzso zzso and zzso recipient can change drastically when zzso zzso zzso involving zzso evolution of a zzso zzso organ, a simpler zzso design, and a simpler female zzso zzso Our study documents that a shift in the mating behavior may alter fundamentally the conditions under which zzso compete and thereby lead to a drastic change in zzso zzso
