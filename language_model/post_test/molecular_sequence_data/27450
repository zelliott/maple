zzso have a complex life cycle which zzso between two hosts and includes two short-lived zzso zzso zzso are the zzso forms of zzso responsible for infection of the zzso zzso The infection is initiated when the zzso penetrate host zzso During zzso zzso will undergo profound changes and release zzso products to adapt to the new environment and to escape from zzso immune zzso Part of these events should be determined, to some degree, by the zzso of certain genes in the zzso In this study, we performed zzso zzso analysis to monitor the profile of the genes actively expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that 76 of zzso zzso clones were expressed more than zzso in zzso compared to adult zzso After cluster analysis, 19 zzso expressed sequence tags zzso were zzso 4 of which represented functionally zzso zzso 14 of which represented functionally zzso zzso and 1 of which represented a novel gene zzso The full-length zzso of the second most abundant zzso zzso was cloned and preliminarily zzso Although the precise biological role of all zzso actively expressed transcripts identified in this investigation awaits further functional analysis, our findings may offer insight into novel control strategies or help to develop potential vaccine candidates against zzso
