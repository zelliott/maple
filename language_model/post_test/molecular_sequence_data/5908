We have identified and functionally characterized a new zzso coli zzso zzso whose product is involved in zzso bond formation in the zzso The zzso gene was cloned from a zzso zzso library lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were selected, since they allowed zzso coli to grow at lethal zzso of zzso In a complementary genetic approach, point zzso were independently obtained and mapped to the zzso zzso Such zzso led simultaneously to a zzso zzso and an increased zzso heat shock response, which reflects the presence of zzso proteins in the zzso In agreement with these zzso zzso zzso were shown to accumulate reduced forms of a variety of zzso zzso proteins in the zzso This zzso zzso could be rescued by addition to the growth medium of either oxidized zzso or zzso or by zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso is zzso as a precursor form of zzso zzso and processed to a zzso mature species located in the zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso and shown to have zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso Replacement of the first zzso zzso of the predicted active site, zzso by Ala, completely zzso zzso protein zzso Taken together, all our results demonstrate that zzso acts in zzso as an efficient zzso zzso In addition, zzso is the first member of the zzso family for which zzso zzso are zzso lethal and can be zzso only if supplemented with zzso in the growth zzso We propose that the main role of zzso is to maintain the proper zzso balance between the zzso and zzso zzso
