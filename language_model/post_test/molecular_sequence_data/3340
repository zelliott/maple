zzso acid zzso in or zzso zzso motifs making up the active binding sites of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were correlated with changes in affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for these zzso Four zzso zzso eight zzso zzso and six zzso zzso zzso were studied by DNA sequencing of the zzso sites of the zzso zzso and zzso genes of strains and by determining 50% zzso zzso of the seven agents for zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso strains had zzso in zzso zzso (one zzso or zzso zzso (one zzso All eight zzso strains had at least two zzso or A or zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso All zzso strains had the same changes seen in zzso zzso as well as zzso or S zzso in zzso The two most resistant zzso strains had a second change in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The affinities of zzso and zzso for all three zzso were decreased for zzso and most zzso zzso The affinity of zzso for zzso and zzso was decreased only for zzso zzso and zzso showed decreased affinity of zzso but not zzso for all three zzso zzso showed decreased affinity of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso but no change for zzso zzso showed no difference in zzso affinity based on zzso or zzso zzso indicating a different zzso target for this zzso Overall, the zzso for and zzso affinities of the strains correlated with the changes found in the zzso active binding zzso
