zzso display was used to isolate zzso clones showing differential expression in response to zzso drought and cold in barley zzso zzso One zzso zzso clone zzso was further analyzed and found to zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso A zzso clone was isolated by probing the zzso zzso library with the zzso clone zzso and the structure of zzso was zzso The coding region is interrupted by six zzso and contains a predicted zzso transit zzso zzso was mapped to zzso zzso A comparison was made to rice and zzso genes to identify zzso structural zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso double knockout strain revealed that zzso can function as the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso levels of zzso increased in response to drought zzso As the first zzso in the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso pathway, zzso might have a role in the degradation of zzso zzso of zzso could serve as a zzso mechanism that maintains the pool of free zzso zzso acids at low and non toxic levels, under drought stress zzso
