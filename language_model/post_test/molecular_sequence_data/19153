zzso zzso disease virus zzso is a zzso transmitted zzso that causes zzso disease in wild and domestic zzso A collection of 44 zzso isolated from 2008 to 2012 was fully zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 viruses were the dominant zzso all years except 2012 when zzso 6 viruses represented 63 % of the zzso High genetic similarity zzso % zzso between zzso 1 and 2 virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso segments prevented identification of zzso events for these zzso Additionally, there was little genetic diversity zzso % zzso within zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso was observed for zzso zzso and zzso segments for type 1 and type 2 zzso In contrast, type 6 viruses were all zzso containing zzso and zzso derived from an exotic type 6 with the remaining segments most similar to type 2 zzso These results suggest that zzso between type 1 and type 2 viruses requires conservation of the zzso zzso and zzso segment constellation while type 6 viruses only require zzso and zzso and are restricted to type zzso zzso As type 6 zzso and zzso segments were exclusively identified in viruses with type zzso zzso these results suggest functional zzso between type 2 and type 6 zzso zzso
