zzso infrared zzso was used to examine the secondary structure of the zzso domain zzso zzso of rabbit liver zzso zzso in zzso and in the presence of zzso and zzso In all situations, the zzso structure was alpha zzso but an examination of the components of the zzso I band in the spectrum of the zzso zzso showed that the major peak was shifted from zzso zzso in the lipids to 1650 zzso in zzso This shift to lower frequency, together with a decrease in intensity of the zzso II band, is indicative of zzso to zzso exchange of the zzso zzso A zzso analysis indicated that the alpha zzso of the zzso is over zzso exchanged in the presence of zzso but is only zzso exchanged in the presence of zzso These data suggest that the zzso portion of the zzso is alpha zzso and is largely protected from zzso to zzso exchange by the zzso We suggest that this technique appears to provide a general method for determining the type of secondary structure involved in membrane interaction and the percentage of this structure which is involved in the zzso
