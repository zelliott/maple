All zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso which are structurally similar and share about zzso zzso acid zzso We found that zzso further resembles zzso as both proteins are membrane components of the mature zzso with similar zzso and induce zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso virus that zzso expresses zzso like a previously described zzso zzso had a zzso zzso plaque formation and replication of infectious virus were dependent on added zzso However, only immature virus particles are made when zzso is zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso formed in the absence of zzso Except for the lack of zzso the zzso components of such zzso were indistinguishable from those of zzso zzso These zzso zzso bound to cells, but their zzso did not penetrate into the zzso Furthermore, cells infected with zzso zzso did not fuse after a brief zzso treatment, as did cells infected with virus made in the presence of zzso In these respects, the zzso associated with zzso zzso was identical to that produced by the lack of individual components of a previously described zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with proteins of that complex, supporting a related zzso Thus, despite the structural relationships of zzso and zzso the two proteins have distinct functions in assembly and entry, zzso
