The recent advances in molecular biology have merged with zzso cell zzso and cell biology to allow zzso cells to be extremely useful for the expression of foreign zzso This chapter has focused primarily on the approaches and potential limitations to high-level expression of proteins in zzso zzso Future developments will involve the modification of zzso cells in order to increase the efficiency of the various steps in protein processing and zzso The ability to genetically engineer zzso cells to produce high levels of desired proteins is presently zzso by advances in zzso engineering which involve the ability to grow zzso cells in very large volumes or at very high zzso with reduced serum zzso As a result, the cost for production of gram quantities of a protein from a zzso host cell are approaching the cost of proteins from a zzso host cell are approaching the cost of proteins similarly derived from microbial systems with all the advantages that zzso systems zzso
