The Max protein forms a zzso complex with the zzso family of proteins and binds to DNA in a zzso zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and basic zzso of Max in protein complex formation, zzso activity and zzso zzso We zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of Max and studied the ability of the normal and zzso proteins to bind to DNA as both zzso and zzso and their ability to zzso with zzso zzso and zzso regions of Max were found to be critical for zzso formation and subsequent DNA zzso while the zzso was essential for zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso the zzso protein functioned as a zzso zzso while Max protein zzso the zzso observed with zzso
