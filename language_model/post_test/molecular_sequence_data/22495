The initiation of zzso in zzso zzso species is regulated by the zzso consisting of several sensor zzso zzso the zzso response regulator, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factor that upon zzso zzso genes for growth and activates the zzso zzso zzso species lack both zzso and zzso and the identities of the sensor zzso zzso are zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly zzso in zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso but the cloned zzso zzso zzso was unable to complement a zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso However, it was able to repress the zzso gene of zzso zzso Active site zzso in zzso still zzso indicating this activity was independent of zzso An orphan sensor zzso zzso of zzso zzso appeared to normally zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of this zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso suggesting zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso essential growth genes as a prerequisite to zzso but could not compensate for this effect by inducing zzso A zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso response regulator domain fused to a zzso zzso zzso domain was capable of restoring zzso to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso albeit at less than zzso zzso The data suggest that induction of zzso requires interactions of both zzso of zzso with other zzso proteins and despite the high conservation of the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso some of these interactions have been zzso
