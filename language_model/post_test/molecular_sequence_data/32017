zzso of zzso cellular proteins has been recognized as a modification that occurs mainly on zzso zzso In this study, we examined the membrane zzso membrane integration, and zzso zzso of four recently identified human zzso proteins with predicted zzso zzso As a result, it was found that protein zzso the human zzso of zzso protein zzso that has recently been found to be involved in network formation of the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso integral membrane zzso Analysis of tumor necrosis zzso proteins with each of the two putative zzso zzso and their zzso regions of protein zzso revealed that zzso domain 1 and 2 functioned as type II signal anchor sequence and stop transfer zzso respectively, and together generated a zzso integral membrane protein with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso with zzso at its zzso revealed that zzso protein zzso localized mainly to the peripheral zzso and induced the formation of large zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso induced by zzso protein zzso were significantly inhibited by the zzso of protein zzso by means of replacing zzso with zzso These results indicated that protein zzso plays a critical role in the zzso zzso change induced by zzso of protein zzso
