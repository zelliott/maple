zzso stem cell research suffers from a lack of molecular markers to specifically assess stem or zzso cell zzso The organization of the zzso zzso marginal zone zzso in the zzso allows the spatial distinction of these two cell zzso stem cells are confined to the most peripheral region, while zzso are more zzso Despite this clear advantage, very few genes specifically expressed in retinal stem cells have been discovered so far in this zzso To gain insight into the molecular signature of these cells, we performed a large-scale expression screen in the zzso zzso establishing it as a model system for stem cell gene zzso zzso genes expressed specifically in the zzso stem cell compartment were retrieved and are discussed zzso These zzso various types of zzso including factors associated with zzso zzso zzso organization, zzso processing, and cell zzso In addition, the publication of this work in a special issue on zzso prompted us to give a more general illustration of the value of large-scale screens in this model zzso Thus, beyond neural stem cell specific zzso we give a broader highlight of our screen outcome, describing in particular other retinal cell markers that we zzso Finally, we present how these can all be easily retrieved through a novel module we developed in the zzso zzso tool zzso and illustrate the potential of this powerful zzso database in the context of the zzso
