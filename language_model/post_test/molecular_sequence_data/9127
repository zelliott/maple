zzso zzso G zzso plays an important role in zzso protective immune responses to zzso We still know relatively little about which zzso zzso protect against this disease in mouse models, although zzso and zzso are considered to be the most potent and dominate in successful passive transfer experiments in zzso zzso To explore the zzso by which the different mouse zzso zzso may mediate a protective effect, we generated mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific for the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso surface protein 1 zzso and to the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso both major targets of protective immune zzso This panel of eight zzso bound zzso with an affinity comparable to that seen for their zzso parental zzso zzso zzso from which they were zzso although for reasons of yield, we were only able to explore the function of mouse zzso recognizing zzso in detail, both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was as effective as the parental human zzso from which it was derived at inducing zzso zzso bursts and zzso from zzso Despite showing efficacy in in zzso functional zzso with zzso the mouse zzso failed to protect against zzso challenge in zzso The lack of protection afforded by zzso zzso against zzso challenge in wild type mice suggests that this zzso class does not play a major role in the control of infection with mouse malaria in the zzso zzso transgenic zzso
