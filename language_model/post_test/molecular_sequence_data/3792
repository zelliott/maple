zzso expression of zzso zzso in a variety of brain networks suggests a diversity of roles in zzso zzso Here, we aimed to determine whether an zzso zzso would mediate zzso responses to different pharmacological and zzso stimuli in the brain of transgenic zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in the cortex, zzso zzso area and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso induction was zzso zzso induced widespread expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso areas, amygdala, and zzso zzso In contrast, induction following a light stimulus was restricted to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our studies have provided novel insights into the differential regulation of zzso and facilitated approaches to the genetic manipulation of zzso zzso zzso
