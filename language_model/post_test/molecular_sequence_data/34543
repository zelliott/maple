The dual functional signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso factors that play crucial roles in host zzso Animals that lack these proteins are highly susceptible to microbial and viral infections and chemically induced primary zzso We have over expressed the zzso domain of human zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso it by affinity zzso and gel zzso zzso The entire process has been monitored by gel zzso The pure protein has been characterized by mass zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of zzso exists as a zzso in zzso
