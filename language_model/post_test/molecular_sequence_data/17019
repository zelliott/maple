We report zzso the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing two type 1 zzso sites and one type 2 zzso zzso zzso the expression and preparation of zzso zzso and two zzso replacing the zzso zzso of each type 1 zzso with zzso and zzso their zzso and functional zzso The zzso frame of zzso zzso is composed of the zzso zzso domain having a type 1 zzso motif like zzso and the zzso zzso domain having type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso motifs such as common zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso to those of zzso and zzso zzso The point zzso of the zzso zzso of each type 1 zzso with Ala gives two zzso zzso and zzso possessing one type 1 zzso and one type 2 zzso The zzso data of zzso reveal that the zzso zzso domain has the green type 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso showing two intense zzso zzso at 455 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso signal like those of the green type 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso data of zzso zzso that the zzso zzso domain in zzso contains the blue type 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso exhibiting an intense zzso band at zzso zzso zzso zzso 2900 zzso zzso and an zzso zzso signal like those of the blue type 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The sum of the visible zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is almost equal to the corresponding spectrum of zzso zzso The zzso characterization of the type 1 zzso indicates that the zzso of the type 1 zzso and zzso sites are slightly distorted zzso (or zzso zzso zzso and flattened zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso probably because of the type 1 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are observed at zzso and zzso zzso versus normal hydrogen zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso These values, which are close to each other, are more positive than those ( approximately zzso V at pH zzso of the type 1 zzso sites of zzso and zzso The zzso capability of zzso from zzso zzso is almost similar to that of zzso zzso whereas that of zzso is very zzso This suggests that the type 1 zzso in the zzso domain is essential for the zzso functions of zzso
