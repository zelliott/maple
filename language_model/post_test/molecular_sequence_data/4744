zzso is a zzso gene expressed at the zzso stage of zzso development that disappears on differentiation to plasma zzso As such, it serves as an excellent paradigm for the study of lineage and zzso zzso gene zzso Using in zzso zzso we identified two sites in the promoter at zzso and zzso that were occupied only in zzso B zzso The zzso site is an E box that binds basic zzso proteins whereas the zzso site is a composite zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso studies with reporter zzso and various expression zzso verified the importance of these zzso The composite zzso and zzso site likely accounts for both lineage and zzso expression of zzso whereas the zzso E box binding proteins enhance overall promoter activity and may link the promoter to a distant zzso
