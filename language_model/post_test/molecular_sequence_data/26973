The impact of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the changes in bacterial community structure and the transition of zzso genes were studied using forest zzso The bacterial community structure of soil suspensions amended with 1 zzso of either zzso or zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso and functional gene zzso To analyze the functional genes in the communities, we targeted a gene sequence that functions as the binding site of zzso iron sulfur center common to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso The gene fragments were zzso chain zzso from zzso extracted from soil suspensions spiked with either zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso community analysis based on zzso zzso genes revealed that specific zzso zzso gene zzso in particular, zzso within zzso increased in the soil suspension amended with zzso or zzso zzso zzso functional community analysis showed that, in addition to two groups of zzso genes that were also detected in zzso soil suspensions, another two groups of zzso zzso each of which is specific to zzso and zzso soil, respectively, emerged to a great zzso The zzso zzso is zzso distant from any known zzso These results strongly suggest that soil microbial community potentially harbors a wide array of organisms having diverse zzso including those previously unknown, and that they could quickly respond to an impact of contamination of hazardous chemicals by changing the microbial community and gene zzso
