A zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was zzso zzso to apparent zzso zzso The zzso and native molecular weights were estimated to be 72,000 and zzso respectively, suggesting a zzso zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso activity zzso I, II, and zzso zzso from a zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso form III, but not form I, contained bound zzso which zzso during zzso to generate form zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso compounds, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso analysis confirmed that expression of the zzso was zzso zzso The first 25 zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso were determined, and a corresponding zzso probe was zzso for use in cloning of the associated zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence data, and zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene was located on a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 10 zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene was zzso to that of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Old Yellow zzso from zzso zzso and the product of the zzso gene of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso located upstream from the zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso of these five sequences revealed potential zzso for an zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso domain, and two other zzso zzso of unknown zzso
