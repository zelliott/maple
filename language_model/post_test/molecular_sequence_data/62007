Human zzso 1 zzso and zzso genes were found as zzso of zzso zzso gene which plays a key role in the zzso cell lineage of the central nervous zzso SIM proteins belong to a family of zzso factors, called zzso Here we examined the zzso zzso of SIM proteins using the expression zzso of whole zzso or zzso protein fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso The transient expression analysis revealed the nuclear zzso of SIM proteins in the cultured zzso To identify the nuclear zzso zzso we made expression zzso of zzso protein consisting of various portions of SIM zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of zzso activity in the small region of 23 and 21 zzso acid zzso at the central part of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further analysis with zzso acid substitution of this small region of zzso protein revealed the critical role of five zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The consensus sequence of zzso was estimated as a zzso zzso in SIM proteins from various zzso Thus, the zzso consisting of a cluster of basic zzso acids with Pro and zzso at the zzso end is novel and well zzso in the SIM proteins during zzso
