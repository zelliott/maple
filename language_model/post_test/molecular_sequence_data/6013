A characteristic zzso feature of Alzheimer's disease is the cerebral deposition of zzso zzso These deposits contain beta A4 zzso zzso a zzso product of the zzso protein zzso protein precursor zzso Despite numerous studies on the processing of the different zzso zzso in zzso cells, little is known about its sorting and transport in zzso of the central nervous system zzso To analyze this question we expressed in cultured rat zzso zzso the human zzso zzso zzso at its zzso with the zzso zzso using the zzso forest virus zzso expression zzso zzso was first delivered from the cell body to the zzso and later appeared also in the zzso zzso of protein synthesis at the time of zzso expression did not block the late appearance of the protein in the zzso An zzso directed against the zzso tag, bound to the cell surface at 4 degrees C at the time of zzso zzso zzso could be chased to the zzso domain after subsequent incubation at 37 degrees zzso These results suggest that the newly zzso zzso after initial zzso delivery, may be transported to the zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in polarized zzso is different from that of polarized zzso cells, in which the protein is delivered zzso arguing for zzso specific sorting and processing zzso
