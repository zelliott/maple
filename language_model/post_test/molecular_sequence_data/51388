zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in long-term culture of immobilized Chinese zzso zzso cells utilizing a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was continuously zzso with zzso medium supplemented with zzso fetal calf serum at an average flow rate of 5 zzso for 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso ranging from 100 to 500 zzso was zzso to apparent zzso by an efficient zzso procedure involving a zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso zzso than zzso recovery of zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein has an apparent molecular weight of 16 zzso identical to that of zzso human zzso or zzso fluid zzso zzso as determined by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Application of the zzso protein onto several different gel zzso columns resulted in zzso of the protein at molecular weights corresponding to zzso zzso suggesting an interaction of the protein with the column zzso However, zzso zzso experiments revealed that the protein behaves as a zzso zzso zzso over a protein concentration range of approximately 10 zzso to 5 zzso With zzso zzso coli zzso as zzso the zzso protein has zzso properties zzso zzso effects of bovine serum zzso sodium zzso zzso and requirement for zzso similar to those of the protein zzso from human zzso
