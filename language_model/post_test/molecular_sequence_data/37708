zzso zzso zzso stimulate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other genes in zzso beta zzso In liver cells, pharmacological zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso the effects of zzso suggesting a key signaling role for this zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso activity is inhibited by elevated zzso zzso in zzso beta cells and that zzso of the zzso with zzso prevents the zzso of the zzso gene by elevated zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso of zzso complex, but not to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso mimics the effects of elevated zzso on the zzso and zzso promoter activities as assessed by zzso imaging of promoter zzso zzso In each case, injection of zzso into the nucleus and zzso but not the nucleus alone, was necessary, indicating the importance of either a zzso zzso event or the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso diminished, but did not zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso changes in zzso activity are necessary and sufficient for the regulation of the zzso gene by the sugar and also play an important role in the regulation of the zzso zzso
