As well as for chemical and environmental reasons, zzso is widely used in many industrial zzso Due to its zzso and zzso its discharge into the environment causes adverse effects on humans and ecology zzso In this study, a novel zzso zzso has been zzso The isolate was identified as zzso zzso strain zzso using ITS zzso zzso The results showed that the best carbon source for growth was zzso at zzso zzso The optimum zzso zzso being a nitrogen source for cellular growth, was at 500 zzso zzso The highest tolerable concentration of zzso was 1500 zzso zzso whereas growth was completely inhibited at 2000 zzso zzso At 500 zzso zzso the strain zzso completely zzso zzso on day zzso zzso acid as a zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso grew well between pH zzso and zzso and between 27 and 30 zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso supported zzso zzso heavy metals such as mercury, zzso and cadmium inhibited growth on zzso
