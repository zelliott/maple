zzso zzso zzso zzso with a dual spray zzso zzso source has been used to measure the molecular weights of zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso accuracy better than zzso Da was achieved for all zzso zzso in the molecular weight range of 11,000 to 27,000 zzso At this mass assignment accuracy level, the sequences of the zzso zzso investigated in this study are easily determined based on molecular weight zzso The zzso 1, 2, and 5 of zzso were observed to undergo zzso under normal storage conditions as ammonium zzso suspension at 2 to 8 degrees zzso These oxidized zzso can be separated completely or partially by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso from their native zzso For the determination of zzso sites, the oxidized zzso and their zzso counterparts were fraction collected, zzso zzso and mapped by zzso The oxidized peptides and their zzso counterparts were further studied by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso to confirm their zzso The zzso at position 212 of zzso 1, at position 89 of zzso 2, and at position 40 of zzso 5 were found to be the primary sites of zzso
