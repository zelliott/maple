zzso genes are regulated by complex, zzso located zzso zzso zzso often forming zzso regulatory blocks zzso that are zzso among zzso and among zzso We have investigated zzso associated with zzso zzso genes in 39 zzso Despite 600 million years of independent evolution, zzso genes are linked to zzso zzso genes in nearly all studied zzso We show that zzso zzso populate the zzso zzso suggesting that regulatory constraints zzso the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso are zzso and not associated with zzso however, zzso and elephant shark data demonstrate that this is a derived feature, and that many zzso were zzso located within zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have allowed selective elimination of zzso zzso from the zzso regulatory landscape while keeping associated zzso resulting in large associated gene zzso These results highlight the importance of zzso in imposing constraints to zzso architecture, even across large zzso zzso and of gene zzso genetic zzso to zzso these constraints, increasing zzso zzso
