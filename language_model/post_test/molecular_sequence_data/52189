A zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso which specifies the zzso zzso zzso acid transport system zzso has been zzso The upstream region contains the zzso and zzso genes zzso the zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso In this study, the zzso sequence of the zzso downstream segment was determined and found to contain four reading zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso putative zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso proteins composed of 308 and 425 zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso proteins of 255 and 237 zzso zzso zzso both the proteins contain consensus zzso acid sequences found in proteins with zzso zzso These four genes linked together have a potential zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso of zzso No promoter sequence was found in the immediate upstream region of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene products were identified as proteins with apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso gel zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these four proteins showed strong zzso to those of the corresponding zzso proteins required for the zzso zzso zzso acid transport systems from both zzso coli and zzso zzso
