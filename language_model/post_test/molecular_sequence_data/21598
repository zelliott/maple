zzso amplified zzso DNA zzso analysis was used to investigate the diversity of 179 bean zzso recovered from six field sites in the zzso de zzso region of northwestern zzso The zzso were divided into 6 groups based on the fingerprint patterns that were zzso Representatives for each group were selected for sequence analysis of 4 zzso DNA zzso Five of the groups were placed within zzso zzso and the other group was placed within zzso zzso type zzso zzso the collection of Portuguese bean zzso was shown to include the two species zzso zzso and zzso zzso In plant tests, the strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and formed zzso zzso both with zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene identical with the zzso zzso locus that zzso wide host range was detected in the strain zzso as well as 24 others identified as zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene also was detected in the remaining zzso of zzso zzso but in this case the locus was that identified with the zzso zzso zzso Representatives of zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso formed effective zzso zzso with zzso zzso and did not zzso zzso zzso From sequence data of zzso the zzso zzso genes for zzso were placed within those of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results would support the suggestion that zzso zzso was the recipient of the genes for zzso with beans from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
