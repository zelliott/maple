zzso pesticides are zzso zzso control agents in agricultural zzso Both agricultural and residential usage is continuing to grow, leading to the development of zzso resistance in the zzso and toxic effects on a number of zzso zzso Thus, it is necessary to hunt suitable zzso including zzso for degrading zzso zzso which is an efficient zzso solution to zzso polluting zzso Although many zzso zzso have consistently been zzso and characterized from various resources including zzso and organisms, the zzso zzso zzso have not been reported up to the zzso 

In this study, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso with zzso functional screening from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained 280 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass zzso of zzso zzso and was zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso in soluble zzso The optimum pH and temperature of the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was stable in the pH range of zzso and at temperatures below zzso The activity of zzso decreased a little when stored at zzso for 10 weeks, and the residual activity reached zzso Even after incubation at zzso for 10 weeks, it kept zzso of its zzso The zzso zzso could zzso a wide range of zzso zzso but its best zzso is zzso zzso with the highest activity zzso zzso The zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso under zzso conditions of zzso for 15 zzso with exceeding zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first report to construct zzso libraries from zzso zzso to obtain the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso with broad zzso zzso and high activity was the most zzso one of the zzso zzso studied before, which made it an ideal candidate for the zzso of zzso
