The zzso zzso includes zzso zzso and zzso which will be collectively referred to as zzso zzso unless otherwise zzso zzso are the dominant tree species in many forest zzso in the Northern Hemisphere and are of substantial economic value in zzso zzso zzso has been established as a model system for zzso studies of growth, development, and adaptation of woody perennial plants including secondary zzso formation, zzso adaptation to local zzso and zzso zzso 

As part of the zzso zzso sequencing project and the development of zzso resources for poplar, we have generated a full-length zzso collection using the zzso zzso zzso zzso We constructed four zzso libraries using zzso from zzso zzso and zzso and green shoot tips and leaves from the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso leaves of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following careful selection of candidate zzso zzso we used a combined strategy of paired end reads and primer walking to generate a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso which clustered into zzso putative unique zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso sequence combined with zzso comparisons to previously predicted protein coding sequences in the zzso zzso identified 39 zzso that likely zzso to gaps in the current zzso sequence zzso Another 173 zzso mapped to the zzso sequence but were not included among the previously predicted genes in the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis against zzso zzso and other species in the zzso database of zzso revealed that zzso of the zzso zzso display no significant sequence similarity to other plant zzso By mapping the zzso zzso against zzso data previously obtained with a zzso K zzso zzso we identified 153 zzso clones for genes that were zzso expressed in zzso leaves attacked by forest tent zzso 

This study has generated a high-quality zzso resource for zzso and the third largest zzso collection published to date for any plant zzso We successfully used the zzso sequences to reassess gene prediction in the zzso zzso zzso perform comparative sequence zzso and identify zzso expressed transcripts associated with defense against zzso The zzso sequences will be essential to the ongoing zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso in particular for targeting gaps in the current zzso assembly and further improvement of gene zzso The physical zzso clones will serve as useful zzso for functional zzso research in areas such as analysis of gene functions in defense against insects and perennial zzso zzso from this study have been deposited in zzso zzso under the zzso numbers zzso to zzso
