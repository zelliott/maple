zzso of a previously identified zzso zzso designated zzso which are zzso expressed in zzso zzso and embryonic cells, have previously been functionally linked to zzso zzso zzso A zzso construct of mouse zzso in which the 20 zzso zzso acids have been replaced by eight zzso from human zzso has been expressed in zzso zzso This zzso mouse zzso zzso exhibited zzso metabolism accurately zzso the characteristic product distribution and specific activity of zzso zzso zzso seen in zzso cells from which this zzso has been zzso The high proportion of zzso and zzso and near absence of zzso and zzso zzso are seen only in zzso zzso where zzso is highly zzso This distribution of products from zzso was highly dependent on addition of zzso zzso particularly the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso These characteristics in addition to zzso by zzso raised to zzso establish that the zzso zzso indeed encodes the zzso responsible for zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso metabolism from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso human zzso zzso however, exhibited a different zzso toward zzso resembling human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with different zzso of zzso zzso indicated a high affinity interaction with an apparent zzso of 3 zzso Large zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso with high affinity zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with substantial spectral shifts zzso low to high spin state zzso Smaller zzso like zzso zzso and zzso neither produced spectral changes nor inhibited the spectral change caused by zzso Among tested steroids, zzso bound zzso to zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso with a comparable spectral shift and was a weak inhibitor of zzso zzso but was not zzso While zzso is a zzso for human zzso we have found no evidence for binding to mouse zzso This data establishes zzso as an important contributor to zzso of zzso particularly in extra zzso zzso that are susceptible to cancer where zzso in contrast to zzso is zzso zzso
