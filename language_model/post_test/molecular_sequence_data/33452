Two novel zzso proteins zzso and zzso have recently been zzso These zzso proteins contain, respectively, zzso copies of an 11 zzso acid repetitive domain zzso observed in a zzso gene from zzso zzso and zzso copies of a 15 zzso acid repetitive domain zzso observed in the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We compare structural characteristics of the proteins and material properties of resulting zzso relative to zzso a previously characterized zzso protein zzso by the first zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso While the repetitive zzso of natural zzso display significant variation both in terms of zzso acid sequence and zzso our synthetic zzso have been designed as perfect zzso Using techniques including circular zzso atomic force zzso and zzso testing, we demonstrate that both zzso and zzso have similar material properties to those previously observed in insect and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso content in the zzso zzso were zzso Despite the reduced complexity of the zzso and zzso proteins compared to natural zzso we have been able to produce elastic and resilient zzso with similar properties to zzso
