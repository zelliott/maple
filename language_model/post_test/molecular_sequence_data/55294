The zzso head zzso and zzso plates of the zzso zzso cheek and tail spot zzso have zzso spots, unlike the entirely white appearance of the zzso zzso zzso We report the identification and characterization of the gene responsible for the zzso zzso zzso cloning revealed a zzso candidate on zzso 16, designated zzso based on the high similarity of the deduced zzso acid sequence between the candidate gene from the zzso strain and the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso likely encodes a membrane protein with 11 putative zzso zzso while the putative structure deduced from the zzso zzso possesses only zzso zzso zzso zzso to a deletion in its coding zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was strongly expressed in the zzso of the head and tail, where the zzso zzso is zzso expression markedly increased at the zzso and newly zzso zzso These results indicate that the novel zzso gene is zzso and the membrane structure of its protein accounts for the zzso zzso These expression profiles and the zzso zzso are quite similar to those of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in the zzso synthesis zzso
