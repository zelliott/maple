zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in catalyzing the folding of zzso zzso It features two zzso inactive zzso zzso inserted between two zzso active zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso reveals that the four zzso zzso are arranged in the shape of a twisted zzso with the active sites facing each other across the long sides of the zzso The inside surface of the zzso is enriched in zzso zzso thereby zzso interactions with zzso zzso The domain arrangement, active site location, and surface features zzso resemble the zzso coli zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that all zzso of zzso including the zzso tail, are required for full zzso zzso The structure defines a framework for zzso the differences between the two active sites and their respective roles in catalyzing the formation and zzso of zzso zzso
