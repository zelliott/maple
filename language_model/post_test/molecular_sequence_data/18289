A series of zzso zzso within the zzso domain of tomato zzso stunt zzso have been evaluated for their effects upon zzso and symptom zzso None of the 12 zzso zzso and one zzso substitution that were examined abolished zzso in a whole plant zzso and the resulting progeny were characterized by zzso sequence analysis of zzso amplified by the zzso chain zzso Four of the 13 zzso gave rise to altered zzso but the patterns of sequence changes observed were unexpectedly zzso zzso that did not rapidly zzso to the zzso sequence are located near the right border of the zzso domain, a region which shows considerable natural sequence zzso None had a zzso effect upon symptom zzso The ability to observe zzso sequence evolution in zzso may provide insight into the molecular interactions responsible for zzso host range and symptom zzso
