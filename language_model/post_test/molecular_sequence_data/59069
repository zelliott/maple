We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso pathway, from potato zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso When the potato zzso was expressed in zzso coli a 45 zzso protein with zzso activity was zzso The first 62 zzso acids of the deduced zzso acid sequence represent an apparent zzso transit zzso While the potato zzso has considerable similarity to the zzso from zzso and zzso zzso similarity to the zzso zzso zzso from humans, zzso coli and zzso zzso is more zzso Northern analysis indicated that the zzso zzso accumulated in zzso in response to zzso zzso the zzso from various potato zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso to higher levels in the stem of mature potato plants than in either leaves or zzso These data are consistent with a role for this zzso in zzso zzso
