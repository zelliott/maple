zzso are a zzso of zzso defined by their highly zzso zzso structures and ability to bind to zzso like Gal zzso zzso zzso Here, we used zzso zzso and pulse field zzso zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to the relatively large zzso zzso whose backbone is composed of zzso zzso units to which single zzso zzso are periodically attached via zzso linkage zzso zzso of 59 zzso The zzso binding domain covers a relatively large area on the surface of zzso that runs across the zzso interface primarily on that side of the protein opposite to the zzso binding zzso Our data show that zzso binds zzso with an apparent equilibrium zzso constant zzso of 10 zzso zzso M, compared to 260 zzso zzso M for zzso and a zzso of about 3 to 6 zzso molecules per zzso zzso zzso also interacts at the same zzso binding domain on zzso but with at least zzso lower zzso supporting the role of zzso units in zzso for relatively strong binding to zzso We also found that the zzso binding domain remains accessible in the zzso complex, as zzso can still bind with no apparent loss in zzso In addition, zzso binding to zzso also zzso the zzso structure of the zzso and appears to reduce its zzso radius and disrupt zzso interactions thereby reducing zzso solution zzso Overall, our findings contribute to understanding zzso interactions and provide insight into zzso function with potentially significant biological zzso
