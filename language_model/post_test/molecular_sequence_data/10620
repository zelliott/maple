We have studied the zzso as well as zzso zzso synthesis of zzso fragments, namely zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso A, to examine whether zzso zzso of the product can facilitate reverse zzso The circular zzso study showed zzso cooperative zzso formation in zzso with zzso of about zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso solutions at pH 6 and 4 degrees zzso The zzso melting profiles of zzso in the above zzso were very zzso zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso from a zzso mixture of the zzso complementary fragments zzso and zzso in the presence of the above zzso at pH 6 and 4 degrees zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not catalyze the zzso of zzso and zzso although zzso could assume zzso zzso in the presence of the zzso used for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso an analog of zzso zzso in which zzso 10-14 were zzso zzso While zzso exhibited zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso solutions, zzso displayed predominantly zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced resistance to zzso as compared with zzso Thus, failure of zzso of zzso may be a consequence of high flexibility around the zzso zzso bond due to its proximity to the zzso stop zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso may be achieved by design and manipulation of the zzso aspects of the zzso
