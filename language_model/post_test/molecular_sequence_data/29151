zzso zzso are zzso pumps that enable organisms to control cellular functions and survive changing environmental conditions by regulating internal zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso amplification with zzso zzso that recognize zzso motifs present in all zzso zzso the zzso zzso site zzso and the zzso binding site zzso zzso analysis and the presence of zzso motifs in predicted zzso sequences identify the zzso zzso as a zzso zzso calcium pump zzso three additional zzso transporting pumps zzso three zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso of unknown transport specificity zzso Southern zzso analyses indicate that the zzso zzso genes are not linked and are present in single zzso except zzso and zzso which contain additional copies or closely related zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso were detected by Northern zzso zzso No zzso transcript was observed, however, zzso amplification of a transcript product indicates that zzso is zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso except zzso was zzso over a range of environmental zzso zzso zzso and zzso had the highest levels of zzso expression while zzso and zzso expression was the zzso
