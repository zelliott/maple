The zzso family includes a number of highly zzso low molecular weight zzso proteins expressed on zzso and zzso zzso The best characterized family member is zzso zzso an zzso commonly used for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We sought to characterize the zzso locus surrounding the zzso zzso We identified several overlapping zzso artificial zzso containing the zzso gene and mapped one of these to mouse zzso zzso the region previously shown to contain members of the zzso zzso gene zzso We then mapped this clone and found that the zzso gene lies zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso in the opposite zzso zzso This is the first direct demonstration of physical linkage of zzso zzso A novel zzso highly zzso to zzso was identified and localized zzso zzso downstream of zzso This zzso which we designated zzso shares several structural features zzso among members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is easily zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as kidney and zzso No zzso expression was detected in heart, stomach, liver, small zzso brain, or zzso zzso protein is zzso on zzso to zzso of peripheral blood zzso including zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso is broadly distributed in the bone zzso with prominent expression on zzso and zzso zzso The identification and characterization of zzso adds a new member to a complex family of zzso tightly linked genes that have proven extremely useful zzso for defining populations within the zzso zzso
