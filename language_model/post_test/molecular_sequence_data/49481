From the larger set of 191 zzso at all the variable contact positions in the turkey zzso third domain, we selected a subset that consists of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at eight of the nine zzso zzso positions zzso zzso the exception being zzso which is involved in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were collected for each zzso as a function of sample zzso This allowed for the evaluation of 31 of the 32 zzso values for these zzso the exception being that of zzso whose signals at high pH could not be resolved from those of other zzso zzso in the zzso Only two of the zzso zzso are present in the zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso these zzso complement earlier zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso This data set was supplemented with results from the pH dependence of zzso zzso of four additional single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two double zzso zzso and zzso Probably the most striking result was observation of a zzso hydrogen bond and a zzso zzso interaction within the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 17, 19, and 21, zzso In several cases, the zzso of a particular zzso was sensed by zzso not only in that zzso but also in zzso with which it zzso zzso in several interacting systems, zzso from different zzso within the same zzso yielded different zzso zzso
