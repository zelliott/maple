A zzso zzso zzso locus composed of five adjacent zzso designated zzso was identified by zzso zzso as being essential for cell zzso Products of the zzso genes exhibit extensive sequence similarities to the zzso of zzso entry into zzso cells zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso restored the ability to invade zzso zzso The structural and functional conservation of the Sip and zzso proteins suggests that zzso and zzso entry processes are promoted by similar zzso
