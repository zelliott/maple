zzso constitute a large family of zzso DNA viruses that cause serious losses in important crops zzso They often exist in disease complexes and have high zzso and zzso rates, allowing them to adapt rapidly to new hosts and zzso Thus, an effective resistance strategy must be general in character and able to target multiple zzso The zzso replication protein zzso is a good target for broad-based disease control because it is highly zzso and required for viral zzso In an earlier study, we identified a set of zzso zzso that bind to zzso and reduce viral replication in cultured plant zzso In this study, we selected 16 of the zzso zzso for further analysis in zzso zzso zzso The results of these experiments showed that all 16 zzso zzso interact with all or most of the zzso proteins from nine viruses representing the three major zzso zzso and identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that interact strongly with different regions in the zzso N zzso zzso tomato lines expressing zzso or zzso and zzso with Tomato yellow leaf zzso virus or Tomato zzso virus exhibited delayed viral DNA zzso and often contained lower levels of viral zzso zzso the effect on symptoms was stronger, with many of the plants showing no symptoms or strongly attenuated zzso Together, these results established the efficacy of using zzso zzso zzso to develop crops that are resistant to diverse zzso
