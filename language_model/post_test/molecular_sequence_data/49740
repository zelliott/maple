The zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso channels on zzso zzso zzso zzso we report a novel zzso termed zzso zzso binding protein released with zzso zzso which interacts with type 1 zzso zzso and was released upon zzso binding to zzso zzso was zzso from a high salt extract of crude rat brain zzso with zzso zzso using an affinity column with the huge immobilized zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso has a domain zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso and in the zzso a 104 zzso acid zzso containing multiple potential zzso zzso In zzso binding experiments showed the zzso region of zzso to be essential for interaction, and the zzso binding region of zzso was mapped to the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso with an zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso it was 50 times more potent than other zzso zzso Moreover, alkaline zzso treatment abolished the interaction, suggesting that the interaction was zzso regulated by zzso and zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso showed the relevance of the interaction in a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is released from activated zzso raising the possibility that zzso acts as a signaling zzso downstream from zzso
