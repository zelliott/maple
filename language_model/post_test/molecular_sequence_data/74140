We identified an zzso recognized on a human zzso lung zzso by a zzso T zzso clone derived from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is presented by zzso and is zzso by the zzso zzso which codes for zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is derived from the zzso region of the zzso signal zzso and is processed independently of zzso and the zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso occurs within the zzso zzso of all zzso and normal cells tested, including zzso cells, and it involves signal zzso and the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in several lung zzso compared with normal zzso leading to recognition by the T cell zzso This new zzso is, therefore, a promising candidate for cancer zzso
