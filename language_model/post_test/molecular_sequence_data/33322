We have established tools for forward and reverse genetic analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A structured population of zzso progeny of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is available for single zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso (for zzso zzso Local zzso IN zzso zzso zzso zzso of this population, we identified a zzso load of one per 502 zzso of amplified zzso Moreover, we observed a 1:10 ratio between zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This reveals a clear difference in zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we assembled zzso siblings with obvious zzso in overall development, starch zzso or zzso root zzso zzso in three zzso zzso By screening the zzso population of zzso individuals for zzso in a set of 12 genes known to be essential for zzso development, we identified large zzso series for each zzso generating a unique data set that combines zzso and zzso information zzso zzso zzso This analysis revealed a significant bias for replacements of zzso zzso zzso in functionally defective zzso which may be explained by the exceptional structural features of zzso zzso allows the zzso chain to adopt zzso that are no longer possible after zzso acid zzso This previously zzso vulnerability of proteins at zzso zzso could be used for the improvement of zzso that are designed to predict the deleterious nature of single zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the power, as well as the limitations, of zzso zzso zzso for forward and reverse genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso at zzso Access to the zzso zzso facility can be obtained through zzso or zzso
