Genes that enable crops to limit zzso zzso in shoot zzso represent potential sources of zzso tolerance for zzso In zzso the zzso locus lowered shoot zzso content by between zzso and 59% zzso zzso or not at all, depending on the growth conditions in zzso and a range of soil types, indicating a strong influence of environment on zzso zzso was zzso on the long arm of barley zzso zzso zzso intervals of zzso zzso containing a total of 34 predicted zzso were defined in the zzso rice and zzso zzso zzso a close barley zzso of the zzso zzso tolerance gene of zzso zzso with zzso No difference in zzso zzso expression was detected between the mapping zzso However, zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso were zzso revealing a single zzso zzso acid substitution difference in the zzso zzso The known crystal structure of zzso was used as a template to obtain molecular models of the barley zzso resulting in structures very similar to that of zzso The position in zzso corresponding to the barley substitution does not participate directly in zzso zzso zzso modifications or interaction with the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso but not zzso forms a predicted hydrogen bond with a zzso zzso which has potential implications for the overall structure and function of the barley zzso zzso therefore represents a candidate for zzso that warrants further zzso
