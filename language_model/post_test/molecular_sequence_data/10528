A synthetic zzso consisting of zzso acid zzso 106 to 126 of the human prion protein zzso that forms zzso in zzso is toxic to cultured zzso We have previously shown that the zzso effect of this zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso For closer insight into this process of zzso we investigated the effect of the zzso on the zzso free zzso concentration zzso in cultured zzso using zzso zzso zzso from zzso as well as from zzso zzso mice zzso responded to exposure to zzso with an increase in zzso free calcium within 30 zzso We observed two types of zzso Both in zzso and zzso mice about half of the tested cells presented a small and often transient calcium increase after zzso application which was found to be independent of the zzso calcium zzso However, a further zzso of zzso cells showed a strong and often permanent calcium increase depending on the zzso calcium zzso which was only rarely observed in zzso zzso To determine whether the response depended on the zzso state of the zzso we also examined zzso activated zzso The character of the calcium response remained zzso but significantly fewer cells zzso Our findings demonstrate the earliest reaction of zzso to a zzso zzso known to zzso
