In potato zzso zzso the zzso included, zzso zzso zzso requires a strong zzso and zzso zzso tract for zzso The strength of these zzso signals was demonstrated by greatly enhanced zzso of a poorly spliced zzso and by their ability to support zzso of an artificial zzso following their zzso Plant zzso also require a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for efficient zzso zzso zzso of the zzso caused loss of zzso inclusion without loss of zzso enhancement, showing that the same zzso sequence can function as either a zzso tract or a zzso zzso zzso The distinction between the zzso signals depended on zzso context (the presence or absence of an upstream, adjacent and functional zzso and on the sequence context of the zzso zzso zzso tracts tolerated C zzso while zzso zzso elements tolerated zzso Thus, in plant zzso zzso zzso elements can have dual roles as either a general plant zzso zzso signal or a zzso zzso Finally, zzso of two different zzso binding proteins enhanced zzso recognition zzso These results highlight the importance of zzso between zzso signals, the importance of other zzso within zzso elements for optimal binding of competing zzso factors and effects on zzso efficiency of zzso binding zzso
