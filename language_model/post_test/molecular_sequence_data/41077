We present a novel zzso platform for peptides quantitative zzso in biological zzso based on zzso liquid zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso mass zzso detection using the selected reaction monitoring zzso zzso The zzso source was equipped with a high frequency zzso laser zzso zzso and mounted on a triple zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso Compared to conventional zzso the separated zzso are zzso onto the zzso plate in zzso and navigation through the zzso zzso makes it possible to perform zzso experiments as well as enhanced product zzso zzso acquisition for zzso analyses without time zzso The zzso spots were analyzed using different zzso speeds ranging from zzso to 4 zzso with the shortest analysis time of 425 zzso Since the zzso runs can be zzso and do not need a comprehensive investigation, the present platform offers a valuable alternative to zzso for high zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso zzso group by zzso was found to be key for the fragmentation of zzso charged peptides under low collision energy zzso Under such conditions, zzso series were observed in the zzso zzso and thus the design of zzso experiments was greatly zzso The quantitative performance of the platform was compared to that of zzso by zzso zzso zzso peptides in human plasma zzso Both platforms exhibited similar sensitivities, accuracy zzso zzso and precision (under zzso in the relative zzso zzso As a proof of principle, the relative and absolute zzso of proteins associated with zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso cycles over a growth time course of zzso zzso on zzso media was successfully performed using zzso zzso
