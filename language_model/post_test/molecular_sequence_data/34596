zzso factor proteins regulate gene expression via binding to specific DNA sequences found in the zzso regions of the genes they zzso Although most zzso factor binding has been associated with an increase in gene zzso gene suppression has also been zzso zzso factor zzso are molecules that mimic the binding sites for zzso factor zzso and compete with promoter regions to absorb this binding activity in the cell zzso By blocking zzso zzso DNA interaction, these molecules provide a powerful means to manipulate the regulation of gene zzso particularly as zzso factors are increasingly understood to alter gene zzso during the course of normal and zzso processes in cell zzso As methods for cellular and nuclear delivery of these agents improve, the increasing use of zzso factor zzso both as investigative and therapeutic tools, promises to have a significant impact on our understanding of and ability to treat human zzso
