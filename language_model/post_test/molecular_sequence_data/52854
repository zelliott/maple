zzso zzso is a member of a group of proteins (including zzso and zzso that are all of similar size and domain zzso The three proteins contain an zzso zzso domain, followed by a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso While it is well established that the zzso domain functions as a zzso zzso exchange factor zzso for zzso factors zzso and the zzso domain anchors the proteins to membrane zzso the function of the zzso domain is zzso Here we show that the N zzso of zzso zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient to target the protein to the zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are not sufficient for zzso zzso Further deletion analysis and point zzso indicate that the zzso domain within the N zzso is responsible for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso N zzso also have the same capability of targeting to the zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso domain is used to target this family of proteins to the zzso zzso
