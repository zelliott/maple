zzso zzso is a devastating zzso zzso that causes late blight on tomato and zzso Recent zzso sequencing efforts of zzso zzso and other zzso species are generating vast amounts of sequence data providing opportunities to zzso the complex nature of zzso However, accurate zzso of zzso zzso will be a significant zzso Most of the information about gene structure in these species was gathered from a handful of genes resulting in significant limitations for development of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we collected a total of 150 zzso determined near full-length zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso that were predicted to contain full open reading frame zzso We performed detailed zzso analyses of these zzso sequences to obtain a snapshot of zzso zzso gene structure, gauge the degree of sequence conservation between zzso zzso genes and those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and identify patterns of gene conservation between zzso zzso and various zzso particularly zzso for which zzso translated protein sequences are zzso These analyses helped us to define the structural characteristics of zzso zzso genes using a validated data zzso We also determined the degree of sequence conservation within the zzso zzso and identified a set of fast evolving zzso Finally, we identified a set of genes that are shared between zzso and zzso zzso but absent in animal zzso zzso These results confirm that plant zzso zzso and zzso share zzso zzso and suggest that zzso microbial pathogens that share similar lifestyles also share a similar set of genes independently of their zzso zzso
