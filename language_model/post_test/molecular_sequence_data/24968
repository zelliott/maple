zzso the zzso of the zzso Gene in zzso Cloning of a zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was cloned from the brain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is zzso zzso in zzso and contains an open reading frame that codes for 251 zzso zzso Within the open reading frame there are seven zzso zzso zzso There were five zzso zzso sequences that are flanked by sets of paired basic zzso acid zzso zzso sites and two zzso extended zzso zzso zzso and zzso No zzso sequences were found in zzso zzso zzso It was possible to align the zzso acid sequences of zzso from several zzso zzso zzso Australian zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by inserting a minimum of nine zzso This alignment was then used to analyze the corresponding zzso for each zzso sequence using maximum zzso This analysis yielded a single zzso In this tree, the Australian zzso sequence was the zzso or the zzso zzso The zzso sequences form a zzso separate from the human zzso The zzso value for the zzso zzso was zzso Within the zzso zzso the zzso sequence was the sister group to a zzso composed of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso value for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso these data indicate that the sequence of zzso zzso may be more similar to the proposed ancestral zzso zzso zzso than either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso
