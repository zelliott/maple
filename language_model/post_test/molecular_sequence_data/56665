This manuscript describes a protocol for the zzso of glass slide preparations of zzso specimens for the recovery of zzso that is of a quality suitable for the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso detection of specific gene zzso Total cellular zzso obtained from archival bone zzso zzso zzso of 23 leukemia patients, which had been stored for periods of time from 1 day to 34 zzso were zzso and 1 to 2 zzso of each were subjected to zzso using primer pairs specific for the amplification of zzso zzso Three pairs of zzso for the amplification of zzso zzso of zzso and 540 base pairs were used to evaluate the length of zzso that could be zzso the results indicate the consistent amplification of zzso for the zzso and zzso fragments as revealed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso To address the utility of zzso analysis towards the detection of zzso associated with specific gene zzso in such zzso a primer pair for amplification of the zzso fusion zzso was used in zzso of zzso zzso for each of the 23 zzso three of which were zzso acute zzso zzso known to have the zzso zzso zzso resulting in the fusion of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of the products of these zzso zzso revealed the amplification of the fusion gene zzso in only those cases for which there was zzso documentation of zzso these results were confirmed by the Southern filter zzso of an internal zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
