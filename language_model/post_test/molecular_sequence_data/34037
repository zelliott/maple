Human killer cell zzso receptors zzso recognize zzso zzso zzso and C2 zzso carried by mutually exclusive zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and -C zzso zzso and orangutan have counterparts to zzso zzso and zzso and zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso and C2 zzso either individually or in zzso Because zzso zzso has counterparts of zzso and zzso but not zzso we expected that zzso zzso would better recognize zzso and zzso than zzso zzso of the interactions of nine zzso zzso with 95 zzso zzso showed the zzso have broad specificity for zzso zzso and zzso but vary in zzso Considering both the strength and breadth of reaction, zzso was the major target for zzso zzso followed by zzso then zzso Strong reactions with zzso were restricted to the minority of zzso carrying the zzso zzso whereas strong reactions with zzso zzso between zzso having and lacking zzso zzso to zzso and zzso every zzso zzso bound to the nine zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed the importance of zzso in the zzso of the zzso domain and the zzso zzso At zzso position 9, zzso zzso favor binding to zzso zzso whereas charged zzso do zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso bind more effectively to zzso than to zzso and zzso This property is consistent with major zzso complex zzso having evolved in zzso to be a generally superior zzso for zzso than zzso and zzso
