A full-length zzso clone of a human zzso zzso XIV zzso gene symbol zzso was obtained and zzso The zzso sequence was zzso zzso long and was predicted to zzso a zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of CA XIV showed an overall similarity of zzso to other active CA zzso The highest percentage similarity was with a zzso CA zzso CA zzso As observed for CA zzso CA XIV has zzso segments at both zzso of the deduced protein for a putative signal sequence and a zzso zzso CA XIV showed low activity and was sensitive to zzso but not to zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated an approximately zzso transcript in the adult human heart, brain, liver, and skeletal zzso zzso zzso analysis for CA XIV zzso expression showed a strong signal in all parts of the human brain and a weaker signal in the zzso small zzso urinary zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed an intense signal in the liver and spinal zzso and a faint signal in the zzso No CA XIV zzso was seen in the zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, CA zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not in the liver or spinal zzso The CA XIV gene was localized to human zzso zzso These findings indicate genetically distinct but closely related zzso of human zzso zzso CA zzso and CA zzso which have different patterns of zzso zzso
