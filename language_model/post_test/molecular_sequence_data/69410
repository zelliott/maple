The zzso zzso DNA sequence of zzso type 40 strain zzso was determined directly from random fragments of zzso DNA cloned into a zzso zzso cloning zzso The gene layout is similar to that of other human zzso and in addition contains two potential zzso regions that are zzso but have not been recognized zzso in other zzso zzso One is oriented zzso contained within the zzso in the zzso region for the zzso zzso zzso and would zzso a protein sharing zzso sequence with zzso The other is a zzso oriented zzso located between the zzso and zzso IV zzso regions which would specify the N zzso of a novel zzso The region zzso the C zzso of this protein is not apparent from sequence zzso
