Chemical modification studies with zzso zzso have indicated that zzso appear to be at or near the active site of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ginsburg, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were prepared that contained approximately 1, approximately 2, and approximately 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso the activity of each sample was 100, 25, and zzso of the activity of unmodified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso sample was performed, the peptides were separated by high performance liquid zzso and the peptides containing zzso zzso were identified by their zzso at 320 zzso These isolated peptides were analyzed for zzso acid composition and zzso The N zzso of the protein (a zzso zzso was modified by zzso zzso at a zzso of approximately zzso Da and this modified zzso had full zzso zzso Beyond a zzso of approximately 1, zzso zzso and 352 reacted with zzso zzso and each modification results in a partial loss of zzso When various combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were used to protect the zzso from zzso zzso was protected from modification indicating that this zzso is at the active zzso Under all experimental conditions zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso analog zzso does not react with zzso zzso
