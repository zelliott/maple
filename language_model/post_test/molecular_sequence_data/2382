zzso of the alpha zzso of the zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso with zzso of translation zzso The importance of zzso alpha zzso in regulating translation was studied by expression of specific zzso of zzso alpha in zzso zzso DNA zzso of certain plasmids could activate zzso zzso and result in poor translation of zzso zzso In these cases, translation of the zzso zzso was improved by the presence of zzso zzso zzso or by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso The improved translation zzso by expression of the zzso zzso alpha zzso was specific to zzso zzso and did not affect global zzso zzso zzso of a zzso acid zzso zzso zzso created to mimic the zzso zzso inhibited translation of the zzso derived from the zzso zzso These results substantiate the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso reduces translation initiation through zzso of zzso alpha and reinforce the importance of zzso of zzso alpha as a way to control initiation of translation in intact zzso
