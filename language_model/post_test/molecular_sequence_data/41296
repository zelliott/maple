zzso of proteins is one of the critical regulatory mechanisms in zzso In higher plants, protein zzso plays an essential role in many biological zzso including hormone zzso zzso and pathogen zzso However, the roles of protein zzso in the zzso process are not zzso In this study, we identified four zzso zzso genes designated zzso zzso Development 1 zzso to zzso as regulators of zzso zzso II zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso double zzso showed a significantly increased percentage of zzso zzso at the mature zzso zzso Further zzso of the zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso resulted in more severe abnormal zzso zzso zzso than in zzso zzso suggesting that cell division was defective in male zzso All of the four genes were expressed in multiple stages at different levels during male zzso zzso zzso analysis using green zzso fusion proteins zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso are associated with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso had zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso and five zzso proteins were zzso Our results suggest that these four genes may be involved, zzso in regulating the zzso process during male zzso
