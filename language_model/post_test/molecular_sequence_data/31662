Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso we identified the zzso relationship among closely related zzso zzso zzso 

Seven zzso zzso strains originally isolated from zzso were characterized by zzso methods to amplify the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso which were determined to assess the suitability as zzso zzso Then, we estimated the genetic distance and constructed the zzso trees including zzso zzso and above mentioned three zzso genes combining with published corresponding zzso 

By comparing the zzso trees, the zzso of three zzso genes trees were consistent with that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of closely related zzso zzso species among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences were different, ranged zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso relationship of three zzso genes sequences were highly consistent with the results of zzso zzso gene zzso while the genetic distance of these zzso genes were extremely high than zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso gene are suitable for zzso and identification closely related zzso zzso zzso
