Several zzso strains had an zzso mechanism of zzso resistance that differed from those that had been reported previously in the zzso This novel mechanism conveyed resistance to zzso and zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso The gene zzso this zzso was cloned by standard methods from total zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso insert into the zzso zzso zzso and expressed in several zzso coli K-12 zzso The location of the zzso zzso was established by functional analysis of deletion derivatives and zzso A search for zzso in the genetic databases confirmed that the gene is a novel one with zzso to zzso pump zzso The zzso coding sequence was zzso into a zzso zzso and expressed from the zzso zzso promoter on the zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso studies of the cloned zzso which has been named zzso for zzso zzso provide evidence for its mechanism of action in host zzso zzso strains containing the cloned zzso maintain lower levels of zzso zzso when this compound is added to the external medium than zzso clones without zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso in the original zzso zzso strain was always lower than that observed in zzso zzso This is consistent with a hypothesis that the gene encodes a novel zzso function which pumps zzso out of the zzso The gene appears to be widely distributed in zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso synthesis using the zzso chain zzso
