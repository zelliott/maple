We report a high-resolution genetic map of 21 genes on the central region of mouse zzso zzso These genes were mapped by segregation analysis of more than 1650 zzso from three zzso zzso The order of these genes in mouse was compared to the previously established gene order in zzso zzso of the 21 genes map to human zzso 5, and 2 of the genes define a zzso border for the region of zzso between mouse zzso 11 and human zzso zzso Our results indicate a minimum of four zzso within the zzso region of zzso zzso between mouse zzso 11 and human zzso zzso In addition, the linkage conservation is disrupted by groups of genes that map to mouse zzso 13 and zzso These data demonstrate that large regions of zzso linkage can contain numerous zzso zzso that have occurred since the divergence of mouse and human zzso zzso of the mouse and human maps with data for other species provides an emerging picture of zzso zzso zzso
