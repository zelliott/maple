Despite copper zzso being crucial in proteins participating in plant processes such as electron zzso zzso elimination and hormone perception and zzso very little is known about copper inward transport across plant zzso In this work, a five-member family zzso of putative zzso copper zzso is zzso We ascertain the ability of these proteins to functionally complement and transport copper in the corresponding zzso zzso zzso copper transport zzso The specific expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso in different zzso was analyzed by zzso Although all members are zzso zzso differences in their relative abundance in roots, leaves, stem and flowers have been zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels, the members that are most zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso copper transport zzso are zzso under copper zzso consistent with a role for these proteins in copper transport in zzso zzso
