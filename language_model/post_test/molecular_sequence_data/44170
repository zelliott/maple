The gene zzso the DNA zzso alpha zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated, zzso and compared with other zzso zzso The coding region is zzso zzso in length and specifies an zzso protein sequence of zzso zzso acids zzso There is a high level of zzso between the human and zzso zzso gene zzso but functional zzso zzso identified in humans and zzso appear to also be zzso in this zzso The discovery of a zzso region located in the midst of the active sites of the zzso which appears to be unique to the zzso and zzso differences found between some of the zzso regions implicated in zzso function, may aid in drug zzso The putative DNA binding zzso finger at the zzso of the protein appears highly species specific and may have potential as a drug target for blocking zzso zzso in the zzso
