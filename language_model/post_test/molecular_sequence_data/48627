zzso is a key regulator of zzso zzso dynamics and bipolar zzso zzso structure with zzso zzso displaying a distinctive zzso zzso zzso It has been zzso that cryptic zzso zzso zzso zzso ability to regulate zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a cryptic zzso domain zzso from human zzso demonstrating the presence of a zzso array in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a convex architecture across the zzso surface that contrasts with the flat zzso surface of zzso family zzso zzso zzso in key zzso zzso zzso abrogate the ability of zzso zzso to rescue bipolar zzso formation in zzso cells depleted of zzso zzso These findings highlight the common zzso use of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso families to regulate zzso dynamics and suggest that differential zzso domain architecture may zzso distinct functions to these critical zzso zzso
