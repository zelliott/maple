The zzso are a major component of soil zzso displaying a complex life cycle that zzso in the formation of often zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is controversial and strongly depends on the weight given by different authors to zzso and zzso zzso We used a molecular approach to establish the zzso relationships in the zzso orders zzso and zzso Twenty-five small zzso zzso zzso gene sequences were zzso with focus on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso our results show that zzso are zzso with zzso arising from within a zzso zzso The zzso zzso itself is zzso and can be divided into two distinct zzso Additionally, we found that zzso zzso comprises two cryptic species, both related to zzso Our study allows the zzso of zzso and zzso characters in the light of molecular data and sets foundations for a new zzso of zzso
