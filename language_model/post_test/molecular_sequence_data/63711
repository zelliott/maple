zzso and zzso complexes catalyze branch migration and resolution of Holliday junctions zzso zzso In addition to their action in the last steps of zzso zzso they process zzso made by replication fork zzso a reaction which occurs at zzso replication zzso by the zzso of blocked leading and lagging strand zzso zzso was recently proposed to bind replication zzso and directly catalyze their conversion into zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of two zzso zzso zzso that resolve zzso based on their capacity to promote zzso zzso and zzso repair of zzso and zzso C zzso but have lost the capacity to reverse zzso In zzso and in zzso evidence indicate that the zzso zzso affect DNA binding and the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso This work shows that zzso actions at zzso and at zzso can be genetically zzso and that zzso zzso compromised for fork reversal remain fully capable of zzso zzso
