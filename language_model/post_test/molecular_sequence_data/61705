The zzso concentration of the zzso coli factor for inversion stimulation zzso a global regulator of zzso and a zzso of certain zzso DNA zzso events, varies substantially in response to changes in the nutritional environment and growth zzso Under conditions of nutritional zzso zzso is zzso expressed at very high levels, whereas under induced zzso conditions, zzso is zzso by stringent zzso We show that both of these regulatory processes operate on the zzso zzso genes of the zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso role of zzso is closely tied to its zzso regulation in response to the nutritional zzso These zzso regulatory processes were previously shown to involve a single promoter zzso P) preceding the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Recent work challenged this notion by presenting evidence from primer extension zzso which appeared to indicate that there are multiple promoters upstream of zzso P that contribute significantly to the expression and regulation of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, a rigorous analysis of the zzso promoter region was conducted to assess the contribution of such additional zzso However, our data from primer extension analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analysis all indicate that zzso P is the sole zzso coli zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso We further show how certain conditions used in the primer extension reactions can generate artifacts resulting from secondary zzso events that are the likely source of incorrect assignment of additional zzso zzso
