zzso zzso strains were characterized zzso and zzso and classified them into four groups according to their specific activities for zzso of linear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The comparative analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso region showed that they belonged to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to involve various and diverse zzso zzso of the families zzso zzso positive strains from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a new family zzso zzso The presence of zzso was strongly related to the specific activity for zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, 26 of 27 strains contained multiple zzso genes coding for probable zzso iron containing zzso zzso and zzso Similar DNA fragments coding for a zzso zzso A zzso zzso were found in all zzso zzso strains and nearly identical DNA fragments coding for likely zzso of a zzso zzso A zzso zzso in all linear zzso zzso The zzso availability in the degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and linear zzso agreed with the molecular probing of the respective genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
