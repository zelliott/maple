The nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified and zzso to identify the source of its zzso zzso The zzso was amplified by zzso in several zzso zzso strains and shown to exhibit multiple bands and length zzso The zzso zzso were shown to segregate in a zzso ratio within zzso zzso in three zzso zzso suggesting that divergent zzso zzso were present in the two zzso of these zzso The two zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso the zzso was zzso zzso in zzso whereas the size of the zzso was estimated to be about zzso zzso These represent the largest published zzso zzso sequences to zzso These sequences can be subdivided into three main regions, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequences are zzso and contain numerous zzso of three types of zzso zzso zzso The length zzso observed between the zzso sequence of the zzso and zzso results from the zzso of various numbers of a 71 zzso zzso called B, occurring in zzso This variation in zzso number suggests that the two zzso resulted from unequal zzso The zzso zzso zzso was aligned with zzso sequences of two other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No sequence similarity was observed between these zzso but zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso length zzso is therefore an efficient tool for investigating genetic relationships between zzso and within zzso in natural zzso zzso
