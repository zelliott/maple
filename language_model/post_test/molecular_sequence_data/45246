We previously described a clinical human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso which showed zzso zzso enhancement of replication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kimura, zzso zzso zzso zzso Isolation and molecular characterization of a zzso zzso human zzso virus type 1 that exhibits zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso 77, zzso To identify the responsible zzso of zzso proteins for such replication enhancement, we constructed a panel of zzso zzso clones harboring portions of the zzso and zzso of zzso and analyzed their replication capabilities and zzso processing zzso Our data suggested that the zzso in the zzso and zzso half of zzso of zzso were indispensable for the zzso enhancement of replication and that zzso facilitated the zzso between the zzso and zzso of the zzso precursor harboring these zzso The zzso in zzso half of zzso rather decreased the zzso of zzso precursor and zzso zzso such negative zzso zzso replication enhancement with zzso can be observed only in the presence of the zzso in entire zzso and zzso of zzso
