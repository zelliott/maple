A zzso was detected in naturally diseased zzso zzso exhibiting symptoms of Australian zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso designed to amplify zzso DNA resulted in detection of zzso DNA in all of the diseased plants zzso no zzso DNA was detected in healthy zzso zzso The collective restriction zzso length zzso zzso patterns of amplified zzso zzso DNA differed from the patterns described previously for other zzso On the basis of the zzso patterns, Australian zzso zzso zzso was classified as a representative of a new zzso designated zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso and related zzso A zzso analysis in which zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences from this and other group zzso zzso was used identified the Australian zzso zzso zzso as a member of a distinct zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the class zzso A zzso tree constructed on the basis of zzso zzso gene sequences was consistent with the hypothesis that there was divergent evolution of Australian zzso zzso zzso and its closet known relative, European zzso zzso zzso zzso from a common zzso The unique properties of the DNA from the Australian zzso zzso zzso clearly establish that it represents a new zzso zzso zzso zzso
