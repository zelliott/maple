Small zzso of the zzso family are crucial regulators of zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by members of the zzso zzso exchange factor zzso family; however, mechanisms that regulate zzso are not well zzso This report demonstrates that zzso a member of a zzso of zzso that contain regulator of G protein signaling zzso is partially localized at or near the plasma zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells, and this zzso is zzso with cortical zzso zzso of the cortical zzso zzso in cells by using zzso B prevents the zzso membrane zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso zzso deletion zzso revealed the presence of a novel zzso acid sequence in zzso located at zzso acids zzso that is necessary and sufficient for zzso to the zzso zzso and interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso that fail to interact with the zzso zzso display enhanced zzso signaling compared with zzso zzso These results identify interaction with the zzso zzso as a novel function for zzso thus implicating zzso interaction in organizing zzso zzso
