zzso surface protein 1 zzso of zzso zzso is a promising candidate for vaccine development against zzso Identification of protective zzso within zzso is an important step towards the zzso of mechanisms of zzso invasion and for the creation of a zzso zzso In this study, we show that a 115 zzso acid region zzso within the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso specifically bind to human zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso invasion at significant levels, in zzso and zzso be recognized by human zzso of individuals from zzso regions of zzso More importantly, we also show that zzso zzso specific to this region prevent zzso invasion at levels approaching zzso in zzso Our data illustrate that not only is zzso involved in zzso zzso of human zzso but that this region is highly zzso producing high zzso zzso The zzso of the role of zzso in zzso invasion is an important component of the development of a zzso malaria zzso and this study identifies a candidate zzso in this zzso
