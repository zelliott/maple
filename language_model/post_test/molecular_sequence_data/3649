zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate both zzso and membrane zzso cycles of zzso and zzso zzso is distinguishable from other zzso proteins by its partial association with a zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigate the activity of this unusual zzso using zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso We establish that the zzso fraction of zzso is associated with the zzso zzso The domain involved in this association is the unique zzso segment of zzso predicted to form an zzso alpha zzso This zzso is indispensable for zzso association of zzso and sufficient to address a green fluorescent protein to the zzso zzso zzso zzso decreasing the zzso surface of the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso We establish that zzso is able to inhibit zzso of the zzso protein and to target this protein to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate the importance of the zzso zzso segment for both zzso targeting and stability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first example of a zzso directly involved in the delivery of a zzso protein to a specific zzso zzso
