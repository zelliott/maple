Iron regulatory proteins zzso control the translation of proteins involved in iron zzso storage and zzso by binding to specific zzso sequences of the corresponding zzso known as zzso elements zzso This strong interaction assures proper iron zzso in animal cells under iron zzso zzso under zzso conditions, zzso binds a zzso cluster and functions as zzso zzso zzso of the balance between the two zzso activities is complex, and it does not depend only on iron zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of human zzso in its zzso zzso zzso with known structures of zzso zzso reveals zzso folds and active site environments with significantly different surface shapes and charge zzso The specific features of human zzso allow us to propose a tentative model of an zzso complex that agrees with a range of previously obtained zzso
