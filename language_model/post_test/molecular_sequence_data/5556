The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed four open reading frames which, based on sequence zzso were designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso to alkaline zzso and zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are anchored in the zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso zzso and zzso repeats but harbors a zzso repeat of zzso zzso By zzso analysis, the zzso zzso and zzso genes were shown to be essential for zzso iron import in zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso gene is not involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
