zzso sequence repeat zzso markers are widely used tools for zzso about genetic diversity, zzso and spatial genetic zzso Their applications assume that variation among zzso is essentially caused by an expansion or contraction of the number of repeats and that, zzso zzso in the target sequences follow the zzso zzso model zzso Generally speaking, zzso zzso sizes are used as direct indicators of the number of zzso repeats zzso an zzso with the data analysis either ignoring the extent of zzso size differences or assuming that there is a direct correlation between differences in zzso size and evolutionary zzso However, without precisely knowing the kind and distribution of zzso within an zzso zzso and the associated zzso region zzso zzso it is hard to say what kind of evolutionary message is conveyed by such a synthetic zzso of zzso as DNA zzso zzso In this study, we zzso several zzso zzso in multiple populations of three divergent tree zzso and zzso the types of zzso contained in each portion of the DNA zzso containing an zzso The patterns of diversity provided by zzso size variation, zzso variation itself, zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso observed in the zzso were zzso zzso size variation largely reflected zzso repeat zzso The amount of variation was as large in zzso as in the zzso zzso The former contributed significantly to the zzso information and sometimes was the main source of differentiation among individuals and populations contained by zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso The presence of zzso occurring at different rates within a zzso sequence offers the opportunity to zzso evolutionary events occurring on various zzso but at the same time calls for caution in the interpretation of zzso marker data when the distribution of zzso zzso is not zzso
