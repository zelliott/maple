The zzso slit locus encodes a protein with four regions containing tandem zzso of a zzso zzso repeat zzso with zzso zzso sequences zzso surrounding these zzso followed by two regions with zzso growth factor zzso zzso Each of these motifs has been implicated in zzso interactions as part of an zzso domain in a variety of other zzso Analysis of slit zzso clones reveals that as a consequence of alternative zzso the locus can code for two distinct protein species differing by 11 zzso acids at the zzso zzso of the last zzso zzso The existence of a putative signal sequence and the absence of a zzso domain suggest that slit is zzso an observation supported by an analysis of its expression in tissue zzso zzso the expression pattern of slit in the zzso by zzso zzso zzso trap zzso and in zzso zzso we demonstrate that the protein is expressed by a subset of zzso cells along the zzso of the developing central nervous zzso Through zzso zzso slit can be seen on the zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells although it is absent from the cell bodies of these zzso zzso that slit is exported by the zzso and distributed along the zzso Finally, we demonstrate that a reduction in slit expression results in a disruption of the developing zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso The embryonic zzso zzso zzso and zzso of slit to both zzso zzso zzso and adhesive zzso suggest that it may be involved in interactions between the zzso zzso cells, their zzso environment, and the zzso zzso that cross the zzso
