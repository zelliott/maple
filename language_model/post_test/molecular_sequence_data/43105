The zzso gene zzso of the zzso tomato pathogen zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso that zzso a hypersensitive response in tomato plants carrying the complementary resistance gene zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed when zzso zzso is growing in the plant and the zzso accumulates in infected leaves as a zzso acid zzso zzso In zzso zzso grown in zzso the zzso zzso is not produced in zzso zzso To produce significant amounts of the zzso zzso in zzso the coding and termination sequences of the zzso gene were fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were obtained that highly expressed the zzso gene in zzso and produced active zzso zzso zzso These peptides were partially zzso from the N zzso and appeared to consist of 32, 33, and 34 zzso respectively, and are the precursors of the mature zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that plant factors process the zzso zzso into the mature zzso zzso We present a model for the processing of zzso involving zzso of a signal zzso during zzso and further maturation by zzso and plant zzso into the stable zzso zzso zzso
