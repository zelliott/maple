The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates the degradation of several zzso including zzso and zzso involved in cell zzso and zzso zzso contains four WW zzso which are essential for recognition on the target zzso which contains a short zzso zzso Several signaling complexes containing these zzso have been associated with human diseases such as muscular dystrophy, Alzheimer's or zzso zzso To gain further insight into the structural zzso of the zzso domain, we investigated its interaction with zzso We zzso by zzso zzso zzso experiments, the backbone and side chains of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso interaction of zzso domain with zzso was studied using its interactive zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso corresponding to the region from zzso zzso of zzso encompassing the zzso motif that interacts with the zzso zzso and we identified the zzso involved in this molecular zzso Moreover, here, a strategy of stabilization of the zzso of the zzso zzso has been adopted, increasing the zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso leads to an increase of both the biological stability of the zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes of the zzso have been also zzso and localized zzso damage on zzso domain has been zzso demonstrating the possibility of use of zzso complexes as models for the design of metal drugs to inhibit the zzso recognition in zzso Thus, our data suggest a novel strategy to study and inhibit the recognition mechanism of zzso zzso
