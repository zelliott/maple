zzso the zzso regulatory protein of zzso had not been previously shown to specifically bind to the zzso to zzso region of zzso We show that the zzso to zzso sequence of zzso has a high affinity binding site for zzso and produced a single zzso complex zzso zzso Extension of this DNA zzso to include an zzso repeat sequence located between the zzso and zzso region resulted in the formation of a second, slower zzso complex zzso zzso A zzso to zzso zzso containing a substitution of the zzso zzso zzso was able to form complex zzso but not complex zzso A zzso zzso protein derived from a strain that can not repress zzso was unable to form complex zzso while complex b was formed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in incomplete repression of zzso These results suggest that zzso binds to the zzso to zzso region and that this sequence plays a role in the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso
