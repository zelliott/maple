We describe the investigation of zzso for the creation of very high affinity human zzso The high affinity human zzso zzso was zzso for its affinity to the human envelope zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso Five libraries of zzso were constructed by zzso zzso of zzso regions zzso Libraries of zzso zzso fragments were displayed on the surface of zzso zzso and selected in zzso for binding to immobilized zzso zzso and parallel zzso strategies of zzso were zzso The sequential zzso walking strategy consistently yielded zzso zzso of improved affinity in each of the four different zzso sequences zzso This resulted in a zzso improvement in zzso zzso effects in the zzso combining site were explored by combining independently zzso zzso in the parallel zzso zzso Six zzso containing zzso zzso were zzso Improvement of affinity based on zzso effects proved to be unpredictable but did lead to a modest improvement in zzso Indeed, only one of the six combinations demonstrated zzso The highest affinity zzso prepared using this strategy was improved zzso in zzso The affinity of this zzso was 15 zzso as compared to zzso zzso for zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso binding to zzso revealed that improvements in affinity were dominated by a slowing of the zzso of the zzso The methodology presented here provides a route for the improvement of the affinities of zzso typical of zzso immune responses into the zzso zzso Such improvements may have profound effects on the utility of zzso as therapeutic and zzso zzso
