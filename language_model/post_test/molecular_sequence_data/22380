Despite considerable differences in primary structure, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signal via a single zzso zzso but exhibit different zzso and zzso To examine zzso interactions in more detail, we performed zzso scanning zzso of 21 charged zzso within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Following transient expression in the zzso cell line, zzso zzso were assessed for their ability to be expressed at the cell surface, bind zzso and induce zzso responses to zzso zzso and zzso The majority of zzso were well expressed at the cell surface and bound zzso with low zzso zzso zzso to this rule included the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which were poorly expressed and responded zzso to all three zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso responded in zzso zzso to zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibiting reduced zzso responses to two or more of the three zzso zzso despite being expressed on the cell surface at levels similar to zzso zzso This suggests a major role for zzso in the recognition of all three zzso In zzso distinct zzso and basic zzso within zzso determine both zzso expression and zzso by the zzso zzso how these zzso interact with their zzso at the molecular level should increase our understanding of the process of zzso zzso zzso
