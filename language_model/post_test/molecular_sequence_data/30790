zzso causes dramatic long-term changes in the activity of the zzso Here we report the molecular cloning of a small zzso zzso zzso zzso species capable of inducing a slow zzso current in zzso zzso The 130 zzso acid protein zzso by this zzso species has a predicted structure that does not resemble that of previously described zzso channels from zzso zzso It is, however, similar to structural motifs found in certain zzso zzso zzso The induction of this zzso by zzso is zzso this zzso zzso species is not zzso in zzso from zzso rats, but is substantially induced after 3 zzso of zzso zzso These results support a critical role for regulation of zzso channel expression by zzso in the zzso
