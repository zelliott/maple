The role of the zzso domain zzso of the zzso virus zzso and F zzso in the process of virus assembly and budding are zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso are generated carrying modifications in the zzso of each of the zzso zzso The modifications include increasing zzso and/or zzso acid sequence zzso Following zzso zzso labeling of the infected cells, the virus particle production is zzso The radioactive zzso in the cell zzso are measured relative to the extent of the infection, assessed by the zzso N protein zzso For both the F and zzso zzso zzso zzso the largest zzso deletions lead to a zzso to zzso reduction in zzso zzso This reduction cannot be explained by a reduction of the cell surface expression of the zzso For the F protein zzso the zzso produced in reduced amount always exhibit a normal F protein zzso It is then concluded that a threshold level of F is required for zzso assembly and zzso The rate or the efficiency with which this threshold is reached up appears to depend on the nature of the F zzso A minimal zzso length is required as well as a specific zzso The analysis of zzso protein zzso brings to light an apparent zzso The larger zzso zzso result in significant reduction of zzso zzso On the other hand, a normal zzso production can take place with an zzso of or, even, an zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso in zzso is confirmed to depend on the previously proposed zzso zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 72, zzso
