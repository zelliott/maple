Two regulatory zzso zzso and zzso have been reported to control expression of the zzso zzso capsule zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on the zzso zzso zzso while zzso carries zzso and the cap zzso zzso has been viewed as the major regulator of the cap zzso because it is essential for capsule gene expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for toxin gene zzso but has also been implicated in control of the cap zzso The molecular functions of the regulatory proteins are zzso We examined cap gene expression in a genetically complete zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that another zzso zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso has a role in cap zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso similar to that of zzso and 50% similar to that of zzso Assessment of cap gene zzso revealed that cap expression was not affected in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and was slightly reduced in an zzso zzso zzso However, cap gene expression was abolished in an zzso zzso double zzso zzso examination of capsule synthesis by the zzso zzso these zzso zzso and zzso expression is controlled by zzso capsule synthesis and zzso of zzso and zzso were markedly reduced in an zzso zzso The data suggest that, in a strain containing both zzso zzso zzso is the major regulator of capsule synthesis and controls zzso expression zzso via positive regulation of zzso and zzso
