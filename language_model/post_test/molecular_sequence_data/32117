We previously reported that colon zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso were very likely to possess zzso zzso whereas when these same advanced zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso they were wild type for zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso were found mainly in a zzso zzso On this basis, we predicted that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso found in the zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso would also harbor zzso zzso and that zzso zzso would zzso In contrast, zzso zzso would be found more often in the zzso zzso We examined 55 zzso collected during screening zzso from a total of 28 zzso Following laser capture zzso DNA was isolated, and zzso in zzso and zzso were determined by direct zzso zzso When zzso zzso were further classified into zzso and zzso zzso there was a strong inverse relationship between zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso was identified in 10 of 16 zzso compared with 1 of 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conversely, zzso zzso were present in 3 of 16 zzso compared with 14 of 33 zzso zzso Our finding of a strong association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso supports the idea that these zzso are an early, zzso or a potentially initiating step on the zzso zzso to zzso zzso
