We have isolated two novel zzso zzso the transforming growth zzso zzso type II zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso beta 1 from a human fetal liver zzso They have unique zzso zzso zzso compared with the reported zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis using zzso from each clone detected the specific zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis revealed a distinct pattern of expression for each zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso has zzso in the structure, and the expression of zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso molecules could be derived from alternative zzso and might elicit specific zzso zzso zzso
