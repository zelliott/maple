The zzso for zzso a major cold shock protein in zzso coli, contains an unusually long zzso zzso zzso untranslated region zzso and its stability has been shown to play a major role in cold shock induction of zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso has a negative effect on its expression at 37 degrees C but has a positive effect upon cold zzso In this report, a series of zzso zzso having a zzso to zzso deletion in the zzso were constructed to examine the roles of specific regions within the zzso in zzso zzso It was found that none of the deletion zzso had significant effects on the stability of zzso at both 37 and 15 degrees zzso However, two zzso zzso and zzso caused a substantial increase of zzso activity at 37 degrees C, indicating that the deleted regions contain a negative zzso zzso for zzso A zzso zzso deleting the highly zzso cold box sequence had little effect on cold shock induction of zzso Interestingly, three zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused poor cold shock induction of zzso In particular, the zzso zzso reduced the translation efficiency of the zzso zzso to less than zzso of that of the zzso zzso The deleted region contains a zzso sequence named upstream box zzso 123 to zzso which is highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and is located 11 bases upstream of the zzso zzso zzso The upstream box might be another zzso element involved in translation efficiency of the zzso zzso in addition to the zzso sequence and the downstream box zzso The relationship between the zzso secondary structure and translation efficiency is zzso
