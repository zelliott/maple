zzso projections to the zzso zzso zzso involve fibers in the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso populations on cells receiving this information are composed of both D1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, unilateral zzso of the zzso with zzso acid, caused a significant reduction in zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side, as evidenced by in zzso zzso Similarly, a reduction of zzso zzso binding (as demonstrated with zzso was observed on the zzso zzso As expected, there was no significant change in the zzso zzso binding on the zzso zzso However, a significant increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso on the zzso side when compared to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso changes may be occurring on the zzso side of the zzso These changes may reflect elevated zzso from DNA to zzso or decreased translation of the zzso zzso to protein following unilateral damage in the zzso The observation of bilateral influence in the zzso zzso zzso system may be of paramount importance in understanding movement zzso These findings could influence the interpretation of results obtained in animal models of human disease in which the zzso zzso system of the zzso zzso is zzso
