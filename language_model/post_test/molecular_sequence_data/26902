The impact of continuous zzso zzso on community structure, composition and abundance of zzso resistance genes in the rat zzso community was zzso zzso were fed a standard diet containing zzso at 15 zzso zzso diet for 28 days, followed by 30 zzso zzso diet to completion of the study on zzso These levels are similar to those administered to zzso during the zzso zzso zzso zzso affected the zzso community as determined through change in the zzso zzso community and through zzso analyses including zzso zzso gel zzso profiles of the variable 2-3 region community zzso zzso genes over time and through comparative sequence analysis of zzso zzso gene community zzso zzso decreases in zzso zzso diversity occurred in response to zzso zzso although total bacterial output remained constant over the entire feeding zzso zzso at 15 zzso zzso diet resulted in significant change in community zzso but only modest change to the zzso community structure in terms of the distribution of individual zzso among the major zzso zzso zzso at 30 zzso zzso diet significantly altered the distribution of zzso among the major zzso lineages shifting the overall community such that zzso zzso aligning within the zzso zzso became the dominant lineage zzso of total zzso While zzso impacted both zzso community structure and zzso there was no significant effect on the abundance of community zzso resistance genes zzso zzso zzso or on the emergence of a new putative zzso resistance gene identified within the zzso zzso While zzso zzso provides sufficient selective pressure to significantly alter the zzso community, the primary outcome appears to be the development of a community which may have a higher inherent tolerance to zzso levels of zzso rather than an overgrowth of the zzso resistant bacteria already present within the zzso
