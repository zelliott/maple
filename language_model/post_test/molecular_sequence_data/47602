The large zzso protein of zzso virus complexes with the zzso zzso to form the active zzso zzso zzso The L protein is believed to be responsible for all of the zzso activities of the zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso alignment of the L proteins of zzso zzso viruses has revealed six zzso zzso zzso thought to be responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out in a highly charged, zzso region zzso acids zzso within domain II to test the hypothesis of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 75, zzso zzso that this region may contribute to the template binding domain of the viral zzso zzso The zzso proteins were tested for expression and stability, the ability to zzso viral zzso in zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso Five of the seven zzso were completely defective in all viral zzso zzso whereas two zzso showed significant levels of both zzso and leader zzso zzso One of the zzso active zzso also gave zzso replication in zzso although not in zzso The other zzso was defective in all the replication zzso and thus the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Because the completely inactive L zzso can bind to the P protein to form the zzso complex and the zzso bind to the viral zzso template, these zzso acids are essential for the activity of the L zzso
