It is demonstrated, by zzso analysis, that zzso zzso early genes zzso and zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso sequence zzso The zzso gene product is shown to be a member of a recently characterized zzso of zzso DNA and zzso zzso The zzso gene product is related at a statistically significant level, to the gene 46 product of zzso T4 which is a component of an zzso involved in zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso A lower but also significant degree of sequence similarity was detected between the gene zzso product of zzso and the gene 47 product of zzso the second component of the same zzso It is hypothesized that both zzso and zzso gene products of zzso might be zzso possibly zzso zzso zzso steps during zzso DNA zzso zzso and/or zzso
