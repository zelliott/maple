We have performed zzso molecular dynamics simulations of zzso solutions of zzso at 300 K in its native state, as well as at high temperatures to explore the unfolding dynamics of the protein and its correlation with the motion of water around zzso On increasing the temperature a partially unfolded molten zzso state is formed where the smallest alpha zzso zzso 2) unfolds into a zzso It is observed that the unfolding is initiated around the zzso zzso which shows a sharp displacement during zzso We have noticed that the unfolding of the protein affects the density of water near the protein zzso Besides, the dynamics of water in the protein zzso layer has been found to be strongly correlated with the time evolution of the unfolding zzso We have introduced and calculated a displacement time correlation function to monitor the change in water motion relative to the protein backbone during zzso We find that the unfolding of zzso 2 is associated with an increase in mobility of water around it as compared to water around the other two zzso We have also explored the microscopic aspects of secondary structure specific and site specific zzso dynamics of the zzso The calculations reveal that unfolding influences the zzso dynamics of the protein zzso in a zzso manner depending on the location of the polar probe zzso This seems to be in agreement with recent experimental zzso
