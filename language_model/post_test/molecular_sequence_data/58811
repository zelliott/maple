By indirect zzso and zzso zzso gold technique, the zzso of alpha zzso zzso and zzso II zzso zzso were zzso With zzso zzso directed against the second zzso zzso of all three zzso these receptors were found to be localized at the zzso of adult rat zzso and at the surface zzso of cultivated zzso heart zzso Additionally, zzso receptors were localized along zzso zzso of both rat and human adult zzso alpha zzso receptors were found zzso near the surface of zzso zzso zzso By using zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso the strongest zzso was found in the right atrium of the zzso Besides the zzso in zzso zzso receptors were also localized in outer plasma zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and the surface of smooth muscle cells of the major arteries and zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso receptors were found along the outer zzso of zzso cells from zzso and zzso
