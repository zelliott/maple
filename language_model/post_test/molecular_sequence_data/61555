The human nuclear zzso protein zzso influences the expression of the fragile X mental zzso zzso gene by specifically interacting with the zzso repeat in its zzso untranslated zzso Here, we show that zzso binds to zzso repeats with zzso and to interrupted zzso The zzso and zzso organization of the human and zzso zzso genes was studied and the human gene was mapped to zzso zzso Due to alternative zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are transcribed at varying ratios in human and zzso cells and in zzso zzso and adult zzso The human and the zzso zzso including promoters and large parts of the untranslated regions, are highly zzso A sequence of 235 zzso zzso upstream of zzso is essential for promoter activity in zzso zzso Complete in zzso zzso zzso the promoter, which is zzso in human cells as shown by zzso zzso zzso
