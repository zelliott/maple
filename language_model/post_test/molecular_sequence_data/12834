The zzso zzso involved in the genetic disorder zzso zzso has been identified zzso This gene is suspected to zzso to zzso and is located in a zzso region that we have recently found deleted in 50 to zzso of breast and lung zzso Because of its location and its function, the zzso gene is a strong candidate tumor zzso or modifier gene of zzso region zzso In this study, we define its zzso zzso The aim was to establish the basis for the development of zzso scanning methods based on DNA instead of zzso We found that the gene spans a region of approximately zzso zzso and is composed of 37 zzso ranging in size from 64 to 324 zzso zzso sequences of all zzso boundaries were zzso With this information, it will be possible to develop simple genetic tests for the identification of zzso and zzso as well as determine whether the gene is involved in the zzso of breast and other zzso
