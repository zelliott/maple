Numerous disparate studies in plants, zzso zzso zzso zzso and bacteria have identified one of the most highly zzso proteins zzso zzso for which no function was previously zzso Members have been implicated in the stress response of plants and zzso and resistance to zzso oxygen toxicity in the plant pathogen zzso However, it is found in some zzso bacteria and is absent in some zzso zzso We have cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso of this highly zzso gene and define this gene family as zzso an zzso specifically required for zzso zzso This realization has enabled us to define a second zzso for zzso zzso Some bacteria zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso defined in zzso coli and others zzso the zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso exclusively use the zzso zzso We also found that zzso is destroyed in the presence of zzso zzso helping to explain the connection to zzso oxygen sensitivity defined in zzso These data bring clarity to the previously confusing data on this gene zzso However, a new conundrum now zzso why have highly related bacteria evolved with different pathways for zzso zzso
