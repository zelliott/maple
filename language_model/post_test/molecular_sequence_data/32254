zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to the large zzso loop of the zzso zzso zzso regulates its zzso transport across the plasma zzso We determined the solution structures of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that, together with an zzso domain zzso form the regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute a novel zzso motif and are very similar in the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso the upper half of zzso unfolds while zzso maintains its structural zzso Together with a zzso higher affinity for zzso this suggests that zzso is the primary zzso zzso zzso point zzso in either domain largely allow the interchange of their functionality and uncover the mechanism underlying zzso sensing in zzso
