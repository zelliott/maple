B zzso use zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Although zzso can rescue single point zzso deliberately introduced into zzso zzso such experiments do not show whether zzso can efficiently evolve challenging novel zzso requiring multiple zzso zzso in zzso zzso We have now zzso zzso over 23 rounds of zzso cell sorting to create zzso red fluorescent proteins with increased zzso and zzso emissions zzso zzso zzso zzso the best efforts of zzso zzso zzso offers a strategy to evolve zzso proteins with desirable properties for which a zzso selection or viable zzso screen can be zzso
