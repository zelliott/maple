The alpha zzso of zzso protein Golf zzso alpha zzso identified in the zzso zzso in which it is supposed to mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso is much more expressed in the zzso than G alpha zzso the classical zzso G protein alpha zzso zzso et zzso J zzso 13 zzso zzso Four species of G alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed by Northern zzso in the rat zzso Analysis of zzso G alpha zzso zzso clones demonstrated that despite extensive variations in their zzso and 3' untranslated regions, these four G alpha zzso zzso zzso the same G alpha zzso zzso One of the four zzso species, which was selectively observed in the zzso is generated by a novel promoter whose activity was barely zzso in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, this promoter generates an unexpectedly high proportion of transcripts in which the first zzso is zzso The retention of zzso was found to abolish the translation of G alpha zzso zzso in the zzso zzso system, suggesting that it could be involved in the down regulation of G alpha zzso expression in the zzso Furthermore, a new zzso site with a non zzso zzso zzso was found to be responsible of the two shortest forms of G alpha zzso zzso In conclusion, we have shown that the G alpha zzso proteins present in the zzso and the zzso zzso are identical and that multiple variations in the untranslated parts of the zzso could affect G alpha zzso zzso
