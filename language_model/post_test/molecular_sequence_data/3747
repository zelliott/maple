To identify novel genes involved in DNA zzso break zzso repair, we previously isolated zzso zzso zzso which are hypersensitive to zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso with zzso This study characterizes one of these zzso zzso The gene that zzso the zzso sensitivity of this zzso was cloned and designated zzso zzso encodes a protein with zzso zzso acids which has the zzso zzso motif found in zzso family zzso zzso is hypersensitive to zzso and gamma rays, zzso to zzso and defective in the repair of zzso caused by zzso The zzso zzso is also temperature sensitive for zzso At the restrictive temperature zzso degrees zzso zzso cells grow for several divisions and then arrest with zzso DNA zzso the arrested cells accumulate zzso and have a diffuse and often zzso shaped nuclear zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a synthetic lethal with zzso and expression of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso partially suppresses the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein of the structural maintenance of zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Murray, zzso zzso Watts, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Carr, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso is required to repair zzso which accumulate during zzso by zzso between sister zzso zzso may perform this function in concert with the zzso protein zzso
