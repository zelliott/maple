Two possible forms of zzso encephalitis virus zzso gene zzso (called zzso and zzso were constructed using two overlapping zzso of zzso zzso and synthetic DNA zzso This genes were expressed in zzso coli cells in expression zzso zzso as individual proteins or fusion with bacterial zzso The proteins zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso zzso 162 zzso and zzso zzso 155 zzso were effectively zzso under the zzso induction zzso zzso of zzso gene results in the formation of two zzso proteins zzso 46 and 44 zzso All bacterial zzso of zzso protein fixed zzso and zzso zzso specific to viral zzso
