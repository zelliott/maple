The three zzso molecular structure of the zzso formed between the zzso drug zzso and a DNA zzso zzso has been determined by zzso zzso analysis at zzso A resolution and refined to a final zzso of zzso This structure, solved by using data from a previously reported crystal form in the space group zzso resembles that found in the space group zzso zzso et zzso Science, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In both structures, four zzso independent zzso molecules zzso into a zzso cluster that is stabilized by a large number of zzso hydrogen bonds and zzso stacking zzso In each zzso the platinum atom is coordinated to the zzso atoms of two zzso bases arranged in a head-to-head orientation, resulting in a large zzso angle between the zzso zzso zzso base pairings between different zzso zzso molecules are used extensively in the crystal zzso
