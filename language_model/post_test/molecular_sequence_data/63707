Transfer zzso zzso are ancient molecules that are central to zzso Since they probably carry evolutionary signatures that were left behind when the living world zzso we reconstructed zzso directly from the sequence and structure of zzso using well-established zzso zzso The trees placed zzso with long variable arms charging zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistently at the base of the rooted zzso but failed to reveal groupings that would indicate clear evolutionary links to zzso origin or molecular zzso In order to uncover evolutionary patterns in the trees, we forced zzso into zzso groups using constraint analyses to generate zzso of zzso diversification and test competing evolutionary zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso was the most ancestral zzso followed by zzso then zzso zzso and zzso in that order, supporting conclusions from recent zzso studies of protein zzso zzso constraint analyses showed that the origin of viruses was not only zzso but was linked to zzso Our findings have important zzso They support the notion that the zzso lineage was very zzso resulted in the first zzso zzso and predated diversification of zzso function and zzso zzso are also consistent with the concept that viruses contributed to the development of the DNA replication machinery during the early diversification of the living zzso
