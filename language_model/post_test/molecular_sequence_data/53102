zzso hormone zzso also known as zzso zzso substance zzso is one of the earliest and best-known markers of zzso cell differentiation and is expressed until around zzso The present study is aimed at the better understanding of the molecular pathways involved in zzso development and establishment of adult functions with regards to zzso zzso We found, within the mouse zzso promoter, putative zzso motifs zzso known to be specifically bound by members of the zzso zzso factor zzso We then carried out zzso protection zzso and zzso techniques aimed at comparing precisely the zzso expression patterns of zzso and zzso this latter being expressed in the zzso after zzso Using both approaches we found an inverse and close relationship between zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression during the zzso zzso These results allowed us to define a zzso zzso period, starting from 3 zzso when both proteins are zzso expressed in zzso cells and showed that the appearance of zzso is associated with the decrease of zzso expression in these zzso zzso zzso interaction in in zzso studies showed first that zzso binds with various affinities on sites found in the zzso promoter and second that the proximity of the two strongest affinity sites leads to a synergistic binding zzso Altogether, the present study suggests that zzso zzso in zzso gene repression during the zzso zzso
