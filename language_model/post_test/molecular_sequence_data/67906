With widespread applications in zzso zzso and zzso much investigation has been made in the structure of the zzso and mechanism of their interactions with protein zzso However, in view of zzso based zzso force zzso zzso studies of zzso systems, only zzso approaches have been zzso In this article, we present an improved zzso approach for surface zzso of zzso DNA zzso for investigation of zzso interaction from an integral zzso zzso zzso The melting force of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso has been successfully zzso It has been found that dynamic equilibrium exists between unfolding and folding structures of the zzso zzso even in pure zzso We also investigated the interactions between the zzso zzso and its target protein zzso under the same solution zzso The zzso zzso force in the absence of zzso zzso zzso is about 50% smaller than that in the presence of zzso zzso zzso The great reduction in force in the absence of zzso suggests that the stability of zzso secondary structure is important for a stable zzso zzso The methodology developed and demonstrated in this work is zzso for studying the stability of secondary structures of other zzso zzso zzso and their interactions with target zzso
