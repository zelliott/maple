An zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which shares the zzso zzso binding motif with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed by using zzso coli zzso The zzso protein was a zzso and contained zzso zzso It was shown to be an zzso with CBS activity as well as zzso activity in zzso The zzso retained zzso of its activity after a zzso incubation at 100 degrees zzso In the zzso zzso reaction, it had a pH optimum of zzso apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso of 28 and below zzso zzso respectively, and a rate constant of 202 zzso In the zzso synthetic reaction, it showed a broad pH optimum in the range of zzso to zzso apparent zzso values for zzso and zzso of 8 and zzso zzso respectively, and a rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a high activity in the zzso zzso reaction, which produces zzso and zzso from zzso and zzso
