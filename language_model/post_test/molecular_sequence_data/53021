A zzso zzso region zzso and zzso zzso located upstream and downstream of the mouse zzso zzso respectively, are known to be essential for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso To explain the same zzso patterns in zzso zzso additional enhancers have been zzso We determined and compared the sequences of human and mouse zzso over 40 zzso and identified 10 zzso zzso downstream zzso 2 of which were zzso with the known zzso zzso zzso in transgenic mice showed that 5 of the other 8 segments functioned as enhancers in specific zzso and/or zzso zzso We also identified a zzso zzso element that appeared repeatedly within the zzso and formed complexes with specific nuclear zzso zzso of one of the factors was inhibited when the target sequence contained zzso zzso These complexes may contribute to the presumed boundary function of the zzso zzso which is proposed to insulate maternal zzso from the zzso Our results demonstrate that comparative zzso sequencing is highly efficient in identifying regulatory zzso
