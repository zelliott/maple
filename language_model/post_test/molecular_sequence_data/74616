zzso proteins are necessary for pathogens to obtain iron from zzso zzso zzso can grow using zzso as source of iron, but the underlying mechanism has not previously been zzso In this work, we identified a 45 zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso which we named zzso In zzso analysis showed that zzso contains the zzso zzso needed for zzso while overlay zzso demonstrated that zzso is able to bind zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso levels were zzso under iron zzso conditions and were subsequently restored to zzso levels when zzso was added to the cell zzso These findings provide the first insights on the role of zzso in iron acquisition from zzso
