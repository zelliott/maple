Most human zzso zzso genes are highly zzso in sequence among zzso but some exhibit a substantial degree of zzso Two of these genes are zzso which encodes a zzso zzso and zzso which is predicted to zzso a membrane zzso The sequences of these genes were determined from a collection of 184 zzso samples obtained from Africa, Australia, Asia, Europe, and North zzso zzso is zzso zzso whereas variation in zzso is concentrated in a sequence zzso a potentially highly zzso zzso The zzso sequences fell into 14 zzso as did all previously reported zzso The zzso sequences grouped into 8 zzso and all previously reported sequences fell into a subset of zzso There were minor differences among zzso in zzso zzso for zzso and zzso but no clear geographical zzso and identical zzso sequences were represented among communities distant from each zzso The frequent detection of multiple zzso indicated that mixed infections are zzso For both zzso the degree of divergence was sufficient to zzso reliable sequence alignments between zzso in the most variable regions, and the mode of evolution involved in generating the zzso could not be zzso Within zzso constraint appears to have been the zzso mode, and positive selection was detected marginally at zzso No evidence was found for linkage zzso The emerging scenario is that the zzso zzso developed in early human populations (or even zzso becoming established via founder or bottleneck effects, and have spread, zzso and mixed worldwide in more recent zzso
