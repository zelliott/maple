We identified and characterized a human zzso of zzso zzso which in budding zzso interacts in zzso with the major duplex zzso DNA binding protein zzso and zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference in human cancer cells impaired cell growth but had no zzso effect on zzso zzso although zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso length control, in a manner specifically dependent on the presence of zzso zzso No zzso of zzso on normal human zzso or interaction with the human zzso proteins zzso zzso or zzso was zzso However, zzso efficiently zzso to zzso located DNA damage zzso in response to the synthesis of zzso zzso directed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso level rose during late zzso but zzso was not visible on zzso in zzso and zzso however, notably, specifically during early zzso zzso aligned along a subset of the zzso zzso between the separating zzso In zzso zzso localized to zzso and in zzso it was zzso These results define a novel zzso zzso behavior for zzso during the cell zzso
