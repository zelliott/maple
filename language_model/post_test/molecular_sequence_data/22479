zzso cultures capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso were enriched from three different zzso one zzso one marine and one zzso Two different electron donors were used in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso iron or a mixture of fatty zzso The removal of doubly flanked zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso and zzso was observed in all zzso zzso community analysis of zzso zzso zzso gene fragments revealed different communities in these cultures, with the exception of one common population that showed a high zzso zzso to zzso zzso No zzso populations were ever detected in control cultures to which no zzso were zzso In addition, the dynamics of this zzso population were strongly correlated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso culture demonstrated that the zzso population disappeared when zzso was inhibited with zzso or when zzso had been zzso These results provide evidence that zzso populations were involved in the removal of doubly flanked zzso from zzso Furthermore, the successful enrichment of these populations from geographically distant and zzso distinct environments indicates the widespread presence of these zzso zzso zzso
