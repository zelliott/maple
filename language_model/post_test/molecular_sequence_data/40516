The zzso zzso includes a large number of species, some of which are serious human zzso A zzso locus is zzso that consists of a gene zzso a member of the multiple zzso resistance regulator zzso family of zzso regulators and a zzso oriented gene zzso a major zzso transport protein zzso a predicted membrane zzso zzso zzso modeling shows that the zzso zzso zzso the location of four zzso zzso acid zzso previously shown to bind the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso shows that its specific DNA binding to two adjacent sites in the zzso region between the genes zzso the zzso factor and the zzso is attenuated by zzso and to a lesser extent by zzso and zzso but not by zzso or the product of zzso degradation, zzso These data suggest the existence of a four zzso acid zzso signature in a subset of zzso zzso and that zzso bearing this signature will respond to the zzso zzso by attenuated DNA zzso The location of binding sites predicts regulation of the zzso and zzso a proposal to name the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso transport zzso
