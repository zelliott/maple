The resonance assignments, secondary structure and backbone dynamics of the zzso domain of the zzso factor zzso have been determined for the free protein in solution by zzso zzso The secondary structure for the free zzso domain is similar to that observed in the crystal structure of the zzso protein zzso with DNA, except that zzso zzso and recognition zzso zzso are shorter for the free protein in zzso zzso dynamics of the protein have been examined using zzso zzso exchange and zzso zzso spin relaxation zzso A significant probability of local unfolding of zzso zzso which precedes the zzso DNA recognition domain, is zzso from the very fast zzso exchange for zzso zzso in this zzso The zzso relaxation zzso indicate that the protein is partially zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso but zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso The zzso relaxation data for the low concentration sample were zzso using the zzso zzso to provide insight into protein dynamics on zzso and zzso time zzso High flexibility of the protein backbone is observed for the zzso in the loop between zzso and zzso This loop is variable in length and in structure within the class of winged zzso proteins and is partially responsible for binding to zzso The dynamic properties observed for zzso zzso and the intervening loop may indicate a correlation between protein plasticity in particular structural elements and recognition of specific DNA zzso
