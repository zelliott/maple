The existence of similar folds among major structural zzso of viral zzso has shown unexpected evolutionary relationships suggesting common origins irrespective of the zzso host life zzso zzso zzso are emerging as one such family, and we have studied the possible existence of the zzso fold in zzso zzso The zzso structure at approximately 10 A resolution was used to obtain a zzso model by fitting a zzso model of the zzso zzso protein zzso that was based on the atomic structure of the zzso zzso zzso A number of fold similarities, such as the fitting of zzso A and P into the L-shaped zzso zzso are evident between both viral zzso A different feature is related to the presence of the zzso domain of zzso found at the inner surface of the zzso that might play an important role in the interaction of zzso and scaffolding zzso
