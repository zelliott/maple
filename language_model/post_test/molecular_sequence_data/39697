We examined the distribution of synonymous and zzso changes in 12 zzso genes of natural populations of zzso to zzso changes in gene zzso By comparing zzso zzso within and across species using the zzso test, we found data sets to contain evidence for zzso selection zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and positive selection zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Other genes from the same set of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not zzso evidence for either form of zzso The results of branch models of zzso evolution agreed fully with the results of the zzso test in terms of significance and absolute value of the zzso zzso The high frequency of zzso zzso patterns and their association with branches that separate closely related zzso zzso suggest that evolutionary tests are suited to uncover zzso selective differentiation in zzso zzso At the same time, given the lack of information about the history of zzso analysis of larger numbers of zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso will produce more detailed pictures of the effects of natural zzso
