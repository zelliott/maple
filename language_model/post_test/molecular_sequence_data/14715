The zzso factor zzso triggers zzso pathways and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso How zzso response elements determine and regulate zzso specificity remains an zzso zzso In this work, we have determined the first crystal structures of zzso zzso domain zzso bound to response elements with zzso of different zzso The structure and function of the adaptable zzso are determined by the distance between two zzso The structures with zero and one zzso zzso show compact zzso zzso domain zzso with large zzso zzso a two zzso zzso results in DNA unwinding and a smaller zzso zzso whereas a four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is more sensitive to zzso length than zzso with one zzso zzso reducing zzso of zzso activity and longer zzso reducing zzso to zzso zzso Our results establish the zzso structure of the zzso zzso domain required as a scaffold to promote zzso
