Trout zzso from most of the survivors of viral zzso zzso virus zzso infections were capable of in zzso proliferation zzso zzso when cultured in the presence of short synthetic peptides designed from the G and the N zzso protein sequences of zzso a virus with substantial economic impact in trout zzso In contrast, no significant zzso responses were obtained for the zzso peptides from zzso obtained from either zzso or genetically zzso zzso However, since the zzso recognition of particular peptides zzso of the G and the N protein by trout zzso varies largely within the zzso trout population, larger zzso protein fragments were also zzso The finding that zzso G and N fragments carrying multiple zzso are recognized by the majority of the individual trout surviving zzso infections and with higher stimulation indexes suggests that the zzso viral proteins could be used as vaccines given the zzso nature of the zzso
