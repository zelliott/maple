The tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso was subjected to zzso zzso within the zzso three zzso using an zzso zzso chain reaction zzso All the zzso and a number of other zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were individually modified and the zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to be correctly folded by measuring the effect of zzso zzso on intrinsic zzso zzso analyses of zzso using a zzso fluorescent zzso zzso and the zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso and zzso caused an increase in the apparent zzso constant, largely due to an increase in the rate of zzso of zzso The data indicate that the anchored sequence between zzso 3 and zzso 13 is a key region for interaction of zzso with zzso
