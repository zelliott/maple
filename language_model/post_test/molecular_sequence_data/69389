zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso release of zzso zzso from slices of rat zzso incubated in zzso have been characterized by comparison of the zzso values of the competitive antagonists, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were significant differences among zzso in their sensitivities to each zzso The delta zzso selective zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso release, indicating that delta and zzso 1 receptors are not zzso zzso zzso and zzso generally behaved as zzso zzso although zzso and zzso were less sensitive to antagonism by zzso than by zzso zzso and zzso showed similar sensitivities to all antagonists, suggesting that they acted through similar zzso possibly of the zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso differed from zzso and from each other in their sensitivities to most zzso Shifts in zzso zzso zzso induced by prior treatment of the rats with the zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso also suggested that zzso and zzso acted through mechanisms differing from those used by zzso zzso and zzso It is possible that zzso and zzso acted via zzso 2 and/or zzso zzso These results suggest that there is zzso in the zzso receptors regulating zzso release in rat zzso
