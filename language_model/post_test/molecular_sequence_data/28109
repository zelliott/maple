The zzso sequence of zzso zzso gene 10 and surrounding regulatory elements has been determined and compared to the analogous region of zzso zzso zzso genes 9, 10 and 11 have been shown to complement zzso zzso The DNA sequences of zzso and zzso gene zzso are zzso as are the zzso acid sequences of the respective zzso The zzso shift to the zzso frame is predicted to occur at the same position in gene 10 of zzso and zzso though different zzso sequences are probably zzso The resulting zzso products have completely different C zzso
