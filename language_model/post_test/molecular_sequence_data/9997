zzso is a zzso protein that loses zzso binding activity and zzso into paired zzso filaments zzso in Alzheimer's zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso modifications detected in zzso but not in normal zzso zzso has reduced ability to bind to zzso To determine whether zzso of zzso occurs in its zzso binding zzso we have characterized in zzso zzso sites of the longest zzso of zzso which has four zzso binding zzso zzso The identified zzso sites are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have also studied zzso of another zzso of zzso which has only three zzso binding zzso zzso This zzso is modified by zzso zzso more slowly than zzso However, the zzso sites appear to be the same in both zzso except for zzso and zzso these are located in the second zzso binding domain, which is missing in zzso zzso zzso and 174 are located within or zzso to the sequence of zzso that is involved in the zzso nucleation activity, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located in the zzso binding zzso zzso at these sites can affect the functional properties of zzso and advanced zzso at these sites might lead to the formation of zzso zzso similar to the ones seen in Alzheimer's zzso
