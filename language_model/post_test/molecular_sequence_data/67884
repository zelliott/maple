A zzso form of the prion protein zzso is the primary culprit in zzso prion zzso It has been shown that zzso acids catalyze the zzso of cellular zzso into a zzso zzso It has also been observed that the interaction of zzso with zzso acids is zzso and that the complex can be toxic to cultured zzso No direct correlation has yet been drawn between changes in zzso structure and toxicity due to zzso acid zzso Here we asked whether different zzso stability, and toxicity effects are detected when zzso DNA sequences interact with zzso zzso Using zzso techniques to analyze zzso zzso and secondary structure and cellular zzso to assess zzso we found that zzso interactions lead to different zzso species, depending on the sequence and size of the zzso zzso A zzso DNA sequence zzso induced higher levels of zzso and also dissimilar structural changes in zzso compared to binding to zzso with the same length and different zzso sequences or different zzso zzso The zzso complex induced significant cell dysfunction, which appears to be correlated with the zzso properties of the zzso Although sequence specificity is not apparent for zzso acid zzso we believe that particular zzso acid patterns, possibly related to zzso content, zzso zzso and structure, govern zzso zzso zzso the structural and cellular effects observed for zzso acid complexes may shed light on the still mysterious pathology of the prion zzso
