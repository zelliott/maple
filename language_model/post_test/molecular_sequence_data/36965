The major zzso zzso on the external zzso of zzso was studied with an zzso zzso zzso and with a human serum positive for zzso to zzso zzso both of which were able to neutralize virus zzso The zzso zzso reacted specifically with zzso from zzso and was shown to neutralize infection of zzso cells by zzso zzso and inhibited the formation of zzso normally observed when zzso cells are zzso with zzso zzso Similar zzso of viral infection and zzso of zzso formation was also demonstrated by the zzso human zzso By examining a number of overlapping peptides from a region of zzso zzso known to contain a zzso zzso this zzso was localized between zzso acids 307 and 320 zzso zzso in the external zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not interfere with the binding of zzso to zzso or with the subsequent step of zzso shedding of zzso from the viral zzso However, it blocked the zzso zzso of the zzso loop by zzso suggesting that the zzso may be zzso the interaction of the loop with other zzso zzso
