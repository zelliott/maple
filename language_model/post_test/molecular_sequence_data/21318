Cellular zzso zzso perform essential functions during zzso zzso The closely related human proteins zzso and zzso are members of this protein family and play an essential role for cellular zzso export by recruiting the zzso protein zzso to spliced and zzso zzso In order to gain insight into their mode of action, we aimed to characterize these zzso in more zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso exhibit an intrinsic zzso zzso shuttling zzso zzso mapping studies identified distinct regions within zzso or zzso required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the region zzso zzso shuttling activity was mapped to the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso acids zzso Interestingly, this region zzso with a domain within zzso of zzso zzso that has been reported to be required for both zzso and zzso zzso However, in contrast to this finding we report that human zzso zzso independently from zzso In zzso our results reveal zzso shuttling as a zzso feature of zzso and human zzso while their export zzso seems to have zzso during zzso
