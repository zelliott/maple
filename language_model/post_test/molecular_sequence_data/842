zzso is a key regulator of skeletal muscle stem cells and is required along with zzso to generate skeletal muscle zzso We have identified a collection of genes induced by either zzso or zzso in zzso muscle zzso Two notable zzso targets are the zzso zzso zzso proteins inhibitor of DNA binding zzso 2 and zzso both of which are zzso expressed with zzso in zzso satellite cells and are induced in zzso zzso zzso cells after zzso expression of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso activates expression of a zzso reporter driven by the zzso promoter, and zzso induction of this reporter requires a zzso zzso binding site located upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is bound upstream of the zzso promoter in zzso satellite zzso In addition, short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso expression in cultured satellite cells zzso decreased both zzso and zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso is a direct zzso target for zzso in zzso satellite cells, and they suggest that zzso acts to block premature differentiation of zzso satellite cells by inducing the expression of zzso and zzso which in turn may act to block either the precocious induction of zzso basic zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso or zzso
