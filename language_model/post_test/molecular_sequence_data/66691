We have recently reported that zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a rich arsenal of zzso zzso possesses four old yellow zzso zzso zzso Here, we report a series of high resolution crystal structures for one of these zzso zzso yellow zzso 1 zzso in its oxidized form at zzso resolution, which binds a zzso of zzso 400 in the active site, and in its zzso and zzso and zzso forms at zzso zzso Although the overall structure of zzso reveals a zzso zzso based on the zzso barrel scaffold observed for other zzso the active site exhibits a unique combination of features: a strongly zzso zzso zzso both in the oxidized and zzso forms, a collapsed and narrow active site tunnel, and a novel combination of zzso zzso involved in the binding of zzso zzso Furthermore, we identify a second zzso site in a zzso zzso next to the entry of the active site tunnel in the capping zzso formed by a restructuring of zzso 3 to an zzso zzso This constitutes the first evidence to date for the entire family of zzso that zzso 3 may indeed play a dynamic role in zzso binding and thus provides insights into the elusive zzso complex and into zzso binding in zzso zzso sequence alignments indicate that the zzso we observe in zzso are supported by zzso zzso in a number of structurally zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso represents a new zzso of bacterial zzso
