Living organisms are comprised of various systems at different levels, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each system carries out its diverse functions in response to environmental and genetic zzso by utilizing biological networks, in which zzso zzso such as, DNA, zzso zzso and zzso closely interact with each zzso Systems biology investigates such systems by producing comprehensive global data that represent different levels of biological information, zzso at the DNA, zzso zzso or zzso levels, and by zzso this data into network models that generate coherent hypotheses for given biological zzso This review presents a systems biology zzso called the zzso zzso Data Analysis zzso zzso which generates zzso hypotheses from network models reconstructed by zzso diverse types of zzso data generated by mass zzso zzso zzso The devised framework includes a serial set of zzso and network analysis zzso Here, we demonstrate its zzso by applying these tools to several conceptual zzso
