We isolated a zzso protein from rat zzso extracts and have named it zzso zzso zzso (formerly called zzso zzso zzso is rich in zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso and zzso but contains no zzso or zzso The zzso zzso content includes about zzso zzso acid and indicates that several zzso and zzso are zzso zzso equilibrium analysis gave a zzso of zzso Based on this molecular weight we calculated that zzso contains about zzso acids and 75 zzso With automated zzso degradation the sequence of the first zzso acids was shown to be: zzso The initial 3 zzso of this sequence are identical to the first 3 in human zzso zzso and are closely similar to the zzso sequences of zzso from other species, as well as at the beginning of bone zzso zzso zzso On Western zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted only with zzso in zzso extracts and with none of the proteins from zzso Similarly, zzso experiments showed the presence of zzso in zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso Along with zzso zzso data reported elsewhere, these observations suggest that zzso may be an important marker for cells in the zzso zzso
