zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of the zzso group from zzso to zzso to form zzso We have cloned a novel human zzso zzso designated zzso from human zzso The zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame that encodes a 307 zzso acid zzso that was expressed as a zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso shared only zzso zzso acid sequence zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso but possessed zzso activity comparable with zzso Using human zzso databases, zzso was localized to zzso zzso within a zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is on zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed highly restricted expression of zzso to brain, heart and muscle zzso which contrasts with the wide tissue expression of zzso different regions of the brain exhibited differential expression of zzso zzso zzso of either of two zzso zzso zzso or zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso to a unique zzso within zzso was produced, and zzso analysis of sections of normal adult human zzso revealed that zzso protein was markedly expressed in the zzso of zzso However, the pancreatic zzso cells exhibited weak expression of zzso zzso Sections of zzso from zzso patients showed strong expression of zzso protein in the zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso cells exhibited relatively low expression of zzso zzso These data suggest that the unique zzso patterns of zzso reflect distinct functions for the zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
