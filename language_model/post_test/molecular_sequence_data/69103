zzso of zzso were introduced individually and multiple to zzso from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso promoter and their effects on zzso initiation efficiency measured in zzso All 15 zzso tested were less active than the wild zzso zzso at zzso nearly zzso promoter activity independent of other changes, and zzso at zzso reduces promoter activity zzso On the other hand, effects of zzso at zzso and zzso depend on other changes, suggesting their role should be associated with neighboring base zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso and zzso are involved in DNA zzso This zzso role of the zzso promoter zzso contrasts with the single role of zzso promoter zzso on DNA zzso The zzso binding region extends further downstream in the zzso promoter than in the zzso zzso
