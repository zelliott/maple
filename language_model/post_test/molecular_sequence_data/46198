The requirements for alignment of capped leader sequences along the viral zzso during influenza zzso initiation zzso have long been an zzso In this study, competition experiments using an in zzso zzso zzso revealed that influenza virus zzso prefers leader sequences with base zzso to the zzso zzso of the viral template, 10 or 11 zzso from the zzso zzso Internal zzso at the zzso zzso as well as zzso was zzso The zzso identity immediately zzso of the zzso zzso also affected cap donor zzso Application to the in zzso system of zzso molecules with increased base zzso to the viral zzso template showed stronger reduction of zzso zzso leader initiated influenza zzso compared to those with a single zzso zzso zzso the results indicated an optimal cap donor consensus sequence of zzso
