The structure of the highly zzso type 1 zzso zzso protein zzso was determined by X-ray zzso This protein belongs to a group of four zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso Of these, zzso and zzso are endowed with the ability to cleave double strand DNA, a property which is not shared by the other two components of the zzso Single zzso of native zzso the most zzso were obtained using seeding techniques and phase determination was achieved using molecular zzso To investigate the role of zzso in the different functionality of these zzso we performed DNA zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso zzso These experiments revealed that DNA zzso ability does not depend on the level of zzso of zzso since there is no difference in the activities displayed by native zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Besides, confirming that DNA zzso by zzso cannot be attributed to zzso these data zzso show that functional changes between zzso and zzso are solely to be attributed to their sequence zzso On the basis of the comparison of zzso and zzso crystal structures, we propose possible structural zzso responsible for their different functional zzso
