zzso Tax zzso interacts with various cellular factors and zzso zzso and the cell zzso In that role it is sufficient to create T cell zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso Tax protein has been reported to bind to cellular proteins containing zzso zzso in zzso The precursor of human zzso 16, zzso is an abundant cellular protein present in human peripheral blood T zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso It has been shown that expression of zzso in zzso negative cells zzso a zzso arrest in the cell zzso The current studies demonstrate that Tax binds to zzso in zzso infected human T zzso We mapped the Tax binding site to the first zzso domain of zzso zzso of Tax in zzso cells resulted in fewer cells in zzso consistent with its activity to induce zzso to zzso progression in zzso while zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso zzso of wild type Tax with zzso in zzso cells negated the effects of zzso an effect not observed with Tax zzso at its zzso binding zzso These results suggest that one of the effects of Tax on growth deregulation in zzso infected T cells might be zzso by its binding to zzso
