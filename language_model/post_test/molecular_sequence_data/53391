The zzso gene encodes a nuclear protein that is essential for normal zzso zzso At the zzso stage zzso is expressed in the zzso cells and in a zzso of the zzso zzso We show that cap site zzso promoter sequences direct zzso expression in zzso cells, while zzso sequences direct expression in the zzso zzso The promoter domain that directs zzso zzso consists of a positively acting region, that has the potential to direct expression in all cells within the zzso and a zzso acting region that prevents expression in the zzso zzso zzso is the zzso protein that regulates commitment to stalk cell gene zzso where it is known to function as a zzso zzso We show that zzso binds in zzso to the positively acting part of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso However, zzso cannot be zzso for this purpose in zzso because analysis of a zzso zzso zzso strain shows that zzso is not necessary for zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, the part of the zzso promoter that directs zzso expression contains a binding site for zzso that is essential for its biological zzso zzso appears therefore to serve as a direct zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, while a protein with a DNA binding specificity highly related to that of zzso is zzso to activate zzso zzso in zzso zzso
