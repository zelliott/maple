The main zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso which attack zzso the major constituent of the plant cell zzso Of these zzso the alkaline zzso named zzso in strain zzso and zzso in strain zzso has been described as being particularly important, based on zzso studies of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes is tightly modulated by various regulators, including the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The use of a zzso reporter gene allowed us to zzso the repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression exerted by zzso another zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso interaction experiments, centered on the zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso promoter regions, allowed us to define precisely the sequences involved in the binding of these three regulators and of zzso zzso zzso These studies revealed an unusual binding of the zzso zzso and suggested the presence of a UP zzso element in the zzso and zzso zzso Investigation of the simultaneous binding of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso to the regulatory region of the zzso and zzso genes showed that zzso zzso and zzso bind zzso zzso zzso partially zzso binding of the zzso zzso and of the zzso complex, and zzso zzso zzso the binding of zzso and prevents zzso initiation by zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression rather than acting as a true zzso like zzso Overall, control of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso appears to be both complex and zzso
