zzso are pivotal regulators of cellular zzso The human zzso contains more than 500 putative zzso which exert their action via the zzso of specific zzso The zzso of this specificity are still only partly understood and as a consequence it is difficult to predict zzso zzso preferences from the primary structure, zzso the understanding of zzso function in physiology and prompting the development of technologies that allow easy assessment of zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso we decided to explore the usefulness of zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso different zzso zzso with zzso zzso for determining zzso zzso preferences, based on the contribution of individual zzso acids to total array zzso zzso this technology, we were able to determine the consensus zzso sequences for zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, two highly zzso zzso with distinct zzso roles in cellular zzso The results show that although consensus sequences for these two zzso identified through our analysis share important chemical similarities, there is still some sequence specificity that could explain the different biological action of the two zzso Thus zzso zzso are a useful instrument for zzso zzso consensus sequences and highly zzso zzso can differ in their requirement for zzso zzso
