We have examined the expression of growth factor genes in primary cultures of chicken zzso zzso zzso was extracted from zzso and differentiated cells, reversed transcribed and amplified by zzso using gene specific zzso The identity of the zzso products was confirmed by restriction zzso We show, for the first time, zzso expression of zzso 2, zzso 3, zzso 4 and zzso genes in chicken zzso zzso We also detect zzso but zzso zzso gene zzso The synthesis and action of these growth factors supports the hypothesis that they act as zzso and/or zzso regulators of zzso precursor cell proliferation and zzso
