zzso disease is caused by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso presenting as an acute zzso zzso is the key step during infection, often relying on an interaction between host cell zzso and bacterial zzso zzso of this interaction by zzso mimics offers possible novel therapeutic zzso zzso zzso attachment to the zzso cell line was significantly reduced by treatment with zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso This indicates the importance of cell surface zzso chains in zzso A number of putative zzso compounds inhibited attachment to the zzso and zzso cell zzso The most zzso compounds were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These compounds inhibited zzso to a range of human respiratory cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and the human zzso cell line, zzso Some zzso receptors for zzso zzso were determined to be the zzso zzso and zzso that contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso The identified compounds have the potential to be used as novel treatments for zzso zzso
