Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso factors are zzso proteins that induce gene zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso Following zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso to the nucleus, and activate specific target zzso This zzso zzso by zzso proteins has been shown to require the recruitment of zzso such as zzso protein zzso In the present study, we show that steroid zzso zzso 1, zzso originally identified as a nuclear zzso zzso also functions as a zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso was found to associate with zzso following zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso part of zzso associates with the zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso or its zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso by zzso proteins in transient zzso zzso This ability of zzso to enhance zzso activity is dependent upon the presence of the zzso domain, zzso domain zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso and zzso are simultaneously recruited to the zzso promoter following zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso and zzso may function in a common zzso to regulate zzso zzso zzso
