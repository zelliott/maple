zzso is a component of the zzso zzso belonging to the family of intermediate filament zzso It exhibits a complex pattern of zzso and zzso zzso It is also a marker of the zzso potential of many tumor zzso Previously, the human zzso promoter was shown to contain several regions for the binding of positive and negative acting regulatory zzso Until now, the zzso element, which shuts down zzso synthesis in selected zzso during development, was not precisely zzso nor was its binding protein zzso In zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso delineated the position of zzso zzso important to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells of various zzso zzso promoter sequences and zzso zzso precisely defined two regulatory zzso a negative element and an adjoining positive acting zzso Band shift zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis confirm that the zzso element specifically binds a zzso Several lines of evidence show that zzso a zinc finger, zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso element binding zzso zzso and DNA affinity zzso prove that zzso zzso with zzso when bound to the zzso element to yield a zzso complex whose mobility is indistinguishable from that displayed by zzso nuclear extract in band shift zzso
