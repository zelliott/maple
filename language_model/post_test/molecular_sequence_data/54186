Two zzso drinking water supplies were investigated to assess the potential of water treatment and distribution systems to support the growth of zzso zzso The treatment plant for supply A distributed treated groundwater with a low concentration zzso zzso of zzso of natural organic matter zzso and the treatment plant for supply B distributed treated groundwater with a high zzso concentration (8 zzso of zzso In both supplies, the water temperature ranged from about zzso after treatment to zzso during zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in distributed water, analyzed with quantitative zzso zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in supply A and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in supply zzso No zzso was observed with the culture zzso A total of zzso clones zzso operational zzso units zzso with zzso sequence zzso were retrieved from water and zzso of supply A and 251 zzso zzso from supply zzso The zzso of the average value of total species richness zzso in supply A zzso was clearly higher than that for supply B zzso In each supply, about zzso of the sequences showed zzso similarity to described zzso zzso related to zzso zzso were only zzso zzso The zzso populations of the two supplies are divided into two distinct clusters based on distances in the zzso tree as zzso of the branch zzso Thus, a large variety of mostly zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso water supplies at temperatures below zzso The lowest concentration and greatest diversity were observed in the supply with the low zzso zzso
