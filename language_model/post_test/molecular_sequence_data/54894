The detection of zzso stimuli by the sensory zzso of the mouse zzso organ zzso is mainly zzso by zzso receptors that are zzso by two large gene zzso zzso and zzso The mouse zzso contains 122 intact zzso zzso which can be grouped in four families by sequence zzso families A, B, and D zzso zzso and family C (7 zzso zzso sensory zzso zzso in the zzso layer of the zzso zzso zzso two zzso genes in zzso zzso one zzso zzso gene together with one zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso This coordinated zzso may contribute to the highly specialized sensory response profiles of zzso for instance by zzso of a zzso with a zzso zzso The mechanisms that regulate this coordinated zzso of two zzso genes per zzso zzso are not zzso Among possible models are a sequential and dependent model of zzso a model of random combinations of expression followed by cellular selection of zzso with appropriate combinations; and a model of direct coordination of gene expression by another gene family such as genes zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe two novel mouse strains with targeted zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso that begin to provide insight into this zzso We observe that the great majority of zzso that express intact zzso zzso zzso zzso and that the percentage of zzso zzso increases from 3 to zzso Having established this tight zzso of zzso with zzso we then asked if it is maintained when the coding sequence of zzso is zzso We find that the number of zzso expressing a locus with a targeted deletion in the coding sequence of zzso that is likely a zzso zzso is similar to the number of zzso that express intact zzso But zzso of these zzso zzso another zzso zzso which is consistent with the absence of negative feedback from the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso expressing the targeted deletion of zzso now zzso zzso Finally, the marginal region of the zzso zzso where immature zzso are zzso has more zzso of zzso zzso genes than of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso Our results are most consistent with the sequential and dependent model for the coordinated zzso of two zzso genes per zzso zzso
