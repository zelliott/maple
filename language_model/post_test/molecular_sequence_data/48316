Using an integrated zzso approach involving zzso zzso zzso virtual zzso molecular dynamics simulations and zzso energy contribution, 10 compounds were proposed as potential zzso zzso Via validated zzso calculations, binding free energy calculations showed that the proposed compounds presented better binding affinity with DNA zzso B when compared to zzso The compiled in zzso approach employed in this study may serve as a useful tool in the process of the design and development of drugs, not only against zzso but also for a wide range of biological zzso
