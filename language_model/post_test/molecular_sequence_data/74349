This review concentrates on the characteristics and functionality of zzso zzso in the zzso system, zzso two zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso then packaged in zzso with its respective zzso In these zzso zzso is generated from a larger precursor zzso and is detected in zzso some of them zzso with zzso for others there is a marked segregation of zzso and zzso zzso along the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso given zzso inhibited the zzso electrical activity of zzso zzso reduced plasma zzso levels and increased zzso zzso showing that zzso acts as a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso actions through zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso Moreover, in response to potent zzso stimuli known to evoke increased zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso like during zzso both the zzso zzso and zzso terminals loose their dense zzso quality, and zzso is released by zzso zzso in the zzso space to zzso the characteristic zzso activity necessary to a sustained release of zzso and zzso by terminals in blood circulation where zzso then ensures its main zzso actions at kidney level zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in these zzso rather than being released into the zzso and probably into the zzso Thus, decreases in the local supply of zzso to zzso zzso cell bodies may facilitate the expression by zzso zzso of an zzso zzso activity, by decreasing the zzso actions of zzso on these zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso has a biological purpose, making it possible to maintain the water balance of the zzso by preventing additional water loss via zzso This reveals a new zzso concept of dual and opposite functional zzso for zzso zzso zzso different zzso in separate zzso depending on the degree of their electrical zzso zzso release selectively the very zzso peptides that will ensure its accurate zzso functions in perfect accordance with the hormonal zzso
