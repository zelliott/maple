The zzso zzso zzso of a highly virulent avian influenza virus, zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to have five zzso zzso and escape zzso within one zzso zzso 1) were markedly attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To define the genetic changes related to these zzso and zzso properties, the zzso genes of zzso within each of the zzso groups were zzso by using the zzso chain zzso The zzso in the attenuated group 1 zzso were located near the zzso tip of the zzso zzso in close proximity to the zzso site, on the basis of alignment with the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso All group 1 zzso involved charged zzso zzso The group 1 zzso similar to the zzso virus, spread zzso and were recovered from the zzso of infected chickens but, unlike the zzso virus, failed to produce severe necrosis in the zzso zzso replication in the zzso was investigated by in zzso zzso of zzso sections from chickens infected with the zzso or attenuated zzso zzso virus replication was demonstrated in large, zzso zzso zzso however, group 1 zzso virus was detected attached only to zzso within the red zzso These results suggest that the attenuated zzso differ in their cell zzso within the zzso
