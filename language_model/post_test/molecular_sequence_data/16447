A cucumber zzso designated zzso and zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso was isolated and zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso was detected that could zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso with sequences of other zzso revealed the highest similarity zzso to zzso As described for other zzso zzso has a long variable domain preceding a zzso domain, an zzso function domain, and a zzso zzso containing 4 zzso zzso zzso The zzso long variable domain of zzso does not contain the zzso zzso which is found in many zzso The relative expression level of the zzso genes in various zzso of cucumber plants and zzso and in zzso excised zzso and zzso following treatments with light and/or zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso acid zzso was determined by northern analysis using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcripts are most abundant in cucumber plant zzso with less zzso in cucumber zzso roots and zzso and lowest zzso in cucumber plant flowers and zzso hooks and zzso All zzso tested enhanced the zzso of the transcripts zzso in zzso zzso On the other hand, levels of the transcripts increased to a lesser extent in both light and zzso or zzso zzso and no effect was noted in response to light treatment with zzso In zzso no major changes in the relative levels of zzso transcripts were observed in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso except an zzso effect with zzso treatment in the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso treatments in zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso can zzso the zzso transcript levels in zzso and zzso and independent zzso
