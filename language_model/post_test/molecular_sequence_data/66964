zzso zzso named as zzso in the zzso an zzso scorpion zzso is zzso from the zzso of the Chinese scorpion zzso zzso zzso It features a primary sequence typical of the zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso and a shifted location of the fourth zzso bridges zzso and demonstrates zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso However, it is noteworthy that zzso is not zzso with a zzso zzso at the preceding position of the third zzso zzso and is the first example having a zzso zzso at the relevant position in the zzso scorpion zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso is determined with zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso The solution structure of zzso is closely similar to those of zzso zzso and zzso only distinct from the latter by lack of an zzso The surface functional patch comparison with those of zzso zzso and zzso reveals their striking similarity in the spatial zzso These results zzso that the functional surface of zzso is composed of two binding regions and a functional zzso The main binding site is consisted of zzso zzso surrounding the zzso and its preceding loop, which is common to all zzso scorpion toxins affecting zzso zzso The second binding site, which determines the specificity of the zzso locates at the zzso for zzso insect zzso while rests at the zzso and its linking loop for zzso zzso The functional site involved in the zzso zzso model, which characterizes the function of all zzso is the zzso charged zzso zzso
