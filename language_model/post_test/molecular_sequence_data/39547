The zzso zzso system can create zzso insertions in the zzso germ lineage very zzso We constructed a zzso gene trap zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso the zzso gene and the zzso zzso In the pilot screen for gene zzso using zzso we identified 38 fish lines expressing zzso in specific zzso and zzso In the zzso line, zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso and the zzso of the gene trap construct captured a transcript of the zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso related zzso protein zzso In the zzso line, zzso is expressed in the central nervous system, and the zzso captured a transcript of a gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe how we performed the gene trap screen and characterized the gene trap insertions and will discuss the outcome of the pilot zzso
