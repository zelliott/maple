zzso of zzso zzso zzso contaminated zzso in the presence of heavy metals have proved to be difficult and often challenging due to the ability of toxic metals to inhibit zzso degradation by zzso In this study, a mixed bacterial culture designated as zzso was isolated from a former manufactured gas plant zzso zzso The ability of this consortium to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso as a sole carbon source in the presence of toxic metal zzso was zzso Furthermore, this consortium has proven to be effective in degradation of zzso zzso even from the real long term contaminated zzso zzso Thus, the results of this study demonstrate the great potential of this consortium for field scale zzso of zzso in long term mix contaminated zzso such as zzso zzso To our knowledge this is the first study to isolate and characterize metal tolerant zzso zzso degrading bacterial consortium which shows great potential in zzso of mixed contaminated zzso such as zzso
