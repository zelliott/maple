zzso are unable to zzso de zzso most of their own membrane zzso including cholesterol, and have to take them up from the host during an zzso The underlying molecular mechanisms are so far zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso which is expressed by zzso stages and adults of the fox zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displays significant zzso to zzso zzso binding protein zzso of zzso origin and to zzso zzso domain zzso Like zzso zzso zzso carries an zzso signal sequence which is absent in predicted zzso zzso from the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a specific zzso and zzso techniques, we demonstrate that zzso is zzso into the zzso environment and into the zzso fluid of in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso zzso a major constituent of zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso By zzso experiments, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso human zzso and is able to zzso zzso from human zzso On the basis of these features and the suggested function of zzso in cholesterol transport in higher zzso we propose a role for zzso in cholesterol and zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso
