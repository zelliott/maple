The opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso possesses four zzso cup zzso which may zzso the ability to adapt to different zzso zzso lies in the zzso island zzso next to genes coding for a putative zzso system composed of the hybrid zzso zzso zzso and the response regulator zzso The main focus of this work was the regulation of zzso at the zzso zzso It was found that the zzso protein zzso does not exert a strong influence on zzso transcript levels, as it does for zzso zzso zzso is higher in cultures grown at 28 degrees C, which agrees with a zzso zzso presenting attenuated zzso only in a plant model, but not in a mouse model of zzso Whereas an zzso zzso deletion zzso presented higher levels of zzso zzso zzso deletion had the opposite zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the levels of zzso transcription, and promoted zzso formation and the appearance of zzso A single zzso start site was determined for zzso and zzso from this site was induced by zzso A motif similar to the zzso zzso site was detected adjacent to the zzso region, suggesting that this could be the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso may provide insights into how similar systems can be used by different bacteria to control gene expression and to adapt to various environmental zzso
