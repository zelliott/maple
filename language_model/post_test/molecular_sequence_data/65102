zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to form zzso zzso Two classes of zzso which rely on different reaction mechanisms, have so far been discovered, class I mainly found in zzso and class II mainly in zzso Only recently were genes zzso proteins with zzso activity identified in zzso zzso zzso do not share any significant overall sequence identity with members of the traditional classes of zzso raising the interesting question of whether they have evolved independently by zzso evolution or zzso from a common zzso zzso characterization of zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso use a zzso mechanism and thus belong to the class I zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso revealed that the protein fold, as for the classical zzso I and II, is that of a parallel zzso zzso A zzso crystal structure allowed detailed zzso comparisons which showed the conservation of six important zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso and the classical zzso zzso This observation provides further evidence that the two sequence families of proteins share a common evolutionary zzso Furthermore, structure and sequence analysis indicate that the class I zzso shares a common evolutionary origin with several other zzso zzso of the zzso barrel zzso
