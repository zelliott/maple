zzso binding zzso zzso which is identical with vitamin D3 zzso zzso protein 1 zzso plays a crucial role in the integration of zzso and zzso zzso There are three highly zzso genes of zzso D3 zzso protein 1 in humans, but their functions remain zzso Here we characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso In contrast to zzso zzso displayed no significant binding affinity for zzso zzso exhibited an inner zzso pattern of distribution and also zzso with zzso and zzso zzso indicating zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso an important regulator of energy metabolism and cell growth zzso induced the expression of zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso cell growth and zzso zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso a novel zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a regulatory role in cell proliferation and zzso zzso
