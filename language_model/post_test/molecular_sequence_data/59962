A single modular zzso zzso zzso gene cluster is responsible for production of both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Building on the success of the zzso expression system engineered using the zzso zzso we have constructed an analogous system for the zzso zzso Through zzso expression and construction of a hybrid zzso we have examined the contributions that the zzso its internal zzso domain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain make in termination and zzso of the two zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso genes were functionally expressed in the zzso host zzso zzso resulting in production of both zzso and zzso (the precursors of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso led to increased production levels, but did not change the ratio of the two compounds produced, leaving the function of this protein largely zzso Fusion of the zzso zzso domain zzso to zzso B zzso zzso resulted in formation of only zzso zzso 

These experiments demonstrate that the zzso alone is capable of catalyzing the synthesis of both zzso and zzso zzso and favor a model by which different zzso rings result from a combination of the arrangement between the module 5 and module 6 zzso in the zzso zzso complex and the selectivity of the zzso zzso
