To identify proteins that regulate the zzso activity of zzso we have used the zzso zzso screen to detect zzso zzso that might interact functionally with the zzso segment of zzso a known regulatory zzso Among the proteins identified is a short form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta is missing the 55 zzso zzso acid zzso of the long form zzso zzso and has 7 additional zzso acid zzso at its C zzso In the absence of added zzso expression of zzso beta (but not zzso zzso in zzso cells activated a promoter containing the zzso 6 responsive element of the rat alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso beta and zzso led to enhanced cooperative zzso of the zzso Nuclear extracts of cells zzso with a zzso beta expression zzso formed a complex with an zzso containing a zzso binding site, whereas extracts of cells zzso with a zzso alpha zzso did zzso We conclude that there is a short form of zzso zzso zzso that zzso beta is zzso active under conditions where zzso alpha is not, and that zzso beta and zzso are capable of cooperative zzso of certain zzso
