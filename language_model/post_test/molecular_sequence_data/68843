The three-dimensional solution structure of a zzso DNA duplex zzso zzso from a zzso region of zzso zzso long terminal zzso has been investigated using zzso zzso and restrained molecular dynamics zzso zzso distances derived from two-dimensional nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso experiments, using the zzso complete relaxation zzso zzso zzso and zzso angles for sugar rings, estimated from zzso fitting of zzso correlation zzso zzso were obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kenyon, zzso zzso & James, zzso zzso (1992) zzso 31, zzso These structural restraints have now been employed as the basis for structure refinement using restrained molecular dynamics zzso to search zzso space for structures consistent with the experimental zzso Specifically, upper and lower bounds on the restraints were incorporated into the zzso zzso zzso total potential energy function of the system, the bounds being used to define the zzso of a zzso penalty term in the zzso force zzso zzso in the zzso structure obtained is engendered by convergence to essentially the same structure zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso when two quite different DNA models, zzso and zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso were employed as starting structures and when various initial zzso were used for the zzso zzso The derived structure is further supported by the total energy zzso the restraint violation energy, the restraint zzso and the fit with experimental zzso For the latter, the zzso residual index indicated a good fit of the determined structure with experimental zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso difference between zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated for the derived structure and experimental zzso zzso were also in reasonable agreement zzso zzso zzso zzso While the structure of the zzso is basically in the zzso family, some structural parameters manifest interesting local zzso The zzso parameters indicate that, compared with classical zzso the structure is zzso more zzso Local structural variations at the two zzso steps in particular together create zzso into the major groove of the zzso zzso of the zzso in the duplex reveals that they have similar structures, with the zzso zzso being almost zzso however, the zzso sequence has a larger roll and slide for the zzso step than for the zzso zzso in zzso with published X-ray zzso zzso
