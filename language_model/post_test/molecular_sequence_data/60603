The zzso zzso zzso is specific for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso which is an 85 zzso acid zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso The binding domain zzso has been produced as a single chain zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in zzso and coded for zzso leader zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is three repeats from the zzso repetitive sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso acts as a zzso it is the zzso for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso usage was zzso for zzso zzso and many unique restriction zzso sites were zzso The zzso gene incorporated into zzso was highly zzso yielding zzso of the cell protein as the zzso which was found in inclusion bodies with the leader zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso yielding preparations with zzso values from 20 to 175 zzso However, based upon an assessment of the amount of active zzso zzso the binding zzso constant was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso previously determined for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso of the zzso zzso on the binding constant of the zzso was very similar to the properties determined for the zzso and the zzso zzso It was concluded that the small percentage ( approximately zzso of zzso zzso is a true mimic of the zzso binding domain and that the incorrectly folded zzso cannot be detected in the binding zzso
