The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso The sequence has been aligned with large zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Nine extensive expansion segments in zzso zzso zzso relative to zzso coli zzso zzso have been identified and compared with analogous segments of zzso zzso zzso and human zzso A secondary structure model for lemon zzso zzso has been derived based on the refined model of zzso coli zzso zzso It has been compared with other zzso zzso models in terms of location of functionally important zzso zzso and evolution of zzso expansion segments are zzso
