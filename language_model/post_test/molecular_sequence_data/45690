zzso zzso are involved in various regulatory zzso Our previous study indicated that the zzso region of an open reading frame, zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso that specifically zzso the zzso zzso zzso of a membrane zzso the zzso zzso In humans, an absence of zzso is associated with a form of zzso anemia known as zzso zzso but the function of zzso is not fully zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso in zzso zzso Each active site of zzso is rich in zzso zzso which accounts for the zzso The zzso of zzso shows structural similarity to one zzso of zzso coli zzso an zzso zzso zzso But, their zzso forms are zzso Major contributors to zzso interaction in zzso are the zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are missing from zzso While the long handle region of zzso contributes to the stacking of two zzso rings, the corresponding zzso loop of zzso is zzso because the region has little interaction with other zzso of the same zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is in almost the same location as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas another zzso zzso presumably forming the zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso region of zzso These findings suggest that the binding of the zzso to the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso changes in a region that includes loop zzso so that zzso approaches the zzso zzso
