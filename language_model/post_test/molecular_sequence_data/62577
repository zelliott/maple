It was observed about 50 years ago that low serum complement activity or low protein zzso of complement C4 concurred with disease activities of systemic lupus zzso zzso Complete deficiencies of complement components zzso and zzso albeit rare in human zzso are among the strongest genetic risk factors for zzso or zzso disease, across zzso zzso and racial zzso However, whether zzso or partial zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso is a zzso factor for zzso has been a highly controversial zzso In this review we critically analyzed past zzso studies on zzso of zzso or zzso in human zzso zzso results from more than 35 different studies revealed that zzso and zzso deficiencies of zzso were present in zzso of zzso patients from almost all ethnic groups or races investigated, which included northern and central Europeans, zzso Caucasians in the zzso African Americans, Asian Chinese, Koreans and zzso In addition, French zzso and control populations had relatively low zzso of zzso but the difference between the patient and control groups was statistically zzso The relative risk of zzso in zzso varied between zzso and zzso among different ethnic zzso In Caucasian and African zzso patients, the two major causes for zzso are zzso the presence of a zzso zzso zzso module with a single, short zzso gene in the major zzso complex; and zzso a zzso zzso into the sequence for zzso zzso at zzso 29 of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso structures and zzso zzso in zzso 29 are absent or extremely rare in the zzso of Oriental zzso zzso The highly significant association of zzso with zzso across multiple zzso zzso and ethnic groups, and the presence of different mechanisms leading to a zzso protein zzso among zzso patients suggested that zzso or low expression level of zzso protein is a primary risk factor for zzso disease zzso per zzso On the other hand, Spanish, Mexican, Australian zzso zzso patients had increased zzso of zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso Such observations underscore the importance of both zzso and zzso proteins in the fine control of zzso Different racial and genetic backgrounds could change the thresholds for the requirement of zzso or zzso protein levels in immune tolerance and immune zzso Most past zzso studies of C4 in human zzso did not consider the zzso and gene size variations of zzso and zzso In addition, many studies were overly dependent on zzso observations or methods that did not distinguish differential zzso and zzso protein expression caused by unequal gene number or different gene size from the absence of a functional zzso or zzso zzso For further zzso studies on clinical manifestations of zzso it would be zzso to zzso the patients with accurately defined zzso and zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of zzso genetic factors interacting with zzso would provide important insights into the intricate roles of C4 in zzso disease zzso and zzso
