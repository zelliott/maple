The zzso zzso associated with the zzso of zzso zzso contains a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso By cloning and expressing the zzso region of the zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso domain exhibits preferred zzso specificity towards zzso and zzso carrier proteins in fatty acid and zzso zzso synthesis over its zzso zzso We also found evidence suggesting that the zzso domain adopts a zzso structure, distinct from the zzso structure of type II zzso The results revealed a novel type of zzso with unique structure and zzso zzso and suggested that the zzso zzso probably acquired the zzso domain from a primary zzso zzso in zzso
