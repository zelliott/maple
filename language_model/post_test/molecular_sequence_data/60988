In zzso zzso one mating partner serves as the source of female tissue and is zzso with zzso from a partner of the opposite mating zzso The role of zzso signaling in mating is thought to involve recognition of cells of the opposite mating zzso We have isolated two putative zzso precursor genes of zzso zzso The genes are present in both mating types of the fungus but they are expressed in a mating zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso that is processed to produce a zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a precursor zzso that is processed by a zzso zzso to yield a zzso with striking similarity to the predicted zzso sequence of a close relative, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso putative zzso precursor genes was observed under defined nutritional conditions and in field zzso This suggests that the requirement for complex media for mating and the poor fertility of field zzso may not be due to limitation of zzso precursor gene zzso zzso of putative zzso precursor gene zzso in zzso suggests that zzso may be important for the fertility of zzso acting as zzso
