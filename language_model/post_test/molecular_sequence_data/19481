The zzso stimulating hormone zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso from zzso of the anterior zzso zzso It acts by binding to and zzso its specific zzso the zzso to induce the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso Recent studies conducted in diverse fish species suggest a direct role of zzso on zzso zzso In this work, we describe the cloning of a zzso zzso a zzso which was isolated from the zzso of the European sea bass zzso zzso The mature protein displays typical features of the members of the zzso hormone zzso family and shows the highest zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso of other fish zzso An zzso of approximately 50 zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso is also present in the zzso end of the zzso domain of the zzso By zzso analysis, we demonstrate the zzso expression of zzso in numerous zzso of the sea zzso Also, two transcripts that differ in the length of their 3' untranslated regions were zzso They reflect the use of alternative zzso zzso zzso Seasonal changes in zzso zzso levels in female and male sea bass during the first zzso and zzso zzso suggest that in females the zzso could participate in active zzso and in the regulation of zzso maturation and zzso whereas in zzso the zzso would be involved in the regulation of processes that occur during the early stages of the zzso development and also of zzso maturation and zzso The results of this work indicate that a zzso has been cloned from the zzso of the European sea bass and they provide the basis for future studies concerning the function of zzso in this zzso
