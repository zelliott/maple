The foot of the simple zzso zzso is a highly dynamic body region of constant tissue movement, cell zzso determination and zzso Previously, two genes have been shown to participate in the development and differentiation of this body zzso zzso factor zzso and signal zzso zzso zzso zzso 180 zzso zzso Development 126 (1999) zzso Development 122 zzso 1941; zzso zzso 106 (2001) zzso zzso functions as zzso regulator and is responsive to changes in the zzso value while the zzso zzso zzso serves as zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso increases the spatial domain of zzso expression towards the gastric region, indicating that zzso signals are integrated at the zzso region of zzso In the present study, to zzso the molecular basis of the interaction of zzso and zzso we characterized the zzso regulatory regions of both zzso Within the zzso zzso upstream region, zzso mobility shift zzso showed that putative zzso binding motifs are specifically bound by both nuclear protein from zzso foot and by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might zzso its own zzso This is the first indication for an zzso circuit in zzso In addition, we also identified zzso binding sites in the zzso region of the zzso zzso indicating that this gene is one of the targets of the zzso factor zzso On the basis of these results, we present a model for the regulatory interactions required for patterning the zzso end of the single axis in zzso which zzso that zzso together with zzso zzso foot specific zzso
