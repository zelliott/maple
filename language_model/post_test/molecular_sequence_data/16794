zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso and zzso control distinct sets of downstream zzso however, these two zzso zzso factors zzso to regulate zzso gene expression and to inhibit tumor zzso Here we investigate the mechanism by which zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso promoter and show that stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso does not require its zzso activity but relies on the ability of zzso to bind the zzso zzso and to stimulate zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sites in zzso eliminates the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso and associated zzso zzso zzso this, small peptides derived from the zzso interface can bind to zzso stabilize the binding of zzso to zzso zzso stimulate zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso activity from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be zzso by zzso further suggesting that zzso zzso is the mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data expand the core zzso protein zzso and zzso interface by including an zzso interface as an zzso modifier of zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso
