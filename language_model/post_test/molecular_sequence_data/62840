We propose the use of single zzso zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso markers for individual identification and parentage control in zzso To this end, we present an initial set of 37 zzso markers together with a zzso zzso for identity control and parentage testing in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso To obtain suitable zzso a total of zzso zzso of random zzso DNA was screened yielding 531 zzso zzso and 43 previously identified zzso were subjected to the following selection criteria: zzso the frequency of the minor zzso must be larger than zzso in at least two of the three examined breeds, and zzso markers should not be linked zzso zzso zzso were estimated by zzso sequencing traces of pooled DNA or by zzso individual DNA zzso The selected zzso zzso were physically mapped by radiation hybrid mapping or by zzso in zzso zzso and tested against the neutral zzso zzso The presented marker set theoretically allows probabilities of identity less than zzso for individual zzso and exclusion powers exceeding zzso for parentage zzso
