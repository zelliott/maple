We determined the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is circular and has a length of zzso The content zzso to typical zzso of zzso The gene order and zzso polarity of the zzso genes is identical to the zzso ground zzso Six zzso genes are zzso making the gene order zzso Thus it will bring forward the understanding of zzso evolution within the zzso for which much more derived gene orders are zzso We zzso that the gene string zzso zzso constitutes an zzso character for the zzso In contrast to the relatively large zzso size, we found two extremely truncated zzso zzso The zzso gene is the shortest zzso reported up until now for zzso A zzso imperfect tandem repeat was observed within the control zzso The zzso deterministic pattern of variation between the repeat units makes it zzso that functional constraints play an important role in the evolutionary dynamics and extant appearance of the repeat zzso
