Very early promoters of viruses control the proper cascade expression of viral genes and are essential for completion of virus life zzso These promoters are usually rare and weak and do not zzso structural zzso As a result, they are difficult to zzso In order to identify and clone the very early promoters of a large zzso DNA virus, the zzso virus, a novel cloning strategy was zzso This strategy is based on a zzso shuttle zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoters upstream permits the efficient expression of zzso in bacteria zzso The function of the putative promoters was then confirmed by their proper expression in insect zzso The first two productive zzso promoters of zzso virus, contained within the shuttle zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from the zzso and zzso fragments of the zzso viral zzso zzso By primer extension analysis, an immediate and zzso expression of the promoter in clone zzso was detected after viral zzso Identification of the productive zzso promoters has laid down important groundwork for future studies on the molecular mechanism of the zzso switch between productive and persistent infections of zzso zzso
