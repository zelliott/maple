The zzso protein zzso from zzso monkey virus zzso contains two evolutionary zzso zzso zzso zinc finger structures, where the zzso and His zzso provide zzso to a zzso coordinated zzso zzso The zzso zinc finger zzso of zzso from zzso contains an immediately zzso zzso in the zzso position relative to the start of this zzso zzso zzso Metal complexes of zzso acid peptides which model the native zinc finger zzso zzso zzso and non-native zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences have been zzso characterized and compared to the native zzso protein fragment, zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso complexes adopt zzso zzso zzso and have zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition zzso consistent with three zzso bonds for zzso and zzso The non-native zzso zzso binds zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparable to that of the native complex, and approximately zzso tighter than zzso Like the zzso zzso the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso zzso is most consistent with zzso zzso complexes with multiple zzso zzso In contrast, zzso complexes of zzso and zzso exhibit a single zzso band in the zzso zzso region zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso distinct in the two complexes, zzso to a zzso zzso transition envelope characteristic of non-native zzso coordination zzso and an intense zzso transition in the zzso zzso approximately 14,000 zzso zzso zzso complexes have intense zzso in the zzso zzso with absolute zzso consistent with approximately zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gives zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes of non-native zzso peptides are more sensitive to zzso by zzso relative to zzso suggestive of a higher zzso in the non-native zzso The implications of these findings for the evolutionary conservation of this motif are zzso
