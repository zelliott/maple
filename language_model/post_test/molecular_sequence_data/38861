Despite recent declines in zzso zzso zzso pneumonia zzso remains the most commonly occurring opportunistic illness among persons with AIDS in the United zzso While zzso zzso DNA has been detected in patient respiratory specimens and in air samples collected from various indoor environments housing zzso patients, the viability of these organisms is zzso For this reason, we have developed and evaluated a molecular viability zzso for zzso zzso This method is based upon the detection of zzso zzso zzso by a reverse zzso that employs specific zzso from a member of the heat shock protein 70 zzso Under optimal zzso conditions, these zzso were capable of detecting as few as 100 viable zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso while no signal was obtained from zzso zzso killed by heat, zzso or zzso zzso This zzso was also capable of distinguishing zzso zzso from other common zzso present in the zzso zzso this molecular viability zzso may be useful in conjunction with standard zzso collection devices and procedures for the detection of viable zzso zzso collected from various indoor zzso It may also be useful in confirming the presence of viable zzso in respiratory specimens collected by zzso techniques from zzso infected zzso
