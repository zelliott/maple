zzso zzso interacting zzso has been known to inhibit two main types of programmed cell death, zzso and zzso and was recently found to be associated with zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso from its zzso role in cell death, zzso was also shown to act as a zzso zzso or zzso in the zzso salvage zzso Here we report the structural and zzso characterization of human zzso as an zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure was determined at zzso resolution, revealing an overall fold similar to members of the zzso class II zzso zzso zzso exists as a zzso in solution and exhibits an assembly with C4 symmetry in the crystal zzso The zzso active site is located at the end of a long zzso between two adjacent zzso We propose an zzso reaction mechanism involving zzso as a zzso zzso as supported by zzso zzso zzso study, and sequence conservation zzso We explored the relationship between two distinct functions of zzso cell death zzso and zzso zzso by measuring the ability of zzso zzso to inhibit cell death, and determined that zzso functions as a cell death inhibitor independently of its zzso zzso activity for zzso induced by either zzso or zzso but zzso for zzso zzso Our results establish the structural and zzso groundwork for future zzso studies of the role of zzso in modulating cell death and inflammation and in the development of related zzso
