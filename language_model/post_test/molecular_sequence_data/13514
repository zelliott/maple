Loss of zzso gene expression has now been demonstrated in a wide variety of zzso zzso Here we present the zzso sequence and predicted zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso Mouse and human zzso share zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso Analysis of zzso zzso expression throughout the mid and late stages of gestation in the zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is expressed at significantly higher levels in the developing mouse zzso than in any adult zzso In addition, we show that an zzso alternatively zzso form of zzso is expressed in day zzso through day zzso zzso The expression of both alternatively spliced forms of zzso is zzso regulated such that the embryonic form of zzso zzso in day zzso and zzso zzso In the later stage zzso the expression of this alternatively spliced form of zzso is zzso with respect to that of the adult zzso zzso in zzso zzso of day zzso mouse zzso revealed that zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in the developing brain and the neural zzso However, no zzso zzso could be detected in any other embryonic tissue at this stage of zzso These observations suggest that during zzso zzso may play a pivotal role in the development of the central nervous zzso
