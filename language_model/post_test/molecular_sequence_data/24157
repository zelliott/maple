The onion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso couples a zzso zzso to either the terminal zzso via a beta zzso linkage or a terminal zzso via a beta zzso zzso The zzso box is present at the zzso of zzso and zzso We tested its function by producing swaps of the first 36 zzso acids of zzso with that of onion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso are able to zzso zzso as their only zzso The zzso zzso were unable to use zzso but were active when incubated with zzso zzso zzso a similar array of zzso as zzso in contrast, zzso showed a dramatic shift in activity towards synthesis of beta zzso zzso Thus the region containing the zzso box is directing the zzso type zzso In zzso the beta zzso zzso which is part of the zzso box, consists of zzso This motif is variable in zzso and consists of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso We studied the importance of the zzso beta zzso motif using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has zzso activity, whereas zzso has a activity that was shifted towards synthesis of beta zzso zzso This is in agreement with the observed activities of the zzso proteins and indicates that the beta zzso motif of the zzso box is specifying the zzso type zzso
