The cellular prion zzso zzso is zzso anchored and abundant in zzso zzso The absolute requirement of zzso in zzso associated to prion diseases is well zzso However, the function of this ubiquitous protein is still zzso Our previous work using the zzso zzso model, provided evidence that zzso acts as a cell surface zzso Besides a ubiquitous signaling function of zzso we have described a zzso specificity pointing to a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, upon appropriate zzso engage into zzso differentiation programs, giving rise either to zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso specificity of zzso signaling prompted us to search for zzso partners in zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here by zzso an association of zzso with an 80 zzso protein identified by mass zzso as the tissue zzso alkaline zzso zzso This interaction occurs in zzso zzso and is restricted to zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is implemented during the differentiation programs of zzso and zzso cells and is active at their cell zzso zzso zzso may contribute to the regulation of zzso or zzso synthesis in zzso and zzso zzso cells by controlling zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso activity is shown to zzso the zzso status of zzso and thereby its interaction with zzso 

The identification of a novel zzso partner in zzso zzso of zzso cells favors the idea of a role of zzso in multiple zzso Because zzso and zzso functionally interact to support zzso differentiation and memory consolidation, our findings introduce zzso as a functional protagonist in the zzso zzso The partnership between zzso and zzso in zzso cells may provide new clues as to the zzso of zzso zzso
