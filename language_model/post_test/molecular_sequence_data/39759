zzso of proteins on zzso zzso is a dynamic zzso modification that is known to play a key role in regulating zzso and other zzso nuclear zzso However, the extent of this modification in diverse cellular proteins remains largely unknown, presenting a major bottleneck for zzso zzso Here we report the first zzso survey of this zzso identifying 388 zzso sites in 195 proteins among proteins derived from zzso cells and mouse liver zzso In addition to regulators of zzso cellular zzso zzso localized proteins with diverse functions were zzso Most zzso zzso was found in more than zzso of zzso zzso including many longevity regulators and metabolism zzso Our study reveals previously unappreciated roles for zzso zzso in the regulation of diverse cellular pathways outside of the zzso The combined data sets offer a rich source for further characterization of the contribution of this modification to cellular physiology and human zzso
