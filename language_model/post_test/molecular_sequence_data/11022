zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein with a zzso zzso active zzso zzso expressed by most cells of the human zzso zzso can also be released by cells such as zzso upon zzso or zzso stress exposure and exert a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a truncated zzso form of zzso has been zzso In order to better understand the function of full-length and truncated zzso we have produced, for the first time, specific zzso zzso which can discriminate between the two zzso Using these novel zzso designated alpha zzso to alpha zzso a panel of cell lines derived from human B and T zzso zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso The cellular distribution differed between the two zzso All lines contained full-length zzso also located to a minor extent on the cell zzso One exception was the melanoma cell line zzso which did not show any zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in most cells in minimal amounts only, whereas the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso expressed high amounts on the cell surface, as shown by flow zzso analysis of living cells and zzso zzso zzso The biological importance and function of the short versus long forms of zzso as detected by the zzso are zzso
