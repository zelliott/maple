zzso zzso is a unique process in plant zzso For example, zzso cells zzso of carrot zzso zzso maintained in a medium containing zzso acid zzso zzso whole plants via zzso zzso after the depletion of zzso Although some genes such as zzso and zzso have been found to be involved in zzso zzso the critical molecular and cellular mechanisms for zzso zzso are zzso To characterize the early mechanism in the induction of zzso zzso we isolated genes expressed during the early stage of zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso screening and subsequent zzso gel zzso analysis suggested a candidate zzso zzso Early zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso encodes a protein that has zzso and zzso zzso and its expression is highly specific to primordial cells of zzso zzso zzso carrot cells with reduced expression of zzso had wide zzso space and decreased zzso on the cell surface and showed delayed development in zzso zzso The importance of zzso attachment in zzso zzso is zzso
