zzso and nonsense zzso zzso selected for their ability to read a new zzso zzso were observed to suppress one or more zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and found to be of the zzso type, resulting from the zzso of four zzso and one zzso zzso Twenty-two zzso zzso were zzso 20 derived from one of the 3 zzso zzso species, one from zzso and one from zzso The sequences of all but four of the zzso zzso are known, and two of those four were converted to zzso zzso that were subsequently zzso Consideration of the coding zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso does not suggest a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso Rather, the results indicate that different zzso may shift frame according to different zzso zzso of the suppression windows of the zzso zzso zzso indicates that some of the zzso may work at zzso zzso either in the 0 frame or in the zzso frame, and others may act at zzso zzso (in either zzso by some zzso zzso Whatever the mechanisms, it is clear that some zzso zzso can occur at zzso zzso A striking example of a zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that differs from zzso zzso zzso by only a single base in the zzso acid zzso zzso a C to zzso transition that results in a zzso base zzso It is suggested that when this zzso zzso zzso reads its zzso zzso zzso the presence of the zzso base pair sometimes leads either to a zzso change in the zzso or to an altered interaction with some component of the translation machinery involved in zzso resulting in a shift of reading zzso In general, the results indicate that zzso is not simply a function of zzso loop size, that different zzso mechanisms may operate with different zzso and that zzso features, some far removed from the zzso region, are involved in maintaining zzso in zzso
