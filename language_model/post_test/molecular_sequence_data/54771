The motor proteins around the zzso zzso body consist of two zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso and function as a complex that acts as the zzso to generate the zzso that drives zzso Genome analysis of several zzso zzso zzso revealed that there are two sets of genes zzso motor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid sequences for zzso and zzso showed zzso to the zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso However, the swimming zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso cyanide zzso but not by the sodium zzso inhibitor zzso To identify a gene zzso the zzso protein required for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso zzso had remarkably reduced and the zzso zzso completely abolished swimming zzso whereas the zzso zzso retained some degree of these zzso The zzso and zzso zzso did not produce zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules in this zzso and remarkably reduced the ability to cause disease in host tobacco leaves, as we previously observed in the zzso zzso zzso These results strongly indicate that both zzso pairs in zzso zzso are zzso and that zzso is important for not only zzso zzso but also for production of zzso and the ability to cause disease in host zzso
