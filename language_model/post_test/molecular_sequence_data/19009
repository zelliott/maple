zzso protein sequences often contain zzso zzso that consist of a single zzso acid repeated from several to dozens of zzso Some of these are functional but others may persist largely because of high expansion rates due to DNA zzso However, very long zzso with over a hundred repeats are very zzso We report an extraordinarily long zzso consisting of zzso tandem zzso repeats from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which also has a zzso zzso The gene has a zzso with 132 repeats and zzso also with high zzso repeat numbers, in various other zzso zzso The zzso gene structure and protein sequences suggest that the zzso is zzso The high zzso diversity and very poor alignment of zzso zzso in this gene between species similarly indicate zzso This is because the zzso zzso is zzso despite much DNA sequence zzso A survey of other very long zzso zzso in zzso shows that high zzso diversity is the rule, suggesting that these too may be zzso
