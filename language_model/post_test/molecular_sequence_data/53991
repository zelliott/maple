zzso zzso channels zzso are small, integral membrane proteins that traverse the outer zzso membrane and conduct zzso and other small zzso They are known to bind several zzso of zzso metabolism in a zzso fashion, have been found in close association with the zzso zzso zzso of the inner zzso zzso and are hypothesized to form part of the zzso zzso transition zzso which results in the release of zzso c at the onset of zzso cell zzso zzso are found throughout all strata of zzso evolution and exhibit zzso characteristics that are well zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso gene family consists of three zzso each of which shares approximately zzso sequence identity with the other two family zzso Recently, we reported that a single zzso zzso zzso is alternatively spliced into the transcript of the type 3 zzso zzso channel zzso in a zzso zzso This unusual zzso event was shown to be zzso between mouse and human, and we theorized that the spliced zzso could lead to the creation of an alternative zzso initiation zzso Here we report that a highly specific zzso zzso zzso was unable to detect the truncated protein zzso indicative of this putative downstream start zzso From these in zzso studies, we conclude that the alternatively spliced zzso results in the zzso of a single zzso zzso at zzso acid position 39 of the mature zzso zzso Additionally, we have used a zzso zzso sequence comparison to identify zzso regions that may be involved in the regulation of small zzso zzso
