The rod zzso channel is localized in the plasma membrane of rod zzso outer zzso where it plays a central role in zzso It consists of zzso and zzso that assemble into a zzso zzso Each zzso contains structural features characteristic of zzso channels, including a zzso domain, multiple zzso zzso and a pore zzso In addition, the zzso has a large zzso zzso and zzso region called zzso that is also expressed as two soluble protein zzso Using zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we show that the zzso channel associates with the zzso zzso in the rod outer segment plasma zzso This complex and soluble zzso proteins also interact with zzso zzso in the rim region of outer segment disc zzso These results suggest that zzso protein interactions zzso by the zzso part of the channel zzso play a role in connecting the rim region of discs to the plasma membrane and in zzso the zzso complex in the rod outer segment plasma zzso
