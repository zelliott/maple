In DNA zzso from families A and B in the closed zzso several positively charged zzso located in zzso B and motif B, have been shown to interact with the zzso groups of the incoming zzso at the zzso active zzso the zzso zzso of motif B and the nearly zzso zzso of zzso B zzso zzso zzso to a His in family A DNA zzso In zzso DNA zzso belonging to the family B DNA zzso able to start replication by zzso the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be zzso Since in several DNA zzso a third zzso has been involved in zzso zzso we have addressed here the question if in the DNA zzso of the zzso zzso and especially in zzso DNA zzso there are more than these two zzso involved in zzso zzso By zzso zzso in zzso DNA zzso the functional role of the remaining two zzso positively charged zzso acid zzso of zzso B and motif B zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso of motif B is also involved in zzso zzso possibly through interaction with the zzso zzso of the incoming zzso since the affinity for zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso was reduced in DNA and zzso zzso On the other hand, we propose that, when the terminal protein zzso is present at the zzso active site, zzso zzso of zzso B is involved in zzso the incoming zzso in an appropriate position for efficient zzso Although zzso DNA zzso zzso showed a zzso like zzso in zzso zzso in the presence of DNA as template, in zzso reactions as initiation and transition it was impaired, especially in the presence of the zzso zzso protein zzso
