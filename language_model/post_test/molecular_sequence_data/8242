In the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso was found to undergo zzso at a rate that was about zzso slower than its zzso zzso Up to zzso zzso of zzso were incorporated per mole of zzso Lower levels of incorporation could be correlated with the presence of an zzso protein zzso which could be inhibited with zzso acid or zzso The major zzso site was identified as zzso or zzso and was located on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso In addition, there was a relatively low and variable contribution of a zzso zzso at zzso or zzso The initial zzso rates and zzso incorporation levels were highest at a zzso ratio of 2 zzso to 1 CM and were inhibited at higher CM zzso This indicated that binding of one zzso of the zzso zzso by a zzso complex was necessary for the reaction to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso reaction was consistent with this interpretation and indicated a zzso zzso process that included zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, the low zzso contribution was of zzso type since it did not depend on the zzso zzso The zzso appeared to be involved in a relatively slow modification of the zzso properties of the zzso leading to a zzso amplification of the zzso zzso activity which followed its zzso by zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso was independently demonstrated by light scattering zzso
