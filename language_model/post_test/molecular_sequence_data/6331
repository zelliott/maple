In continuation of earlier observations on the involvement of zzso zzso in zzso function, we examined the ability of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso synthesis in human zzso zzso cells zzso Toward this goal, zzso were obtained from women undergoing in zzso zzso zzso with zzso fetal calf serum for 48 zzso and subsequently cultured for 48 h in zzso media in the absence or presence of zzso beta (10 zzso Cellular PA activity was measured by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso levels were zzso by conventional zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso resulted in a 50% increase in zzso production, a zzso suppression of PA activity, and a zzso increase in the ability of the corresponding zzso media to inhibit zzso zzso zzso The zzso capacity was attributable to an zzso increase in PA inhibitor zzso zzso production, zzso as zzso zzso could be abolished by the administration of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso zzso zzso abolished the ability of zzso to enhance PA zzso activity and zzso production, thereby establishing specific zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to suppress PA activity and to produce zzso persisted in the presence of zzso a potent inhibitor of PG zzso Likewise, transforming growth zzso 1 suppressed the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso production without affecting the zzso effects on the PA zzso The present findings suggest a zzso response of zzso to zzso characterized by the induction of zzso and the suppression of PA occurring concurrent with, but independent of, PG zzso These observations support the potential involvement of zzso in the regulation of human zzso zzso
