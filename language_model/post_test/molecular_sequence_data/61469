zzso zzso dysfunction has been regarded as the central hallmark in the zzso of zzso but the mechanisms leading to this dysfunction remain zzso The levels of many metabolism zzso such as zzso zzso are changed in plasma of patients with zzso Some of those might be associated with the occurrence of zzso Our research was trying to reveal the source of metabolism substances which were elevated in plasma of zzso zzso The expression of many zzso genes in 3 zzso and strictly matched 3 normal zzso were compared by employing DNA chip representing 243 human zzso zzso The results showed that, many zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found more highly expressed in zzso zzso than that in normal zzso Additionally, the zzso levels of some genes which were related to other metabolism such as hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also higher in zzso of patients with zzso Furthermore, many zzso factor genes were also zzso in zzso It suggested that, the change of genes expression in zzso was associated with the change of metabolism in patients with zzso
