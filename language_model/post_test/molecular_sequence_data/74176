The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso social zzso and behavior in a wide variety of zzso Variation in a repetitive zzso element in the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene zzso in zzso has been associated with variation in brain zzso expression and in social zzso In humans, the zzso zzso region of zzso contains a tandem zzso of two approximately 350 zzso zzso elements located approximately zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The first block, referred to as zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso the second block, zzso has a complex zzso zzso zzso known as zzso zzso in zzso have been associated with variation in zzso traits in humans, including zzso spectrum zzso Thus, evolution of these regions may have contributed to variation in social behavior in zzso We examined the structure of these regions in six zzso six zzso and one zzso zzso 

Both tandem repeat blocks are present upstream of the zzso coding region in five of the zzso species we investigated, while monkeys have only one copy of this zzso As in humans, the zzso within zzso and zzso are zzso in many zzso zzso Furthermore, both single zzso zzso and duplicated zzso zzso both zzso and zzso are present in zzso zzso zzso populations with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for the single and duplicated zzso respectively, based on the analysis of 47 zzso zzso Finally, a zzso reconstruction suggests two alternate evolutionary histories for this zzso 

There is no obvious relationship between the presence of the zzso zzso and social organization in zzso However, zzso identified in some species may be useful in future genetic association zzso In particular, the presence of both single and duplicated zzso in chimpanzees provides a unique opportunity to assess the functional role of this zzso in contributing to variation in social behavior in zzso While our initial studies show no signs of directional selection on this locus in zzso pharmacological and genetic association studies support a potential role for this region in influencing zzso expression and social zzso
