In order to isolate zzso resistance plasmids from bacterial communities found in activated zzso derivatives of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso with the green fluorescent protein as an identification marker, were used as recipients in filter zzso zzso were selected on zzso plates containing zzso as the sole carbon source and the zzso zzso zzso or zzso and were recovered at zzso in the range of zzso to zzso per zzso A total of 12 distinct zzso designated zzso was zzso Their sizes ranged between 41 to 69 zzso and they zzso various patterns of zzso resistance on their zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso also zzso resistance to zzso zzso Seven of the 12 plasmids were identified as zzso zzso displaying extremely high transfer zzso in filter zzso ranging from zzso to zzso per recipient zzso Ten of the 12 plasmids belonged to the zzso zzso group, based on zzso typing using zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of zzso amplification products further revealed that eight of the 12 plasmids belonged to the zzso zzso whereas two plasmids were identified as zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso products revealed considerable differences among the zzso plasmids at the DNA sequence zzso In order to characterize the gene zzso of the zzso zzso restriction fragments were cloned and their DNA sequences zzso A remarkable diversity of putative proteins zzso by these fragments was zzso Besides zzso and proteins involved in zzso resistance, two putative DNA zzso belonging to the zzso family, a zzso of a type I zzso system, a zzso zzso parts of a putative zzso system belonging to the zzso family, and proteins of unknown function were zzso
