The zzso of zzso zzso C2 of zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso in a mixture of zzso zzso zzso M zzso Most of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso C2 were assigned using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To simplify the assignment procedure for overlapping regions of zzso zzso an analog of zzso C2 with zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso exchange rates for zzso zzso were measured in a series of zzso zzso Two right-handed zzso regions zzso and zzso were identified on the basis of zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso The zzso part of the zzso zzso adopts the zzso zzso stabilized by 3 hydrogen zzso
