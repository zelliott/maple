The beta zzso structure of zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso We established a highly zzso zzso zzso from low zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso cells, and three clones that zzso expressed high zzso activity were zzso In these zzso the affinity to zzso zzso was reduced, whereas the binding to zzso zzso was increased, indicating that the level of beta zzso structure was decreased due to competition for zzso between intrinsic zzso and zzso expressed zzso Lung zzso after intravenous injection of the zzso into zzso and nude mice was significantly zzso suggesting that the decrease in beta zzso structure suppressed zzso via a mechanism independent of the zzso zzso These zzso also displayed decreased zzso into zzso and inhibited cell attachment to collagen and zzso Cell growth was not zzso Our results demonstrate a zzso role for beta zzso branches in invasion and cell attachment in the zzso stage of zzso
