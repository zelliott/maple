zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is classified into 2 clinical zzso type 1 zzso zzso and type 2 zzso zzso We found a Chinese family with type 1 zzso zzso zzso the patients from which were diagnosed according to clinical symptoms and zzso zzso activity in the blood zzso To learn the molecular basis of type 1 zzso zzso zzso in this Chinese family, we isolated total zzso from the peripheral zzso of the zzso and zzso complementary DNA zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The coding region of the zzso zzso was analyzed by sequencing the cloned zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso was zzso for a zzso transition at zzso zzso in zzso 7, changing a zzso to a zzso zzso To characterize the zzso zzso both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and affinity zzso The results showed that the zzso activity of the zzso was not much affected by this zzso acid zzso but the zzso zzso exhibited decreased heat stability and increased zzso to zzso These properties of the zzso zzso would account for the restricted zzso zzso and mild clinical manifestations of these type 1 zzso The finding of this novel zzso makes zzso zzso the only position within the zzso gene at which more than 1 zzso has been zzso
