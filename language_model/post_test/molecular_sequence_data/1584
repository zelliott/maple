We recently showed that zzso protein zzso one of twelve related zzso domain containing proteins with zzso and zzso binding activity, interacts with zzso protein zzso on the zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso seven zzso proteins zzso bind zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso We focused on this interaction for zzso which is expressed as a full-length zzso or truncated version missing the zzso domain zzso zzso analysis showed that the interaction required the zzso zzso motif and the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso which was partially zzso by the zzso domain based on limited zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso and caused zzso of the zzso as well as retention of the zzso intermediate compartment marker zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso binding domain zzso did not zzso to the zzso but appeared with zzso and zzso on large zzso structures, suggesting the presence of a hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed for zzso zzso show that zzso binding and zzso zzso target zzso to the zzso and a zzso zzso respectively, and that zzso zzso in these compartments severely zzso their zzso
