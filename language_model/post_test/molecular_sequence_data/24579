A zzso long transcript zzso the zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso analysis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Complete sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the coding region zzso zzso is followed by an unusually long zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a single zzso in which a zzso due to the deletion of a zzso zzso was zzso The complete structural organization of the relevant gene has been zzso The zzso unit was shown to span a zzso region and to consist in six zzso varying in size from 131 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and five zzso varying in size from 600 to zzso zzso Using the zzso in zzso zzso technique, the zzso gene was localized to bovine and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
