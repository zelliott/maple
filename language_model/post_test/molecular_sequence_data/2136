The zzso gene of the nuclear zzso virus of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been subjected to deletion zzso A number of clones containing partially deleted zzso genes were characterized and four clones containing limited deletions of the zzso or zzso sequences of the gene were further analyzed with respect to zzso promoter zzso The functional characterization of the deletion zzso was achieved through the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso into each deletion zzso The zzso cat zzso were introduced into the zzso of zzso through zzso zzso and the effect of each deletion on the activity of the zzso promoter was evaluated by zzso of zzso zzso activity in extracts of tissue culture cells infected with the corresponding zzso zzso as well as by primer extension zzso zzso of the entire leader region and zzso adjacent zzso of the zzso sequences of the zzso gene results in a dramatic decrease in promoter activity, which, however, remains zzso through zzso activity zzso zzso of an additional 30 zzso zzso of the upstream sequences results in the complete zzso of the zzso zzso The functional characterization of a deletion zzso lacking 41 zzso of the zzso sequences has demonstrated that no functions necessary for viral zzso replication or assembly are disrupted by this zzso since the corresponding zzso viruses zzso in the cells with the same zzso and to the same extent as zzso zzso As a result of the deletion zzso two classes of transfer zzso have become zzso The first class can be used for introducing into the viral zzso foreign zzso sequences under zzso promoter control, while the second one can be used for obtaining zzso viruses harboring foreign genetic material in an environment which is devoid of zzso promoter zzso
