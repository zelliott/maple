With the objective of identifying candidate tumor zzso zzso we used zzso in zzso zzso to map zzso deletions of the long arm of zzso 6 zzso Twenty of 24 deletions overlapped to define a zzso region of minimal deletion between markers zzso and zzso within zzso 6 band zzso Using reverse zzso we found evidence of expression in zzso cells for 3 of 15 genes in the region zzso zzso and zzso zzso between our own and published deletion data singled out zzso as the gene most frequently affected by deletions of zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso analysis of zzso in 14 ALL cases carrying zzso zzso deletions revealed a constitutional and zzso inherited C to G substitution in zzso 6 zzso for an zzso acid change in one zzso The substitution was absent among 232 normal zzso tested, leaving open the possibility that zzso carriers of such zzso may be susceptible to zzso Although low in all normal zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso showed higher baseline zzso expression in zzso and T cells than other zzso Among zzso ALL patients, zzso deletion was associated with a statistically significant reduction in zzso expression zzso zzso zzso By contrast, elevated zzso expression was measured in the zzso line zzso and in one patient with common zzso Finally, we detected significant levels of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso raising the possibility that this gene may be protective against multiple tumor zzso
