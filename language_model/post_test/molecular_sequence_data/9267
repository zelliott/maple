zzso zzso is a zzso endemic species and is an economically important zzso resource in zzso de Bay, the largest lake in the zzso zzso reduction in population sizes of zzso zzso has been recorded in the past, which may have resulted in genetic zzso In this study, the genetic diversity and population structure of zzso zzso in zzso de Bay were assessed using the zzso DNA control zzso zzso were obtained from three localities along zzso de Bay, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of the 86 DNA sequences generated, 22 distinct zzso were zzso There were four unique zzso for zzso six for zzso and five for zzso There were two zzso common to the three zzso The maximum likelihood tree and zzso network showed little geographic separation among the zzso zzso test showed no significant differentiation in zzso zzso from the three zzso The overall zzso zzso was zzso indicating small genetic differentiation in zzso zzso from the three localities zzso Likewise, analysis of molecular zzso showed a greater percentage of variation within population zzso than variation among populations zzso zzso Total zzso diversity and zzso diversity among the specimens from the three sites were zzso and zzso zzso The high zzso diversity coupled with low zzso diversity observed in this study confirms that genetic bottleneck occurred in zzso zzso which was followed by population zzso This is also supported by the zzso values for both zzso D and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso mismatch distribution plots were generated, which is consistent with the model of spatial range expansion followed by demographic zzso
