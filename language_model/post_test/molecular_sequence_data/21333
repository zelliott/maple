zzso alcohols naturally exist in many organisms as important cellular zzso however, their roles in zzso zzso zzso are poorly zzso We report here the isolation and characterization of a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso defective zzso wall zzso which displays defective zzso development and zzso zzso grains with an irregular zzso Chemical analysis revealed that zzso zzso had a dramatic reduction in zzso zzso and an altered composition of zzso zzso as well as soluble fatty acids and zzso Using zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso which is expressed in both zzso cells and zzso during zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso shows that it is a novel fatty acid zzso that produces zzso and exhibits zzso higher specificity for zzso carrier protein than for zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly targeted to zzso zzso by its zzso transit zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso from rice zzso the zzso zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso and is the probable zzso of zzso These data suggest that zzso participate in a zzso step in primary fatty alcohol synthesis for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso
