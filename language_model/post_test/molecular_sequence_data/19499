zzso A is a zzso that zzso at a zzso and subsequently transfers the zzso component to a zzso containing zzso zzso We investigate the reaction conditions of the zzso zzso and demonstrate a useful application by the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the reaction equilibrium of which can be shifted in favor of the product by zzso out the low molecular weight zzso The zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso
