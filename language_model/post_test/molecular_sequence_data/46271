zzso zzso is a novel, aggressive, zzso zzso zzso that drastically affects salmon production at different latitudes, with particular impact in southern zzso Initially, zzso zzso was described as a zzso zzso zzso zzso but it was reclassified recently as a zzso zzso zzso This designation has prompted the independent growth of the zzso to a pure state for detailed study of its biology, zzso and zzso properties that are still relatively poorly zzso The preliminary sequence analysis of a zzso zzso of pure zzso zzso DNA allowed us to characterize a novel and complete zzso zzso sequence in the bacterial zzso (named zzso which has a novel zzso perfectly zzso terminal repeat zzso a zzso zzso that encodes a putative zzso zzso The coding sequence of the zzso shares similarities to that described in some zzso species and particularly to those of the zzso zzso zzso carries its own promoter with standard zzso and zzso zzso suggesting an interesting potential for plasticity in this zzso zzso Additionally, the presence of zzso was confirmed from three zzso of zzso zzso collected from different zzso in Chile in zzso
