zzso is a new zzso of the zzso family identified recently, which consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso active zzso of zzso induced an zzso of the zzso network and resulted in an increased zzso rate of the zzso Here we report the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel mouse zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso consists of 19 zzso and has been mapped to mouse zzso zzso Both human and mouse zzso genes are zzso expressed in adult zzso The results of zzso experiments indicated that the zzso gene is expressed in all stages of mouse zzso and reached the adult level of zzso at zzso day zzso In zzso zzso revealed strong zzso signals of zzso in residual zzso In the mouse zzso zzso may be involved in the differentiation of zzso and zzso The molecular characterization of the mouse zzso gene may provide a clue for functional studies of the human zzso zzso
