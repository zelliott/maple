zzso virus large tumor zzso zzso T zzso has been zzso to near zzso by zzso column zzso We have detected DNA zzso and zzso zzso activities in the zzso zzso T zzso fraction and characterized these zzso The zzso activity was zzso about zzso by zzso which was the most effective zzso among the synthetic zzso zzso Natural zzso zzso such as calf zzso native and zzso DNA, and zzso circular zzso DNA were also effective, but the degree of stimulation was less than zzso The zzso and zzso zzso activities showed similar preference for zzso zzso requirement for zzso zzso and pH zzso The preference for zzso zzso was zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso much greater than zzso The only difference observed between the two activities was salt zzso The zzso zzso activity was resistant to zzso up to 300 zzso In contrast, zzso activity was reduced to the level of zzso activity at 300 zzso zzso DNA zzso activity required zzso zzso and was dependent on zzso of zzso The activity showed similar preference for zzso zzso requirement for zzso zzso and pH optimum as the two zzso activities, and the salt sensitivity of DNA zzso activity was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was inhibited competitively by the addition of zzso or zzso DNA, and a relatively high zzso activity was observed with zzso zzso The zzso T zzso zzso was found to migrate in the 3' to zzso direction along the DNA strand to which the protein zzso
