zzso zzso complexes were isolated from zzso cells and incubated in zzso in the presence of zzso to allow zzso of the zzso zzso up to the zzso zzso The 94 zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The labeled zzso were then isolated, zzso with zzso zzso and their base composition was zzso Based on these analyses 10 consecutive zzso spanning zzso zzso were zzso As the in zzso zzso zzso are zzso the junctions between labeled and zzso zzso define the in zzso pause sites of zzso zzso zzso The characterization of the 10 radioactive spots and their relative zzso allowed the zzso of two in zzso pause sites: one at zzso zzso downstream from the major initiation site presumably at the initial opening of the DNA zzso and the second at approximately 40 zzso downstream from the major initiation site, just past a zzso region of zzso zzso It is zzso that pausing of zzso zzso molecules in the leader region is an essential process in the control of zzso late zzso
