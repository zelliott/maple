Among other functions, zzso play an important role in the innate immune response of zzso and zzso by recognizing exposed zzso on the surface of potential zzso Despite the typically weak interaction of zzso zzso with their zzso zzso they usually achieve high zzso through zzso structures or by the presence of tandem zzso zzso along the zzso The recently described structure of the zzso European zzso zzso revealed a novel zzso fold (the zzso zzso which is shared with other zzso proteins and apparently unrelated proteins from zzso to zzso and a unique zzso sequence zzso Here we described the zzso and molecular characterization of a unique zzso zzso zzso isolated from serum of the striped bass zzso zzso composed of two tandem zzso that exhibit the zzso zzso recognition sequence zzso which we designate zzso We also described a novel zzso family zzso constituted by a large number of proteins exhibiting greater multiples of the zzso zzso either zzso arrayed or in mosaic combinations with other zzso including a putative zzso zzso that suggests an extensive functional diversification of this zzso zzso Among the tandem zzso zzso and other tandem zzso zzso appear unique in that although their zzso domain shows close similarity to the zzso recognition domain of the zzso zzso their zzso domain exhibits changes that potentially could zzso a distinct specificity for zzso zzso In contrast with the zzso in which the zzso zzso appear conspicuously zzso the widespread gene zzso in the zzso fish suggests these zzso zzso acquired increasing evolutionary value within this zzso
