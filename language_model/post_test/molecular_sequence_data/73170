Genome of zzso have zzso and 3' untranslated region and a coding region of zzso zzso zzso In comparison with other zzso zzso lacks the sequence coding typical zzso protein at the N zzso of putative zzso In the putative structure region, E1 and zzso three potential zzso zzso were zzso in all zzso In the putative zzso region, zzso elements found in zzso zzso with zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso In addition, a sequence motif found in all viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso zzso
