zzso zzso is involved in the stable and zzso repression of zzso gene activity during zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel human zzso zzso zzso This gene is more closely related to a zzso zzso zzso zzso than to a previously described human zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso and zzso proteins zzso in zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso cells, suggesting that the proteins are part of a common protein zzso To study the functions of the novel human zzso zzso we generated a zzso zzso delta zzso which lacks an zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso domain is important for zzso function, since the delta zzso zzso protein which lacks the zzso domain is unable to repress gene zzso zzso of the delta zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso zzso results in cellular transformation of zzso cell lines as judged by zzso changes, altered marker gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso in delta zzso cells, the expression of the zzso zzso is strongly enhanced and serum deprivation results in zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso protein results in decreased zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is a zzso of zzso activity and that interference with zzso function can lead to zzso of zzso zzso and subsequently to cellular zzso
