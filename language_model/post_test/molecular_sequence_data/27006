zzso zzso a zzso zzso was isolated from soil associated with the zzso of a perennial grass growing in a fallow agricultural field in Ithaca, New York, zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence placed the strain in the zzso branch of the zzso and the closest characterized relative was the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso straight zzso which formed zzso zzso and were positive for zzso and zzso positive for zzso zzso were zzso unable to grow by reduction of zzso or nitrate and grew exclusively through zzso zzso Growth with zzso on zzso solid media caused the strain to produce copious amounts of zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso and cells contained significant amounts of the zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso studies, zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, fatty acid analysis, and zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
