A cluster of genes for zzso zzso synthesis was isolated from a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso in these strains shares a common first step, transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso The cluster of 24 genes was compared to genes for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have a common zzso backbone but different side zzso one zzso for zzso zzso a zzso side chain for zzso and no side chain for zzso The genes for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar in general organization but differed in location of some zzso in particular, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso repeat unit zzso An unidentified reading frame zzso present in the gene clusters for zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso had similarity to zzso zzso group 2 zzso and was zzso when cloned in zzso zzso producing zzso that lacks a side chain, but not in zzso zzso zzso producing zzso zzso with a zzso side zzso Gene zzso could possibly zzso a zzso zzso zzso Another gene zzso was unique to the zzso gene zzso A zzso containing 20 of the 24 genes resulted in a slight increase in the amount of zzso produced, but a significant increase in the zzso properties of zzso
