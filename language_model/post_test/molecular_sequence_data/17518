The DNA of two previously isolated zzso zzso one from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and another from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that express zzso activity in zzso coli was zzso zzso zzso had three open reading zzso two of which include portions of zzso zzso The third open reading frame occurs entirely within the zzso DNA insert and encodes a protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The DNA insert in zzso was found to contain an open reading frame zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso The major zzso produced in zzso coli cells carrying zzso is about 30,000 zzso It is concluded that zzso encodes this zzso Both zzso and zzso gene zzso protein binding sites lie upstream from the initiating zzso of zzso An interesting feature of the zzso protein is the presence of zzso acid motifs zzso and zzso that occur within a 25 zzso acid zzso
