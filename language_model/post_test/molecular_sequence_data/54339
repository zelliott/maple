To understand the molecular mechanism of tick blood zzso an zzso zzso zzso was identified in the tick zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is zzso and it encodes a deduced zzso zzso acid protein with a size of zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso containing one zzso domain with high zzso to the tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso protein expressed in zzso coli delayed normal zzso of rabbit plasma both in the zzso time zzso and the activated partial zzso time zzso zzso Using zzso zzso transcripts of zzso were detected in fed but not in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene with zzso led to a zzso decrease in the tick attachment rate zzso after introduction in the rabbit ears and a zzso decrease in the average zzso body weight of zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso protein involved in tick blood feeding with possible future application as a vaccine zzso The discovery of zzso is the first report on zzso genes in this species of zzso
