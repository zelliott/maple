To investigate the zzso of a predicted zzso region of zzso zzso virus zzso peptides zzso the zzso sequence have been zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso with zzso backbone zzso zzso In order to analyze the effect of the carrier on the solution zzso of the potential zzso three peptides zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso were studied by CD zzso in PBS or in zzso In zzso zzso and zzso mice, the level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses were zzso zzso with synthetic zzso carrier AK induced zzso zzso responses, accompanied by the appearance of a low level of zzso zzso The zzso pattern of induced zzso revealed the presence of at least two functionally zzso overlapping zzso the availability of which was influenced by zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso mice with the zzso zzso resulted in the production of zzso zzso and in prolonged survival of animals infected with a lethal dose of zzso zzso zzso The degree of protection was comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso
