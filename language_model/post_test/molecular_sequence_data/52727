The 3' end of zzso mosaic virus zzso contains a zzso sequence that directs its zzso zzso A stem loop structure in this zzso stem loop C zzso was investigated using zzso and correlated with its ability to direct zzso synthesis by its zzso zzso consists of two discrete zzso a flexible stem with an internal loop and a rigid stem containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis requires the sequence on only one side of the flexible stem and a specific compact zzso of the zzso A high resolution structure of the zzso places the zzso zzso out in solution, and the 3' zzso within the zzso held tightly through stacking and unusual hydrogen zzso This high resolution structure of an zzso promoter from a zzso zzso virus provides new insights into how the zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso to initiate zzso
