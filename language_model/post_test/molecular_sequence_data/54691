zzso zzso zzso cells cause both zzso infections zzso gas zzso and diseases originating in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or lethal zzso Despite their medical and veterinary importance, the molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells causing diseases of zzso origin remains poorly zzso However, zzso zzso beta toxin zzso was recently shown to be important when zzso cells of zzso zzso type C strain zzso induce zzso zzso zzso and lethal zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso regulatory system was found to control zzso production by zzso zzso cells during zzso infection of cultured zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso zzso the current study now reports that the zzso system also regulates zzso zzso during infection of zzso cells under zzso conditions, as found in the zzso More importantly, the zzso zzso lost the ability to cause zzso zzso zzso in rabbit small zzso zzso Western zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso system mediates zzso zzso at least in part, by controlling in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were, relative to zzso zzso cells, strongly attenuated in their zzso in a mouse zzso zzso zzso these results identify the first regulator of in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso cells causing disease originating in the complex zzso zzso Since zzso also mediates zzso infections, this zzso regulatory system now assumes a global role in regulating a spectrum of infections caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso
