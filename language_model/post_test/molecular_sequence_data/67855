Woolly hair zzso is an abnormal zzso of tightly curled hair, which is frequently associated with zzso zzso forms of zzso can show either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso inheritance zzso zzso has recently been shown to be caused by zzso in either the zzso acid zzso 6 zzso or zzso H zzso zzso More recently, a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene has been reported to zzso zzso zzso all of these genes are abundantly expressed in the inner root sheath zzso of human hair zzso Besides these findings, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso have not been fully zzso In this study, we identified a Japanese family with zzso and associated zzso After exclusion of known zzso zzso we discovered the zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso initiation motif of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in affected family zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso protein led to disruption of zzso intermediate filament formation in cultured zzso To our knowledge, it is previously zzso that the zzso zzso is associated with a zzso hair disorder in zzso Our findings further underscore the crucial role of the zzso zzso in hair zzso development and hair growth in zzso
