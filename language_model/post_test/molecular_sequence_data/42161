zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs as two major zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso The alpha and beta zzso are zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both the gene structures and deduced primary sequences demonstrate their common evolutionary zzso While undergoing similar zzso modifications in the zzso the pro beta zzso is additionally zzso internally to produce the mature zzso zzso beta b and beta a zzso Previous data have suggested that this processing event occurs somewhere between zzso zzso and zzso In this report we demonstrate that this area is located in a zzso zzso structure (between zzso and zzso The zzso event is prevented by the deletion through in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or by its substitution with the aligned alpha zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso the zzso Furthermore, we show that this area is not involved in zzso targeting of zzso B, or in the increased stability or the variation in zzso specificity of the beta as compared with the alpha zzso Our data suggest the presence of a novel zzso zzso Like other zzso it is specific for basic zzso zzso however, it zzso on the zzso side rather than the conventional zzso side of such zzso and then only if they are fully exposed to the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
