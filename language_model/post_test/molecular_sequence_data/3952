zzso fatty acid zzso is a vital facet of zzso coli physiology and requires the expression of two zzso zzso and zzso in the type II fatty acid zzso zzso This study links the zzso zzso zzso factor to the regulation of zzso fatty acid content through the regulation of zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso gene was deleted by replacement with a zzso zzso and the resulting strains zzso possessed significantly elevated levels of zzso fatty zzso particularly zzso in their membrane zzso The altered fatty acid composition was observed in the zzso zzso double zzso zzso zzso as the condensing zzso responsible for the increased zzso zzso The zzso strains had zzso to zzso higher levels of zzso and a zzso to zzso increase in zzso transcripts as judged by Northern zzso zzso array analysis, and real-time zzso zzso did not regulate the zzso of fatty acid zzso The elevated level of zzso zzso was reflected by higher condensing zzso activity in zzso zzso double zzso Thus, zzso functions as a zzso that zzso controls the expression of the zzso zzso which in turn, zzso the physical properties of the membrane by altering the level of zzso fatty acid zzso
