We describe the molecular characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso which is one of the zzso zzso called a vegetable zzso and plant zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso spans 922 zzso and consisted of three zzso and four zzso coding for 154 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso sequences from other zzso The zzso zzso zzso possesses the typical metal binding zzso of six zzso and one zzso acid common to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso in the zzso insect zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately zzso U per zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso DNA suggested the zzso zzso zzso was a single zzso Northern and Western zzso analysis and zzso activity zzso indicated zzso was expressed zzso This is the first report of an zzso gene from any zzso zzso
