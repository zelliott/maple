Our zzso is assembled into and array of highly dynamic zzso structures allowing spatial and zzso access to zzso The zzso are subject to a wide array of zzso zzso altering the zzso interaction and serving as zzso sites for proteins exhibiting zzso or zzso zzso The nuclear proteins zzso and zzso are composed of several putative zzso zzso which may have ability to zzso a set of zzso modification zzso Here we have performed a zzso study of their putative reader zzso the zzso zzso like domain, a novel zzso binding region and an zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso and in zzso cells suggested that despite the extraordinary long loop region in their zzso zzso binding zzso the zzso region of both proteins seem to adopt a zzso zzso of zinc finger interactions similar to other structurally determined zzso zzso Both their zzso domain and their novel zzso binding domain are highly zzso in zzso evolution, and construction of a zzso tree displayed two well supported clusters representing zzso and zzso zzso Their zzso and domain zzso suggest that zzso and zzso have occurred from a gene zzso zzso The zzso tree suggests that this zzso has happened early in zzso evolution, since only one gene was identified in insects and zzso Finally, experimental data confirm that the zzso novel zzso binding region of zzso has the ability to bind the zzso core and zzso However, an adjacent zzso zzso motif as identified in zzso is not present in zzso and deletion of the novel zzso binding region of zzso did not significantly affect its nuclear zzso
