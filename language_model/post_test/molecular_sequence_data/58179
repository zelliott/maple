We have identified the zzso which are incorporated into both zzso human zzso virus type 1 strain zzso zzso produced in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso particles produced in a genetically engineered zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso DNA contains zzso zzso to zzso zzso both long terminal repeats and the primer binding site are zzso As analyzed by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso both zzso and zzso zzso contain four zzso zzso species, which include zzso zzso (the putative primer for zzso reverse zzso and zzso Identification was accomplished by comparing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with those of zzso and zzso zzso from human zzso and comparing the partial zzso sequence at the 3' end of each viral zzso species with published zzso zzso Thus, the absence of the primer binding site in the zzso virus does not affect zzso incorporation into zzso However, only the zzso virus contains zzso tightly associated with the viral zzso zzso The identification of the tightly associated zzso as zzso is based upon an zzso mobility identical to that of zzso and the ability of this zzso to zzso with a zzso DNA zzso In addition to the four zzso zzso species, the zzso zzso particle contains two zzso species and three zzso species that we have been unable to zzso Their absence in zzso virus makes it unlikely that they are required for viral zzso
