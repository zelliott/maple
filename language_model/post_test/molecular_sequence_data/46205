When plants become shaded by zzso plants, they perceive a decrease in the zzso zzso ratio of the light environment, which provides an early and zzso warning of the presence of competing zzso The zzso bases of the natural genetic variation in response to shade signals remain largely zzso This study demonstrates that a wide range of genetic variation for zzso zzso in response to an zzso pulse at the end of day zzso a light signal that simulates natural shade, exists between zzso zzso A quantitative trait locus zzso mapping analysis was done in the zzso zzso zzso line zzso zzso is the most significant zzso identified in response to zzso The zzso zzso at zzso caused a reduced response to shade as a consequence of an impaired zzso zzso under white light, and an accelerated leaf movement rhythm, which correlated positively with the pattern of zzso expression of clock genes such as zzso and zzso zzso and quantitative zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso is the most likely candidate gene underlying natural variation at zzso In conclusion, zzso is proposed as a component of the shade avoidance zzso zzso responsible for the zzso differences between zzso populations in relation to adaptation in a changing light zzso
