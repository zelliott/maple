zzso zzso leukemia zzso is a clinically zzso zzso The zzso status of the zzso heavy chain variable zzso region represents one of the best zzso markers and defines 2 disease zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with different clinical zzso 

zzso gene zzso and zzso status were analyzed in 73 zzso patients with zzso 22 previously treated, by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso The results were compared with those reported in other geographic zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis was also zzso 

A total of 43 zzso cases were of patients with zzso and 30 zzso were patients with zzso zzso of zzso zzso as a single zzso was more frequently observed in the zzso group zzso than in the zzso group zzso In the zzso group, the proportion of cases with deletion of zzso zzso was significantly higher than those with zzso and those with deletions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The most frequently used zzso families were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are different from those observed in Asian, zzso and Uruguayan zzso The zzso gene zzso was the most commonly used, followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso each), and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the lowest frequency zzso in our cohort compared with published data, whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in our zzso zzso zzso zzso chain complementary determining region 3) was found in zzso of zzso 

Our results showed that zzso patients with zzso display an zzso gene usage that resembles that observed in Western countries and exhibited interesting similarities and differences with respect to published series from other Latin American zzso which reflect variations in the genetic zzso
