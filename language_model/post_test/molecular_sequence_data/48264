zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by marking active receptors for zzso zzso an adapter protein for zzso positively regulates zzso zzso in a manner dependent on its zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso finger zzso zzso zzso (or zzso are the components of zzso pathways that recognize target zzso and promote their zzso to zzso The zzso protein acted as an zzso that can recognize zzso zzso such as the activated zzso growth factor zzso through its zzso domain and that recruits and zzso activates an zzso zzso zzso through its zzso zzso These results reveal an zzso protein that functions as a zzso zzso and thus provide a distinct mechanism for zzso targeting in the zzso zzso
