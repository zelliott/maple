zzso is a zzso virus infecting two zzso species zzso zzso It is zzso has a zzso zzso and belongs to the zzso zzso zzso The linear zzso DNA zzso was zzso and found to be 77 670 zzso in zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso A total of 121 likely open reading frames zzso were identified, of which 37 overlapped at start and stop zzso The predicted proteins were usually zzso zzso zzso of zzso and less than about zzso of them had zzso in the sequence zzso Four complete zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an incomplete zzso were zzso A zzso map showed that most of the zzso was transcribed and that the synthesis of transcripts occurred in a highly organized and zzso pattern over a 5 h infection zzso zzso often spanned multiple zzso suggesting that viral genes were organized into zzso The predicted zzso and observed transcript directions matched well and showed that zzso is mainly directed zzso from the zzso zzso meeting at about zzso zzso and this was also a turning point in a cumulative zzso zzso The low point in cumulative zzso near the left end, was a region rich in short repeats and lacking zzso which is likely to be an origin of zzso The zzso zzso is a mosaic of components from widely different sources, demonstrating clearly that viruses of zzso like their zzso counterparts, are zzso for the exchange and transmission of genetic material between wide zzso zzso even across zzso
