zzso aims at exploring microbial communities concerning their composition and zzso Application of zzso sequencing technologies for the analysis of environmental zzso can generate large sets of zzso sequence data which have to be analyzed by means of zzso tools to unveil the zzso composition of the analyzed community as well as the repertoire of genes and gene zzso A zzso software platform is required that allows the automated zzso and functional analysis and interpretation of zzso zzso without manual zzso To address current demands in zzso data zzso the novel platform zzso was zzso zzso automatically accomplishes the tasks necessary for analyzing the composition and functional repertoire of a given microbial community from zzso sequence data by implementing two software zzso zzso the first pipeline consists of three different zzso performing the zzso profiling of zzso sequences and zzso the second functional pipeline accomplishes region predictions on assembled zzso and assigns functional information to predicted coding zzso Moreover, zzso provides tools for statistical and comparative analyses based on the zzso and functional zzso The capabilities of zzso are demonstrated for two zzso zzso obtained from a zzso microbial community of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso web interface is available at zzso
