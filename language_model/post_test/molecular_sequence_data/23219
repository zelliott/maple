The presence of a zzso containing gene sequences for DNA zzso that are not expressed in microbial culture, imposed a degradation in zzso performance in cultures of the host zzso coli zzso zzso decreases in growth rate zzso and biomass yield zzso and a corresponding increase in overflow metabolism were observed in a strain containing a therapeutic sequence (a zzso B zzso under the control of a zzso zzso The observed increase in overflow metabolism was incorporated into a zzso zzso Analysis zzso model (as zzso zzso zzso flux analysis revealed an increase in zzso cycle zzso consistent with an increased zzso rate observed in zzso zzso These effects are thought to result from increased zzso synthesis requirements zzso arising from the expression of the zzso zzso marker gene whose product accounted for zzso of the cell protein of the zzso zzso These factors will zzso significantly higher zzso and agitation rates or lower zzso feed rates in zzso cultures than would be expected for zzso zzso
