zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that can activate zzso from promoters bearing zzso zzso Whereas the zzso region of zzso has been identified within the zzso zzso the location of the specific zzso domain has not been zzso zzso treatment of zzso protein generates a stable zzso zzso that binds with marked specificity to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso located the zzso zzso site to zzso zzso Because the zzso does not contain the zzso zzso site at zzso we conclude that the the zzso zzso domain of zzso spans the central region of the zzso The vast majority of the zzso in zzso derived zzso proteins are located within this central portion of the zzso Such zzso zzso proteins exhibit defective zzso zzso Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins generates zzso patterns that differ from zzso zzso one zzso tested, zzso generates a resistant zzso that zzso with a similar zzso mobility to the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, although intact zzso zzso protein binds to DNA at 20 degrees C, the zzso zzso zzso does zzso In addition, the central zzso zzso binding region of zzso zzso does not demonstrate zzso zzso Thus, although sequences outside of the central region of zzso contribute to both zzso zzso and zzso they are not required for zzso zzso
