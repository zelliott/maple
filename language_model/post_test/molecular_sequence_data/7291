The zzso protein of the influenza A virus zzso both the nuclear export of zzso and zzso zzso Two functional zzso an zzso domain and an zzso domain, have been identified in this zzso Here we demonstrate that the zzso protein exists as a zzso in zzso both in the absence of its zzso target and when it is bound to a specific zzso target, zzso zzso This indicates that it is most likely the zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso also occurs in zzso as zzso using the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the situation in zzso zzso in zzso was zzso by not only the zzso domain but also the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso in zzso involves a cellular protein zzso that bridges more than one zzso protein zzso together via their zzso zzso
