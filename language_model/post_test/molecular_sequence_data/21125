The zzso of zzso zzso contains a gene zzso that is predicted to zzso an zzso zzso protein containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain in the zzso region and a zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso To understand the structural and functional properties of the zzso the zzso gene was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein were grown by the zzso method using zzso ammonium zzso zzso zzso buffer pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso data were collected to zzso resolution using the remote zzso feature of the Advanced Light zzso Lawrence Berkeley National zzso The crystal belonged to the primitive cubic space group zzso or zzso with zzso parameters zzso Assuming the presence of one zzso in the zzso unit gave a Matthews zzso zzso of zzso corresponding to a zzso content of zzso
