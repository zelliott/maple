zzso of the zzso structure greatly benefits from the information related to secondary structure, zzso accessibility, and zzso contacts that stabilize a zzso zzso We address the problem of zzso prediction defined as the prediction of zzso pairings, interaction types zzso or zzso and zzso interactions (or contact zzso We introduce a zzso approach for proteins with six or less zzso in which we model the zzso features in a zzso framework by combining the zzso acid pairing zzso with a zzso knowledge of zzso zzso To select the optimum zzso architecture, we significantly reduce the search space by zzso that enforce the zzso acid pairs with strong interaction zzso In addition, we find the optimum zzso alignment between zzso using dynamic programming in which we allow any number of gaps in an alignment to model zzso more zzso For proteins with more than six zzso we first zzso zzso pairings using the zzso zzso Then, we zzso gapped alignments of the paired zzso and choose the interaction types and zzso pairings with maximum alignment zzso We performed a zzso zzso experiment on the zzso set and obtained significant improvements in the prediction zzso
