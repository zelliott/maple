The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso controls cell functions in response to environmental cues in organisms as diverse as zzso and zzso In the zzso human zzso fungus zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we identified and characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso which functions in parallel with the zzso zzso zzso to control the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the C zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso By molecular and genetic approaches, zzso was shown to play a critical role in mating by regulating cell fusion and zzso growth in a zzso zzso zzso also regulates zzso and capsule production via the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso studies support models in which zzso and zzso are necessary and sufficient components that cooperate to activate zzso zzso Taken together, these studies further define the zzso signaling cascade controlling zzso of this ubiquitous human zzso zzso
