In zzso the transition metals iron and copper play an essential role in zzso electron transport and act as zzso for zzso zzso Iron is essential for zzso zzso and zzso clusters in zzso store iron during zzso development, and iron zzso Thus, zzso zzso of transition metals, in particular of iron, is crucial for zzso as well as plant zzso However, very little is known about iron zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso IN zzso zzso identified in a screen for metal zzso in zzso contains four predicted zzso is targeted to the inner zzso and displays zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso grew only zzso and were characterized by a zzso and zzso zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed severely impaired zzso development and a striking increase in zzso zzso Besides zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed differential regulation of genes and proteins related to iron stress or zzso photosynthesis, and zzso cluster zzso Furthermore, zzso and its zzso zzso zzso iron zzso in an iron zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso functions in iron transport across the inner envelope of zzso and hence in cellular metal zzso
