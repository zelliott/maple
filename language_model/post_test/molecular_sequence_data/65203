The zzso type II extended left-handed zzso structure is well represented in zzso In an effort to determine the zzso role in zzso acid recognition and zzso a survey of 258 zzso zzso protein structures from the zzso Data Bank was zzso zzso indicate that left-handed zzso are commonly found at the zzso acid zzso zzso Three examples are used to illustrate the utility of this structural element as a recognition zzso The third K zzso domain of zzso the zzso nuclear zzso and the zzso paired protein zzso all contain left-handed zzso involved in zzso acid zzso In each structure, these zzso were previously unidentified as left-handed zzso by secondary structure zzso but, rather, were identified as either having small amounts of hydrogen bond patterns to the rest of the protein or as being zzso zzso mechanisms for zzso acid interactions by the extended left-handed zzso include both zzso and specific zzso The observed interactions indicate that this secondary structure zzso an increase in protein backbone exposure for zzso acid zzso Both zzso and zzso atoms are involved in specific and zzso hydrogen bonding to zzso or zzso zzso Our results emphasize the need to zzso the left-handed zzso as a viable zzso acid recognition and binding zzso similar to previously identified motifs such as the zzso zinc fingers, zzso zzso and zzso
