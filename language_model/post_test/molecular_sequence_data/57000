Available genetic information places the mouse zzso gene approximately 5 zzso zzso to zzso on zzso mouse zzso zzso These data have indicated that there is a relevant paucity of genetic markers that map to this region of zzso zzso To increase the density of the genetic map on zzso 4, we have applied the techniques of zzso and zzso of the zzso of mouse zzso zzso A total of 47 zzso from the zzso library were used to type the progeny of three zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting composite genetic map positions seven known zzso 41 zzso and three other anonymous markers to a region of approximately 21 zzso on zzso 4 extending from b to zzso The density of markers in this region of zzso 4 should be sufficient to initiate the physical mapping of this zzso segment, zzso efforts to clone the zzso zzso as well as other zzso zzso zzso in this region of zzso zzso
