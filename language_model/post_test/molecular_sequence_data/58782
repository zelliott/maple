A human zzso zzso cell line, zzso was treated with zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce its differentiation and proliferation zzso A zzso sugar chain zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso was used to detect the activity of zzso on the cell surface by zzso The results show that the activity of zzso on the cell surface increases when the cell is treated with zzso but decreases when it is treated with zzso whereas the activities of the whole cell remain stable during the zzso
