B zzso zzso promoter activity zzso by the zzso motif requires the zzso or zzso protein and additional B zzso zzso One such zzso zzso was recently isolated from human B zzso Here, we describe the isolation and detailed characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso clones were isolated, and the gene structure was zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acids shows zzso sequence identity between mouse and human zzso The zzso 126 zzso acids of zzso are both essential and sufficient for interaction with the zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso This zzso interaction does not require the simultaneous binding of Oct proteins to DNA, and high resolution zzso of the zzso interaction reveals that binding of zzso to zzso or zzso does not alter the interaction with zzso zzso can efficiently activate zzso promoters in zzso however, it fails to stimulate zzso zzso zzso Fusion of zzso of zzso with the zzso DNA binding domain reveals that both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso contribute to full zzso function, the zzso domain is more efficient in this zzso zzso zzso with the failure of full-length zzso to stimulate zzso zzso elements in non B cells, the zzso zzso likewise only stimulate from a zzso zzso
