A full-length copy of a single zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso yellow vein virus zzso has been cloned from an extract of infected zzso zzso originating from zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso component encodes two zzso zzso and zzso and four zzso open reading frames zzso typical of DNA A of zzso zzso from the Eastern zzso A zzso component equivalent to DNA B was not detected in extracts of infected zzso zzso The cloned zzso component produced a systemic infection in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when introduced into plants by zzso and symptoms were identical to those produced by zzso virus introduced into these hosts using zzso zzso However, attempts to re-establish a systemic infection in zzso zzso either by zzso or by zzso transmission of the cloned progeny were zzso suggesting that additional factors are required for infection of the natural zzso The significance of zzso zzso as a zzso host for the economically important zzso diseases is zzso
