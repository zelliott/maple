All zzso animal cells zzso zzso to provide the prosthetic group of respiratory zzso Large amounts of zzso are zzso by zzso cells for zzso production and by liver cells for drug-induced zzso zzso This review focuses on the first zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso step in liver and possibly other zzso We report that there are two distinct human genes for zzso one, a zzso zzso is probably zzso expressed while the other is active only in zzso zzso By contrast it has been reported that, for zzso zzso the third zzso of the zzso pathway, there is a single human gene with two zzso one functional in all zzso the other zzso zzso In liver, zzso of the zzso zzso gene is induced by drugs and zzso by zzso zzso also acts in a novel way to prevent transport of zzso into zzso its site of zzso zzso result from inherited defects in zzso of the zzso zzso subsequent to zzso and the molecular zzso is now known for the most common zzso of acute intermittent zzso In developing red cells, levels of zzso are regulated by increased gene zzso and by a zzso zzso in which iron most probably controls translation of zzso zzso zzso through an zzso element identified in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso The human zzso zzso gene is located on the zzso suggesting that a zzso in this gene may be responsible for zzso zzso zzso
