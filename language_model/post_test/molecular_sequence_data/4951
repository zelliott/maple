The recently discovered second zzso region zzso contains at least two zzso zzso and zzso Recent findings show that, like zzso zzso zzso escapes X zzso and its Y zzso is also zzso but zzso seems to act like an zzso zzso expressed from the active X zzso but not from the inactive X or zzso Here we show that differences are also seen in the evolution of the sex zzso locations of zzso and zzso zzso is known to be zzso in mice, and is zzso only in zzso zzso however, has been found to be on the X zzso in all zzso tested, from zzso to zzso Both genes were duplicated on the Y zzso of the terminal portion of the X zzso during the evolution of Homo sapiens from other higher zzso The zzso pattern of zzso may be correlated with its longer history of X linkage, and at a more zzso zzso position during zzso the more recent X linkage and more zzso position of the zzso gene may explain its zzso zzso zzso zzso
