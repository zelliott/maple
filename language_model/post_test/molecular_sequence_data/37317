zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the liver and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor, stimulates zzso promoter activity in liver cells through the insulin response sequences zzso zzso a zzso zzso factor, is important in the zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso zzso during the zzso cycle and zzso zzso are lowest during the zzso phase and highest in zzso zzso gene studies reveal that zzso stimulates both zzso and human zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso alone has a relatively weak zzso When zzso and zzso are expressed together, promoter activity is markedly zzso which is indicative of zzso A DNA zzso zzso zzso fails to stimulate promoter activity, even in the presence of zzso and deletion or zzso of zzso also zzso the effect of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso the zzso region placed upstream of the 31 base pair zzso minimal promoter is sufficient to mediate effects of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso studies reveal physical association between zzso and zzso These studies show that zzso and zzso interact directly and can function zzso to stimulate zzso promoter activity in zzso cells and perhaps in other zzso
