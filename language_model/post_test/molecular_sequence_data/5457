The zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso A6 was isolated from the zzso by zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed one open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso appears to be divided into two equal zzso The zzso part has the typical characteristics of the well-known zzso family zzso identity with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso identity with the partial sequence available for the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso part displays a fairly unusual zzso It consists of four direct tandem repeated sequences of 104 zzso acids sharing zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso gene of zzso zzso was also zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso acid protein was zzso Perfect zzso between the two zzso genes was observed in the zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso zzso zzso also included tandem repeat units but striking differences were zzso zzso the addition of one repeat unit; zzso a zzso 91 zzso acid repetition zzso These structural zzso suggest that both genes have a common zzso and may have evolved independently by zzso with subsequent zzso and zzso
