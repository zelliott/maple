zzso in zzso are associated with dominant zzso zzso zzso This gene is highly expressed in the zzso and is zzso through zzso Here we report the zzso organization of the mouse zzso of zzso and its zzso and spatial zzso A significant amount of zzso zzso expression is detected in the adult zzso brain, skin, zzso and zzso During development, expression is first noted at embryonic day 7 zzso A significant level of the zzso is observed both in brain and in eyes at zzso day 1 zzso after which levels decrease in the brain and increase in the zzso until they stabilize at zzso zzso protein is evident in the zzso zzso by zzso and becomes restricted predominantly to the zzso layer in the mature zzso These observations suggest that zzso may play an important role in embryonic development and in maintaining normal physiology of zzso and brain at later stages of zzso
