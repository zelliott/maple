The zzso family of zzso plays key roles in the regulation of cell zzso and zzso They also regulate protein zzso zzso gene zzso and cell cycle zzso This zzso of roles requires that the zzso zzso interact with a wide variety of downstream zzso zzso An understanding of their functions at a molecular level therefore requires the identification of the entire set of such zzso zzso this end, we performed a zzso screen using the zzso zzso as bait and identified a family of putative zzso proteins related to zzso a zzso zzso and zzso cell protein of 55 zzso We have named this family the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Complete open reading frames have been obtained for zzso through zzso We renamed zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind both zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso bound only to zzso An intact zzso zzso zzso interactive zzso domain was required for zzso No interaction of the zzso with zzso or zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was mostly zzso when expressed zzso in zzso zzso cells, with some zzso in membrane zzso The zzso induced by zzso was reminiscent of that caused by an zzso of zzso function and was reversed by zzso of zzso Surprisingly, it was independent of the ability to bind zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso activity by a mechanism that was independent of zzso zzso zzso expression caused substantial delays in the spreading of cells on zzso surfaces after zzso and the spread cells lacked stress zzso We propose that the zzso proteins function as negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso
