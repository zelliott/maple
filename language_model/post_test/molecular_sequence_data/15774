The sequence of the sense strand of zzso segment 5 of both Australian and South African zzso virus zzso zzso 1 has been determined and found to be 1771 and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both coding sequences of zzso zzso were flanked by a zzso zzso sequence of 34 zzso and 3' zzso regions of 78 and 80 zzso zzso The zzso zzso at zzso zzso were assumed to initiate the synthesis of zzso or zzso zzso proteins which had calculated net charges of zzso or zzso at neutral zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins had a very high zzso ratio of zzso zzso A variable region of approximately 45 zzso at the zzso of zzso segment 5 of South African and Australian zzso and the zzso segment 6 of the North American zzso was shown to be unusually rich in A + T zzso zzso zzso compared with other zzso gene segments so far zzso which have between 52 and zzso A + zzso These regions were thought to be responsible for the variable migration of zzso 5 segments on zzso in zzso gels in the presence of zzso This zzso in the apparent molecular weight of zzso 5 segments was not restricted to zzso amongst Australian zzso tested, nor was the apparent molecular weight for zzso 5 identical for different zzso of the same zzso zzso indicating that this A + T rich region was highly zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso acid sequence divergence of the Australian and South African zzso zzso segments 5 to that for the North American zzso zzso segment 6 (which codes for zzso revealed the same relationships as those found for the core protein zzso gene zzso in that although all zzso proteins were very similar in their zzso acid zzso their genes were more zzso The Australian zzso sequence differed from both the South African and North American genes by zzso at the zzso level, whereas the North American and South African sequences zzso by only zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso segment 5 DNA zzso were capable of zzso the geographical origin of a zzso zzso as had been observed for zzso zzso however, other zzso were also generated which were capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso from other zzso zzso
