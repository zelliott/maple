This report describes the preparation of a library of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso characterization of the zzso by liquid secondary zzso mass zzso and investigation of their reactions with zzso bovine serum zzso by zzso binding zzso The results, together with additional binding studies using zzso derived from zzso complex type zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso or their zzso products, have shown that the combining specificity of zzso includes structures not only on high zzso zzso but also on zzso and zzso zzso With high zzso zzso there is increased zzso from the zzso to the zzso structures, indicating a preference for the terminal Man alpha 1-2 zzso With zzso and zzso zzso the requirements for binding are the presence of zzso terminal zzso or zzso zzso but the presence of a zzso zzso zzso may inhibit zzso From these results it is deduced that the zzso of zzso with the complement zzso zzso rather than the intact zzso zzso is due to the zzso accessibility rendered by zzso in the complement zzso
