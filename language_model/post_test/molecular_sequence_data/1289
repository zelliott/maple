zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso Its kinetic zzso for zzso were measured equal to 2 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso search and zzso acid sequence alignments revealed low zzso to other zzso acid zzso zzso Threading methodology, zzso modeling and zzso analysis resulted in certain conclusions concerning the structure of zzso zzso and led to the prediction of a binding pocket that provides favorable conditions of accommodating zzso charged aromatic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Eleven commercial textile zzso and four zzso zzso or zzso bearing a zzso as their terminal zzso zzso immobilized on zzso zzso zzso The resulted zzso of affinity zzso was screened for binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso All but zzso Blue zzso zzso affinity zzso were able to bind zzso at pH zzso One immobilized zzso bearing as its terminal zzso zzso zzso acid zzso displayed the higher affinity for zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner with a Ki of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso interaction does not involve the zzso zzso zzso equilibrium data, obtained from a batch system with zzso zzso corresponded well to the zzso zzso with a rate constant k of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso was further studied with regards to zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained were exploited in the development of a facile zzso protocol for zzso which led to zzso zzso in a single step with high zzso recovery zzso The present zzso procedure is the most efficient reported so far for zzso zzso
