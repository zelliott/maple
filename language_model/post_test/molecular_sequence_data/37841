The zzso crystal structure of human zzso has been extended to zzso A resolution, using zzso data recorded at zzso degrees C zzso zzso zzso free r zzso zzso zzso confirm that the zzso is zzso attached to the protein via two zzso linkages between the zzso groups of zzso and zzso and modified zzso groups on zzso rings A and C of the zzso as well as a zzso zzso linkage between the sulfur atom of zzso and the zzso of the vinyl group on zzso ring zzso In the native zzso a bound zzso zzso has been identified at the zzso zzso of the zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso crystal structure of a zzso complex zzso zzso zzso free r zzso zzso has shown that this zzso zzso can be replaced by zzso zzso is also seen to zzso at partial occupancy, in the zzso zzso zzso in close proximity to the zzso zzso where it replaces the water zzso hydrogen bonded to zzso The zzso site in the zzso cavity appears to be the zzso site responsible for shifts in the zzso band of the zzso spectrum of zzso It is proposed that zzso binding to this site zzso the zzso by effectively competing with zzso for access to the zzso zzso whereas in compound I, the same site may be the zzso zzso zzso
