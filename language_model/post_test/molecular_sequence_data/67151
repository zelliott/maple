The zzso zzso comprise a large and diverse group of biologically active peptides and are widely distributed in zzso ducts of all major feeding types of zzso Six novel zzso peptides from the two zzso cone snail species of zzso zzso zzso zzso native to zzso were identified and determined to share a common signal sequence as well as a zzso arrangement of zzso zzso zzso The predicted mature peptides consist of 11-15 zzso acids zzso zzso analyses of new zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in present study and published zzso zzso sequences from the other zzso species was systematically zzso zzso trees, zzso zzso to view evolutionary relationships of the zzso zzso zzso and mature toxin regions were zzso as well as zzso frequency component and zzso zzso zzso zzso divergence of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso exhibited high zzso whereas the sequences of the mature peptides ranged from high similarity to high divergence between zzso and zzso zzso diversity of zzso region was also high with intermediate percent divergence between that observed in signal and zzso Consensus zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala, zzso and Pro of signal regions were abundant, whereas among zzso basic zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso frequency components were zzso in mature toxin region except for highly conservative zzso frame zzso The zzso zzso have been previously found mainly in zzso and zzso cone zzso The newly identified six zzso peptides described in this investigation exemplify the first to be found from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the six toxins will facilitate a better understanding of the relationship between structure and function as well as provide a framework for their further research and zzso
