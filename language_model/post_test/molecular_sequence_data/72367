zzso function mainly in the zzso degradation of proteins that have been zzso with zzso To demonstrate the zzso of zzso in plants, we conducted an zzso zzso experiment with a crude extract of rice cultured zzso The results indicated that the C2 zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso in cultured zzso An zzso zzso zzso and analysis of zzso acids revealed that the C2 zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso protein zzso the activity of which is inhibited by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso II from zzso was also able to zzso the C2 zzso These results suggest that the C2 zzso in rice is probably zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our demonstration of the zzso of zzso in plants suggests that zzso might be involved in the general regulation of the functions of zzso
