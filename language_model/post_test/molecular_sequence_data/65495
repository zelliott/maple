zzso in zzso zzso 1 zzso a nuclear gene zzso a zzso zzso is the most common cause for zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso The condition is characterized by gradual loss of vision, color vision zzso and zzso zzso zzso To understand the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso cause zzso zzso and to facilitate the development of an effective therapeutic agent for zzso zzso we analyzed zzso in the developing and adult zzso eyes produced by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso by a zzso or zzso insertions causes no zzso eye zzso whereas the zzso zzso results in embryonic zzso Using powerful zzso genetic techniques, we created zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the eyes caused rough zzso and glossy zzso lens and zzso zzso eye zzso in adult zzso this zzso was zzso by precise zzso of the inserted zzso Furthermore, we show the rough eye zzso is caused by the loss of zzso lattice cells in developing eyes, suggesting an increase in lattice cell zzso In adult flies, the zzso zzso caused an increase in zzso oxygen species zzso production as well as zzso fragmentation associated with loss and damage of the cone and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso 1 zzso Vitamin zzso and genetically zzso human zzso zzso is able to reverse the glossy eye zzso of zzso zzso large zzso further suggesting that zzso play an important role in cone and zzso cell zzso Our results show zzso zzso cause cell loss by two distinct zzso zzso This study provides novel insights into the zzso of zzso zzso and demonstrates the promise of antioxidants as therapeutic agents for this zzso
