zzso is essential for zzso sexual reproduction and important for genetic diversity among zzso Although a number of genes regulating zzso zzso pairing and zzso have been identified in the plant kingdom, their molecular basis remains poorly zzso In this study, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IN zzso zzso zzso required for zzso zzso pairing and zzso in zzso Two independent zzso designated zzso and zzso were identified in our zzso zzso zzso library which could not form zzso due to failure of zzso zzso pairing and zzso at zzso resulting in zzso in both male and female zzso zzso of zzso by zzso produced similar results to the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein that contains putative zzso zzso but does not have any close zzso in other zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso especially in zzso mother cells and the zzso zzso during zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso pairing and zzso in zzso
