zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso responses of the liver, changes its zzso zzso depending on the zzso status of the zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso fused to the green fluorescent protein zzso concentrated in the nucleus of cultured rat zzso at low zzso and zzso to the zzso at high zzso Three zzso forms of zzso zzso with reduced affinity for zzso regulatory protein zzso did not concentrate in the zzso zzso even at low zzso In zzso and zzso cells, a blue fluorescent protein zzso version of rat liver zzso was only able to accumulate in the nucleus when it was zzso with zzso At low zzso both proteins concentrated in the nuclear compartment and at high zzso zzso zzso to the zzso while zzso remained in the zzso These findings indicate that the presence of and binding to zzso are necessary and sufficient for the proper zzso zzso of zzso and directly involve zzso in the control of the zzso zzso zzso
