zzso profiles of the zzso community zzso and potential activity of zzso bacteria zzso were investigated in the zzso of Lake zzso zzso samples were obtained from two sites at different water zzso The abundance of zzso was assessed as the copy number of the zzso gene zzso the alpha zzso of particulate methane zzso measured with quantitative real-time zzso zzso of the zzso gene peaked in the 5-8 zzso layer of the zzso from both zzso zzso community composition was investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The band patterns observed in zzso did not significantly differ with zzso depths or sampling zzso zzso analysis of the zzso bands indicated the dominance of the zzso zzso Potential activity, which was measured in the presence of sufficient amounts of methane and zzso decreased zzso from the zzso surface to deeper zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene copy number cannot be regarded as an indicator of zzso zzso that retain potential activity in zzso
