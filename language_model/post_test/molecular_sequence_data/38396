zzso type 2 zzso is an zzso dominant disease that causes a predisposition to nervous system zzso zzso point zzso have been found in about zzso of zzso patients, and large zzso deletions account for approximately zzso of zzso gene zzso The majority of these deletions are larger than 50 zzso with a zzso usually lying outside the zzso zzso We identified two cases of zzso deletion with loss of zzso and 40 zzso zzso In both cases, one boundary of the deletion was located in or at the proximity of an zzso sequence in zzso zzso zzso No sequence identity longer than 5 bases and no signal of specific zzso have been evidenced on either side of the deletion zzso These observations are compatible with a zzso zzso being responsible for the zzso zzso In a third case, a zzso inversion of zzso 22 was zzso This zzso zzso breaks the zzso gene in two parts and carries the first zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso in position of the deletions and the observation of a new zzso zzso in the zzso gene underscore the importance of FISH analysis in the molecular diagnosis of zzso
