We report the isolation and characterization of zzso a novel zzso human zzso zzso The zzso zzso was cloned by differential screening of a zzso library derived from the liver of a patient with adult zzso zzso zzso a rare form of zzso with presumed viral zzso In zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso is an integral membrane zzso and zzso experiments using zzso zzso demonstrate that the protein is localized to the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from multiple human zzso reveals a single zzso zzso transcript with a size of approximately zzso zzso studies using rabbit zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso demonstrate that the protein is zzso expressed by zzso cells in many human zzso In normal zzso zzso is consistently present in zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso show little or no zzso In contrast, zzso of patients with zzso display strong zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein are expressed in highly differentiated zzso zzso cells after infection with zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso represents a novel, zzso zzso integral membrane zzso protein that can be zzso in response to viral zzso
