The skin functions as more than a physical barrier to zzso zzso cells of the skin can zzso zzso zzso including zzso which exhibit direct zzso zzso Here we characterize the expression pattern, genetic variation and activity of the major zzso expressed in canine skin, canine zzso 103 zzso The gene zzso zzso exhibits two forms of zzso a common zzso deletion zzso and a gene zzso zzso Golden retrievers and Labrador retrievers were the only breeds that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso termed zzso Both these breeds also exhibited a zzso gene zzso zzso that ranged from 2 to 4 zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the human zzso human zzso 3 zzso and zzso showed potent and comparable zzso killing against both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso biopsy specimens from dogs with zzso zzso revealed zzso expression levels similar to those in healthy controls and comparable at zzso and zzso zzso This expression pattern in dogs differs from the previously reported reduced expression of the human zzso in zzso zzso Overall, the similarities of zzso and its human zzso reported here support the notion that the domestic dog may serve as a valuable model for studying zzso biology in the zzso
