The zzso zzso zzso zzso factor has been implicated in zzso gene regulation and in zzso zzso Using zzso screening methods, we identified two additional zzso zzso from a mouse embryonic zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso define a family of zzso factors that share structural similarities and zzso zzso Although these zzso genes are expressed within zzso zzso in an identical pattern, they exhibit different patterns of expression in the developing nervous zzso Although zzso zzso is present in several zzso in addition to zzso zzso and developing zzso zzso and zzso are expressed at high levels only in zzso zzso In zzso zzso animals, the presence of two additional zzso family members in zzso zzso may provide zzso and allow normal zzso zzso Further, the identification of the zzso family of zzso zzso factors and their embryonic expression patterns suggest that the zzso proteins may have a more general function in zzso zzso
