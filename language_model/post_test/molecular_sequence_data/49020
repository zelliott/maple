zzso remains a human disease of global significance and a major cause of high infant mortality in endemic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cause the disease by degrading human zzso as a source of zzso acids for their growth and zzso zzso degradation is initiated by zzso zzso termed zzso with a zzso at the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso II is one of the four zzso active zzso that has been identified in the food zzso of zzso zzso Novel crystal structures of zzso zzso II as well as the complex with a potent inhibitor have been refined with data extending to resolution limits of zzso and zzso and to R factors of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso belongs to a family of potent zzso zzso that have large zzso zzso Such zzso could not be modeled into the binding cavity of the structure of zzso II in complex with zzso zzso Our structures reveal that the binding cavities of the new complex and zzso zzso II are considerably more open than that of the zzso A complex, allowing for larger zzso groups in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso II zzso in space group zzso with one zzso in the zzso zzso The structures show extensive interlocking of zzso around the zzso axis of zzso with areas in excess of zzso buried at the zzso and a loop of one zzso interacting with the binding cavity of the zzso related zzso zzso density for this loop is only fully ordered in the zzso zzso
