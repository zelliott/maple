zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have proven to be useful for imaging zzso flux in zzso zzso However, the dynamic range of the original sensor was limited and thus it did not appear optimal for high zzso screening of zzso populations for identifying proteins involved in regulation of sugar zzso Here we describe a hybrid approach that combines zzso with zzso to decrease the degrees of freedom for zzso positioning leading to improved zzso zzso We were able to develop a novel highly sensitive zzso zzso that shows a zzso higher ratio change and dynamic range zzso zzso in zzso permitting analyses in the zzso relevant zzso As a proof of concept that this sensor can be used to screen for proteins playing a role in sugar flux and its control, we used zzso zzso of zzso family members and show that zzso is the major zzso zzso in zzso cells and that zzso contributes as well, however to a lower zzso zzso zzso suggest that zzso and 9 are zzso localized to the plasma membrane and thus can account for the transport zzso The improved sensitivity of the novel zzso zzso increases the reliability of in zzso zzso flux zzso and provides a new means for the screening of zzso collections as well as drugs using zzso zzso
