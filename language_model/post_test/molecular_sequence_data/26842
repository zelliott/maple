zzso zzso is an opportunistic pathogen that displays a remarkably high resistance to zzso zzso We zzso that high resistance to zzso peptides in these bacteria is because of the barrier properties of the outer zzso Here we report the identification of genes for the zzso of the core zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We constructed a panel of zzso zzso with truncated core zzso that facilitated functional gene assignments and the zzso of the core zzso structure in the zzso strain zzso The core zzso structure consists of three zzso in the inner core region, zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso linked to zzso zzso Also, zzso is linked to zzso I, whereas zzso II carries a second zzso and a terminal zzso which is the site of attachment of the O zzso We established that the level of core zzso in the zzso was zzso to their increased in zzso sensitivity to zzso B zzso zzso zzso using fluorescent zzso zzso demonstrated a correlation between sensitivity and increased binding of zzso to intact zzso Also, the zzso producing a zzso core zzso did not survive in zzso as compared with the parental zzso zzso Together, our results demonstrate that a complete core zzso is required for full zzso resistance in zzso zzso and that resistance is due, at least in part, to the ability of zzso zzso to prevent binding of the zzso to the bacterial cell zzso
