zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso an zzso family member, is suggested to have various functions in zzso including serving as the regulatory zzso for the zzso zzso in the zzso and acting as a motor component of the protein zzso at the zzso Indeed, although zzso is a soluble zzso zzso a portion of it is associated with the inner envelope zzso The mechanism and functional significance of this zzso membrane association have not been zzso Here, we mapped the region important for zzso membrane association by creating various deletion zzso and found that only the construct with the zzso domain deleted, zzso had reduced membrane zzso When transformed into zzso zzso zzso most zzso proteins did not associate with zzso and zzso failed to complement the zzso and protein zzso zzso of an zzso knockout zzso The residual zzso at the zzso had further reduced association with the central protein zzso component zzso However, the degradation of zzso zzso zzso a potential zzso for the zzso zzso was not affected in the zzso zzso or in the zzso transgenic zzso zzso also had the same zzso activity as that of full-length zzso These data suggest that the association of zzso with the inner envelope membrane through its zzso domain is important for the functions of zzso in zzso
