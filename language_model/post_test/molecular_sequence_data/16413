zzso catalyze the transfer of the zzso groups of zzso to specific zzso groups of several classes of zzso zzso Of the several zzso clones isolated from a zzso zzso library, zzso encodes the zzso of partially zzso zzso The zzso protein of another zzso zzso which differs from zzso by a single zzso acid zzso zzso exhibits no zzso activity towards any of the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of zzso zzso in zzso with either Ala, zzso zzso or zzso almost abolished zzso zzso In contrast with zzso no zzso labeling could be achieved using zzso with the zzso zzso proteins indicating that zzso zzso is also required for zzso zzso These results are zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ruled out any significant zzso differences in the secondary structures of both zzso and zzso Modeling zzso on the structure of zzso zzso indicates that zzso zzso is greater than 10 A from any of the zzso of the active site or the zzso binding site of zzso At the same time, zzso 282 to 290 are zzso in most of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso form a large part of the zzso zzso and at least five of these zzso are within 4 A of the opposing zzso It would appear, therefore, that zzso in zzso exert their influence by altering the contacts between the zzso and that these contacts are necessary for maintaining the zzso of the zzso binding site and active site of this group of zzso
