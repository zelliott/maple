The zzso family of zzso are essential for the control of zzso microbes but are also responsible for devastating zzso zzso zzso tight regulation of inflammatory processes is essential for maintaining zzso In zzso zzso beta zzso is primarily regulated at two levels, zzso and zzso The main zzso for processing zzso is the zzso a zzso complex that forms in the zzso and which results in the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso 1) and the subsequent zzso and zzso of active zzso Although zzso zzso zzso of zzso and inflammatory zzso the processing of zzso by activated zzso has never been zzso Here, we demonstrate that in response to infection with the zzso bacterial pathogen zzso zzso primary zzso from adult zzso display zzso activity that results in zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 or zzso zzso considerably abrogates zzso zzso As in zzso this processing event is concurrent with the zzso of zzso zzso into the culture zzso Furthermore, two putative zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B, are both able to cleave zzso but with different zzso These results represent the first demonstration of processing and zzso of zzso zzso in response to a zzso contributing to our understanding of the evolutionary processes governing the regulation of zzso
