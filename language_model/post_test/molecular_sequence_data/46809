We determined the zzso sequence of the entire zzso insert contained in zzso zzso clone zzso This human zzso segment was derived from zzso zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso We compared this segment, in terms of structure, with a previously characterized zzso sequence in zzso zzso that had come from a portion of human zzso zzso corresponding to an zzso zzso The two segments were significantly different with respect to the frequency of zzso units, the types and numbers of repetitive elements present, their zzso content, and the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content, and zzso islands all showed positive correlations with the abundance of zzso but the distribution of zzso did zzso These observations might reflect an influence of the first three of these features on the functions or expression of genes in the respective zzso In addition to a novel gene zzso lying at the zzso end of the zzso segment, we found a cluster of zzso genes within a small section (about 400 zzso on the zzso side of zzso This cluster consisted of four apparently unrelated zzso and two zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and a novel gene zzso named zzso Our characterization of the two zzso regions provided evidence that genes are not evenly distributed throughout the human zzso and that gene richness is correlated with the zzso content and with the frequency of either zzso elements or zzso zzso
