The zzso human virus zzso virus type 2 zzso has evolved the potentially unique strategy to establish zzso by zzso zzso its zzso into human zzso 19 zzso at a locus designated zzso This zzso zzso zzso of viral DNA with the human zzso provides a basis for developing targeted gene therapy zzso To assess whether the region surrounding zzso might have contributed to the selection of the specific integration site, we have investigated this zzso Here, we show that zzso is closely linked to the slow skeletal zzso T zzso zzso which has been mapped previously to zzso In support of this idea, we demonstrate that zzso zzso DNA integration can result in the formation of zzso zzso The question now arises whether muscle represents a natural target tissue for zzso zzso zzso This possibility is of additional interest in view of recent observations that muscle tissue is particularly well suited for zzso gene zzso The question also occurs whether zzso infection by zzso can lead to zzso changes of the zzso muscle fiber zzso
