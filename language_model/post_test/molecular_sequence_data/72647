Human zzso zzso is a zzso virus detected in peripheral blood zzso cells and in zzso but no reliable link between this agent and a disease has been demonstrated so zzso Starting from a 186 zzso described zzso we used an inverse zzso chain reaction to clone and sequence the adjacent sequences of this known zzso A zzso zzso containing two zzso was characterized and its sequence was compared with those of two other zzso human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso With respect to the first ORF, zzso identity was estimated to be zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso In contrast, only a weak zzso between zzso and the two other zzso was demonstrated for the second zzso The newly characterized zzso zzso was used to define a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicate that this region is highly zzso among zzso zzso
