Because zzso zzso have been observed in zzso the potential ability to produce cellulose degrading zzso was examined in the zzso zzso zzso zzso an important zzso of decayed plant zzso zzso fragments zzso portions of two novel zzso zzso acid sequences were amplified by zzso and the zzso acid sequences predicted were affiliated to zzso from other zzso where they cluster with zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso reveals the zzso to be the primary site of gene expression and provides direct evidence of the zzso origin of zzso in zzso zzso Conservation of zzso important zzso acid zzso suggests that both sequences translate into functional zzso zzso activity was detected in zzso extract after separation by zzso which included zzso as zzso This is the first evidence of zzso zzso in zzso crustaceans and gives strong support for the involvement of zzso zzso in the degradation of cellulose in their zzso
