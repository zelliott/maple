zzso are zzso proteins found in some wild zzso of the common zzso zzso zzso They are grouped in six zzso zzso and zzso is the zzso with the highest zzso effect on the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the protein and its genes resulted in the identification of three zzso and the isolation of two genes that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe a new zzso zzso The protein it encodes has zzso zzso acid identity with the derived zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed in developing seeds and at a much lower level in zzso Data obtained by a combination of two-dimensional gel zzso protein sequencing and zzso mass zzso analysis support the conclusion that zzso encodes a zzso present in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso three zzso containing zzso zzso were zzso by increasing the salt zzso The three zzso contain various amounts of the three zzso zzso and inhibit the growth of zzso zzso larvae zzso suggesting differences in zzso activity among the zzso zzso
