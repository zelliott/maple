Major bacterial small zzso zzso regulate the translation and stability of target zzso through base pairing with the help of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso consist of three basic zzso zzso zzso region, zzso site, and zzso zzso Although the zzso region and the zzso are well documented in many zzso the zzso site is less zzso except that zzso binds zzso with a preference for zzso zzso Here, we performed zzso and zzso studies to define the zzso site required for zzso action using zzso as a model zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso tail eliminates the ability of zzso to bind to zzso and to silence zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso can be replaced with any foreign zzso zzso possessing a zzso tail longer than 8 without losing the ability to silence zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso the zzso zzso tail of several other zzso also eliminates the ability to bind to zzso and to regulate target zzso We conclude that the zzso tail of zzso is essential for zzso action in zzso The data also indicate that the zzso zzso tail plays a role in zzso stabilization of zzso
