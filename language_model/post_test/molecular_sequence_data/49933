We describe the first complete zzso zzso sequence from a representative of the insect order zzso the flour zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso long zzso zzso zzso encodes 13 putative zzso two zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso for animal zzso zzso Their arrangement is identical to that in zzso zzso which is considered ancestral for insects and crustaceans zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso usage fall within the range of values observed in other insect zzso zzso Most notable features are the use of zzso as zzso zzso instead of zzso which is used in most other zzso species, and the relative zzso of special sequence motifs in the zzso zzso long control zzso zzso analysis confirmed resolving power in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso regarding diversification events, which zzso the emergence of zzso insects, while little resolution was obtained at the level of zzso zzso zzso The partition of faster evolving zzso acid sites zzso strong support for joining zzso with zzso which is consistent with a zzso zzso
