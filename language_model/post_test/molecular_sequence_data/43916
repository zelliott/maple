zzso specific zzso were used to amplify zzso zzso genes from a representative strain from each of the 23 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and 8 strains from 6 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Only regions of extreme zzso which had been identified on the basis of zzso search of all the zzso zzso sequences available in zzso database, were zzso from the amplified zzso zzso zzso that had the potential to distinguish zzso zzso from zzso zzso species were designed from the derived sequences and a sensitive zzso protocol zzso The zzso method enabled the differentiation of the 59 strains of the 23 zzso of zzso zzso from the 8 strains of 6 zzso of zzso zzso Further investigation by zzso zzso sequencing of two strains of zzso zzso which gave unexpected zzso results, provided evidence that they had been zzso and hence we propose to zzso them to zzso zzso
