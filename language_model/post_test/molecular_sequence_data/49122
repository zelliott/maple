zzso of spectral sensitivities, visual zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences have indicated that all butterfly eyes contain zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some species also contain a fourth or fifth type, related in zzso acid sequence to zzso insect zzso but red shifted in zzso By combining electron zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso we found that the compound eye of Vanessa zzso has the typical zzso features of the butterfly zzso but contains only the three common insect zzso We estimated zzso values and relative zzso of the zzso in the Vanessa zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and calculations based on a zzso model of zzso zzso We isolated three zzso zzso fragments that were identified with zzso zzso and zzso by zzso to the zzso insect zzso zzso The retinal mosaic was mapped by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and found to contain three kinds of zzso with respect to their patterns of short wavelength zzso zzso In some zzso zzso or zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso opposed zzso zzso in others, one cell expressed zzso whereas its complement expressed zzso zzso was expressed in the other seven cells of all zzso zzso cells were abundant in the zzso zzso but nearly absent zzso Our results indicated that there are major differences between the color vision systems of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso Vanessa has a zzso zzso system than do the zzso zzso that have been zzso
