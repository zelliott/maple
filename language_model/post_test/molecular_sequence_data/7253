zzso zzso is thought to play an important role in the evolution of zzso plasmids in bacteria, including the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso A mechanism for zzso and zzso zzso between large zzso plasmids was identified in zzso strain zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso (called zzso was found to form stable zzso with the large zzso zzso in the zzso strain zzso Two closely related zzso sites were identified on these plasmids at which zzso occurred to form zzso The sites zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso were cloned and studies with them showed that the zzso at these sites occurs by a new zzso The site zzso (27 zzso is deleted and zzso zzso zzso is duplicated during zzso The data show that zzso zzso contributes the site for zzso and that the zzso zzso the zzso involved in zzso are zzso on either zzso or the zzso zzso
