zzso of the most prominent spots which are visible on two-dimensional zzso protein gels of zzso zzso crude extracts were selected as marker spots for the construction of a zzso protein zzso zzso sequencing of the corresponding proteins resulted in the identification of zzso involved in zzso zzso cycle, zzso zzso cycle, zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using computer analysis of the zzso protein gels, most of these zzso zzso were found to be zzso at a reduced rate after different stresses and zzso zzso Such an approach permits a rapid and global evaluation of the regulation of different branches of metabolism in response to various zzso zzso
