A small zzso open reading frame in the zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative membrane protein of 62 zzso zzso To determine the function of this reading frame we have constructed a knockout zzso for targeted disruption of zzso This zzso was introduced into the tobacco zzso zzso by zzso transformation to replace the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knockout plants displayed no zzso under normal growth zzso However, under low light conditions, their growth rate was significantly reduced as compared with the zzso due to a lowered efficiency of the light reaction of zzso We show that this zzso is caused by the zzso in a zzso complex of the zzso antenna of zzso II and hence by a reduced efficiency of zzso capture when light availability is zzso Our results indicate that, in contrast to the current view, zzso complexes do not only consist of the classical zzso zzso but may contain small structural zzso in zzso These zzso appear to be crucial architectural factors for the assembly and/or maintenance of stable zzso zzso
