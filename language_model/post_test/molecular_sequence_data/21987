zzso binding proteins zzso are zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso zzso Thus, they are potential players in the control of several zzso important zzso including zzso zzso and neural tube and limb zzso We have cloned the avian zzso of zzso and zzso and examined their expression pattern by zzso in zzso zzso between zzso and Hamilton zzso stages 3 and zzso Both zzso genes show similar expression patterns during embryonic development, and both are detected from zzso stage 3 in the developing central nervous system, by zzso stage 7 in the zzso zzso and later in the limb zzso In most places, zzso and zzso are expressed in overlapping zzso However, there are interesting zzso and/or zzso expression patterns that are specific to each zzso zzso For instance, zzso is predominantly expressed in the zzso whereas zzso is in the primitive streak at zzso stage zzso However, by zzso stage 4, both genes are found in the primitive streak and in the zzso Similarly, although both genes display similar expression patterns in early zzso in mature zzso zzso transcripts are located in zzso cells, whereas zzso transcripts are observed in zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso neural crest cells express zzso whereas zzso root zzso express zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso may be functionally redundant in some zzso and have unique functions in other zzso
