We have succeeded in the cloning of alkaline zzso zzso zzso from moderate zzso zzso zzso zzso A deduced zzso acid sequence showed a high ratio of zzso to basic zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso The gene product was efficiently expressed in zzso coli zzso Star zzso zzso but in an inactive zzso The zzso zzso zzso was separated into four zzso by gel zzso When they were zzso against 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso buffer containing 3 M zzso one of these four zzso was activated to almost full zzso This fraction contained a folding intermediate that was converted to the native structure by the zzso Among the additional zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso was effective, suggesting the importance of Na zzso
