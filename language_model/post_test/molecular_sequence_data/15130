To identify pertinent zzso associated with zzso resistance to zzso the entire coding sequence of the zzso sodium channel gene zzso was zzso and analyzed from a zzso strain with zzso resistance to zzso and two susceptible strains of Aedes zzso The longest transcript, a zzso open reading frame, encodes zzso zzso acid zzso with an estimated molecular mass of zzso A total of 33 zzso were found in the zzso gene over zzso of zzso zzso Three previously zzso optional zzso were zzso The first two zzso m and zzso were located within the zzso domain zzso and the third, zzso was found within the zzso zzso The two mutually exclusive zzso d and zzso were the only alternative zzso in all the zzso clones zzso in this zzso The most distinct finding was a novel zzso acid substitution zzso zzso located within the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso which is concurrent with the known zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso The high frequency and coexistence of the two zzso in the zzso strain suggest that they might exert a synergistic effect to provide the zzso resistance to zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso DNA data from the same individual mosquitoes have demonstrated that zzso editing was not involved in zzso acid zzso of the zzso zzso
