The zzso region zzso of the group 2 coronavirus mouse zzso virus zzso zzso contains a predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to create the zzso stem zzso is mutually exclusive with formation of stem zzso at the base of the zzso zzso as a result, the two structures cannot be present zzso zzso we use zzso methods to evaluate the ability of individual zzso of the 3' zzso to adopt a zzso zzso We find that an zzso capable of forming only the predicted zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso adopts the zzso zzso with little evidence for zzso pairing in zzso M zzso and the absence of zzso as zzso or 1 M zzso is added, a new zzso unfolding transition is induced and zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso is only marginally stable, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso and unfolded at zzso Similar findings characterize an zzso zzso extended through the zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso capable of forming either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso forms no zzso zzso zzso unfolding simulations are fully consistent with these experimental zzso These data reveal that the zzso forms zzso and only when the competing zzso structure cannot zzso in the zzso zzso the double hairpin is the zzso zzso under all solution zzso
