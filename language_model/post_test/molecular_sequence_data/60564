It is well established that the zzso influences the development of adjacent neural and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the differentiation of the zzso zzso has been zzso However, our knowledge of the signals involved in pancreatic development is still zzso In order to identify proteins potentially implicated during pancreatic zzso we raised and characterized zzso zzso against previously established embryonic pancreatic zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso Using the zzso zzso the cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The predicted sequence for zzso zzso is the rat zzso of zzso zzso reported as a protein expressed on zzso cells of the chicken zzso of zzso BEN is expressed in a variety of zzso during development and described as a marker for the developing central and peripheral chicken nervous zzso A role has been suggested for BEN in the zzso of stem cells and zzso cells to the zzso tissue zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso initially expressed exclusively in the zzso during the early development of zzso is implicated in pancreatic zzso We show that zzso zzso regulates the pancreatic zzso cell growth through the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso zzso is able to regulate the expression of the zzso factor zzso required for insulin gene zzso in embryonic zzso organ zzso
