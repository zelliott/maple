The zzso class zzso has been variously divided into two to seven zzso Previous molecular zzso analyses of the class have had limited zzso sampling or have focused on particular zzso Despite these limitations zzso groups have been identified at different zzso zzso To investigate the zzso of the zzso a multiple alignment containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene portions was analyzed according to zzso zzso maximum likelihood, minimum evolution and maximum zzso zzso This zzso approach allowed robust resolution of evolutionary relationships within zzso and the proposal of a zzso revision within the zzso The best statistically supported tree either zzso confirmed that several zzso at different zzso levels were zzso Ten zzso were formally proposed for species of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso zzso were zzso as zzso zzso Four major zzso received strong statistical zzso These zzso most of the studied zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not included in the zzso zzso zzso was excluded from zzso and placed zzso zzso
