zzso zzso signaling in zzso controls patterning and differentiation of a broad range of zzso during zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso maintaining active repression of the zzso in the absence of zzso limiting excess diffusion of zzso and providing an efficient negative feedback mechanism for zzso the responsiveness of receiving zzso Two distinct zzso genes have been isolated from several zzso Here, we describe the cloning of a second zzso gene from chick zzso We show that zzso and zzso are both zzso at sites of active zzso signaling but that the expression patterns of these genes only partially zzso thus providing distinct zzso of zzso zzso zzso We also show that chick zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the limb bud in a pattern similar to zzso and that the induction of zzso within the zzso like that of zzso is zzso via antagonism of zzso zzso The differential responsiveness of cells to zzso zzso stimulation (as marked by the differential induction of zzso zzso suggests zzso in the mechanisms by which zzso signals are zzso within different populations of receiving zzso
