Genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso from the deep sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso box element established for zzso promoters are located upstream of the zzso and zzso zzso All four of the zzso genes appear to zzso the 3' terminal zzso zzso of the mature zzso These zzso zzso are predicted to contain most, but not all, zzso zzso and are characterized by a high level of G + C base zzso consistent with the 98 degrees C optimum growth temperature of zzso zzso
