zzso zzso (A zzso the major constituent of zzso deposits found in Alzheimer's disease, is derived from the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of soluble beta zzso zzso zzso are zzso by protein zzso C zzso zzso whereas A beta production and release are zzso The cellular mechanism that zzso the zzso zzso of A beta generation is zzso Because zzso processing of beta zzso from the cell surface is a major zzso of A beta production, the effect of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso on zzso trafficking of beta zzso was zzso 

In this study, trafficking of beta zzso was zzso in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso cells zzso zzso with full-length beta zzso 

Treatment with zzso resulted in a rapid and striking reduction of up to zzso in the amount of beta zzso at the cell zzso This loss of zzso molecules could not be accounted for by changes in the trafficking of zzso beta zzso zzso as determined by a zzso zzso zzso Rather, the decrease in beta zzso was due primarily to a reduction in the sorting of beta zzso to the cell zzso This zzso was correlated with accelerated zzso zzso beta zzso zzso and accelerated beta zzso trafficking in the zzso zzso 

The data suggest that the displacement of beta zzso away from the cell surface after zzso zzso treatment reduces the zzso available for zzso processing and in turn, results in the zzso of A beta zzso
