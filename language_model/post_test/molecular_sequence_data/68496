The zzso zzso is a trans zzso zzso network zzso which adds zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso of zzso Previous results suggested that the zzso stem and signal anchor including zzso sequences may be two independent zzso retention zzso However, other experiments demonstrated that the sequence of the signal anchor itself was not zzso To investigate whether the zzso signal anchor was necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso several zzso and zzso proteins were expressed and localized in zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso We found that the signal anchor and zzso sequences were able to retain the zzso zzso domain in the zzso However, efficient zzso retention was still observed when the signal anchor was altered or entirely replaced in either the presence or absence of most of the zzso stem zzso zzso proteins consisting of the zzso zzso tail and signal anchor fused to the zzso zzso of two different cell surface proteins demonstrated poor zzso zzso A significant increase in the zzso retention of one of these zzso was observed when two zzso were placed next to the signal anchor on the zzso zzso Taken together these results suggest that the zzso signal anchor is not necessary or sufficient for zzso zzso rather, appropriately spaced zzso and zzso zzso sequences are the important elements of the zzso zzso retention zzso
