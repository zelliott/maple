The high-level expression and zzso of zzso p IX zzso grass zzso zzso were examined utilizing a modified zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso This zzso permits zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso protein from the fusion partner zzso zzso The expression of the fusion proteins in zzso form varied among the zzso of the same bacterial strain and also between different host zzso zzso of the fusion proteins by affinity zzso employing zzso zzso gel revealed that zzso in the bacterial zzso bound to the gel and were zzso with the fusion zzso These zzso which specifically zzso the zzso proteins to varying degrees, were inhibited by both of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso of the fusion proteins indicated that the structure of the individual protein affected the zzso accessibility to the zzso zzso Increased concentration of zzso partly compensated this effect, but resulted in a broader specificity of the zzso By contrast, zzso of the fusion protein when it was still attached to the zzso gel was convenient and led to zzso of the product devoid of zzso zzso Since almost all the zzso zzso have been cloned in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso reported zzso will facilitate the zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso proteins or their peptides in soluble and biologically active zzso
