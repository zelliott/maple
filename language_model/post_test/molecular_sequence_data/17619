zzso chain reaction zzso amplification was carried out on total DNA from a range of autopsy zzso from deceased human subjects with no known zzso disease, aged from birth zzso minutes) to 87 zzso We report the finding of an age-related 5 zzso deletion in the zzso zzso of these zzso The deletion occurs between zzso positions zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and is flanked by a 13 zzso direct zzso All zzso from adult subjects showed the presence of zzso DNA molecules with the deletion after a 30 cycle zzso zzso by contrast the deletion was not similarly detected in any of the infant zzso zzso However, the occurrence of the deletion was detected in the infant zzso after 60 zzso cycles of zzso zzso It is concluded that such deletions are not necessarily associated with particular zzso diseases but occur naturally, and with increasing frequency with zzso A consequence of the zzso of this deletion could be a progressive decrease with age of zzso capacity which in turn could influence the rate of zzso and zzso to zzso degenerative zzso
