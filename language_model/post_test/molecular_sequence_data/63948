The zzso zzso zzso protein belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso family, involved in heavy metal zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso strain zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells accumulate the same amount of cadmium as zzso zzso cells or zzso cells, suggesting that zzso carries out an zzso zzso of zzso A zzso of zzso altered in the zzso zzso domain did not complement zzso suggesting that metal transport rather than zzso is zzso The fusion protein zzso fluorescent protein zzso is localized at the zzso consistent with a role in the influx of cadmium into the zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was detected mainly in roots, old zzso leaves and zzso zzso The expression levels were not affected by cadmium or zinc zzso
