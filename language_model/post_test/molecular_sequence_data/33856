Both mating system and population history can have large impacts on genetic diversity and population zzso Here, we use zzso sequence data to investigate how these factors impact two closely related zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso To do this, we have zzso 16 zzso in approximately 70 individuals from 7 populations of each zzso zzso of population structure differ strongly between the two zzso In zzso zzso we observe an zzso pattern and identify three clearly delineated genetic zzso In zzso zzso where we estimate the zzso rate to be zzso the pattern is less clear with some sampling populations forming separate genetic clusters while others are highly zzso The two species also have divergent zzso Our analysis gives support for a bottleneck approximately 73 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which most likely represents zzso from zzso zzso In zzso zzso there is moderate support for the standard neutral model in 2 of 3 genetic zzso while the third cluster and the total data set show evidence of zzso It is clear that mating system has an impact on these two species, for example affecting the level of genetic variation and the genetic zzso However, our results also clearly show that a combination of past and present zzso some of which are not affected by mating system, is needed to explain the differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
