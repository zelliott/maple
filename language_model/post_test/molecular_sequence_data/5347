The zzso proteins are components of the zzso zzso zzso They form zzso with the zzso proteins and these complexes bind efficiently to zzso response elements in promoters of genes that are involved in cell cycle zzso The properties of the zzso proteins are less documented than those of their zzso counterpart and the present work was aimed at characterizing avian zzso genes (named zzso and their zzso Here we describe the cloning of the chicken zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This work also suggests that zzso zzso have an additional 60 zzso acid extension at the zzso compared to its human zzso zzso zzso and zzso show that both zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and activate zzso zzso as demonstrated by transient expression zzso However, contrary to the expression patterns exhibited by zzso during the cell cycle or during zzso development, zzso zzso expression appears more zzso suggesting that zzso activity is limited by the availability of the zzso zzso
