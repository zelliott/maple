An zzso was isolated from zzso fluid of Pacific zzso zzso zzso zzso by successive zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso named zzso in the present paper, showed a molecular mass of approximately zzso Da on zzso and exhibited high zzso activity on both zzso from locust bean gum and zzso from zzso at an optimal pH and temperature of zzso and 45 degrees C, zzso zzso could degrade either zzso or zzso to zzso and zzso similarly to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso could disperse the zzso of a red zzso zzso zzso into cell masses consisting of zzso cells that are available for cell engineering of this zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction from an zzso zzso zzso From the zzso sequences of the zzso the sequence of zzso zzso in total was determined and the zzso sequence of 377 zzso was deduced from the zzso region of zzso zzso locating at zzso positions zzso The zzso region of 17 zzso except for the initiation Met, was regarded as the signal zzso of zzso because it was absent in the zzso protein and showed high similarity to the consensus sequence for signal peptides of zzso zzso zzso zzso mature zzso was considered to consist of zzso zzso with the calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso is classified into zzso zzso family 5 zzso on the basis of sequence zzso to zzso zzso
