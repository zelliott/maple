When two ongoing zzso zzso reactions are mixed, formation of zzso is subject to a lag of several minutes, and the subsequent rate of zzso formation is greatly reduced relative to normal reaction progress zzso The lag reflects the formation of a stable complex containing multiple zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso products, a process completed within zzso zzso after addition of zzso zzso to a reaction zzso The reaction products are zzso within this complex for an extended period of time, unavailable for further zzso The length of the lag increases with increasing zzso protein concentration and is not affected by the introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results provide evidence that zzso of zzso complexes from products occurs in a minimum of two zzso At least one zzso protein zzso is released from reaction complexes in a discrete step that leaves the reaction products zzso The zzso products are released in a form free to react with other zzso zzso zzso DNA molecules only after at least one additional zzso zzso One or both of these zzso steps are rate limiting for reaction turnover under conditions often used to monitor zzso zzso in zzso
