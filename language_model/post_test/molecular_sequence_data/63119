zzso pneumoniae, an zzso zzso zzso changes its form from a zzso zzso body into an infectious elementary body during the late stage of its infection zzso zzso of the molecular events in the zzso change is important to understand the switching mechanism between acute and chronic infection, which is deemed to relate to the zzso of zzso zzso we have attempted to screen genes expressed in the late stage with a zzso DNA zzso resulting in nomination of 17 genes as the late-stage zzso Fourteen of the 17 genes and six other genes predicted as late-stage genes were confirmed to be zzso in the late stage with a quantitative reverse zzso chain zzso These 20 late-stage genes were classified into two groups by zzso analysis: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Out of eight drastically induced zzso four contain zzso zzso sequences and the other four contain an upstream common zzso It suggests that besides zzso there are certain zzso mechanisms at the late stage, which may be involved in the zzso zzso change and thus zzso
