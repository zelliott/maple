Over the last 20 years several observations at the zzso level have indicated the possible existence of additional members of the zzso zzso zzso gene family in zzso In this study, the human zzso was analyzed for the existence of genes structurally related to the VP and OT zzso Human zzso blots zzso under low stringency conditions with zzso B of the human OT zzso that codes for the zzso constant region of zzso revealed the presence of two distinct bands in addition to the known VP and OT gene zzso Five clones were obtained from a library of zzso zzso fragments ranging from zzso zzso that comprised both low stringency signals, by low stringency zzso with the OT zzso B zzso One clone of 7 zzso zzso at high stringency conditions to bands of the same size as previously detected with OT zzso B on a human zzso zzso However, no similarity was observed between the open reading frames of this clone and the zzso portion of the OT zzso Another clone of zzso zzso was identical to a zzso of the gene for the human bone zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso zzso The zzso gene was not detected by low stringency zzso of the human zzso zzso with the OT zzso B zzso No significant similarity was found between the zzso acid sequences of human OT zzso and zzso zzso no evidence can be provided that the human zzso contains additional zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
