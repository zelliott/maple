zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and functional activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso acid zzso zzso in mature zzso To determine whether zzso regulates zzso promoter activity, zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso alone modestly enhanced zzso zzso zzso However, zzso suppressed the ability of zzso to zzso zzso activity, suggesting that zzso has multiple effects on zzso zzso zzso also reduced the zzso association of zzso zzso II with the zzso gene in zzso The zzso promoter contains a zzso zzso and zzso bound to the zzso zzso promoter after zzso zzso To determine the impact of zzso zzso we zzso cells with zzso a zzso active zzso zzso zzso alone zzso zzso zzso this effect was zzso by mutating the zzso binding site in the minimal zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the potent zzso of zzso promoter activity caused by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor, downstream targets of zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in mature zzso zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso caused zzso expression to be zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso plays two distinct roles in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso mediates suppression of the zzso zzso promoter activity indirectly by zzso zzso zzso However, in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds the zzso promoter after zzso treatment and directly enhances zzso zzso
