Human zzso is a recently characterized zzso present on zzso zzso and zzso Its function is not zzso Because it is a member of the zzso zzso and structurally zzso to zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso it is believed that zzso may function also as an zzso zzso In this report, we characterize the cellular zzso of a zzso zzso to a zzso protein that is zzso to zzso To delineate the cellular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recognized by our zzso zzso we used zzso and zzso microscopic zzso The most striking finding was that the putative zzso zzso of zzso is expressed in particularly high amounts on zzso zzso zzso across zzso or zzso vascular zzso Such a distribution was apparent in draining zzso zzso zzso during the peak of an immune response after zzso with a protein zzso in zzso a situation in which there are many zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis also shows that zzso is predominantly distributed on portions of zzso zzso that are in contact with or adjacent to areas of contact with zzso zzso These findings suggest a previously zzso role for zzso in zzso recruitment and zzso
