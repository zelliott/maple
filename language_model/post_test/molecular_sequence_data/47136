The frequency and level of cellular and zzso responses to seven synthetic peptides from asexual blood stages of zzso zzso were measured in two zzso of children living in areas highly endemic for malaria in zzso and zzso A prospective zzso study was conducted for one year in these sites to examine the relationship between specific in zzso immune responses and zzso to clinical zzso Clinical protection was related to high zzso responses zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as to elevated zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the village of zzso zzso Higher response rates of zzso but lower response rates of tumor necrosis zzso to four and six zzso respectively, were observed in zzso than in zzso that were independent of the older age of the zzso zzso Age accounted only for the higher prevalence rate in zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso from zzso zzso surface zzso zzso Our results support the inclusion of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso vaccine against malaria, but show that a zzso clinical, zzso and zzso study conducted according to identical criteria in two separate areas may lead to contrasting zzso demonstrating the geographic limitation of the interpretation of such zzso
