zzso Mediterranean fever zzso is a zzso disorder characterized by episodes of fever with zzso or zzso Recently the zzso gene zzso was zzso the protein product, zzso is thought to regulate inflammation in zzso zzso In this manuscript we report the mouse and rat zzso of zzso The zzso gene contains ten zzso with a coding sequence of zzso zzso while the rat zzso has nine zzso with a coding sequence of zzso zzso A considerable zzso acid sequence zzso was observed between the mouse and human zzso identity and zzso zzso and between the mouse and rat genes zzso identity and zzso zzso The predicted zzso proteins have several important zzso and signals found in human zzso including a zzso zinc finger domain, zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, perhaps because of an ancient zzso zzso neither the mouse nor the rat protein has an intact zzso zzso domain, in which most zzso zzso have been found in human zzso Nevertheless, like the human zzso mouse zzso is expressed in peripheral blood zzso but not zzso zzso with its expression in zzso zzso was detected at high levels in the primary zzso and marginal zones of the zzso white zzso zzso is localized on mouse zzso zzso 16, region zzso extending a region of zzso with human zzso zzso Development of knockout and zzso mouse models may provide further insights into the functional evolution of this zzso
