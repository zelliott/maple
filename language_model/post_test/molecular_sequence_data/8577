Variation in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso DNA zzso of lake trout zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso DNA with restriction zzso showed that almost every individual had a unique combination of length zzso with most of this variation occurring within rather than between zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spanning the 3' end of the zzso coding region and approximately zzso zzso of the zzso revealed two blocks of repetitive zzso zzso zzso termination sites were found approximately 220 bases zzso downstream from the end of the zzso coding zzso zzso of the zzso fragments with two longer zzso zzso fragments showed that the major difference in length resulted from variation in the number of short zzso b) repeats located 3' to the putative zzso Repeat units within a single zzso organizer region zzso appeared relatively homogeneous and genetic analysis found zzso to be zzso zzso A comparison of the number of zzso zzso with the number of zzso found that the number of length zzso per individual was always less than the number of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in five populations showed that populations with more zzso had more zzso zzso indicating that zzso are present at different zzso sites on zzso zzso
