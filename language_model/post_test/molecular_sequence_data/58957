Within the family of zzso zzso some exhibit a zzso activity in addition to their zzso zzso However, their role in peripheral nerve zzso processes is still poorly zzso This study presents the zzso of expression of zzso for different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and that of zzso included as zzso It was carried out on the rat zzso nerve zzso using two models of nerve zzso with a 7 zzso loss of zzso Nerve zzso took place through an zzso nerve zzso in the first model, and through a zzso cylinder in the second zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to zzso each zzso of zzso and that of zzso beta gene considered as an zzso internal zzso The results showed a peak in the expression of zzso beta zzso in both models at zzso zzso bay after zzso This zzso was also observed for zzso alpha and zzso but only in the model of the zzso The level of zzso zzso was very high compared to the nearly complete absence of zzso zzso expression in non operated control zzso According to these results, zzso zzso and especially zzso may play a major role in promoting peripheral nerve zzso
