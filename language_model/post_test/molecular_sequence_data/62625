zzso zzso is a major component of animal plasma zzso Its production involves the transfer of zzso from zzso onto zzso yielding zzso as a side zzso This reaction is zzso by zzso zzso an zzso whose biological potential can be judged from the roles of zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis occurs in the zzso of the zzso as well as on the cell zzso As no gene for zzso zzso has been cloned so far, it is unclear whether different zzso are present at these zzso Using a functional cloning strategy in zzso we identified a novel family of integral membrane proteins exhibiting all zzso features previously attributed to animal zzso zzso zzso human, mouse and zzso zzso zzso each contain at least two different zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas human zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso resides primarily at the plasma zzso zzso these findings open up important new avenues for studying zzso function in zzso
