To test its zzso utility, zzso sequence variation in a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso gene was examined in 49 zzso species representing the major groups of the zzso zzso Both zzso and distance analyses supported the zzso of nearly all groups for which there are clear zzso zzso zzso of zzso rank and lower, probably zzso and younger, were strongly zzso The third zzso position contains zzso of variable sites, and approaches zzso at approximately zzso sequence zzso possibly due to zzso rate zzso and composition zzso higher zzso occur only in association with shifts in zzso Surprisingly, the few zzso changes appear no more zzso reliable than synonymous zzso Signal strength for zzso zzso is weak and fails to improve with character zzso thus, dense zzso sampling is probably needed for strong zzso from zzso alpha regarding deeper splits in zzso (probably early zzso zzso alpha synonymous changes show promise for zzso reconstruction within zzso and other groups of zzso zzso
