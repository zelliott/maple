zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso involved in multiple membrane functions including zzso of zzso fatty acids and oxidized low density zzso In mice, expression of the gene is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha in the liver and by zzso gamma in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peters, zzso zzso Gonzalez, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the time course of zzso alpha zzso expression of zzso in the liver, and also in the cultured zzso cells, is significantly slower than those of other zzso alpha target zzso To study the molecular mechanism of the slow zzso zzso of the gene by a zzso zzso we first cloned the zzso ends of the zzso and then the mouse gene promoter region from a zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso of the gene starts at two initiation sites 16 zzso apart and zzso occurs zzso producing at least three zzso species with different zzso zzso The zzso alpha zzso promoter in the liver was identified as the new upstream promoter where we found several possible binding sites for zzso zzso zzso factors but not for zzso Neither promoter responded to a zzso alpha zzso in the in zzso or in zzso reporter zzso using cultured zzso cells and the liver of living zzso We also have cloned the human zzso gene from a bacterial artificial zzso library and identified a new independent promoter that is located 13 zzso upstream of the previously reported zzso Only the upstream promoter responded to zzso alpha and zzso gamma zzso in a cell zzso zzso The absence of zzso in the responding upstream promoter region, the delayed zzso by the zzso and the results of the reporter zzso all suggested that zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso is indirectly dependent on zzso
