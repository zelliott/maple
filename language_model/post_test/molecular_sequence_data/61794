zzso a type 2 zzso protein from the roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized both at the protein and zzso level by direct zzso acid sequencing and cloning of the gene zzso the zzso Gene sequence analysis revealed that zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso without zzso with an internal zzso sequence of 45 zzso zzso in zzso present at several sequence positions zzso after repeated protein sequence zzso with respect to the gene zzso suggest several zzso for the zzso zzso Based on the zzso coordinates of zzso which shares a high sequence identity with zzso a molecular model of zzso was zzso The zzso model suggests that the zzso acid zzso of the active site of the zzso zzso are zzso at identical spatial positions, including zzso a novel zzso acid zzso found to be zzso in all known zzso zzso The sugar binding site 1 of the zzso zzso is also zzso in the zzso zzso whilst in binding site 2, zzso replaces zzso Native zzso contains two free zzso zzso out of 14 derived from the gene zzso thus suggesting a further zzso bridge in the B chain, in addition to the zzso and zzso zzso bond pattern common to other type 2 zzso zzso
