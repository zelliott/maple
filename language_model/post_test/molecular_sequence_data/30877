zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in all 13 human zzso and 28 brains zzso even subjects whose zzso were devoid of zzso expressed zzso zzso of this zzso zzso and brains from individuals with zzso zzso in their zzso had additional forms that also reflected the liver zzso An zzso with an zzso point of zzso which was a major zzso in zzso and present as well in cerebral zzso but not detected in any zzso was identified and zzso zzso analysis of peptides derived by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso I revealed distinct aspects of primary structure not found previously in any zzso zzso zzso These unique features included a blocked and extended zzso zzso and 3 additional zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This structure was confirmed by molecular cloning and sequencing of zzso derived from human zzso and brain zzso In the coding region the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with that of the liver form, and its zzso sequence was mostly zzso indicating that it is the product of a separate zzso zzso zzso and structural properties of the zzso zzso zzso suggest that these zzso may be uniquely involved in zzso functions common to both zzso
