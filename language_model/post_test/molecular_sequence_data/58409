We determined a 146 zzso zzso sequence at the 25 zzso degrees region of the zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso Among the 113 zzso identified, 33 are already zzso functions were assigned to 38 zzso by a search of zzso protein sequence data banks and those of 16 zzso were suggested through significant similarity with reported zzso The zzso acid sequences of 13 of the zzso were similar to proteins of unknown function of zzso coli, zzso zzso and other zzso We did not find similarities for 29 zzso to any known zzso The 146 zzso region is rich in zzso (35 zzso related to the metabolism of low molecular mass compounds and five genes for zzso production occupy about 26 zzso of the zzso
