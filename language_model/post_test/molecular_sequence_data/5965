A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso amplification zzso was developed to detect infectious zzso disease virus zzso gene sequences in clinical samples, infected cell cultures and chicken zzso Two pairs of zzso were designed to amplify the zzso and zzso of segment A genes that partially code for the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso One primer pair specifies a zzso fragment, the other a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 5 zzso samples of chickens derived from a suspected first outbreak of infectious zzso disease in New Zealand yielded the zzso and zzso by zzso The identity of both amplified fragments was confirmed by restriction zzso analysis, zzso Southern zzso zzso and direct cycle zzso zzso amplification of zzso extracted from 4 out of 5 zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, chicken zzso zzso and specific zzso chicken zzso yielded zzso fragments of zzso small zzso
