Various components of the zzso fraction from bovine milk were separated by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso They included the genetic zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta A3, and an unknown component previously zzso beta X zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso of these components were compared by zzso and most zzso were zzso by mass zzso zzso The zzso map of beta X was closest to that of beta zzso but with a few mutually different peak zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that in the beta X map these components had relative molecular masses of 16 higher than the corresponding ones in the beta A1 zzso The main differential zzso represented the zzso fragments of beta A1 and beta X, respectively, which were both zzso and then zzso with zzso zzso In the resulting zzso each of which contained three fragments, the corresponding peptides representing the zzso sequence showed the 16 relative molecular mass zzso In beta X this sequence contained a zzso zzso at position 152 instead of the zzso in beta zzso as established by zzso zzso zzso The zzso could be zzso from an zzso zzso by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso spectrum of the beta X zzso zzso The sequence of the two zzso zzso fragments was confirmed by regular zzso acid sequence zzso In accordance with internationally accepted guidelines for the nomenclature of milk zzso the new genetic zzso has been named zzso zzso
