We have analyzed the relative activities of the zzso coli zzso zzso promoters zzso and zzso in zzso under different zzso zzso zzso efficiencies were determined by quantitative comparison of the zzso primer extension products obtained from total zzso zzso zzso were analyzed at different stages of the growth cycle, at different growth rates, and under conditions of stringent zzso In addition, the zzso gene dosage was altered by transformation with plasmids containing additional zzso or zzso zzso units, or zzso zzso in which one of the tandem promoters zzso had been zzso Under conditions of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso we observed the expected strong reduction in zzso zzso In contrast to the previous assumption that the zzso promoter is not zzso we simultaneously noticed a smaller but significant repression of zzso zzso In strains in which the zzso gene dosage was increased by transformation with plasmids bearing zzso zzso units, a similar degree of repression was zzso zzso of the zzso promoter activity was increased, however, when cells contained extra zzso zzso with zzso promoters zzso As demonstrated under stringent control conditions, changes in the growth cycle also affected the activity of promoters zzso and zzso A greater proportion of zzso transcripts was observed when cells changed from exponential to stationary growth or if cultures were grown in minimal zzso Under zzso slow growth conditions zzso zzso we obtained evidence showing that the ratio of zzso zzso products is much lower for cells with extra zzso as compared to extra zzso zzso or cells lacking extra zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
