The aim of this work was to zzso zzso and characterize the component of goat zzso zzso zzso zzso responsible for goat zzso deterioration in skim milk zzso zzso extracts promote a decrease in the percentage of zzso zzso deterioration in the quality of movement, breakage of zzso and cellular death of goat zzso diluted in skim zzso A zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso and was identified as the only zzso component responsible for the deterioration of zzso in zzso The zzso was shown to display zzso zzso activity, and partial sequences zzso zzso acids in all) exhibited zzso zzso with sequences of various types of pancreatic zzso zzso especially zzso protein 2 zzso In addition, zzso zzso produced deterioration of goat zzso properties in milk as effectively as zzso and zzso These results support the preliminary identification of the goat zzso as a zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Since seminal plasma also contains factors favorable for zzso survival, it is zzso that, for the best preservation of goat zzso specific zzso of this family of zzso could be added into zzso zzso without eliminating seminal zzso
