zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by a new technique involving the use of zzso zzso zzso carriers and zzso modification of the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso carriers were zzso to increase the number of zzso molecules attached to a zzso The zzso carriers were coupled to the zzso via a single, zzso zzso group to prevent zzso of zzso zzso were prepared with zzso zzso zzso containing up to zzso zzso molecules per zzso Under neutral conditions, no zzso of the zzso bond between the zzso and the zzso carrier could be zzso and the zzso was not stabilized by reduction with zzso or zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso showed that approximately two zzso carrier chains were attached to a zzso regardless of the number of zzso molecules linked to a zzso zzso zzso zzso attachment of the zzso chains to the zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gave a single species zzso in the range of zzso zzso As determined by a competitive zzso zzso using viable zzso human zzso melanoma cells, the zzso showed excellent retention of zzso activity relative to zzso zzso
