zzso the gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso 580 was zzso and analyzed together with an apparent promoter region and adjoining genes in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso identified as a zzso zzso by its signal zzso is zzso related to the soluble zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and to other predicted zzso zzso zzso The promoter region, containing about 400 zzso upstream of zzso comprised potential binding sites identical or highly similar to known consensus sequences of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The complex regulation of the zzso of zzso which is suggested by this setting and emphasized by a possible zzso promoter, supports a hypothesis proposing an auxiliary role of the zzso in lowering zzso elevated zzso of formaldehyde, which might arise in the course of stress or regulatory transitions disturbing balanced zzso zzso
