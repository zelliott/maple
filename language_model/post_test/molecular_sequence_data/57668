Three zzso zzso were zzso with zzso envelope protein preparations derived from zzso zzso virus zzso Although zzso and cellular responses were zzso by the zzso regime, all zzso became infected upon challenge with 10 zzso of the zzso virus challenge stock of zzso The zzso chain reaction was used to amplify zzso zzso zzso sequences present in the blood of both zzso and control zzso at 2 months zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences found in the region from V2 to zzso of zzso failed to differentiate zzso recovered from either zzso or control zzso A detailed investigation of sequences obtained from the zzso zzso region identified a mixture of sequences in both zzso and control zzso Some sequences were identical to those previously detected in the virus challenge stock, whereas others had not been detected zzso zzso analysis of the new zzso sequences found in zzso animals revealed that they were quite distinct from those from the virus challenge stock and that they included zzso to potential zzso zzso zzso In contrast, new sequence zzso recovered from the control animals were closely related to sequences from the virus challenge zzso The difference in diversity of new zzso sequences recovered from zzso and control zzso was highly significant zzso zzso zzso Thus, the presence of pre-existing immune responses to zzso envelope protein is associated with greater genetic change in the zzso region of zzso These data are discussed in relation to the zzso of zzso zzso that may zzso protection from in zzso zzso
