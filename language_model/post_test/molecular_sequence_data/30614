DNA can be extracted from hair shafts and hair zzso The content of DNA in hairs is usually zzso the root end of hairs may contain zzso zzso DNA and shed hairs contain less than 10 zzso zzso DNA analysis with restriction zzso length zzso zzso requires zzso amounts of zzso Such DNA cannot be obtained from such samples as single hairs or blood zzso Even with a little amount of DNA, specific genes of DNA can be greatly amplified to more than zzso in zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso We extracted the DNA from a half, 1, and 2 hair roots and 4 hair shafts and amplified the DNA with primer pairs zzso zzso of the zzso zzso covering part sequences of the zzso region by using the zzso chain reaction for 50 zzso The zzso of the zzso product revealed a 131 base pairs zzso Finally, we zzso the zzso product with an zzso probe zzso A zzso of the zzso extending from zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso gene can be demonstrated in the slot zzso filter of hair roots and hair zzso but not in the 1 zzso of blood which was not amplified by zzso zzso of the zzso gene from single hairs by using the zzso may be useful for the diagnosis of zzso from single zzso
