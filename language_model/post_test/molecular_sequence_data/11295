zzso zzso into zzso cells has been found for a water soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With the zzso zzso acid analog of zzso zzso exhibiting an identical primary structure but no propensity to adopt a zzso zzso only about zzso of the cellular zzso of zzso was zzso The mechanism of entry of zzso into the cells remained zzso but proved to be energy, temperature and pH dependent and, therefore, clearly distinct from that reported for zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso high zzso in water and the found extensive entry into zzso cells make zzso appear a good lead for developing new types of zzso for delivering zzso and peptides into intact zzso
