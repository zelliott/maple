The large zzso of nuclear receptors is a family of zzso zzso factors involved in numerous fundamental processes and shows many common characteristics and zzso The comprehension of these roles is of fundamental importance to select the right target for zzso zzso zzso Recently, during the last ten years, several zzso structures of nuclear receptors zzso with zzso have been registered in the zzso Data Bank, zzso a structural basis for zzso zzso The zzso flexibility of zzso and local flexibility of some zzso acids zzso within cavities of the zzso zzso zzso suggest a reason for the behavior of these receptors toward different zzso Several approaches have been applied in trying to explain this flexibility and to predict how zzso binding can influence complex zzso In this short review, we present an introduction to the structure and function of nuclear zzso specifically the estrogen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso and a discussion of the state-of-the-art of induced fit approaches for the nuclear zzso zzso
