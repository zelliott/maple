We zzso a large amount of zzso with high zzso activity from rat brain tissue by a new zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained from 20 g of rat zzso The purity of zzso was almost zzso zzso plays a role of zzso rather than zzso In the absence of zzso zzso constant zzso and maximum zzso zzso for zzso zzso were 370 zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and in their presence, both were significantly accelerated up to 25 zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso activity was very low in the absence of zzso and even in their presence, zzso and zzso for zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Despite slow zzso turnover rate in the absence of zzso binding of zzso and its zzso zzso was very fast, indicating that zzso binding step is not rate zzso zzso did not cause a zzso consistent zzso sliding movement just like zzso or zzso in the presence of 2 zzso zzso or 2 zzso zzso We observed the molecular structure of zzso with zzso rotary zzso technique and revealed that the zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that these zzso were the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso with a zzso approximately zzso zzso ratio in the absence of zzso zzso zzso electron zzso of the zzso complex showed that zzso zzso the surface of zzso zzso like a screw zzso very orderly and tightly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the previous report, zzso make zzso by the attachment of the zzso zzso around each adjacent zzso and no zzso formation was zzso
