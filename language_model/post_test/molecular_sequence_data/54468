Human zzso zzso can zzso many different cell types in zzso Two zzso complexes are used for entry into zzso zzso shows no selectivity for its host cell, whereas formation of a zzso complex only restricts the zzso mainly to zzso Here, we describe that depending on the cell type in which virus replication takes place, virus carrying the zzso complex is either released or retained zzso We observed that virus spread in zzso cultures was predominantly zzso whereas spread in zzso cell zzso cultures was predominantly zzso This was due to properties of virus released from zzso and zzso zzso released virus which could zzso both zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso released virus which readily infected zzso but was barely able to zzso zzso The zzso infection capacities of virus released from zzso or zzso correlated with respectively high or low amounts of zzso in virus zzso Moreover, we found that focal spread in zzso cultures could be attributed to zzso virus tightly associated with zzso and not released into the zzso zzso of zzso virus progeny with zzso or beads coated with zzso zzso depleted the fraction that could zzso zzso and left a fraction that could predominantly zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso progeny is composed of distinct virus zzso zzso specifically retain the zzso population, whereas zzso release zzso and non zzso zzso Our findings offer completely new views on how zzso spread may be controlled by its host zzso
