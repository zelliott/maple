The zzso model of zzso zzso zzso places zzso one of two variable zzso zzso in the zzso of various zzso zzso proteins in close proximity to the zzso and zzso another variable zzso acid, in a more zzso zzso We have constructed zzso zzso proteins altered at either of these positions and zzso models of each based on multiple alignments with zzso zzso zzso The zzso models suggest the existence of significant structural diversity in the hydrogen bond network surrounding the zzso as a result of single point zzso in zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to other zzso present in the insect zzso zzso indicates that these zzso acids control the spin state of the zzso and, as a result, the zzso activity of this zzso In particular, the zzso zzso significantly increases the spin state of the zzso zzso with zzso to zzso increases in its turnover of linear zzso Other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso display more variation in their effects but, in each case, strong correlations exist between zzso turnover and zzso spin zzso These data demonstrate that variable zzso acids in zzso of the insect zzso zzso exert dramatic effects on the range of zzso zzso even when they occur in positions potentially zzso from the zzso These effects are possibly zzso through zzso of the local hydrogen bond zzso
