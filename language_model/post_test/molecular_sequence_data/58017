The use of zzso in zzso zzso paired with zzso zzso has been proposed for the zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso strategy was applied to the synthesis of the zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso which contains two susceptible points to zzso in a zzso zzso system, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso segment zzso ending with zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso protections at zzso and zzso zzso were prepared by the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and by a conventional method, zzso Both segments were condensed by the aid of zzso The acid component was converted into the partially protected zzso at as high as zzso conversion determined by zzso zzso When the zzso of zzso at the zzso was not protected, zzso was obtained only in zzso yield, and was contaminated with products of secondary zzso Although the zzso sequence was very poorly susceptible to zzso the zzso of zzso had to be protected in order to be zzso to zzso under the synthetic zzso zzso is demonstrated as a good zzso with zzso to allow the efficient zzso zzso of zzso The strategy increased the value of the zzso zzso as practical method by avoidance of secondary zzso high dissolution of peptides and retention of activity of zzso
