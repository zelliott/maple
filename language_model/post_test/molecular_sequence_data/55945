zzso C zzso is a dysfunctional protein C characterized by defective zzso activity determined by a zzso zzso and normal zzso activity measured on a synthetic zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Res zzso We have identified a single point zzso of C to G in zzso 57 zzso of the gene for protein C zzso by genetic analysis utilizing the zzso chain zzso The zzso should have resulted in an zzso acid substitution of zzso for zzso at position 15 of the light chain of mature protein zzso No zzso were found in zzso spanning the putative zzso recognition site or zzso acid zzso of protein zzso zzso C zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso that solely recognized the zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso This indicated that the zzso had critically zzso the highly zzso structure of the zzso acid zzso Thus, the zzso zzso required for the zzso binding to exert the zzso functions of protein C may not have been zzso normally in this abnormal protein C, resulting in defective generation of zzso activities in zzso zzso no zzso activities may have been generated in zzso
