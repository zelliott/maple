We have isolated a human zzso and zzso clone that encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids and belongs to the family of the zzso zzso factors zzso called zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript of the human zzso gene is expressed predominantly in the stomach, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of human zzso was shown in zzso zzso and lung zzso cell zzso The zzso gene is located on zzso zzso zzso analysis shows zzso zzso with the mouse zzso gene (formerly zzso and with a revised sequence of the rat zzso gene (formerly zzso The zzso zzso named zzso domain, is well zzso showing zzso identity in human, zzso and zzso The human protein sequence contains two putative zzso zzso zzso which share a high zzso acid identity with the corresponding mouse and rat zzso
