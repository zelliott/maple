zzso are structurally diverse natural products that have a range of medically useful zzso zzso bacterial zzso are zzso on modular zzso zzso zzso zzso in which each cycle of chain extension requires a different zzso of zzso zzso Attempts to design and construct modular zzso that zzso specified novel zzso provide a particularly stringent test of our understanding of zzso structure and zzso 

We have constructed zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso that contains only zzso 1 and 2 and a zzso zzso by substituting multiple zzso with appropriate counterparts derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained that zzso the predicted target zzso zzso which are simple zzso of cholesterol-lowering zzso In constructing zzso zzso whether between zzso in the same or in different zzso it was found advantageous to preserve intact the zzso carrier zzso zzso zzso that spans the junction between successive zzso 

Relatively simple considerations govern the construction of functional hybrid zzso Fusion sites should be chosen either in the zzso zzso regions between zzso zzso as previously revealed, or just inside the zzso margins of zzso The interaction of an zzso domain with the adjacent zzso domain, whether on the same zzso or not, is of particular importance, both through conservation of appropriate zzso zzso and through zzso molecular recognition of the altered zzso chain in the key transfer of the zzso chain from the zzso of one module to the zzso of the downstream zzso
