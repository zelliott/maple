Many members of the zzso family, which possess zzso activity, have been identified in zzso but their zzso functions are poorly zzso We have identified a zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of zzso zzso during early zzso is examined by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The maternal zzso transcript is abundant in zzso eggs and zzso The expression of zzso zzso during zzso and early zzso when it is expressed and restricted to the zzso and zzso On day 2, expression occurs in the zzso fin bud but not in other zzso It will be interesting to investigate whether zzso is required for controlling cell proliferation during zzso zzso
