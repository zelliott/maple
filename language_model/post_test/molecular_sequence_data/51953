The zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is a major cellular zzso for protein zzso C that is also a zzso zzso zzso In addition, it is the zzso of a small family of zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso We isolated a zzso clone from a mouse zzso library that spanned the entire coding sequence of the mouse zzso zzso The first zzso zzso of the putative promoter was zzso identical to a corresponding region of the human promoter, and contained at least 59 potential zzso factor binding sites in analogous zzso both human and mouse promoters lacked zzso zzso The mouse zzso probe was used to zzso the mouse gene to zzso 10, in the middle of a linkage group that zzso to a region on human zzso zzso These data strongly suggested that the human gene would zzso to zzso This was confirmed by studies of DNA from a patient with zzso in which expression of the human gene zzso zzso zzso was only about 50% of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso from this patient was only zzso of zzso These studies confirm that the mouse and human zzso proteins are products of the same genes in their respective zzso differences in their primary sequence can therefore be attributed to species variation rather than to the existence of related zzso
