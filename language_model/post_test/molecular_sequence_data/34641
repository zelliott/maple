The zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso of nuclear receptors zzso that are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is present only in zzso and plays a central role in regulating the expression of a vast array of genes during development and zzso The functional entity is a zzso composed of zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso is the molecular target of zzso zzso zzso zzso hormones found in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso is the target of the environmentally safe zzso zzso used against zzso such as zzso that cause severe damage to zzso The crystal structures of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso A zzso and to the zzso specific zzso zzso used in the zzso zzso control, provide the first insight at atomic level for these important functional zzso The zzso zzso has a shape similar to that seen for the known zzso zzso complexes with a zzso main zzso but with features, that are specific to this zzso zzso The two zzso structures in complex with zzso and zzso zzso reveal substantial zzso The zzso of zzso to its zzso results in two radically different and only partially overlapping zzso pockets with different zzso involved in zzso zzso The concept brought by these structural studies of a zzso binding pocket has potential applications for other zzso
