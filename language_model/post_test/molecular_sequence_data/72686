zzso zzso is a human and animal pathogen in tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia and northern zzso Currently little is known about the zzso and molecular biology of this zzso In this report, we describe the zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained at a frequency of zzso zzso zzso per initial donor cell, and the zzso inserted randomly into the zzso We used zzso to identify the zzso structural zzso zzso We screened 3,500 zzso zzso and identified 28 zzso zzso zzso integrated into 19 unique genetic zzso zzso proteins with zzso to zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso contained zzso zzso in zzso We cloned and zzso zzso and used it to complement zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso zzso start site and a zzso promoter were identified by primer extension zzso We observed a significant difference in the expression of two distinct zzso zzso zzso during bacterial growth, suggesting the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso of zzso compared to that of zzso in diabetic rats or Syrian zzso suggesting that zzso and/or zzso are probably not zzso zzso in these animal models of zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on the zzso from a variety of bacterial species supported the recent transfer of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso to zzso
