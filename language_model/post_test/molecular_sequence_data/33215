zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso fatty acid zzso using zzso acid zzso zzso zzso as a zzso To enable the production of zzso in the conventional zzso zzso zzso we have isolated a zzso zzso the zzso fatty acid zzso from zzso zzso zzso and confirmed its function by zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that this zzso sequence has an open reading frame of zzso zzso which encodes a 52 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This sequence has zzso identity to the previously reported zzso fatty acid zzso from zzso zzso The zzso has a zzso zzso domain at the zzso including the zzso motif in the zzso region, as reported for other zzso fatty acid zzso In addition, this zzso differs from other zzso by the presence of three possible zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the fatty acid composition demonstrated the zzso of zzso to the level of zzso of the total fatty zzso zzso the amounts of zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso were increased from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso These results reveal that the modification of the fatty acid zzso zzso by genetic manipulation in order to produce specific zzso fatty acids in zzso zzso is a promising zzso
