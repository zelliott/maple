The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were recently shown to inhibit selectively human zzso viruses zzso and zzso B virus in zzso In the current study, the potential for zzso type 1 zzso resistance to these compounds was evaluated by serial passage of the virus in human peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso cells in the presence of increasing drug zzso zzso drug-resistant zzso zzso dominated the replicating virus population after two or more cycles of zzso The resistant zzso were zzso to zzso zzso and their zzso zzso but remained susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso compound zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from drug-resistant viral particles was zzso to zzso less susceptible to the zzso of zzso and zzso compared with zzso from parental zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the reverse zzso gene amplified from resistant viruses consistently identified zzso at zzso 184 from Met zzso to Val zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of amplified reverse zzso from a patient who had received zzso therapy for 4 months demonstrated a mixture of the zzso zzso zzso and the parental zzso indicating that the zzso zzso can occur in zzso
