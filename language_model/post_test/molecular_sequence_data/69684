Analysis of a 67 zzso zzso zzso protein from avian zzso zzso revealed zzso acid sequences zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were used to identify a clone from an avian zzso library that contained a full length copy of the zzso zzso zzso This was restriction zzso zzso and zzso The zzso sequence of the open reading frame showed 70 percent identity to that of zzso zzso zzso the predicted zzso acid zzso 78 percent zzso There was no zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso was constructed that zzso the intact chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso alpha in high zzso the zzso properties and the zzso terminal sequence of the expressed protein exactly matched those of the native zzso
