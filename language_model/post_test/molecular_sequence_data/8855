Little is known about the structure and regulation of zzso zzso genes despite increasing interest in the zzso potential of the zzso that they zzso zzso the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso growing on zzso produces an zzso suitable for zzso applications, at least eight genes zzso putative zzso have been found in its zzso In the current work we have identified the gene zzso zzso the former activity, and characterization of its expression has revealed a novel regulatory zzso A shared pattern of expression has also been observed for a second zzso zzso zzso 

zzso acid sequence data for the zzso zzso were determined using zzso mass zzso and zzso to the zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and yielded zzso zzso zzso analysis has revealed this zzso zzso to be the first such zzso found to be more closely related to bacterial zzso than other zzso of zzso zzso Northern analyses of diverse zzso zzso strains cultivated under different growth conditions indicate that zzso and zzso are induced by zzso and zzso by zzso as well as other carbon sources, some of which are considered to be zzso growth zzso Interestingly, the zzso repression is independent of the wide domain carbon zzso zzso zzso Gene induction and zzso repression of these zzso genes correlate with the zzso or lack of it, of the inducing carbon source zzso suggesting a prominent role for zzso exclusion in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso distant to those described in zzso zzso and its expression is regulated by a novel zzso zzso The identification of zzso and the characterization of its regulation will facilitate the design of strategies to zzso the zzso zzso - or zzso from other zzso - for industrial zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso genes could serve as prototypes for zzso genes coding for plant cell wall degrading zzso regulated by a novel mechanism of zzso
