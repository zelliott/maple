We have isolated a zzso clone zzso the human zzso protein zzso zzso The longest zzso of the zzso predicts a zzso small zzso identical to the rat zzso protein zzso zzso and sharing a zzso of identity to the tomato zzso protein zzso Northern zzso analysis of a number of zzso cell lines showed that the zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA suggested that the zzso does not constitute a zzso family but it is zzso by a reduced set of active zzso among which we have also found a zzso processed zzso located in the promoter region of the human zzso zzso II zzso zzso This zzso zzso is very unusual among processed zzso in that the zzso A tail and the entire zzso of the original zzso zzso were deleted during the zzso zzso
