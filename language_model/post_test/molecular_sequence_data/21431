Human zzso zzso is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in zzso zzso The unique long zzso zzso region of zzso contains at least 19 open reading frames zzso however, little is known about the function of zzso and zzso We characterized zzso and zzso in zzso clinical zzso from Chinese zzso 

The clinical strains of zzso were recovered from the urine from zzso zzso Human embryonic lung zzso zzso were infected with clinical zzso of zzso and the viral DNA and zzso for zzso and zzso were analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso and sequencing zzso We also predicted the structure and function of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso Chinese infants infected with zzso were recruited into this study and the clinical zzso were recovered from the zzso Two strains among the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso and zzso sequences were deposited with zzso under zzso numbers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso expression of both zzso and zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso was predicted to contain 1 protein zzso C zzso site, 2 zzso zzso II zzso sites and a zinc finger zzso zzso was predicted to contain a protein zzso C zzso site, zzso site, zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso site and zzso zzso II zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are highly zzso 

zzso may act as an zzso regulating factor by direct binding to DNA, while zzso may be a membrane zzso involving signal zzso
