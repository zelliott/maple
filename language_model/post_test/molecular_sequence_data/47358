We developed a zzso chain reaction based approach using restriction zzso length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I to identify nine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I genes of nine zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso with three restriction zzso zzso I, zzso I and zzso zzso This zzso chain reaction based restriction zzso length zzso method allowed the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were distinguishable by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and zzso zzso were distinguishable by zzso using zzso I, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were distinguishable by zzso with zzso I and zzso zzso The results obtained with this zzso chain reaction based restriction zzso length zzso zzso confirmed those previously reported by others and support the separation of the Japanese zzso as a new zzso namely zzso zzso
