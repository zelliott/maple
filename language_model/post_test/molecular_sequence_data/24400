To zzso the roles of genes involved in the cell wall zzso and function in zzso zzso we isolated and characterized zzso that were lethal in a strain in which the zzso gene zzso a cell wall zzso was zzso Thus, double zzso of zzso and either zzso or zzso were unable to grow and zzso on a zzso zzso could suppress their synthetic zzso A zzso fusion protein was found to zzso to the cell wall, suggesting that it might also be a cell wall zzso zzso we zzso the effects of the zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso double zzso cells after the zzso showed anomalous cellular zzso and died in the zzso M zzso From these and other results, we zzso that these genes function zzso with each other and in a cell zzso manner in the zzso and maintenance of cell wall in zzso zzso
