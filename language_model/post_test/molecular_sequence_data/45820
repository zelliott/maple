We have isolated a zzso zzso from the Indonesian fermented zzso zzso which produces a strong zzso zzso and was identified as zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso and SP zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was determined, and the zzso gene was cloned and zzso The result demonstrates that zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso family consisting of 275 zzso acid zzso in its mature zzso Its apparent K zzso and V zzso for the synthetic zzso zzso were 259 zzso and 145 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso degradation pattern generated by zzso as a function of time was similar to that obtained with zzso In addition, zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the zzso degradation products demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso (or zzso near zzso acids as a zzso site in the zzso and zzso of zzso to generate fragments zzso zzso and zzso similar to those generated by zzso On zzso zzso plates, zzso did not seem to activate zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso converted the active zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
