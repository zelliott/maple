zzso analysis of zzso fluid from the zzso zzso and zzso revealed a protein of about 105 zzso in the fluid in the zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of this fluid protein shifted from 105 zzso to 94 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and remained at 94 zzso in the lower regions of the zzso The possible zzso origin of this protein was suggested by the decrease in intensity of a zzso compound on the zzso plasma membrane extract and by its total disappearance from the fluid of animals with impaired zzso production caused by zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso zzso fluid, and a rabbit zzso zzso was zzso This zzso showed that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from the initial zzso were positive for the presence of an zzso related zzso The protein was zzso mainly on the zzso intermediate piece, whereas in some corpus and zzso zzso only the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso The zzso protein was zzso its zzso was not found in the sequence database, but its zzso fragments matched the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso protein exhibited a zzso activity inhibited by specific zzso of zzso All the soluble seminal plasma zzso activity in the zzso was attributable to the zzso zzso fluid zzso The zzso zzso also showed that a soluble form of zzso appeared specifically in the zzso zzso fluid of the zzso zzso and zzso This soluble form was responsible for all the zzso activity observed in the fluid from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso in these zzso Our results strongly suggest that the zzso fluid zzso derives from the zzso form of zzso that is liberated from the zzso zzso in a specific zzso zzso
