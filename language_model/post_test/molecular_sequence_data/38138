A total of zzso zzso samples obtained between June 1996 and March 1999 was genetically characterized in the envelope region by zzso and/or zzso The zzso zzso distribution was as zzso 290 zzso A, 22 zzso B, 16 zzso C, 8 zzso D, 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 4 zzso G, and 1 zzso zzso For 77 samples the zzso region from the gag gene was also zzso and for 9 zzso the zzso between zzso and gag were zzso zzso tree analysis showed the predominance of zzso viruses among gag and zzso zzso A zzso zzso is relatively simple and requires less sophisticated technical facilities compared with sequencing, and in zzso 323 zzso of the zzso samples could be identified by this zzso However, in the actual zzso of the zzso discrimination between the zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso A viruses is not zzso
