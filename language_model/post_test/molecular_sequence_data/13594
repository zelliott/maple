zzso zzso is imported into zzso and sorted to the zzso space by a zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso targeting zzso followed by an zzso space sorting zzso The zzso of the mature protein forms a folded zzso binding domain that depends on the zzso function of zzso zzso zzso for zzso We report that the distance between the zzso and the zzso binding domain is critical for the ability of zzso to promote import of the zzso zzso proteins with 40 or more zzso acids between the zzso and the zzso binding domain are arrested in the import zzso The zzso arrest can be overcome by unfolding of the zzso or by zzso of the zzso space sorting zzso Moreover, the sorting signal prevents zzso of the precursor zzso in the import site in the initial import step, when the signal has not made contact with the zzso The results indicate that the sorting signal interacts with zzso of the inner zzso space during the initial import step and promotes an early divergence of zzso zzso from the general zzso import pathway, zzso an unfolding role for zzso in the zzso of most of the mature portions of a zzso We propose a sorting model of zzso zzso which explains the apparently divergent previous results by a unifying zzso
