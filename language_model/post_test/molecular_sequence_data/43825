Access to mineral nitrogen often limits plant growth, and so symbiotic relationships have evolved between plants and a variety of zzso zzso These associations are responsible for reducing 120 million zzso of atmospheric nitrogen to zzso each zzso In agriculture, independence from zzso zzso expands crop production and zzso pollution of water tables, lakes and zzso Here we present the complete zzso sequence and gene complement of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso with the ability to associate zzso with zzso zzso In conjunction with zzso zzso these data demonstrate the presence of new symbiotic zzso and zzso zzso The sequence and organization of genes involved in replication and zzso transfer are similar to those of zzso suggesting a recent lateral transfer of genetic zzso
