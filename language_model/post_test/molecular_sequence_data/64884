The zzso fold mechanism of a zzso zzso which is modified from the zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso is studied through direct folding simulations in explicit water at native folding zzso Three zzso zzso molecular dynamics zzso simulations have revealed a series of zzso folding zzso During these simulations, the zzso folds repeatedly into a major cluster of zzso structures, which agree well with nuclear magnetic resonance experimental zzso This major cluster is found to have the minimum zzso free energy among all sampled zzso This zzso also folds into many other zzso structures, which represent some local free energy minimum zzso In the unfolded state, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a confined zzso zzso This confinement makes zzso the only energetically favored structure to zzso The unfolded state of this zzso is populated with zzso with non-native zzso zzso This zzso goes through fully hydrated zzso to eliminate non-native interactions before folding into a zzso The folding of a zzso starts with zzso zzso which bring two strands together to form zzso hydrogen zzso The unfolding of the zzso is not simply the reverse of the folding zzso Comparing unfolding simulations using MD and zzso methods demonstrate that zzso simulations can zzso reproduce the zzso of the zzso zzso
