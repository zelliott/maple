The human U2 zzso promoter directs the formation of a specialized zzso zzso II zzso complex that recognizes the zzso gene 3' box as a signal for zzso 3' end zzso In contrast, the human zzso promoter is recognized by zzso zzso III and zzso zzso in a run of zzso We show that zzso from the zzso promoter is dependent on a sequence similar to the U2 zzso element and on an zzso element centered around position zzso zzso of the zzso element zzso zzso zzso II zzso from the zzso promoter, whereas zzso of this element within the U2 promoter converts it into a predominantly zzso zzso III zzso The site of zzso termination always zzso with the nature of the zzso zzso the 3' box with zzso zzso II and a run of zzso with zzso zzso zzso Thus, a single element determines the zzso zzso specificity of zzso promoters and hence the site of zzso zzso
