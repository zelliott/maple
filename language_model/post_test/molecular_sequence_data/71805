In most species the 3' zzso site is recognized initially by an interaction between the zzso zzso factor zzso with the zzso zzso tract that results in recruitment of the U2 zzso to the zzso consensus just zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso both the zzso tract and the zzso consensus sequences are missing, apparently replaced by the highly zzso zzso 3' zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is very similar to its zzso and fly counterparts and may recognize the 3' zzso site zzso Here we report the cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that it lacks an identifiable zzso domain, which, in flies, has been shown to play a role in zzso zzso but it contains an extended zzso stretch at its zzso zzso is in an zzso with zzso a gene that encodes a zzso with an zzso domain at its zzso We demonstrate by zzso interference that both zzso zzso zzso (which encodes zzso and zzso are required for zzso whereas zzso is apparently zzso
