The genetic variation of zzso zzso virus zzso in Venezuela was estimated by single strand zzso and zzso sequence analyses of two zzso regions of zzso zzso These analyses showed that zzso virus movement, selection, mixed infections and zzso contributed to shape the genetic variation zzso zzso analysis indicated that Venezuelan zzso were within a zzso composed of zzso from the Americas and zzso The genetic diversity of these zzso was sufficiently large that it must be taken into account when designing control strategies such as transgenic resistance and zzso
