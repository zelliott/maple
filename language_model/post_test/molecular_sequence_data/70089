zzso and pharmacological properties of zzso a newly zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated in zzso and in zzso The novel zzso acid zzso which is shorter in chain length than the well-known zzso was incorporated into zzso as a zzso zzso analogue for the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso more strongly inhibited plasma zzso from primates than those from dogs, zzso guinea pigs and zzso zzso competitively inhibited zzso human zzso with a Ki value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the tissue zzso activities of various zzso from Japanese zzso with zzso values on the order of zzso zzso zzso was also very stable in various tissue zzso from Japanese zzso Both intravenous (from zzso to 3 zzso and oral (10 and 30 zzso administration of zzso to zzso and conscious zzso Japanese zzso respectively, significantly lowered the blood pressure and plasma zzso activity without affecting the heart zzso In Japanese zzso zzso was continuously detected in the plasma up to at least 7 zzso after oral administration of 10 and 30 zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a highly zzso zzso and long-lasting oral zzso inhibitor with a blood pressure lowering zzso
