A method of zzso zzso search is zzso We use mutual information to reveal the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of an zzso sequence is a zzso with a low level of similarity between any two periods inside the zzso zzso The mutual information between an artificial zzso sequence and an zzso sequence is zzso The length of the artificial sequence period is varied from 2 to zzso The high level of the mutual information between artificial and zzso sequences allows us to find any type of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of many zzso coding regions has been zzso For example, the zzso gene of zzso clone contains a region with a zzso period equal to 45 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso clone contains a region with a zzso period equal to 84 zzso Integrated sequences for the regions with zzso zzso are zzso The potential significance of zzso zzso is zzso
