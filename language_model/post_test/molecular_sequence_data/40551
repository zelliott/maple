We previously reported that zzso of stem cells with zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso causing zzso We zzso that these zzso effects could be simulated by zzso zzso of zzso 

During zzso zzso of zzso mouse bone zzso stem cell zzso zzso cells, zzso was mainly zzso onto the zzso inner zzso which was zzso by an zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso blocker zzso To investigate the role of zzso zzso we successfully designed a zzso coding for full-length mouse zzso with a zzso sequence zzso and cloned into a shuttle zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso lowered zzso activity, and improved survival during index zzso deprivation as determined by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motif in zzso with a zzso pattern of zzso acids consistent with the zzso family that regulated zzso c zzso Moreover, zzso secondary structure prediction indicated an extended zzso in this region, a known condition for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso into zzso during zzso was zzso zzso of zzso simulated the zzso effects of zzso in stem zzso zzso features of zzso were shared with the zzso family as determined by zzso zzso
