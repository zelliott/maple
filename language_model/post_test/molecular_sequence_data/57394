The low molecular weight zzso copper zzso zzso has been zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso using various zzso techniques including zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso of the reduced and zzso protein yielded a single sequence corresponding to zzso The complete zzso zzso 128 zzso acid zzso with a zzso sequence corresponding to zzso was determined from the peptides obtained from a zzso zzso zzso digest of the protein and confirmed using peptides obtained following zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence contained three zzso zzso at positions 3, 26, and zzso was devoid of zzso and showed closest similarity zzso identical zzso to the previously determined sequence of zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso De La zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the complete sequence indicated zzso zzso zzso contained unique zzso and Ala zzso at positions 19 and 21, respectively, that have not been found in any other zzso zzso
