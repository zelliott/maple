zzso sequence tag zzso simple sequence repeat zzso markers were developed in zzso zzso by screening a zzso zzso The zzso were verified by sequencing and explored for zzso among 19 zzso and zzso among 30 other zzso related zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred ten zzso were developed, and a set of 20 amplified two to six zzso repeats with a mean number of zzso zzso per locus and with an observed zzso and zzso information content per locus ranging from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso in 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, 92 of these markers have zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso among 30 other zzso related zzso zzso zzso 

The developed markers have potential for application in zzso appraisal, genetic diversity study, genetic zzso and molecular breeding in zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
