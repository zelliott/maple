zzso protein 1 zzso regulates multiple aspects of nuclear and zzso zzso processing, with implications for onset of zzso zzso zzso harbors three zzso zzso and zzso targets zzso zzso zzso We describe crystal structures of zzso zzso and tandem zzso zzso bound to zzso containing tandem zzso zzso Both zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso complexes use similar principles to target zzso zzso with recognition zzso by zzso stacking and zzso zzso zzso The zzso step adopts a left-handed zzso zzso with the zzso zzso recognized through zzso zzso backbone zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso complex establish that both zzso zzso target tandem zzso motifs in solution, whereas zzso zzso identify a preference for recognition of zzso over zzso or zzso zzso We discuss the implications of zzso targeting and zzso of zzso elements on zzso zzso regulation, zzso regulation, and zzso zzso
