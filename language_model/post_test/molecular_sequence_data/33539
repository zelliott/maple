The overall zzso and zzso zzso coordination for the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso buffer are affected by zzso zzso zzso This effect is investigated by transmission electron zzso zzso atomic force zzso zzso and electron spin echo envelope zzso zzso zzso At lower than zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are zzso At these zzso of zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso data indicate that the zzso zzso is coordinated by zzso zzso For zzso zzso at a zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso and zzso images show both linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso show that the zzso coordination for zzso zzso partially breaks up and becomes exposed to water or zzso zzso of the zzso at a higher zzso zzso Since the zzso electron spin resonance results also suggest two zzso sites in zzso the zzso zzso peak may arise from the second zzso site, which may be significantly involved in the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso and circular zzso experiments also show that zzso zzso the formation of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose that zzso has a second zzso site in a zzso environment and the second binding zzso zzso interferes with a zzso transition into zzso zzso inducing the formation of zzso zzso zzso
