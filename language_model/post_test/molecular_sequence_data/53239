In zzso zzso the zzso factor zzso mediates both pH regulation and control of mating and zzso Like its zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso processing, which occurs in response to a signal zzso by a zzso involving several PAL gene zzso We report here the cloning and sequencing of two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein with six possible zzso zzso which differs from the zzso proteins zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso but is zzso to zzso zzso zzso and to the product of the zzso zzso a predicted zzso of unknown function in zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso of zzso zzso and to a newly identified putative zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are expressed zzso regardless of ambient zzso zzso in these genes affect growth at alkaline pH and zzso in both zzso zzso and in zzso zzso They affect zzso of zzso strains in zzso zzso only, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results highlight the conservation of the zzso zzso initially described in zzso zzso
