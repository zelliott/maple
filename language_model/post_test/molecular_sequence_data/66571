zzso proteins constitute a group of zzso nuclear basic proteins that have been shown to be related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso they usually replace the zzso zzso zzso complement during zzso hence their zzso Several of these proteins have been characterized to date in zzso organisms, but information about their occurrence and characterization in zzso is still zzso In this sense, the zzso zzso is unique, as it is the only known zzso that has its zzso zzso organized by virtually only zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso of this zzso is organized by two type I zzso proteins zzso and we characterize the major zzso component of the fish zzso zzso zzso red zzso The native zzso structure resulting from the association of these proteins with DNA was studied by zzso zzso zzso as well as electron zzso and X-ray zzso It is shown that the zzso proteins organize zzso in parallel DNA zzso of different thickness in a quite distinct arrangement that is reminiscent of the zzso organization of those organisms that contain zzso (but not zzso in their zzso
