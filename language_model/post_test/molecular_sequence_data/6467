To better understand the evolution of a key zzso pathway, we have zzso the zzso gene cluster of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The genes were cloned by zzso in zzso of zzso deletion strains of zzso zzso The new zzso together with earlier findings, establish that the zzso zzso of zzso has the order zzso which might represent the ancestral organization of the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso and zzso sequencing of their zzso products showed that their translation is initiated at the rate start zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso fusion protein is 43 zzso shorter than previously zzso zzso acid composition and sequence analyses of the protein products of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggest that these zzso zzso zzso proteins may be stabilized by additional salt bridges, compared with the zzso zzso Another notable feature is the predicted lack of the zzso zzso alpha 0 in the zzso of zzso zzso
