zzso checkpoints prevent zzso entry upon DNA damage or replication zzso by targeting the zzso regulators zzso and zzso Although zzso protein stability is regulated by zzso zzso the zzso pathways controlling zzso degradation have not been zzso In budding zzso stability of the zzso zzso zzso is controlled by a regulatory module consisting of the proteins zzso and zzso zzso synthetic lethal 1 and zzso which are targeted by the zzso checkpoint to prevent zzso degradation when budding is zzso We report here the identification of zzso zzso as a positive regulator of zzso that is controlled, instead, by an entirely distinct checkpoint, the DNA replication zzso Although zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso zzso overrode the replication checkpoint, accelerating zzso zzso zzso checkpoint zzso disrupted zzso zzso but binding was restored by active zzso zzso These data establish zzso as a component of the replication checkpoint and reveal that similar cell cycle control zzso can be zzso for use by distinct checkpoints in different zzso
