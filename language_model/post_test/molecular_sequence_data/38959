According to a recently proposed hypothesis, initiation of signal zzso via zzso depends on interactions of the engaged zzso with zzso membrane zzso zzso In this study, we describe a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso comprises a short zzso domain of 16 zzso acids and a zzso acid zzso tail containing ten zzso zzso that are likely zzso by zzso family zzso In zzso cell lines and in resting peripheral blood zzso T cells, zzso is expressed as a zzso zzso protein and binds the major negative regulator of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso After zzso of peripheral blood zzso T cells, zzso becomes rapidly zzso and zzso from zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells results in recruitment of zzso zzso altered zzso zzso activity, and impaired zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso T cell zzso zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor of activated T zzso These findings collectively suggest that in the absence of external zzso the zzso complex zzso negative regulatory signals and thus may help to keep resting T cells in a zzso zzso
