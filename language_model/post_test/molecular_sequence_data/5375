The 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso contains a binding site for the zzso protein that consists of two zzso internal zzso The zzso each comprise a loop of seven zzso bases opposing a single base zzso a zzso zzso The zzso zzso are located on opposite zzso distributed in a symmetrical manner about the intervening zzso zzso We have investigated the global zzso of this binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso duplexes interrupted by a single zzso box with a series of duplexes of the same length containing zzso zzso indicates that the individual boxes cause a substantial zzso of the zzso zzso estimated to be 90 zzso 10) zzso A series of zzso duplexes were constructed containing a zzso box separated from an A5 zzso by a duplex section of length between 3 and 21 zzso It was found that the zzso zzso of these species varied zzso indicating that the zzso box introduces a defined zzso into the zzso zzso rather than a point of zzso zzso experiments with the complete zzso binding element suggest that the zzso zzso of the two zzso boxes combine to give an approximately zzso 180 degrees change in duplex zzso
