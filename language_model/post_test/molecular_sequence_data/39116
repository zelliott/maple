zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso which takes place in different types of zzso systems and zzso zzso The zzso regulation of the zzso zzso which is complex and highly variable among different zzso reflects this zzso We recently isolated a zzso zzso factor, named zzso that is uniquely expressed in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso area, which together form the zzso zzso zzso This strict zzso and its coinciding induction of expression with the zzso gene during development suggested a possible role for this zzso factor in the control of the zzso zzso We report here the presence of a responsive element for zzso located at position zzso to zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso promoter zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso nuclear extracts demonstrated that this region binds zzso protein and zzso a zzso effect on the zzso zzso Depending on the cell type, the effect of zzso was an zzso to zzso enhancement of zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso cells, or a zzso repression in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso Despite the close association of the zzso site and the major zzso zzso element in the zzso zzso no interplay was found between zzso and zzso zzso zzso In combination with the orphan nuclear zzso zzso which is required for the induction of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter activity to zzso was enhanced in zzso zzso zzso alone displayed only very weak activity on the zzso promoter in this cell zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso protein zzso has the potential to act on the promoter of the zzso gene in a markedly cell zzso zzso This suggests that zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso
