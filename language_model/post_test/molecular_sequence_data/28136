The gene specifying the group A zzso zzso gene was cloned from an M type 49 strain of zzso zzso and shown to express in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the DNA zzso carrying zzso was determined and compared to that of the group C zzso gene zzso There is zzso sequence identity between the two zzso with highly zzso zzso and translation control zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the group A zzso zzso contains the same number of zzso acids as that of group C zzso with zzso sequence identity between the two zzso Among 440 zzso acid zzso specified by the coding zzso there are 62 zzso zzso with 45 zzso and 17 zzso zzso The zzso zzso are located in two major regions, spanning zzso 174 to zzso and zzso to zzso with 40 and 10 zzso acid changes, zzso The sequence differences provide an explanation at the molecular level for the previous findings of zzso and chemical zzso among zzso produced by zzso zzso
