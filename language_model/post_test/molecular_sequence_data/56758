A zzso zzso a zzso of human zzso has been isolated from a bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with zzso identity to the human zzso except that it lacks three of the consensus repeat zzso found in human zzso Human zzso expressed in zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso cells that binds to carbohydrates on zzso and zzso To determine if bovine zzso exhibits a similar binding activity, its zzso was expressed in zzso cells and the ability of the zzso to bind zzso human zzso leukemia cells was zzso The bovine zzso bound the zzso cells in a manner similar to human zzso indicating that the altered domain structure of bovine zzso does not affect zzso function in this in zzso cell zzso zzso
