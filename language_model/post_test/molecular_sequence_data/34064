zzso zzso virus zzso is the most important virus affecting zzso and zzso plants in tropical and zzso zzso zzso zzso are divided into zzso P and zzso both the P and W types naturally zzso plants in the family zzso whereas the P type naturally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the origin and nature of the zzso genetic diversity and evolution is critical for the zzso of control strategies based on zzso and the deployment of transgenic plants that show resistance to virus zzso highly similar to the zzso The molecular epidemiology of zzso was evaluated by analyzing the zzso sequence of the zzso protein zzso and helper zzso zzso genes of zzso from around the world, including newly characterized ones from Colombia and Venezuela, using a relaxed molecular zzso approach and a zzso zzso Our results confirm previous estimates on the origin of zzso around 400 years ago and suggest distinct zzso events from the Indian Peninsula to the rest of Asia, via zzso and subsequently to the zzso A historical reconstruction of the zzso and zzso characters in the zzso study supports the need to revise the hypothesis that zzso derives from zzso since our results suggest that the ancestral state could be either of the two zzso Moreover, estimates of epidemic growth predict an increasing genetic diversity of the virus over time that has direct implications for control strategies of zzso based on zzso and the use of transgenic zzso
