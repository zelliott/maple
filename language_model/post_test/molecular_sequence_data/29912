zzso analysis of the zzso virus zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso predicts that it codes for a zzso zzso zzso labeling of cells infected with zzso virus zzso that expressed the zzso open reading frame revealed several diffuse species of zzso of around zzso and 55,000 zzso A zzso zzso derived from zzso of mice zzso with zzso zzso the zzso protein made by the zzso virus zzso and also zzso a late envelope zzso with a mobility of zzso to 55,000 from zzso zzso zzso treatment of the zzso zzso product from zzso cells resulted in a zzso of 28 zzso closely agreeing with the predicted molecular mass for the unmodified zzso gene zzso Western zzso blots using zzso infected cells as a source of zzso showed that the majority of zzso individuals have a serum zzso response to the zzso zzso
