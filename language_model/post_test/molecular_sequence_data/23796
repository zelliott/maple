The tear film is complex and is rich in both peptides and zzso zzso factors have been shown to alter the balance of the protein components in the tear film, however, little is known of the precise stimuli that initiate these changes, or their nature and zzso Attention has been directed at the role of tear proteins in the protection of the external zzso surface, and their potential role in the zzso of inflammatory and zzso diseases, but few zzso proteins have been identified and demonstrated to offer a protective function at the zzso zzso The biological importance of zzso proteins is uncertain, although there is some evidence to indicate a potential zzso function for these proteins in zzso Despite the detection of zzso for zzso proteins in zzso zzso the translated protein product has not been detected in tear zzso In this study we investigate the presence of zzso proteins in the tear zzso Human zzso tear fluid was examined by zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso directly, and following size exclusion high performance liquid zzso This revealed significant levels of a truncated form of zzso zzso zzso and a series of peptides derived the zzso of this zzso None of these had previously been identified in zzso Our study highlights the dangers inherent in zzso strategies that assign an identity to a protein based on limited coverage of zzso zzso
