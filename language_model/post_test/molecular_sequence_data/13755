The mouse zzso zzso the zzso of the gene zzso in zzso syndrome, has been isolated and zzso the predicted zzso acid sequence is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso A distinct feature of the mouse gene is an expanded zzso zzso zzso repeat that codes for zzso and varies from 15 to 17 triplets in different zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of the mouse zzso gene is expressed as an approximately zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso mapping in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso placed the zzso locus near the zzso of the mouse X zzso inseparable from zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso makes zzso a candidate for involvement in zzso a T zzso fatal zzso disease of mice that has previously been proposed as a mouse zzso of zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso tissue samples indicated the presence of zzso zzso in liver and skin, presumably as a consequence of zzso zzso but non abnormalities in the amount or size of zzso zzso
