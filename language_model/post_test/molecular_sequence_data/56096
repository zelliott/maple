zzso clones zzso zinc finger motifs were isolated by screening human zzso and zzso zzso zzso libraries with zinc finger zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso clones were mapped in the human zzso by zzso zzso cell hybrid analysis and in some cases in zzso zzso zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso was previously mapped to zzso and is here shown by in zzso zzso and use of appropriate hybrids to map zzso to the zzso zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso to the zzso gene and between a constitutional zzso zzso on the zzso side and the zzso specific zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso mapped to zzso while zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso 19 carries many zzso zzso and other genes with zinc finger zzso zzso the zzso clone additionally detected a locus designated zzso which mapped to zzso region zzso most likely in the region zzso where the zzso and zzso zzso zzso
