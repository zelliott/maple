Moving zzso A recent model for zzso gating of zzso channels proposed that the four zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso (left) are in direct contact with the membrane lipids and move into the hydrocarbon core of the membrane during zzso It is demonstrated that the physical properties of the isolated zzso sequence (right) are sufficient to allow it to freely zzso across synthetic zzso
