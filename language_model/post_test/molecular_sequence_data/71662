zzso modification of LDL may be important in the initiation and/or progression of zzso but the precise mechanisms through which low density zzso zzso is oxidized are zzso Recently, evidence for the existence of zzso LDL in human zzso zzso has been reported, and zzso zzso which is thought to act through production of zzso has been identified in human zzso zzso In the present report we describe the formation of zzso zzso modifications in the zzso zzso by exposure of LDL to zzso in zzso In contrast with the complex mixture of peptides from zzso of LDL with zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso produced a major zzso zzso showing zzso at 365 zzso This zzso was isolated and characterized as zzso corresponding to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses of two zzso peptides from zzso of LDL by zzso indicated formation of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso zzso which suggest zzso to the corresponding zzso acids zzso by zzso The present results demonstrate that zzso modifications other than zzso and zzso can be formed in the zzso of proteins and illustrate how characterization of specific products of protein zzso can be useful in assessing the relative contributions of different and unexpected mechanisms to the zzso of LDL and other target zzso The data also suggest a direct interaction of the LDL particle with the active site on zzso and indicate that effects of the protein zzso can greatly influence product formation and zzso
