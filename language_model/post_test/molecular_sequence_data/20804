Using a zzso strategy we isolated from winter wheat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene coding for a modular protein constituted by an zzso domain called zzso found in several zzso zzso and a zzso domain related to zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript as well as native zzso levels increased during zzso and upon zzso zzso treatment of young zzso zzso transcript levels were kept constant either in infected zzso or in wounded samples indicating that zzso is not directly involved in plant zzso zzso The zzso protein was expressed in bacteria as a zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso zzso protein was further characterized using an affinity zzso approach based on its interaction with zzso zzso zzso tightly bound to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain and zzso zzso confirmed that zzso possesses zzso zzso binding zzso
