zzso of zzso zzso elaborate an zzso a two-dimensional protein zzso which covers the cell zzso The zzso protein zzso is zzso by a type I mechanism zzso on a zzso zzso and is unusual among type I zzso proteins because high levels of protein are produced zzso In efforts to adapt the zzso for display of foreign peptides and zzso we noted a zzso activity that affected zzso zzso with foreign zzso The zzso was precise, resulting in fragments with an zzso zzso zzso We developed an zzso to screen for loss of this activity zzso presentation of foreign peptides without zzso using zzso and traditional zzso A zzso gene designated sap zzso zzso was identified which could complement the zzso zzso The zzso half of zzso possessed significant similarity to other type I zzso zzso zzso alkaline zzso of zzso zzso including the characteristic zzso repeat zzso but the zzso half which normally includes the type I zzso signal exhibited no such zzso Instead, there was a region of significant similarity to the zzso region of zzso We zzso that zzso evolved by combining the zzso portion of a type I zzso zzso with an zzso zzso perhaps to associate with nascent zzso zzso to zzso for zzso
