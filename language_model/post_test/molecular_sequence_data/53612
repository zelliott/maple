The mechanism by which receptors activate G proteins is unclear because a connection between the zzso and the zzso binding site has not been zzso To investigate this zzso we evaluated the roles in zzso interaction of three potential zzso contact sites in zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso loop and zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso loop do not affect zzso by the zzso zzso However, replacement of five zzso zzso in the zzso loop region with the zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso of zzso and increases the affinity of zzso for this zzso The zzso do not alter zzso zzso binding or zzso or zzso by aluminum zzso indicating that the effects on zzso interaction are not due to a zzso of the zzso bound zzso In a model of the zzso protein complex, the zzso loop maps near the second and third zzso zzso of the zzso The effects of the zzso zzso suggest that the zzso zzso may be zzso contact sites that are zzso to ensure the zzso of zzso protein zzso Furthermore, the zzso region zzso to an exchange factor contact site in both zzso and zzso suggesting that the mechanisms by which zzso receptors and exchange factors catalyze zzso exchange may share common zzso
