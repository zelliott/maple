Human zzso B zzso is a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Its zzso makes it potentially zzso in cancer zzso However, the effectiveness of zzso can be hampered by the zzso expression of a natural protein zzso human zzso zzso zzso Here, we used zzso approaches to identify zzso zzso that can affect its binding to zzso without significantly decreasing its zzso zzso zzso calculations allowed us to identify zzso of zzso important for the interaction with zzso Some zzso were selected, and molecular dynamic simulations on the zzso zzso in complex with zzso in zzso solution were carried out to investigate the effect of these zzso on the stability of the zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly zzso the interaction of the protein with zzso zzso all of these zzso also retained their activity in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor in subsequent in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In particular, the activity of zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso is very similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso emerges as a promising species for zzso therapy zzso
