The zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate the activity and stability of the tumor zzso protein zzso cellular process initiated by zzso and/or zzso binding to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso in many tumors zzso zzso zzso and tumor survival, and are important molecular targets for zzso zzso We screened a zzso zzso zzso library against zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso and zzso chemically zzso via native chemical zzso and identified several zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The most potent inhibitor zzso termed zzso bound to zzso and zzso at low zzso zzso 2 orders of magnitude stronger than the zzso zzso zzso of the same length zzso We solved the crystal structures of synthetic zzso and zzso both in complex with zzso at zzso A zzso Comparative structural analysis identified an extensive, tightened zzso zzso network in bound zzso that contributed to its zzso stability, thus enhanced binding to the 2 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Pro of zzso induced formation of a zzso zzso in zzso previously unseen in the structures of zzso zzso or zzso Our findings zzso the structural basis for zzso zzso zzso of zzso interactions with zzso and zzso shedding new light on zzso rational design of different classes of zzso zzso for potential therapeutic zzso
