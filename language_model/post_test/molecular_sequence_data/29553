zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso synthesis or zzso It has two zzso zzso and zzso both genes of which are on zzso zzso Their similar zzso structures suggest the two genes arose by gene zzso Both genes are expressed at higher levels in some normal human zzso compared to matching tumor zzso zzso for zzso exist on zzso 2, 3 and zzso No zzso was identified for zzso Both zzso inclusion and zzso skipping were found to zzso regulate zzso gene zzso No alternative zzso was identified for zzso Overall, the results suggest that the two zzso of zzso arose by gene zzso but the resulting genes are zzso zzso
