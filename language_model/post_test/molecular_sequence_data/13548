Base zzso which is required for correction of spontaneous zzso and zzso damage to DNA as well as zzso inflicted by zzso agents, is a relatively well understood repair zzso zzso factors involved in this zzso are zzso with emphasis on current zzso Most DNA replication and repair zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have direct counterparts in zzso In contrast, the abundant zzso in zzso cell zzso that bind and are activated specifically by DNA strand zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso have not been detected in zzso nor has zzso which is elevated in response to DNA strand zzso We have found a family of four distinct DNA zzso in human cell zzso whereas only a single DNA zzso has been detected in zzso It would appear that the cellular responses to DNA strand breaks may differ markedly between higher and lower zzso
