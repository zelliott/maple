In certain combinations of donor and recipient rat zzso such as zzso zzso donors into zzso zzso recipients, rejection after zzso liver transplantation zzso is overcome without zzso drugs, although other zzso transplanted between these combinations are promptly zzso The mechanisms involved in achieving drug-free liver zzso tolerance still remain poorly zzso In the present study, zzso zzso into zzso serum from various zzso times was zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and two unique proteins of 40 zzso and 37 zzso were found to be in large zzso in 60 day zzso zzso These proteins could only be detected at specific times after zzso in the zzso into zzso combination and could not be detected in the serum of zzso transplanted animals zzso into zzso and zzso into zzso zzso combinations zzso into zzso requiring zzso treatment or induced by other organ zzso When these proteins were zzso and zzso they were found to have an identical zzso sequence which is not listed in sequence zzso Mixed zzso zzso revealed that only the 40 zzso protein has a zzso capability which additionally appears to be donor zzso The 40 zzso protein will aid further in the understanding of how drug-free tolerance is attained in certain liver zzso and may also act as a marker of when treatment with conventional zzso drugs can be stopped in clinical zzso providing a zzso of the zzso can be zzso This possibility appears likely as case reports already exist of patients who have successfully been able to cease treatment with such zzso
