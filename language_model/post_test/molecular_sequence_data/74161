zzso the first zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study we report a modified approach for high-level expression of zzso which allows us to evaluate its differential potency on the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a specific resistance zzso strain to plant zzso by using different zzso The results presented here show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso is resistant to our zzso zzso zzso survival rates of zzso larvae infected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso further confirm the key zzso role of zzso in zzso The absence of activity against zzso suggests a mechanical zzso between zzso and plant zzso which provides additional evidence in favor of their zzso zzso Furthermore, the existence of zzso molecules in zzso suggests that all these peptides could originate from a common ancestry rather than horizontal gene transfer between plants and insects, which is further strengthened by the zzso origin of these peptides from plants, zzso and zzso
