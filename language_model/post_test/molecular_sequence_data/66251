A new isolate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that produces a novel zzso of zzso zzso was isolated from soil collected in northeastern zzso zzso was composed of zzso zzso acids and had a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a single copy of the gene coding for this zzso was located on a approximately zzso zzso When zzso by the zzso strain, zzso produced a unique, zzso zzso crystal whose long and short axes were both approximately 1 zzso long, which gave it a zzso appearance in wet mount zzso In diet incorporation zzso the 50% lethal zzso of the zzso complex were zzso and zzso zzso zzso for second- and zzso larvae of the cabbage zzso zzso zzso respectively, but the isolate was essentially nontoxic to larvae of the beet zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso preparations showed no evidence of zzso activity, indicating that toxicity was due primarily to zzso Studies of the zzso of isolate zzso in zzso larvae of zzso zzso showed that after zzso death the zzso zzso and subsequently zzso extensively throughout the zzso suggesting that other bacteria inhabiting the zzso zzso played little if any role in zzso As zzso zzso is among the most destructive zzso of vegetable crops in North America and has developed resistance to zzso zzso this new isolate may have applied zzso
