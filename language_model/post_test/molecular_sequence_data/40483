An zzso approach combining zzso and zzso methods was used to characterize the zzso zzso through the outer membrane of zzso zzso Two novel members of the General zzso zzso family of zzso named zzso and zzso were identified in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in growth media, several resistant derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso These zzso strains showed significant decrease of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso to study their zzso characteristics and their interactions with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso through zzso and zzso indicated that the strength of interaction decreased in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of these antibiotics through zzso was more efficient than through zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso coli strain zzso was associated with a higher zzso zzso of the zzso coli cells to zzso compared with expression of zzso All our data zzso the involvement of zzso in the resistance of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
