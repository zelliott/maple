zzso X receptors zzso along with zzso acid zzso receptors zzso mediate the effects of zzso on gene zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which bind to and are activated by the zzso zzso of zzso have been zzso They activate gene zzso by binding to specific sites on DNA as zzso or as zzso with zzso and other related nuclear zzso including the vitamin D zzso zzso hormone receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from zebra fish zzso libraries are described here; although both zzso form zzso zzso with zzso and zzso neither binds zzso zzso and both are zzso inactive on zzso response zzso In zzso studies with zzso the delta zzso was found to function in a dominant negative manner, while the zzso zzso had a slight zzso effect on zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso The discovery of these two novel receptors in zebra fish expands the functional repertoire of zzso to include zzso and dominant negative zzso of type II zzso zzso
