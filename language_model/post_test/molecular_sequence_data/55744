The zzso patterns of human zzso spread on a glass surface are zzso zzso is arranged in patterns of parallel zzso zzso forming zzso or zzso radiating zzso from a central zzso or zzso zzso a zzso zzso is located at both ends of the zzso In zzso with zzso radiating zzso zzso patches are aligned on the branches of a zzso zzso The spirals are always zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins usually associated with focal contacts in tissue culture cells, are not concentrated at the ends of zzso in human zzso It is suggested that the distribution of zzso is due to competitive zzso of zzso close to the inner leaflet of the zzso plasma membrane and that sites of zzso linkage are important for generating zzso zzso of biological zzso
