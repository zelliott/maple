zzso methods have zzso the classical genetic techniques biologists use to assign function to zzso Here, we describe construction of a zzso interaction trap that uses zzso cells to register more complex protein relationships than those detected in existing zzso zzso We show that such cells can identify bridge or connecting proteins and zzso zzso that discriminate between closely related zzso zzso The protein relationships detected by these cells are analogous to classical genetic zzso but lend themselves to systematic application to the products of entire zzso and zzso zzso We show that, by performing logical operations on the zzso zzso of these complex cells and existing zzso cells, we can make zzso about the zzso and order of protein zzso Finally, we show that cells that register such relationships can perform logical operations on protein zzso Thus these cells will be useful for analysis of gene and zzso function, and may also define a path for construction of biological zzso zzso
