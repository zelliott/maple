zzso programmed cell death zzso is intimately linked with disease resistance and zzso However, the molecular components regulating zzso including hypersensitive and susceptible cell death, are largely unknown in zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso hypersensitive induced reaction 1 zzso and zzso repeat 1 zzso function as distinct plant zzso regulators in pepper plants during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein gel zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso specifically binds to the zzso zzso in pepper zzso zzso of zzso triggered zzso cell death in pepper and zzso zzso plants but not in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso and zzso distinctly strengthened and compromised hypersensitive and susceptible cell death in pepper plants, zzso zzso salicylic acid levels and zzso gene transcripts were elevated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso repeat and hypersensitive induced reaction proteins may act as zzso regulators associated with plant immunity and zzso
