In zzso zzso and zzso are critical regulators of checkpoint responses to damaged and incompletely zzso zzso These checkpoint responses involve the zzso of signaling pathways that inhibit the replication of zzso with DNA zzso In this study, we describe the isolation of a zzso zzso a full-length version of zzso zzso Using zzso against the regulatory domain of zzso we have identified the essential replication protein zzso as an zzso protein in zzso egg zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso at zzso in response to the presence of zzso DNA breaks or DNA replication blocks in egg zzso This zzso involved both zzso and zzso but the relative contribution of each zzso depended upon the zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso directly at zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso the checkpoint response that blocks zzso DNA replication in egg extracts containing zzso DNA zzso These experiments indicate that zzso and zzso zzso the functionally critical replication protein zzso during both DNA damage and replication checkpoint responses in zzso egg zzso
