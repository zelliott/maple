We describe two zzso of the zzso zzso metal zzso zzso for zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have a high nutritional and zzso demand for zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso are identical in all but the zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences share at least zzso identity with zzso zzso of humans, mice, and rats, and at least zzso identity with zzso from mice, humans and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso eggs, zzso zzso zzso and adults, whereas zzso is expressed in all but the zzso and occurs at lower levels than zzso in zzso eggs and zzso An zzso element, present at the zzso region of many zzso zzso is not present in zzso zzso studied zzso A Western zzso analysis of adult zzso preparations using a zzso rabbit serum raised against a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso serum raised against zzso zzso revealed a band zzso 115 zzso By zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso primarily to the zzso Iron zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso were able to rescue zzso growth in zzso zzso deficient zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso express molecules for zzso iron transport in their zzso suggesting zzso transport as one means of iron acquisition for these zzso
