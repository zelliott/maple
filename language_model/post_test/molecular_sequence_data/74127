The genetic basis of primary angle closure glaucoma zzso has yet to be zzso zzso characteristics related to zzso such as short zzso eyes with shallow anterior chambers suggest the involvement of genes that regulate zzso zzso zzso a retinal zzso gene associated with zzso and zzso the zzso zzso protein gene underlying zzso zzso represent good candidate genes for zzso due to the association with small zzso To investigate the possible involvement of zzso and zzso in zzso we zzso both genes in zzso patients with small zzso zzso 

One hundred and eight Chinese patients with zzso lengths measuring zzso zzso or less were selected for zzso zzso zzso and zzso control subjects were also zzso zzso DNA was extracted from zzso of peripheral blood samples, and the zzso of zzso and zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso and subjected to zzso sequencing and zzso 

All study patients were Chinese with a mean age of zzso years zzso zzso There were 77 females zzso zzso out of the one hundred and eight subjects had previous symptomatic zzso and 59 had zzso zzso The mean zzso length was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified a possible zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulting in zzso substitution in one zzso This zzso was not found in 215 normal zzso Several zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso 

Our results do not support a significant role for zzso or zzso zzso in zzso
