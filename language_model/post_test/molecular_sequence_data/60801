DNA ring closure methods have been applied to zzso box DNA and its complex with the zzso zzso protein zzso The J factors for zzso zzso zzso of one DNA end about the zzso have been measured using zzso zzso with and without bound zzso for 18 DNA zzso containing the zzso major late promoter zzso box zzso separated by a variable zzso phasing adapter from zzso zzso DNA zzso Six phasing lengths were used at three overall DNA lengths zzso zzso zzso were also measured in the absence of protein for the same set of molecules bearing a zzso zzso box zzso The results suggest that the zzso box DNA itself is strongly bent and zzso flexible, in a direction opposite to the bend induced by zzso and that the zzso zzso box is much less zzso The zzso and flexibility of the free DNA may govern the zzso of recognition of different DNA sequences by zzso and the intrinsic bend may act to repress zzso complex assembly in the absence of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso complexes in solution predict a geometry generally consistent with crystal structures, which show dramatic zzso and zzso The novel observation of zzso zzso suggests that this zzso approach is able to distinguish zzso unwinding from writhe zzso cancel out in larger zzso and this in turn suggests that changes in zzso in small zzso zzso can control zzso zzso
