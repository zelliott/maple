This paper investigates the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso using the bait region of the alpha zzso inhibitor as a zzso The bacterial zzso zzso the zzso bond of the zzso inhibitor and the zzso zzso inhibitor and the zzso bond of the zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso values of 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at the zzso position with a significantly lower rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The pH optimum for the zzso of the native, the zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso are, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso readily zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and that its pH optimum is not as alkaline as usually zzso
