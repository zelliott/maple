A panel of mouse zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso and three primer binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt, zzso zzso zzso zzso Sorensen, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Pedersen, zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed for the occurrence of zzso between the zzso input virus and zzso zzso sequences within the zzso leader zzso Evidence of zzso within the region studied was found in 14 of 52 tumors zzso zzso analysis of a approximately zzso zzso of 44 zzso zzso encompassing the zzso the primer binding site, and the upstream part of the zzso untranslated region, enabled us to map zzso sites, guided by distinct scattered zzso zzso In 30 of 44 analyzed zzso zzso was mapped to a zzso similarity window coinciding with the zzso zzso motif implicated in zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso pattern preference found in zzso viruses from zzso tumors is very similar to the pattern previously reported for zzso zzso in cell culture zzso The data therefore sustain the hypothesis that the kissing loop, presumably via a role in zzso zzso formation, constitutes a hot spot for reverse zzso zzso in zzso
