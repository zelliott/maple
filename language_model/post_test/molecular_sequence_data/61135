The sequences and predicted secondary structures of the four zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso and have similar secondary structures, except at the 3' end where zzso contains a large zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso 1 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with which it shares the same location, high zzso identity in the core, and an zzso placed zzso that shows zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and shows similarities to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and is remarkably similar to the T4 zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, a zzso version of zzso is located in the zzso region between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso All four zzso contain zzso which potentially code for basic proteins of zzso zzso The zzso in zzso 2 and 3 contain zzso of the zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso is zzso whereas the zzso zzso is zzso and zzso with the upstream zzso The zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso and possibly a zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso have multiple origins, and illustrate some of the evolutionary DNA dynamics associated with zzso zzso in zzso
