Human zzso which has been cloned recently, is a new structural type of weak inward zzso zzso zzso Here we report the structural and functional properties of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite a low zzso acid identity between zzso and zzso zzso zzso both channel proteins share the same overall structural arrangement consisting of two zzso zzso and four zzso segments zzso This structural similarity does not give rise to a functional zzso zzso currents generated by zzso are inwardly zzso while zzso currents generated by zzso are zzso zzso These channels have a zzso of 14 zzso zzso currents are insensitive to pharmacological agents that block zzso activity such as zzso and zzso zzso inhibitions of zzso activity are observed after zzso of protein zzso A and zzso zzso currents are sensitive to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed in most zzso and is particularly abundant in the lung and in the zzso Its zzso in this latter tissue has been studied by in zzso zzso zzso expression is high in the zzso bulb, zzso and zzso These results provide the first evidence for the existence of a zzso channel family with four zzso and two pore zzso in the nervous system of zzso They also show that different members in this structural family can have totally different functional zzso
