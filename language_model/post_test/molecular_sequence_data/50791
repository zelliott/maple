zzso zzso of the available zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and comparison with the crystal structure of zzso zzso indicate that two highly zzso regions are of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on these zzso were used in the zzso chain reaction to amplify a 309 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso for use as an zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso library, and sequencing revealed an zzso frame of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso This protein shares zzso identity with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain with zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso domain with zzso zzso indicates the presence of several functionally zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was shown to contain no zzso
