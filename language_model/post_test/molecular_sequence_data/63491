The aim of the present study was to purify and characterize classic pancreatic zzso from the zzso turtle zzso 

The zzso was zzso from the fresh zzso extract followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and a zzso zzso zzso 

Turtle pancreatic zzso is a zzso zzso and it contains only 1 free zzso Its activity is maximum at pH zzso and 37 degrees zzso A specific activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured zzso on zzso and olive oil zzso zzso Natural zzso act as potent zzso of zzso and zzso restores the zzso When the zzso is inhibited by synthetic zzso simultaneous addition of zzso and zzso zzso is required to restore the zzso zzso The critical surface pressure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to the one of human zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso zzso 

The results presented in this article indicate that despite the primitive character of the turtle, no significant difference has been observed between zzso and known zzso zzso However, partial zzso of zzso with zzso shows the absence of the zzso zzso identified as the zzso domain in the case of many classic zzso
