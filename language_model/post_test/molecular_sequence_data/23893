The simplicity and sensitivity of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso have increased its application in recent zzso The most common method of zzso mass zzso analysis often does not provide robust zzso Additional sequence information, obtained by zzso zzso or collision induced zzso provides additional constraints for database zzso However, de zzso sequencing by mass zzso is not yet common practice, most likely because of the difficulties associated with the interpretation of high and low energy zzso zzso Success with this type of sequencing requires full sequence coverage and demands better quality zzso than those typically used for data base zzso In this report we show that full-length de zzso sequencing is possible using zzso zzso zzso The interpretation of zzso data is facilitated by zzso zzso after protection of zzso side chains zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1999, 96, zzso Reliable de zzso sequence analysis has been obtained using zzso quantities of peptides and zzso sequences of up to 16 zzso acid zzso in length have been zzso The simple, predictable fragmentation pattern allows routine de zzso zzso either manually or using zzso zzso of the complete primary structure of a zzso is often hindered because of differences in fragmentation efficiencies and in specific fragmentation patterns for different zzso These differences are controlled by various structural parameters including the nature of the zzso zzso The influence of the presence of internal zzso zzso and basic zzso on the zzso fragmentation pattern will be discussed, both for zzso and zzso zzso
