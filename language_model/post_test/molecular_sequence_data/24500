zzso syndrome zzso is characterized by prenatal and zzso growth zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 has been reported in some zzso zzso zzso is an imprinted gene on zzso zzso that is expressed only from the paternal zzso and is a candidate gene for zzso To clarify its biological function and role in zzso we screened zzso abnormalities in 15 zzso patients from various zzso In the zzso of zzso patients, no zzso expression patterns of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were detected when they were compared with normal zzso zzso sequence analysis failed to detect any zzso in the zzso alpha coding region, and there were no significant zzso in the zzso upstream region containing the predicted promoter and the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns of the zzso island for zzso alpha were normally maintained and resulted in the same pattern as in the normal control, suggesting that there was no loss of zzso These findings suggest that zzso can be excluded as a major zzso of zzso
