zzso gene transfer into primitive zzso cells has been difficult to achieve in zzso zzso We have developed an zzso producer clone that generates greater than zzso zzso zzso particles zzso zzso per zzso of culture zzso zzso zzso monkey bone-marrow cells were zzso with either high (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso or low (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso producer clones for 4-6 days and zzso into zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was detected in blood and bone-marrow cells from all three animals zzso with cells zzso with the zzso producer zzso In contrast, three animals zzso with bone zzso zzso with the zzso producer clone exhibited no evidence of gene zzso
