zzso and zzso members of the family of zzso group zzso domain zzso factors, are both essential for zzso formation during human embryonic zzso The zzso domain is a zzso and zzso motif zzso about 80 zzso acid zzso It has been shown that zzso and zzso are nuclear zzso Using normal or zzso zzso and zzso fusion proteins in zzso studies involving zzso cells, we have identified two nuclear zzso signals zzso within the zzso zzso of both proteins that can independently direct the fusion proteins into the zzso Only zzso zzso of both zzso motifs resulted in complete exclusion of the fusion proteins from the zzso The zzso sequences are located at the N and C zzso of the zzso domain and are a zzso zzso motif and a basic cluster zzso zzso zzso Both zzso motifs are zzso in the zzso zzso of other zzso zzso The implications of the present results are discussed regarding zzso the apparent dual function of certain basic zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain of zzso in both DNA binding and in nuclear zzso and zzso the possible control of zzso in early zzso differentiation at the level of nuclear zzso
