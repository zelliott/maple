zzso diseases belong to a group of neurodegenerative disorders affecting humans and zzso The human diseases include zzso zzso disease zzso zzso syndrome zzso and fatal familial zzso zzso The zzso of the prion diseases are not yet zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso would provide valuable tools in zzso as well as in basic research of these zzso In contrast to conventional strategies we have developed an zzso protocol based on zzso acid injection into non tolerant zzso DNA or zzso coding for different human prion proteins including the zzso sequences associated with zzso zzso and zzso were injected into muscle zzso The mice were primarily zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso either with DNA, zzso or zzso zzso Forest virus zzso particles expressing zzso After zzso preparation, different zzso against prion proteins were obtained and their binding zzso was zzso by zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso Our zzso are directed against four different linear zzso and may also recognize zzso regions of the native prion zzso It could, therefore, be demonstrated that zzso of non tolerant mice with DNA and live attenuated zzso virus is a valuable means to induce a broad immune response leading eventually to the generation of a panel of zzso for basic science as well as for zzso
