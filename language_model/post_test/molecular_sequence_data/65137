zzso of several key zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is considered to contribute to the zzso zzso present in many zzso zzso zzso stabilize zzso filaments against the gel severing actions of proteins such as zzso Among multiple zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso stress fibers and functions as a zzso of zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso effects and tumor suppression remain poorly zzso We have hypothesized that the ability of zzso to stabilize zzso is crucial for tumor zzso In this study, by employing a zzso zzso which contains an zzso zzso zzso tag, we demonstrate that the N zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso Unlike the wild type zzso the modified protein fails to restore stress fibers and inhibit zzso growth in transformed zzso Furthermore, the zzso modification of zzso zzso the zzso and delays zzso in normal cells, zzso binding to zzso and zzso the zzso associations in zzso The functionally defective zzso allows the association of zzso to stress fibers and zzso the zzso whereas wild type zzso appears to restrict the binding of zzso to stress zzso zzso zzso reorganization appears to be zzso through preventing zzso interaction with zzso Our studies provide in zzso functional evidence that the N zzso is a critical zzso of zzso functions, which in turn determines the organization of stress zzso
