We have isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to explore the zzso stability and zzso zzso of this zzso and to identify zzso recipients for a zzso genetic transformation zzso Positive selection of spontaneous zzso resistant to zzso yielded zzso zzso with zzso of between zzso and zzso per sensitive, viable zzso Four different, zzso zzso sequences zzso were identified at different positions within the zzso zzso locus of these zzso They ranged in size from zzso to zzso zzso and possessed properties typical of known zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso repeats, zzso duplicated target zzso and putative zzso genes zzso motifs that are indicative of the zzso IS element zzso Between 12 and 25 copies of each IS element were found in zzso zzso by Southern zzso While characteristic fingerprint patterns created by IS zzso zzso were observed with zzso DNA of different zzso zzso zzso no zzso sequences were identified in DNA of other zzso strains of the order zzso
