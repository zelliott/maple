zzso receptors and their zzso zzso are highly zzso protein families which play important roles in targeting zzso and zzso zzso In this study we have examined the functional roles of two major zzso sites, zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso constitute major zzso sites in zzso zzso was zzso to the highest zzso suggesting that zzso at this site may have a zzso important zzso Upon conservative zzso of zzso located in the zzso zzso domain, the zzso activity of zzso was zzso reduced both in zzso and in zzso whereas a zzso at zzso in the zzso domain did not impair the zzso zzso zzso In zzso binding experiments revealed that zzso at zzso in zzso mediates the preferential binding to zzso domain rather than zzso and Ras zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Additionally, a high level of zzso was detected in zzso zzso in intact cells, indicating that zzso and zzso can physically associate in zzso In contrast, the association of full-length zzso to zzso containing zzso at either zzso or zzso was greatly zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso is critical for determining the association with zzso whereas the integrity of zzso zzso is required for efficient zzso at zzso as well as other major zzso Finally, it was observed that cell attachment responses are attenuated by zzso of wild type zzso zzso but to much less extent by zzso zzso lacking zzso at either zzso or zzso Furthermore, transient expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells blocked cell attachment responses attenuated by the zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso zzso is one of the major downstream targets for the zzso signaling zzso leading to a modification of cell zzso and that zzso at zzso is critical for positively regulating the zzso signaling zzso
