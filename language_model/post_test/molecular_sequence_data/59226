The zzso zzso divide the labor of zzso and zzso genetic functions between two distinct zzso The development of the zzso zzso nucleus from the zzso zzso nucleus occurs during sexual reproduction and involves zzso genetic reorganization including zzso zzso breakage and DNA zzso This intriguing process has been extensively studied in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso putative protein factors, and possible reaction zzso has begun to shed light on the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso This article summarizes the current understanding of this phenomenon and discusses its origin and biological zzso We zzso that zzso nuclear restructuring serves to segregate the two essential functions of zzso the transmission and expression of genetic zzso
