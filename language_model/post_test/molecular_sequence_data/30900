Juvenile zzso zzso is a rare neurodegenerative disorder closely related to zzso disease but of later onset and more protracted zzso The zzso zzso lies in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from patient A zzso an zzso which could acquire zzso zzso and be zzso but which failed to associate with the zzso to form the zzso active zzso By contrast, zzso from patient B zzso an zzso that was retained in the zzso zzso To identify the molecular basis of the disorder, zzso from zzso of these two patients was zzso and the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso in four overlapping zzso The zzso fragments were zzso and shown by sequence analysis to contain a G to A transition corresponding to substitution of zzso for zzso at position 504 in the case of patient A and at position zzso in the case of patient zzso The zzso were confirmed by zzso of zzso zzso to zzso fragments of DNA corresponding to zzso 13 of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found on both zzso of patient A as well as of another unrelated zzso the zzso of this zzso zzso is attributable to zzso in the two zzso The zzso zzso was found in patient B in compound zzso with a common infantile zzso zzso There is additional zzso in juvenile zzso zzso as neither zzso was found in the DNA of a fourth zzso The zzso zzso at positions zzso and 504 are located at zzso zzso which are known to be zzso zzso zzso
