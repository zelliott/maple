To analyze the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso resonance energy zzso zzso zzso between the family A zzso zzso and zzso and zzso as well as their respective zzso zzso We observed zzso induced interaction of both zzso and zzso with the activated zzso zzso In zzso experiments, we observed zzso to interact with the activated zzso in a zzso manner while zzso zzso in a zzso manner with the low affinity phase corresponding to zzso affinity for zzso zzso induced zzso interaction with the zzso was dependent on intact zzso whereas the high affinity phase of zzso interaction was independent of zzso zzso We were surprised to find that the zzso zzso experiments indicated that before zzso zzso the full-length zzso zzso but not a functional zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in a relatively zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso can compete for zzso induced zzso interaction with the zzso zzso whereas zzso does not compete for zzso interaction with zzso We suggest that zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso and that zzso rather than zzso is a key player in competitive regulation of zzso zzso specific interaction with the zzso zzso
