The term zzso editing is generally used to describe those molecular processes in which the information content is altered in an zzso zzso This process is not limited to zzso since zzso of zzso zzso have also been zzso zzso editing exists extensively in the higher plant zzso and is the necessary step for forming functional zzso In this paper, the research materials are the zzso male zzso line zzso zzso line zzso and F1 hybrid zzso of zzso zzso 15 editing sites are found in the transcripts of zzso by comparing zzso and zzso zzso zzso and F1 have same zzso zzso When editing occurs at the first or second position of zzso the zzso zzso acid is likely to be zzso As a result, the conservation of the predicted protein is improved as compared with other zzso
