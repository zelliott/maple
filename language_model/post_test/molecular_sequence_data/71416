We have isolated a zzso coding a new organic zzso zzso zzso expressed specifically in rat zzso The zzso zzso had an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid protein zzso molecular mass of 55 zzso that shows zzso identity with the rat zzso organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analyses revealed that the zzso zzso was expressed predominantly in the zzso convoluted zzso zzso straight zzso and cortical collecting zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso organic zzso such as zzso methotrexate, zzso and zzso zzso although its zzso zzso transported zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso each zzso was localized functionally to the zzso zzso and showed transport activity similar to that in the zzso Moreover, the zzso of preloaded zzso was also enhanced across the zzso membrane in zzso zzso The zzso transport by zzso cells showed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several organic zzso zzso zzso cardiac zzso and steroids had potent zzso effects on the zzso zzso transport in the zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso in zzso transport of zzso zzso compounds in the zzso
