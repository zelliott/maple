zzso are a zzso family of proteins with robust effects in promoting zzso nucleation and zzso However, the mechanisms restraining zzso activities in cells to generate zzso networks with particular dynamics and zzso are not well zzso In zzso zzso assemble zzso cables, which serve as tracks for zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso to decrease rates of zzso filament zzso which is distinct from the zzso displacement activity of zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso demonstrates that this zzso mechanism is critical for maintaining proper zzso cable architecture, zzso and zzso We directly observe zzso being transported by zzso V and zzso pausing at the neck in a manner dependent on zzso These observations suggest that zzso is part of a negative feedback mechanism that detects cable length and prevents zzso
