zzso zzso is associated with the zzso and zzso zzso We have previously narrowed down the critical region most likely to contain the psoriasis zzso gene to 111 zzso spanning 89 zzso to 200 zzso zzso of the zzso locus by zzso zzso This segment includes three known genes zzso zzso and zzso and four new expressed zzso Among them, zzso zzso is the cell growth regulated gene possibly with zzso zzso Since psoriasis zzso is a common skin disorder characterized by zzso of zzso cells, it is tempting to speculate that the zzso gene is one of the strong candidate genes responsible for the development of psoriasis zzso Here, we investigated genetic zzso in the zzso gene by direct DNA sequencing and zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three single zzso zzso in zzso 2, two of which are accompanied by zzso zzso were zzso Further, one zzso deletion zzso was detected around the zzso site of the zzso structure necessary for zzso zzso in zzso zzso No significant difference in the zzso or zzso distribution at these four zzso sites was observed between the patients with psoriasis zzso and healthy zzso This suggests that the susceptible gene for psoriasis zzso is not the zzso gene itself, although a unique zzso zzso was identified in the zzso
