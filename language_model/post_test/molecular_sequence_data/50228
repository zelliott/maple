We performed zzso cloning of genes carried on zzso artificial zzso that span a human zzso zzso associated with a human disease and isolated by chance human and bovine genes with strong zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso We report here sequence analysis, expression data, and functional studies for this human zzso gene zzso and its bovine zzso zzso Despite strong zzso at the zzso acid level, zzso is not capable of zzso the zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, in contrast to zzso itself, a fusion protein consisting of the DNA binding domain of zzso and zzso did not zzso a reporter gene downstream of zzso binding sites in a zzso expression zzso The strong similarity between zzso and these zzso and zzso genes suggest that the zzso genes are part of an zzso zzso family that has been implicated as global zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso but whose function in zzso remains zzso
