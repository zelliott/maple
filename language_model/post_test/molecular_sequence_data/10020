Using zzso isolated from zzso zzso we have mapped the zzso I hypersensitive sites zzso residing within the zzso regions of the zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso within the 5 zzso upstream region of the cardiac zzso gene were zzso One of the zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso zzso zzso region and the other to the zzso promoter zzso We further localized the zzso zzso site to a range of 250 zzso zzso zzso muscle regulatory motifs were found within the zzso zzso site, consisting of three zzso one zzso site, one zzso zzso one zzso box and one zzso zzso zzso zzso This cluster of regulatory elements is zzso similar to a cluster found in the zzso of the mouse muscle zzso zzso gene zzso to zzso The specific interaction of the motifs within the zzso zzso site and the cardiac nuclear proteins was demonstrated using gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis revealed a significant increase in zzso zzso activity when the zzso zzso site was linked to a zzso zzso These results suggest that previously undefined regulatory elements of the zzso gene may be associated with the zzso zzso zzso
