zzso zones have yielded considerable insight into many evolutionary zzso including zzso and the maintenance of species zzso Presented here are analyses from a hybrid zone that occurs among three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the southern Appalachian zzso Using a novel statistical approach for analysis of zzso zzso hybrid zones, we examined spatial patterns of variation at four zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso gene and the nuclear DNA zzso zzso and the zzso markers of red cheek pigmentation and white zzso zzso of the zzso marker and both zzso markers across four zzso is zzso In three of the four zzso however, the pattern of zzso is zzso from all other zzso with a higher representation of zzso zzso in the northern and lower zzso localities than is expected given the zzso marker and zzso To explore whether climate plays a role in the position of the hybrid zone, we created ecological niche models for zzso and zzso zzso results suggest that hybrid zone position is not determined by steep zzso in zzso suitability for either zzso Instead, the hybrid zone lies in a zzso zzso region that is broadly suitable for both zzso and zzso We discuss various selective zzso selection associated with zzso and zzso processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that might explain the zzso in the extent to which zzso and nuclear DNA and zzso traits have moved across this hybrid zzso
