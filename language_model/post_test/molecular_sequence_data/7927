Three plant zzso zzso zzso have been isolated by zzso of a zzso zzso with a zzso library derived from the tropical forage zzso zzso zzso Two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that mediate the zzso of zzso by plant roots from low zzso of zzso in the soil zzso The third, zzso represents a different zzso zzso a lower affinity zzso zzso which may be involved in the internal transport of zzso between cellular or zzso compartments within the zzso The zzso level of zzso corresponding to both zzso is subject to regulation by signals that ultimately respond to the external zzso zzso These zzso represent the identification of plant members of a family of related zzso zzso proteins whose sequences exhibit significant zzso acid conservation in zzso zzso zzso plants, and zzso
