The African zzso zzso zzso has a zzso life cycle that involves the insect zzso and the zzso zzso This is underscored by zzso switches in its nutritional zzso In the insect zzso the zzso relies on zzso acid zzso but in the zzso host, it derives its energy exclusively from blood zzso zzso transport is zzso and constitutes the zzso step in zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning of a novel zzso zzso gene by zzso screening of a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso using a rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that the gene is present as a single copy within the zzso zzso The gene encodes a protein with an estimated molecular mass of zzso zzso which shares only zzso zzso with members of the zzso zzso zzso Several potential zzso modification sites including zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites also punctuate the zzso It is distinguished from classical zzso proteins by the absence of putative zzso zzso zzso However, this protein was capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The rescued zzso zzso the ability of the cells to grow on a broad range of zzso both zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso reflected those in zzso zzso In addition to zzso in zzso we also showed that the gene enhanced zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso
