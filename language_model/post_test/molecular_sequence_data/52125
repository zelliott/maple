A cell line expressing neuroendocrine zzso zzso designated as zzso was established from a human large cell zzso of the lung using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso characteristics of large cell zzso zzso zzso and expressed some general zzso markers including zzso zzso zzso protein gene product zzso zzso neural cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of 200 zzso Some cells of this cell line were positive to zzso zzso but did not express zzso or aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso Such a cell line derived from zzso with zzso properties has not previously been zzso The biological and zzso properties of the zzso cell line were compared with those of 2 surgical cases of zzso with zzso markers and of the zzso cell line previously reported to derive from large cell zzso and to possess zzso markers such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells of 2 large cell zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso cell lines and 2 large cell zzso were thus considered to be zzso with zzso zzso Both lines had the zzso characteristics of zzso relatively short doubling time and zzso expression of zzso zzso indicating them to be closely related to the zzso type of small cell zzso cell lines and thus possibly to represent high-grade zzso They may be useful for examining the biological behavior and zzso features of large zzso zzso tumors of the zzso
