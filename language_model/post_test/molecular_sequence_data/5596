The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene is an zzso zzso gene among the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso One of the unique functions attributed to the zzso gene product is the arrest of cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso interacts physically with zzso one member of an zzso zzso gene family involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso was initially identified through a zzso zzso screen and was confirmed by the demonstration of direct binding between zzso expressed zzso and zzso expressed or chemically zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by indirect zzso and zzso zzso indicates that the two proteins zzso at or about the nuclear zzso We also map the zzso domain in zzso to a zzso zzso region of the protein previously shown to have zzso to members of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a truncated zzso which includes the zzso domain results in a partial zzso of the zzso arrest induced by zzso suggesting that the interaction between zzso and zzso is critical for cell cycle arrest induced by zzso These results provide further support for the hypothesis that zzso interferes with the normal function of a protein or proteins involved in the DNA repair process and, thus, in the transmission of signals that allow cells to transit from the zzso to the M phase of the cell zzso
