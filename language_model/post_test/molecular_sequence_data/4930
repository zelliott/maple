The crystal structure of the zzso domain zzso of the zzso protein has been determined, in complex with zzso peptides corresponding to a region of zzso precursor protein zzso that is required for zzso zzso The mode of binding to zzso of the zzso zzso which contain an zzso zzso resembles that of zzso peptides bound to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso make specific contacts with the zzso zzso domain, and they collectively achieve high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that, in contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso are primarily zzso zzso that have, in some cases, acquired specificity for zzso zzso
