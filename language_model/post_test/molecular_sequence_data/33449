The identification of novel targets and strategies for therapy of microbial infections is an area of intensive research due to the failure of conventional vaccines or antibiotics to combat both newly emerging diseases zzso viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso and new influenza zzso and zzso zzso and entrenched, pandemic diseases exemplified by zzso One clear approach to this problem is to target processes of the host zzso rather than the zzso Recent data have indicated that members of the zzso zzso proteins with a widespread distribution in zzso organisms and 33 members in humans, may provide such an zzso zzso traverse the membrane four times, but are distinguished from other zzso membrane proteins by the presence of zzso charged zzso in the zzso zzso and a defining zzso motif in the larger of the two zzso zzso (the zzso They characteristically form zzso associations with one another and with other membrane proteins and lipids to generate a specialized type of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso are integral to the main role of zzso as zzso zzso involved in functions such as membrane trafficking, zzso fusion, zzso and zzso zzso evidence demonstrates that zzso are used by zzso pathogens as a means of entering and replicating within human zzso Although previous investigations focused mainly on viruses such as zzso C and zzso it is now becoming clear that other microbes associate with zzso using zzso as a zzso to zzso In this article we review the properties and functions of zzso that are relevant to zzso processes and discuss the accumulating evidence that shows how different pathogens exploit these properties in infection and in the zzso of zzso We then investigate the novel and exciting possibilities of targeting zzso for the treatment of infectious disease, using specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso Such therapies, directed at zzso zzso may provide alternative options for combating zzso or newly emerging zzso where conventional approaches face zzso
