The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for human zzso zzso alpha zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso mimics zzso zzso by binding in a region of zzso that zzso the zzso binding zzso In the present study, to explore the functional importance of the zzso acid zzso of zzso required for effective binding to, and antagonism of, zzso each charged zzso was subjected to zzso zzso and examined for zzso interaction by using a surface zzso resonance zzso One zzso zzso was found to be essential for zzso zzso its replacement with either zzso or zzso completely abolished the interaction between zzso and zzso Other charged zzso play zzso zzso One class consists of the zzso zzso cluster zzso and zzso for which zzso replacement decreased the association zzso A second class consists of zzso and the zzso zzso cluster zzso and zzso for which zzso replacement increased the zzso zzso zzso model analysis of the zzso of the latter class of zzso indicated the existence of zzso zzso during the zzso On the basis of these results, we propose a model in which zzso and zzso zzso zzso drive the encounter complex, while zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in stabilizing the final zzso These data argue that the charged zzso of zzso are zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso complex formation to zzso the zzso zzso The results also help focus emerging models for the mechanism by which zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso
