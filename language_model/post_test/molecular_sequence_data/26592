Plant defenses against zzso include the zzso of specific blends of zzso which enable plants to attract natural enemies of zzso We characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso bean zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was multifunctional, producing zzso zzso and zzso precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plants, expressing zzso or its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced and used for zzso with zzso and predatory zzso zzso zzso plants expressing zzso produced zzso and zzso whereas zzso plants and transgenic plants expressing zzso did zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso produced zzso but not zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso the zzso predatory zzso zzso zzso but not the specialist zzso zzso was attracted to zzso transgenic zzso plants expressing zzso over zzso zzso The specialist zzso was more strongly attracted by the transgenic plants infested with zzso zzso than by infested zzso zzso zzso responses to transgenic plant volatile zzso depend on various background zzso zzso produced by the transgenic zzso zzso the manipulation of zzso is an ideal platform for zzso control via the attraction of zzso and specialist predators in different zzso
