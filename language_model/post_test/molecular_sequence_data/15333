zzso are zzso zzso that are produced in high structural diversity by strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A hallmark of zzso is the unusual Choi zzso central to the zzso while other positions are occupied by variable zzso in individual zzso Here we report on three zzso zzso gene clusters zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The analysis and comparison the zzso gene clusters provide the first insight into the molecular basis of zzso and structural plasticity in zzso zzso Major parts of the zzso gene clusters are highly similar in all zzso particularly the genes coding for the first three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso except for the region coding for the second zzso zzso However, the gene clusters differ largely in genes coding for tailoring zzso such as zzso and zzso reflecting structural peculiarities in zzso zzso produced by the individual zzso zzso zzso were further observed in the zzso zzso zzso suggesting two distinct release zzso The architecture of the gene clusters is in agreement with the particular zzso zzso that are produced by individual zzso the structures of two of which zzso zzso A and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso gene clusters of zzso and zzso are proposed to originate from a common zzso and to have evolved to their zzso diversity largely through horizontal gene transfer and zzso zzso
