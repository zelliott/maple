Using reporter gene zzso consisting of the bacterial zzso zzso coding region flanked by the zzso and 3' regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, we studied the degradation of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of transcripts of the reporter gene by more than 6 zzso triggered rapid zzso zzso a zzso zzso known to pause zzso in various positions downstream of the zzso zzso blocked rapid degradation of the zzso In all these cases the zzso ends of the accumulating zzso transcripts were found to be trimmed to the zzso end of the zzso tracts indicating that a zzso zzso 3' zzso is involved in the degradation zzso Several unstable zzso of the zzso transcript could not be rescued from rapid degradation by a zzso tract showing that zzso modes of zzso breakdown exist in the zzso zzso Furthermore, degradation of zzso transcripts that accumulated in cells maintained in the dark could be zzso by illuminating the cells, zzso a zzso mode of zzso degradation that is not blocked by a zzso zzso These results suggest zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso pathways in the zzso of zzso zzso
