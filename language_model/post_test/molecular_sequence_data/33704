This study was conducted to characterize zzso disease virus zzso zzso obtained from waterfowl from the Upper Midwest region of the United zzso A total of 43 zzso were isolated by zzso of zzso samples in zzso chicken zzso These zzso were obtained from 24 zzso seven American zzso zzso six northern zzso four zzso zzso and two wood zzso zzso sequences of fusion gene were analyzed to determine the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso site of fusion zzso protein revealed that all zzso had zzso zzso Of the 43 zzso 23 exhibited sequence motif of zzso at the zzso site, 19 exhibited zzso while one isolate showed zzso zzso analysis based on comparison with different classes of zzso revealed that all 43 zzso clustered with class II zzso and none with class I zzso Within class II, five zzso were zzso close to zzso I zzso while the remaining 38 were close to zzso zzso 

We conclude that more than one zzso of zzso zzso in waterfowl in the Upper Midwest region of the zzso Continuous surveillance may help better understand the epidemiology of zzso maintained in wild bird populations and their relationship to zzso in domestic poultry, if zzso
