Worldwide, increasing numbers of insects have evolved resistance to a wide range of zzso which zzso their control in the field and, therefore, threatens zzso Members of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are prominent candidates to zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to be involved in zzso resistance in Australian zzso zzso the zzso species possessing by far the most reported resistance cases zzso However, specific zzso responsible for zzso resistance in field populations of this species have not yet been zzso Here, we show that the resistance toward zzso in an Australian strain of zzso zzso is due to a unique zzso zzso zzso which arose from unequal zzso between two parental zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso into zzso which exhibits no toxic effect on susceptible zzso zzso from the parental zzso genes showed no zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso strain could be bred into a susceptible line possessing the parental genes zzso and zzso and a resistant line possessing only zzso The exclusive presence of zzso in resistant insects of this strain zzso a zzso resistance to zzso Thus, in addition to previously documented genetic mechanisms of resistance, zzso can also generate selectively advantageous zzso such as this zzso zzso zzso with an altered zzso specificity leading to a potent resistance zzso
