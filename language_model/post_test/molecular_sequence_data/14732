Directed evolution is a broadly successful strategy for protein engineering in the quest to enhance the zzso activity, and zzso of zzso To increase the efficiency of directed evolution based on zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is introduced here as an alternative to traditional quantitative zzso relationship zzso methods for identifying potential protein zzso with desired properties from minimal sampling of focused zzso The operation of zzso depends on identifying the underlying zzso of the protein property landscape, allowing it to make predictions without explicit knowledge of the zzso zzso In a zzso study, zzso identified all or most of the best zzso zzso among the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso in the absence of zzso seeds with high zzso zzso even revealed a laboratory error from irregularities of the zzso zzso landscape zzso
