When a blood vessel is injured, control of bleeding starts with the rapid zzso of circulating zzso to the site of zzso Within seconds, the zzso zzso are zzso zzso the contents of storage zzso spread out over the damaged area and recruit more zzso to the developing zzso However, if this same process occurs in a zzso sclerotic or zzso vessel, the resulting zzso zzso may break away and block the coronary artery, causing a heart attack, or restrict blood supply to the brain, causing a zzso The zzso zzso zzso complex, a member of the zzso protein family, is a zzso zzso membrane zzso for von zzso Factor zzso a zzso adhesive zzso found in the zzso underlying the zzso cell lining of the blood vessel wall and in the zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso complex regulates zzso of zzso to the zzso at high zzso flow, and zzso signal zzso leading to zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex also constitutes a binding site for zzso an interaction that zzso zzso zzso zzso This review will focus on recent detailed analysis of the zzso zzso complex and zzso that has identified discrete zzso acid sequences that mediate their zzso An zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso that is critical for binding of the zzso zzso complex to both zzso and zzso is analogous to zzso zzso zzso acid sequences zzso interactions of other adhesive zzso including zzso binding to zzso and Factor VIII binding to zzso
