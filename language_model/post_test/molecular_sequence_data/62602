Human zzso zzso establishes zzso infections in zzso cells such as zzso zzso zzso During zzso the virus is zzso in a zzso state, although limited zzso activity has been previously zzso In this study we sought to further examine viral gene expression during the zzso phase of zzso Using an experimental model of zzso primary human zzso were zzso infected with zzso strain zzso and extracted zzso subjected to reverse zzso by using zzso zzso zzso Using this approach, we detected zzso from the zzso region of the viral zzso This zzso was also detected in zzso zzso infected with zzso and zzso zzso indicating that expression was zzso strain zzso zzso we detected zzso transcripts in zzso cells from healthy bone zzso and mobilized peripheral blood zzso donors, demonstrating expression during natural zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso extracted from zzso infected zzso revealed the expression of a novel zzso region transcript with a zzso pattern that differed from that reported during productive infection of zzso zzso This zzso region transcript expressed during zzso infection is predicted to zzso a zzso protein with zzso to the potent zzso zzso zzso and to the viral zzso zzso that is expressed during productive zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso may zzso upon the virus an ability to avoid immune recognition and clearance during the zzso phase of zzso
