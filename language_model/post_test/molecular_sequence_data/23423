We recently described patients with soybean zzso mainly zzso by zzso to birch zzso zzso A majority of those patients were reported to have peanut zzso 

We sought to study the occurrence of peanut zzso in patients allergic to birch zzso and characterized the zzso v zzso peanut zzso zzso h zzso 

zzso zzso h 8 was cloned with zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso Nine Swiss and 11 Dutch patients with peanut and birch zzso zzso and a positive zzso zzso food challenge result to peanut were investigated for zzso zzso to birch zzso and zzso peanut zzso and zzso between birch and zzso zzso h 8 stability against zzso and roasting was assessed by means of zzso zzso The zzso zzso potency of zzso h 8 was tested on the basis of zzso zzso zzso 

During zzso zzso food challenge, all patients experienced symptoms in the oral zzso progressing to more severe symptoms in zzso of zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding to zzso h 8 was inhibited by zzso v 1 in peanut extract zzso and in zzso zzso In EAST zzso zzso zzso h 8 inhibited zzso binding to peanut in 4 of 7 tested patient zzso zzso response was dominated by zzso h 8 in 12 of 17 tested zzso Furthermore, our results demonstrate a low stability of zzso h 8 to roasting and no stability to gastric zzso zzso zzso release with zzso h 8 was more than zzso in 5 of 7 tested zzso 

Peanut zzso might be zzso in a zzso of our patients by means of zzso of zzso v 1 with the zzso peanut zzso zzso h zzso
