Human upstream binding factor is a zzso zzso factor involved in zzso by zzso zzso zzso It contains six zzso box zzso the zzso box is a minor groove zzso domain that has been found in hundreds of proteins with different zzso Among the six zzso box zzso in zzso the first one can bind to the zzso promoter specifically by itself and is essential for the whole zzso DNA binding zzso Here we report the three-dimensional structure of this first zzso box free in solution determined by zzso zzso using zzso zzso Like the previously determined zzso box structures, zzso zzso box 1 adopts a twisted zzso consisting of three zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso pack onto each other to form the short arm, while zzso 3 zzso is associated with an extended strand zzso to zzso 1 and forms the long zzso A cluster of zzso zzso in particular the aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso is important to maintain the zzso The short arm is rigid due to extensive zzso interaction between zzso 1 and zzso 2, while the long arm is less zzso
