zzso zzso zzso protein zzso are presently regarded as a promising approach toward treatment of prion zzso Here, we investigated the ability of five peptides corresponding to three different regions of the bovine prion protein zzso to elicit zzso interfering with zzso propagation in zzso zzso zzso were zzso with free zzso zzso zzso immune zzso were tested in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for their binding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal prion protein zzso zzso zzso positive in all tests were chosen for zzso zzso studies in cell zzso All peptides induced zzso zzso most of them reacting with zzso zzso Moreover, addition of the serum specific to zzso zzso led to a transient reduction of zzso levels in persistently zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso interfering with zzso propagation were induced with a prion protein zzso zzso to a protein zzso These results point to the potential application of the zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of prion zzso
