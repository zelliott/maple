The zzso zzso zzso is a short, highly zzso zzso zzso to both microbial and zzso cells which is zzso from a precursor including a signal zzso and a highly zzso zzso A zzso analysis of 28 complete sequences from five zzso species zzso zzso guinea zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso clusters of zzso indicating that the genes duplicated after divergence of these zzso zzso of rates of synonymous and zzso zzso substitution suggested that gene zzso has often been followed by a period in which diversification of the mature zzso at the zzso acid level has been selectively zzso In some zzso it appeared that zzso acid differences in this region have appeared in a zzso fashion so as to change the pattern of zzso zzso Because it has been hypothesized that the negative charge in the zzso serves to balance the positive charge in the mature zzso and thus to prevent zzso prior to zzso we used a maximum likelihood method of reconstructing ancestral states in order to test whether this balance has been maintained over evolutionary time in spite of rapid diversification of the mature zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso ancestral sequences always maintained a charge balance between mature zzso and zzso and changes in the net positive charge of the mature zzso were balanced by corresponding changes in the zzso The results support the hypothesis that, in the evolution of these zzso zzso acid changes have occurred in a coordinated fashion so as to preserve an zzso zzso
