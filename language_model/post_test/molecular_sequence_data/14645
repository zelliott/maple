The partial pressure of oxygen constitutes an important factor in the regulation of human zzso zzso including control of cell volume, membrane structure, and zzso zzso Because band 3 is thought to be involved in all three processes and because binding of zzso zzso to the zzso domain of band 3 zzso is strongly zzso the possibility that the zzso association of zzso zzso with zzso might constitute an zzso sensor that mediates zzso changes in zzso properties zzso While several lines of evidence support this hypothesis, a major opposing argument lies in the fact that the zzso binding sequence on human zzso is not zzso Moreover, no effect of zzso pressure on zzso 3 interactions has ever been demonstrated in another zzso To explore whether band zzso interactions might be widely involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso we undertook characterization of the effect of zzso on band zzso interactions in the zzso We report here that zzso band 3 binds zzso with significantly greater affinity than zzso despite the lack of significant zzso within the zzso binding zzso We further map the zzso binding site on zzso band 3 and show that deletion of the site eliminates zzso zzso Finally, we identify zzso in zzso zzso that either enhance or eliminate its affinity for zzso zzso These data demonstrate that despite a lack of zzso in the sequences of both zzso band 3 and zzso zzso a strong zzso association of the two proteins has been zzso
