A putative zzso zzso zzso is reported for Atlantic cod zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso and zzso walking were used to articulate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso number zzso It contains a 149 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso open reading frame and a zzso zzso 3' zzso At the zzso level, the cod zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity to human zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence clusters with zzso from rainbow trout and zzso zzso transcript is highly expressed in brain, zzso heart and kidney and expressed to a lower level in at least six other zzso zzso is evident immediately upon zzso of zzso Six hours of zzso at zzso zzso did not alter expression levels in brain, zzso heart or zzso The level of expression is not substantially altered in heart during low temperature challenge, although there is a suggestion that colder temperature could lead to lower levels of zzso consistent with the concept that the zzso heart has a reduced dependence upon zzso as a zzso zzso Two months of zzso did not significantly alter the level of expression of zzso in zzso This is in marked contrast to the rat heart where zzso leads to a substantial decrease in zzso zzso Overall, there is a ubiquitous tissue distribution of zzso consistent with other species, and the level of gene zzso especially in heart, is relatively constant over a range of zzso zzso
