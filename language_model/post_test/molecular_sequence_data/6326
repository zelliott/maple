We previously reported a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against human zzso cells zzso and showed that the zzso zzso is a cell surface zzso zzso expressed on zzso of zzso and on large zzso cells in the early to zzso zzso In this study, we further characterized the zzso zzso An zzso study showed that the zzso zzso was also expressed on zzso zzso and zzso cells and on first zzso and term zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso using the zzso zzso consisted of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso protein zzso from zzso revealed that the 16 zzso acids from the zzso were identical to those of the heavy chain of human zzso alpha 6, the molecular mass of which is reportedly zzso zzso We examined the tissue distribution of zzso alpha 6, beta 1, and beta 4, because zzso alpha 6 forms zzso with zzso beta 1 or beta zzso zzso zzso zzso of various zzso and zzso zzso using two known zzso alpha 6 zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso alpha 6 was expressed on zzso and large zzso cells in a profile similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso beta 1 was expressed on zzso and large zzso cells, but zzso beta 4 was zzso zzso beta 1 was also expressed on zzso and zzso zzso In term zzso the zzso zzso and zzso alpha 6 and beta 4 were expressed on zzso whereas zzso beta 1 was expressed on zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso recognizes zzso alpha 6, and that zzso alpha 6 is a zzso zzso of human zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso
