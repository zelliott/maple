The zzso nuclear factor 1 zzso zzso factor family is composed of two closely related zzso proteins with similar but distinct expression zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso factors, zzso and zzso increase zzso from target genes through direct physical interaction with one or more elements of sufficient similarity to a 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso sites have been found in the zzso upstream regulatory regions of most known human zzso zzso zzso As the liver and gastrointestinal tract are both important sites of zzso and express significant levels of one or both zzso zzso it is thought that these zzso may play a role in zzso regulation of zzso This chapter explores the current evidence that zzso zzso factors are explicitly involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Most data supporting this hypothesis come from in zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for which methods are zzso However, as in zzso functionality of zzso factors does not necessarily imply significance in zzso some of the limitations of these techniques are also zzso In addition, available in zzso data are discussed, with particular attention given to contributions made by zzso knockout mouse models and zzso studies of human zzso Finally, possible scenarios in which zzso regulation of zzso expression may be clinically relevant are zzso
