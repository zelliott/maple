We previously demonstrated zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso that zzso zzso of zzso zzso 29 contain an zzso of 120 bases which is essential for DNA zzso Here we report that this zzso exists primarily as a zzso of zzso 174 zzso in zzso cells and that zzso 54 bases are zzso from its zzso by zzso zzso during the zzso of zzso The long and short forms of the zzso had similar activity in in zzso DNA packaging and zzso zzso We report the sequence of the long form of the zzso and show that similar long and short forms can be isolated from the zzso of the zzso 29 relatives zzso 21, zzso 15 and zzso The concentration dependence in the zzso of zzso zzso suggests that one copy of the zzso is sufficient to restore DNA packaging activity to zzso zzso However, quantitative zzso indicate that 5 to 6 copies of the zzso are present on zzso isolated from zzso zzso
