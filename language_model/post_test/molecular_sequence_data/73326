The zzso zzso disorders zzso are a group of genetically zzso diseases lethal in early zzso Although the clinical features of zzso patients may vary, cells from all zzso patients exhibit a zzso in the import of one or more classes of zzso zzso zzso This cellular zzso is shared by zzso zzso zzso and human zzso of zzso zzso genes have been shown to be defective in some groups of zzso zzso We identified a putative human zzso of zzso by screening the database of expressed sequence tags for zzso capable of zzso a protein similar to zzso zzso Although its sequence similarity to zzso zzso proteins was zzso zzso shared the same zzso distribution as zzso zzso and localized to the zzso zzso zzso expression restored zzso protein import in zzso from zzso patients of complement group 3 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were detected in two unrelated zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso in zzso are responsible for zzso of the zzso and that zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso protein zzso
