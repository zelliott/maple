The small zzso proteins zzso and zzso are key elements in the zzso pathways respectively controlling the formation of zzso and stress fibers induced by growth factors or zzso zzso We recently reported that zzso function is necessary for Ras transformation and that expression of zzso activated zzso is sufficient to cause zzso zzso We now show that, although expression of zzso activated zzso in zzso 1 zzso does not cause transformation on its own, it strongly zzso with zzso active zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso focus formation by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells, and stable zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso reverts Ras zzso Interestingly, stress fiber formation is inhibited in zzso lines and restored by zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso drives at least two separate zzso one that zzso stress fiber formation and another one that is important for transformation by zzso zzso
