zzso zzso and native DNA both give rise to zzso zzso zzso 6 and 7 upon treatment with zzso zzso a known zzso in zzso under zzso zzso The use of synthetic zzso containing zzso 6 or 7 could shed light on the mechanism of the zzso of 1 and on the nature of the structural zzso present in DNA duplexes where they are zzso Unfortunately, this is precluded by the instability of 6 and 7 to the conditions of automated DNA zzso We have prepared zzso zzso zzso as a stable model for zzso The structure of 8 has been verified by magnetic zzso ultraviolet zzso and mass zzso This zzso has been incorporated into zzso via solid-state synthesis zzso zzso zzso fast atom zzso zzso mass zzso of the zzso zzso verified the identity and position of the modified zzso The zzso of 8 as a model system for the zzso pair zzso in structural and biological studies of DNA duplexes is zzso
