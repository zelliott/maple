zzso ecological techniques were applied to analyze the bacterial diversity of two zzso microbial fuel cells zzso enriched using river water or artificial wastewater zzso as zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of the zzso amplified zzso zzso showed that different microbial communities were present in the two zzso and these were different from the river zzso used to initiate the zzso Nearly complete zzso zzso was amplified and zzso Over zzso of the clones were zzso zzso were the dominant clones zzso in zzso fed with river water, and about zzso of the clones in zzso fed with zzso were zzso zzso were found only in the zzso fed with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso fed with river zzso Many clones were related to zzso bacteria, some with zzso less than zzso indicating that many novel bacteria were enriched in the zzso zzso
