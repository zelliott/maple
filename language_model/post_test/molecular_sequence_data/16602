The zzso gene zzso zzso protein zzso is probably involved in early zzso and has a variable copy number in different zzso zzso Analysis of bovine zzso clones leads to an estimate of 90 zzso zzso on the bovine Y zzso Half of these zzso zzso and zzso contain a single zzso while the other zzso zzso contain a cluster of three, possibly four, truncated zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso are located mainly on the short arm zzso The zzso genes appear to account for about zzso of the Y zzso and contain several published bovine zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and the major zzso repetitive elements zzso from cattle and zzso from sheep zzso zzso further illustrates how the Y zzso is shaped by zzso and horizontal spreading of the most abundant zzso A comparison of zzso sequences from different zzso clones and from related bovine species suggests concerted evolution as one of the mechanisms of the rapid evolution of the zzso Y zzso
