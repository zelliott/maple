Using the zzso zzso zzso which zzso specifically with an zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the chick cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso core zzso we have identified the zzso zzso expressed by zzso This large zzso zzso is first detected zzso as early as stage 16, long before zzso occurs, and is expressed continuously during the time of active neural crest migration and through the onset of zzso zzso Because of the zzso of both zzso and cartilage zzso with the zzso zzso extensive molecular and zzso analysis of the two zzso was carried zzso zzso differences distinguish the zzso and cartilage zzso zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso cartilage zzso carries a significant content of zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso is devoid of zzso In contrast, cartilage zzso lacks the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso has a high content of zzso Three different approaches were used to establish the relationship of the two zzso at the molecular zzso Northern zzso analysis, using zzso zzso detected zzso messages from zzso and cartilage zzso Overlapping fragments, generated by zzso using zzso covering zzso of the entire coding sequence from the known cartilage structure, were of identical size in zzso and zzso Taking advantage of our recent studies, which demonstrated a single base change in the zzso gene resulting in conversion of zzso to a STOP zzso in zzso 12 of chick zzso as the molecular basis of the zzso zzso we demonstrated that the same zzso was present in zzso zzso from zzso zzso These results provide evidence that the chick zzso gene is expressed very early in development in zzso and confirm that the core proteins expressed in chick zzso and cartilage are derived from the same zzso These findings strongly support the hypothesis that the final structural characteristics of each zzso are determined not only by the core protein but also by zzso zzso regulated zzso mechanisms, functioning within the context of the requirement for specific zzso zzso
