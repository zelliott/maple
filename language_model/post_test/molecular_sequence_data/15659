Star is expressed in zzso cells as zzso and zzso transcripts that differ only in their zzso regions zzso In mouse zzso zzso and zzso adrenal lines, zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso is similarly selective in primary bovine zzso zzso The zzso form harbors zzso elements zzso in the extended zzso which enhance zzso After peak stimulation of zzso zzso degradation is zzso Star zzso turnover is enhanced by the zinc finger protein zzso which binds to zzso repeats in the extended zzso zzso is rapidly zzso in each cell type in parallel with Star zzso zzso of zzso selectively decreases zzso Star zzso and zzso zzso reporters harboring the extended zzso zzso complex formation was demonstrated between zzso and the extended zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso required the first two zzso zzso zzso which also binds zzso did not affect Star zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso of zzso specifically enhanced stimulation of zzso Star zzso in bovine zzso cells, zzso and zzso cells but did not affect the zzso seen after peak zzso zzso zzso of Star zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso a selective turnover of zzso zzso independent of zzso which may zzso to these reversal zzso zzso acute regulatory zzso protein induction was zzso by zzso zzso zzso with decreased cholesterol zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso is therefore surprisingly coupled to enhanced Star translation leading to increased cholesterol zzso
