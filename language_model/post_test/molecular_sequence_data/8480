zzso gene transfer into human zzso zzso cells for therapeutic or experimental purposes has proved difficult due to low and variable infection zzso To address this, we have developed an in zzso system for the selection and maintenance of a zzso population of zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured on zzso a zzso zzso zzso cell line used for embryonic stem cell zzso zzso zzso cultures could be maintained with continuing blast cell and zzso production for eight weeks, compared to four weeks in the absence of zzso We then tested the ability of SNL to facilitate the selection in zzso of zzso zzso cells infected with the zzso zzso zzso While all cells in the control cultures died within 14 days, zzso zzso cells continued to zzso differentiate and produce zzso for up to five weeks after zzso zzso of zzso zzso from such cultures were shown by zzso to be successfully zzso This approach should be useful for experimental work and, since it would diminish competitive zzso between infected and zzso zzso may also be zzso with zzso for zzso gene therapy zzso
