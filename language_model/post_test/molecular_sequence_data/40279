zzso zzso forms long chains of cells during growth and zzso zzso Cell separation is zzso by zzso whose genes are under the negative control of a zzso complex composed of the proteins zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso complex is governed by a zzso zzso feedback loop in which zzso zzso the gene for zzso and zzso by forming the zzso complex, zzso zzso and prevents it from zzso zzso The loop is a zzso switch and exists in a zzso state in which zzso genes are on, and a zzso state in which zzso genes are zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso state are driven into the zzso state by zzso an zzso that binds to and zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which cells in the zzso state zzso back to the zzso state is zzso We report that zzso is zzso unstable and present evidence that zzso via a zzso zzso and zzso contribute to its zzso zzso producing a zzso zzso of zzso exhibited more persistent zzso during growth and yielded zzso with enhanced structural zzso We propose that degradation of zzso allows cells to switch from the zzso to the zzso zzso
