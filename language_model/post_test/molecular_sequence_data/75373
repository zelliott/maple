zzso virus, in contrast to zzso virus, can multiply in Chinese zzso zzso zzso To study the genetic basis for this difference in host range, zzso between zzso and zzso viruses were isolated and their DNA restriction patterns were zzso The ability to multiply in Chinese zzso zzso cells could be correlated with the conservation of zzso virus sequences mapping at the left end of the zzso This was further demonstrated by marker rescue of the host range zzso with restricted zzso virus zzso zzso rescue with cloned restriction fragments of decreasing size enabled the fine zzso of the host range function to a zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed that the zzso zzso a single major zzso of approximately zzso zzso It is suggested that the role of the host range gene from zzso virus is to prevent the early and extensive zzso of protein synthesis that normally occurs in Chinese zzso zzso cells infected by zzso zzso
