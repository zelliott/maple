zzso complexes that assemble on zzso genes in a crude zzso zzso cell extract extend over the entire zzso unit and approximately 40 base pairs of zzso zzso zzso We show here that the interaction with zzso DNA is due to a protein that zzso with zzso factor zzso through several steps of zzso and shares characteristic properties that are normally ascribed to zzso dependence on prior binding of zzso and great stability once the zzso complex is zzso zzso gene zzso DNA that was cut within the zzso sequence zzso 31 or 28 base pairs upstream of the zzso start zzso was no longer able to zzso incorporate zzso into a zzso zzso The zzso zzso DNA protein interaction was predominantly not sequence zzso The extension of the zzso complex into this DNA segment does suggest two possible explanations for highly diverse effects of zzso zzso on zzso gene zzso either zzso proteins that are capable of binding to these upstream DNA segments are also potentially capable of stimulating or interfering with the incorporation of zzso into zzso complexes or zzso zzso sequence influences the rate of assembly of zzso into stable zzso zzso
