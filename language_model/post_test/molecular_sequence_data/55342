The zzso blood group influences zzso to severe zzso zzso zzso Recent evidence indicates that the protective effect of group O operates by virtue of reduced zzso of infected red blood cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a zzso of zzso zzso with zzso binding being assigned to the zzso zzso zzso Here, we identify the zzso blood group as the main zzso for zzso zzso with a marked preference for group A over group B, which in turn is preferred to group O zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso reproduce the zzso blood group preference and document direct binding to blood group zzso by surface zzso zzso More detailed zzso zzso analysis showed preferred binding to group zzso weaker binding to groups zzso and B, and least binding to groups zzso and zzso The zzso zzso resolution crystal structure of the zzso Head region, zzso reveals extensive contacts between the zzso and zzso and shows that the zzso hinge region is essential for zzso zzso Computer zzso of the blood group zzso and subsequent zzso zzso localized the zzso site to the face opposite to the zzso site of zzso zzso binding involves zzso that are zzso between zzso zzso zzso opening novel opportunities for intervention against severe zzso By deciphering the structural basis of blood group preferences in zzso we provide a link between zzso blood zzso and zzso zzso consistent with the selective role of zzso malaria on human genetic zzso
