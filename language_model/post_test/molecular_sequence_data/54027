zzso are zzso abundant and zzso strongly zzso proteins that play a role in important cellular zzso Using blue native zzso we have demonstrated that human zzso and zzso together form a large complex in the zzso inner zzso This complex is similar in size to the zzso complex formed by the zzso zzso and zzso In zzso levels of this complex are increased on zzso of both zzso and zzso suggesting that these two proteins are the only components of the zzso zzso experiments with zzso isolated from zzso and zzso zzso cells show that the zzso complex is able to stabilize newly zzso zzso translation zzso This stabilization probably occurs through a direct interaction because association of zzso translation products with the zzso complex could be zzso The fact that zzso is a large zzso complex, which provides protection of native peptides against zzso suggests a functional zzso with protein zzso with respect to their ability to hold and prevent zzso of newly zzso zzso
