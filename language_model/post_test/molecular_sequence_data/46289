The objective was to perform zzso gender identification of three zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso primer set resolved the zzso products of these species in zzso zzso gel zzso it was zzso for molecular gender identification using the melting curve analysis zzso curve for zzso zzso After sequencing the zzso and zzso genes for these species, we redesigned a zzso zzso primer zzso and a zzso (or zzso primer zzso to combine with the zzso zzso primer to generate two zzso zzso with different lengths zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Melting temperature zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso were determined and resolved in zzso at approximately zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso females contained two zzso peaks, whereas males contained zzso In conclusion, melting curve analysis zzso using our proposed primer sets was a robust gender identification method for the three zzso species zzso
