zzso synthesis initiation factor zzso zzso is zzso expressed in zzso zzso We characterized the zzso gene promoter cloned from human zzso The minimal promoter, localized to a region in the zzso region adjacent to the first zzso consisted of approximately 300 base pairs zzso zzso of which were identical with those in the corresponding mouse zzso The minimal promoter contained zzso and zzso motifs and consensus sequences binding to zzso (three zzso and zzso (one zzso zzso analyses of the promoter revealed that a zzso region near zzso of the minimal promoter was essential for the efficient transcription, although the zzso site in the region was zzso A zzso polarization zzso suggested that the plus strand of the zzso region, despite the lack of known consensus sequences binding to zzso factors except for zzso bound to unknown nuclear zzso in a sequence specific zzso
