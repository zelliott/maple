Identification of a tumor zzso specific zzso would allow targeting of tumor zzso zzso vehicles can be used to deliver therapeutic agents for treatment of disease or contrast agents for molecular zzso A targeting zzso would allow specific delivery of such zzso to zzso sites, thereby reducing side effects and gaining zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso has been described to home zzso activated zzso suggesting an ideal candidate as targeting zzso To investigate this application of zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso were zzso with zzso Using phase contrast and zzso zzso as well as magnetic resonance imaging zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso bind specifically to activated zzso cells, suggesting application as an zzso targeting agent for molecular targeting and molecular imaging of zzso zzso
