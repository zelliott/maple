zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been discovered and characterized as a member of the zzso protein zzso zzso acid zzso zzso gene family, which also includes zzso zzso zzso zzso as a distant member of this gene zzso This new zzso is unique as it is the only member of this family capable of efficiently zzso reduced zzso to both zzso acid zzso and zzso Although zzso zzso has been demonstrated to display both general zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso activities, its biological function remains zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso location of zzso zzso as well as the relative importance of this zzso versus zzso zzso for the production of zzso in various human zzso and cells that have been previously demonstrated to possess zzso zzso zzso As determined by Western zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in human liver zzso human zzso cell zzso and sparsely detected in human lung zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was prevalent in human lung zzso human zzso zzso and human kidney zzso zzso to the formation of zzso zzso zzso also produces a new zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso This zzso was used to distinguish between zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities involved in the zzso of zzso Based on the relative production of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be the principal zzso responsible for zzso production in human liver zzso and human zzso cells and played a minor role in the formation of zzso in human lung zzso In comparison, zzso zzso was the main zzso capable of catalyzing the zzso of reduced zzso to zzso in human lung zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be an integral component in the zzso of biological systems due to its marked presence in human liver, in accordance with its known zzso zzso zzso zzso however, may also be pivotal for zzso zzso formation in zzso cells, and this could change our current understanding of the regulation of zzso zzso in inflammatory disorders such as zzso
