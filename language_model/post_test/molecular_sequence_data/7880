The zzso cells missing zzso gene in zzso encodes a novel nuclear protein that is zzso expressed early in the development of nearly all zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly all zzso fail to zzso and, where we can follow them in the zzso are transformed into zzso In zzso zzso conditions using transgenic zzso that drive zzso zzso zzso many zzso zzso are transformed into zzso Thus, zzso appears to function as a zzso genetic switch for zzso versus zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso become zzso while in its absence, zzso zzso become zzso
