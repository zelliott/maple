zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso is a zzso process consisting of the formation of zzso and the subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a reaction zzso in turn, by zzso The fact that the two activities, zzso synthesis and zzso zzso can be measured separately is particularly useful when the zzso zzso approach is used to determine the functional role of the zzso acid zzso involved in zzso The present report describes the cloning and subsequent functional zzso using a bacterial expression system, of the zzso gene zzso zzso number zzso from zzso zzso the zzso agent of visceral zzso The absolute need to include a zzso zzso in the zzso buffer for this zzso in conjunction with the rapid zzso of the functionally zzso protein by zzso suggests the presence of crucial zzso zzso in the primary structure of the zzso zzso The seven zzso in zzso zzso zzso were zzso to their zzso zzso acid, zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a drastic loss of zzso synthesis activity compared to the wild type, and the zzso and zzso zzso retained a mere zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso remained unchanged with respect to the zzso zzso zzso also modified zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso lacked in zzso activity altogether, whereas zzso zzso and zzso retained low but zzso zzso The behavior of the zzso zzso was zzso its inability to zzso zzso combined with its retention of zzso activity appear to be indicative of the specific involvement of the respective zzso in the first step of the zzso zzso
