zzso zzso shows zzso activity due to zzso interaction with the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso The second zzso of a functional zzso zzso the common gamma chain zzso zzso is more zzso since human zzso is able to activate zzso zzso complexes containing either human or zzso common gamma zzso chain zzso zzso We have zzso zzso zzso mouse cells of zzso and zzso origin with combinations of human zzso alpha and gamma c zzso In these cell lines, both human and zzso gamma c receptors as well as zzso alpha chains from both species are simultaneously zzso Both versions of gamma c readily form zzso complexes with either human zzso and human zzso alpha or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Due to distinct zzso properties of human and zzso gamma zzso the two zzso complexes can be activated zzso by different zzso zzso of human zzso The contribution of zzso common gamma chain to human zzso signal zzso is suppressed by an zzso zzso directed to the zzso domain of the mouse gamma zzso We present evidence that the two zzso complexes functionally interfere with each other and compete for zzso zzso zzso
