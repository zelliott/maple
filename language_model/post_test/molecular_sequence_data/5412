The zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso comprises two zzso zzso each with zzso zzso zzso which are responsible for binding zzso gamma at the cell zzso The zzso on the human zzso recognized by three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been mapped by zzso scanning zzso In this way, a loop connecting zzso C and zzso in the zzso domain was identified as a key component of the zzso bound by A6 and zzso whereas zzso binds to the zzso domain in a region including strands A and B and part of the large zzso zzso The zzso for A6 was confirmed in a crystal structure of a complex between a zzso zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso from zzso determined by X-ray zzso to zzso A zzso The zzso interface zzso zzso zzso of protein surface, including 22 zzso zzso from five zzso determining regions, primarily through interactions with the zzso surface loop of the zzso The floor of the zzso binding cavity is formed mainly by zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso while a surrounding zzso is formed by zzso from all other zzso except zzso Many potential polar zzso as well as 13 aromatic zzso four in zzso six in zzso and three in the zzso are situated at the zzso The surface of the zzso contacted by A6 zzso to a large extent with that contacted by zzso in the zzso zzso However, the zzso of this zzso is very different in the two complexes, demonstrating that zzso mobility in a surface loop on this zzso zzso permits zzso and zzso zzso to two quite differently shaped binding zzso
