zzso zzso analysis has shown that the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso DNA binding zzso is required for normal zzso fetal liver zzso and zzso To identify novel genes involved in zzso differential display analysis was conducted using total liver zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using 4 zzso 3' zzso and 5 arbitrary zzso as zzso zzso 22 zzso expressed genes have been zzso Eight zzso novel genes were identified from 12 zzso that were zzso One zzso initially designated zzso is primarily expressed in cells of the zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso a putative protein of 931 zzso zzso The protein is a member of a family of hormone receptors containing 7 zzso zzso The zzso also contains 7 zzso growth zzso zzso motifs at the zzso terminal of the predicted zzso The gene is alternatively zzso resulting in the deletion of one or more copies of the zzso zzso zzso maps to mouse zzso 17 and is the putative zzso of zzso a recently described zzso module containing zzso hormone zzso with 7 zzso segments in zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso fetuses represent a unique resource for identifying genes involved in zzso
