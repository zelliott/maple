The role of a zzso zzso repeat motif between zzso acids 268 and zzso in the structure and function of the zzso disease virus zzso F protein was explored by introducing single point zzso into the F gene zzso The zzso affected either folding of the protein or the fusion activity of the zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso likely zzso with folding of the zzso since these proteins were not zzso zzso were minimally expressed at the cell surface, and formed zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso and expressed at the cell surface although the protein migrated slightly slower than wild type on zzso gels, suggesting an zzso in zzso or zzso zzso protein was fusion inactive in the presence or absence of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed at the cell surface and zzso zzso at better than zzso zzso Most importantly, this protein zzso zzso formation in the absence of zzso protein expression although zzso protein enhanced fusion zzso These results show that a single zzso acid change in the zzso portion of the zzso F protein can alter the stringent requirement for zzso protein expression in zzso zzso
