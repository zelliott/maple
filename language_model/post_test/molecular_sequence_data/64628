This is the first identification of a zzso fatty zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso The gene product of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso which has a high sequence similarity to zzso zzso has been expressed and zzso zzso showed zzso fatty zzso synthetic activity in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso suggesting a fatty zzso zzso is an zzso Recently, it was revealed that zzso zzso has two zzso functions, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, unlike zzso zzso zzso did not show zzso activity in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso properties of zzso including zzso zzso pH dependency and optimal temperature were close to those of zzso zzso and rat fatty zzso zzso Further, zzso analyses strongly suggest that the zzso zzso gene may have evolved from a fatty zzso zzso gene as a common ancestral zzso
