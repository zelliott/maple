A zzso DNA zzso which contained a zzso gene and its upstream region was cloned from zzso zzso type D strain zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso revealed that genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso and one for a zzso zzso component were located upstream of the zzso zzso This strain produced two toxins of different molecular size zzso 300 zzso and 500 zzso which were designated as zzso toxins zzso and L zzso The molecular size of the zzso component of L toxin was approximately 130 zzso on zzso and its zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso which agreed with that deduced from the zzso zzso In contrast, the M toxin had a zzso zzso component whose zzso sequence was zzso corresponding to the sequence from zzso of the deduced zzso A zzso fragment, which was found to be associated with an M toxin preparation, possessed the same zzso zzso acid sequence as that of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, five major fragments generated by limited zzso with zzso zzso were shown to have zzso zzso acid sequences identical to those deduced from the zzso sequence of zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso of the L toxin is zzso at a unique site, between zzso and zzso leading to the zzso zzso of the M zzso
