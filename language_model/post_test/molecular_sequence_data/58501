zzso zzso by the marine zzso zzso zzso involves zzso to and transport of zzso zzso and zzso We report the properties of the respective zzso that zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shares 38% identity with zzso coli zzso zzso it is zzso identical to zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso An adjacent open reading frame encodes a protein with zzso identity to zzso coli zzso zzso zzso requires only zzso zzso zzso and the accessory zzso zzso system zzso The zzso zzso equivalent of zzso was not found in the 25,000 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shares zzso identity with the zzso zzso domain of zzso coli zzso but is unique among zzso proteins in that it lacks the zzso domain and thus requires zzso for sugar zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso While there are similarities between the zzso zzso system of zzso zzso and enteric bacteria, the differences may be important for survival of zzso zzso in the marine zzso
