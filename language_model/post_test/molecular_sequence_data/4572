zzso focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso signals initiated by zzso engagement and G zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso from brain had a higher molecular weight and an increased zzso activity, than from other zzso In addition to a zzso zzso in the zzso region, which defines zzso rat zzso zzso zzso contained several additional short zzso coding for peptides of 28, 6, and 7 zzso respectively zzso boxes 28, 6, and zzso surrounding the zzso zzso In zzso zzso 7 cells, the presence of boxes 6 and 7 zzso an increased overall zzso zzso a higher zzso of zzso assessed with a zzso zzso zzso and a more active zzso in immune zzso The presence of box 28 did not alter further these zzso zzso zzso maps of zzso zzso were identical to those of zzso The presence of the various zzso did not alter the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso Thus, several zzso zzso of zzso are zzso expressed in rat brain, some of which have an increased zzso activity, suggesting that zzso may have specific properties in zzso
