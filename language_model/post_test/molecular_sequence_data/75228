We have zzso the zzso zzso of zzso DNA which ensures the autonomous replication of plasmids in zzso zzso mapping has shown the zzso element to consist of at least two zzso the core having the consensus zzso sequence zzso and the zzso which is no more than 90 zzso long and is located at the zzso of the zzso core zzso Neither domain per zzso ensures zzso replication in zzso A comparison of the zzso sequence with the sequences of 14 different zzso elements failed to reveal significant zzso zzso Most probably the zzso zzso that are adjacent to the core and act as zzso do not carry any zzso They may determine a peculiar structural feature of DNA (for example zzso which are necessary for the zzso zzso
