In zzso amplification of the zzso zzso has been widely used to assess for the presence of minimal residual disease in patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso presenting with complete clinical and zzso zzso However, the level of sensitivity achieved in different laboratories remains largely zzso Moreover, the results are usually expressed as positive or negative, making a precise follow-up of the patients zzso In an attempt to overcome these limitations, we devised a quantitative method to measure the amount of zzso zzso in clinical zzso This methodology involves a single reverse zzso step, followed by separate zzso of zzso and total zzso zzso These two zzso are performed in the presence of different zzso of a same internal zzso This standard consists of zzso sequences with an eight bases deletion in zzso 2 of zzso One of the zzso used in each separate reaction is zzso with zzso Following amplification, zzso products derived from cellular zzso and those from the internal standard are separated and their relative zzso is determined using a laser fluorescent DNA zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso and total zzso zzso molecules initially present in each sample is then zzso The accuracy and zzso of this method was assessed by studying serial zzso of zzso zzso into normal zzso Blood samples from 10 patients in zzso zzso under zzso therapy were zzso Only one sample was found negative while the others contained between zzso and 17 hybrid zzso zzso molecules per 1000 molecules of zzso zzso These results suggest that a variable number of zzso cells are present in the majority of zzso patients in zzso zzso following zzso zzso
