We have cloned and characterized a zzso DNA spanning the zzso region, the first and second zzso and the first zzso of the human zzso zzso The zzso upstream region is highly zzso and lacks a zzso box, whereas the zzso region contains several zzso zzso Multiple zzso initiation sites were identified by primer extension zzso Based on the transient zzso zzso the major zzso zzso element was identified between zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso repressive element was found between zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso in various cell lines was examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso lines such as zzso zzso and Ramos cells, whereas it existed at very low levels in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso upstream of zzso was able to activate zzso from the zzso promoter in zzso and zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, which is consistent with the zzso protein expression levels in those cell zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression of zzso might be attributed to the zzso regulation by the upstream zzso
