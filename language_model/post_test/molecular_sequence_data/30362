Ten zzso sugar chains zzso were prepared from various zzso and zzso labeled with zzso The fluorescent zzso zzso chains were first separated into five zzso according to their molecular sizes by zzso on a zzso gel zzso zzso Each fraction was then separated into the component zzso chains by zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso column according to their chemical zzso The method is useful for studying the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso as a zzso
