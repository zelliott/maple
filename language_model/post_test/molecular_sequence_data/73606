Active zzso and zzso zzso zzso were produced in trans in zzso from plasmids containing zzso zzso II zzso signals and zzso fragments with unique zzso zzso zzso were carried out in cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were derived from separate zzso and zzso zzso coding units, however, active zzso zzso could be produced only by zzso with zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso organization of the large zzso zzso is not required for successful processing of zzso or assembly of functional zzso The split zzso system should facilitate future efforts to dissect zzso zzso zzso
