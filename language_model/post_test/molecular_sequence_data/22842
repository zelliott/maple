When higher zzso cells transition into zzso the nuclear zzso nuclear pore complexes, and nuclear zzso are zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex, which plays a major role in membrane zzso at the zzso has been implicated in the process of nuclear envelope breakdown and requires interactions at the nuclear pore complex for recruitment to this new site of action at zzso zzso a resident of the nuclear pore basket, was found to be involved in zzso zzso but the molecular nature of the interface between zzso and the nuclear pore has not been fully zzso To better understand what occurs at the nuclear pore at this zzso we have zzso the role of the zzso zzso zzso contains a repetitive zinc finger domain with overall organization similar to a region within zzso that is critical to zzso association, yet inspection of these two zinc finger zzso reveals features that also clearly distinguish zzso Here, we found that the zzso zinc finger domain, but not a zinc finger domain from an unrelated zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso progression of nuclear envelope breakdown in an zzso that robustly zzso this process in zzso Moreover, the zzso zinc finger domain interferes with zzso recruitment to the nuclear zzso zzso with a role for this pore protein in zzso nuclear envelope breakdown, zzso zzso impair nuclear zzso zzso targeting either zzso or zzso for zzso zzso nuclear envelope breakdown, supporting a model in which these zzso play zzso roles, perhaps contributing to zzso recruitment platforms on both the nuclear and zzso faces of the zzso We found that an individual zinc finger is the minimal interface for zzso association, although tandem zinc fingers are zzso These results provide new information about the critical components of nuclear membrane zzso and lay the foundation for a better understanding of how this process is zzso
