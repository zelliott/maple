zzso regulation of the gene zzso the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso of a variety of zzso events, is likely to involve important regulators of zzso Here we identify two mouse zzso proteins that bind to an upstream regulatory element in the zzso promoter: zzso related to zzso cut and human zzso and zzso a novel protein with a zzso related to that of the zzso paired zzso In transient zzso experiments, zzso was found to be a strong inhibitor of zzso promoter activity, and this zzso could be relieved by simultaneously zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene might be a direct target of zzso proteins and provide a striking example of regulatory zzso between zzso proteins of different zzso Whereas the expression pattern of zzso includes many zzso sites, zzso expression was restricted to cells also expressing zzso or their zzso The zzso data thus strongly reinforce the notion that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso In the peripheral nervous system, zzso was strongly expressed in all zzso of the zzso nervous system and more zzso in some zzso sensory zzso but not in the sensory zzso of the zzso zzso transcripts were detected in the zzso of sympathetic zzso as soon as they zzso zzso expression in the brain was confined to zzso restricted zzso in the zzso which zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso once they are zzso All zzso components of the peripheral nervous system are at least zzso zzso or zzso In the developing brain, zzso was expressed at all known locations of zzso zzso and of their zzso These results suggest that zzso in addition to regulating the zzso zzso may be part of the regulatory cascade that controls the differentiation of zzso towards this neurotransmitter zzso
