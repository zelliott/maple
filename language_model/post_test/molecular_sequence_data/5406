zzso although closely related in zzso show intriguing differences in their zzso zzso those that have a high or intermediate zzso for phase separation are zzso whereas low zzso zzso are zzso To address the molecular basis of phase zzso X-ray zzso has been used to define the structural differences between high and low zzso zzso A zzso for this study was to clarify the assignment of bovine gene sequences to bovine zzso proteins used for zzso zzso Based on zzso sequence analyses of gamma E and gamma F bovine zzso zzso gamma F zzso to the previously zzso high zzso protein bovine gamma zzso and gamma E zzso to the high zzso bovine protein fraction previously known as gamma zzso The gamma F sequence has enabled the completion of the refinement of the bovine gamma F crystal structure which shows that the zzso has an additional surface zzso explaining why gamma F has different zzso properties from gamma zzso A high zzso protein from rat zzso gamma E zzso has been zzso and the X-ray structure solved at zzso A zzso zzso of the X-ray structures of two high zzso zzso rat gamma E and bovine gamma zzso with the structures of two low zzso zzso bovine gamma B and bovine gamma D, shows that the main zzso change between high and low zzso proteins is in the zzso surface loop of motif zzso All four structures have numerous zzso pairs on their surfaces leading to a high surface charge density, yet with low overall zzso zzso of the lattice contacts of the two high zzso proteins with the two low zzso zzso indicates that these high zzso proteins zzso more zzso interactions such as between zzso and zzso zzso of the sequences of all the zzso which have been zzso for phase separation temperature indicates that only zzso zzso zzso uniquely zzso zzso from zzso zzso and it is close to the altered surface zzso Although this region probably contributes to phase zzso zzso is likely to be a function of an overall global property that is responsive to overall charge zzso zzso zzso moments of native zzso low zzso zzso sequences threaded into high zzso zzso structures, and vice versa, show how both sequence and zzso structure contribute to this overall zzso High zzso zzso have on average higher zzso ratios and higher zzso zzso It is zzso that this increases the proportion of surface zzso paired charged networks which thus reduces the repulsive zzso force and so increases the attractive interactions of the protein-rich phase in zzso liquid phase zzso
