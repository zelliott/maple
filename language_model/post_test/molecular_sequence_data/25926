zzso structure of the gene coding for zzso zzso of influenza virus zzso isolated during the zzso of influenza in zzso in 1980 was zzso The close relationship of zzso gene of this virus to the corresponding gene of the virus zzso was zzso It was shown that a single zzso in an zzso site (the change from zzso to zzso at position 51 of zzso zzso caused an zzso zzso One silent zzso was detected zzso zzso of zzso zzso which points at the zzso of strains zzso with zzso and with other more recent zzso These data allowed to determine the position of the strain zzso zzso gene regarding to the evolutionary relationships of zzso genes of influenza A zzso zzso zzso The branch leading to the zzso strain is supposed to start from a point common for strains isolated following zzso The zzso of zzso genes presented in this zzso were zzso supporting the notion on limited evolutionary potential of the zzso zzso influenza zzso
