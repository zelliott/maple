The response regulator zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso constitute a zzso system in the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso is known to activate zzso of more than 120 genes in zzso zzso including the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso To characterize zzso regulation of zzso the interaction of the zzso regulatory region with zzso zzso was analyzed using gel zzso and footprint zzso This revealed that zzso bound three direct repeats of a motif that is known to be arranged as an zzso repeat in the zzso promoter, to which zzso zzso zzso analysis using a zzso fusion revealed that the three direct repeats in zzso are needed for zzso zzso zzso
