zzso Forest virus zzso is a zzso pathogen of small zzso and infection of adult mice with zzso a zzso strain of zzso leads to lethal encephalitis in a few days, whereas mice infected with the zzso zzso strain remain zzso In adult zzso zzso is unable to form zzso and hence does not reach a critical threshold of zzso zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso we have cloned and zzso the entire zzso zzso of zzso and compared it to the highly zzso zzso zzso We found several sequence differences and sought to zzso zzso zzso the zzso by using a panel of zzso between zzso and a cloned zzso zzso We first localized zzso zzso in the zzso region by showing that zzso structural genes combined with the zzso zzso zzso produced a highly virulent virus, while a zzso zzso was zzso In addition to several zzso acid zzso in the zzso region, the zzso gene of zzso displayed an zzso termination zzso and an zzso zzso deletion close to the zzso zzso Replacement in zzso of the entire zzso gene with that of zzso zzso the virulent zzso whereas an zzso at the zzso position significantly increased zzso leading to clinical symptoms in zzso zzso of the zzso deletion in zzso did not increase zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso other than the deleted zzso are mainly responsible for the zzso of zzso and that the attenuating zzso reside entirely in the zzso zzso
