zzso of zzso zzso are a key zzso factor, being the major zzso of this zzso zzso and contributing to specificity for the human zzso zzso are zzso modified by addition of an zzso zzso zzso zzso In a previous study the authors identified and characterized a zzso zzso zzso a zzso involved in zzso zzso In this study a set of random zzso sequences from zzso zzso strain zzso was used to search for further genes involved in zzso zzso Initially, an open reading frame was identified, and designated zzso zzso zzso gene zzso which was zzso to genes involved in zzso zzso The region adjacent to this gene was cloned and zzso sequence analysis revealed two further zzso zzso and zzso which were also zzso with genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso a strain with zzso zzso and zzso zzso structures, to determine whether these genes had a role in the zzso of either of these zzso Analysis of these zzso revealed that there was no zzso in the zzso of zzso in any of the zzso strains as judged by zzso gel zzso In contrast, increased gel migration of the zzso zzso molecules of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by Western analysis was zzso zzso from each of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not react with a zzso zzso confirming that the gel migration differences were due to the zzso or absence of the zzso zzso structure in these zzso In addition, zzso specific for the zzso zzso failed to react with zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso sequence zzso has suggested specific roles for zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso
