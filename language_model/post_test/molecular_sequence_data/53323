The K zzso zzso motif is one of the major classes of zzso acid binding zzso Some members of this family have been shown to interact with DNA while others have zzso zzso There have been no reports containing direct experimental evidence regarding the nature of zzso zzso zzso In this study, the interaction of the zzso zzso domain of zzso nuclear zzso K zzso with its zzso zzso DNA zzso are zzso Chemical shift zzso mapping indicates that the first two zzso the zzso zzso loop, beta 1, and beta 2, are the primary regions involved in DNA binding for zzso The nature of the zzso interaction is further illuminated by a comparison of backbone zzso relaxation data for the bound and zzso zzso zzso data are also used to confirm that the backbone of zzso zzso is structurally identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso which was previously zzso zzso zzso exchange experiments indicate that the two zzso involved in DNA binding are less stable than other regions of secondary structure and that a large portion of zzso backbone zzso zzso are protected in some manner upon zzso zzso The major backbone dynamics features of zzso are similar to those of the structurally comparable human zzso zzso DNA binding zzso Secondary structure information for zzso zzso zzso is also presented and shows that binding results in no global changes in the protein zzso
