zzso is a zzso protein that was initially identified from rat zzso zzso cultures and has been suggested to be a sensitive marker to monitor the integrity of zzso cell zzso However, the expression of the zzso gene in other species and the molecular mechanisms that govern its zzso are zzso To address these issues, we cloned and characterized the mouse zzso zzso A full-length mouse zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso was isolated by library zzso zzso analysis revealed that mouse zzso shares zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with rat zzso and zzso L of zzso zzso and human, respectively, at the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Southern zzso analysis demonstrated that mouse zzso transcripts were predominantly expressed in the zzso The mouse zzso gene spans over 21 zzso zzso and contains eight zzso interrupted by seven zzso zzso extension analysis and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends identified a major zzso start site located zzso base pairs upstream from the translation initiation zzso Analysis of a zzso mouse zzso zzso region revealed that it lacked zzso and zzso boxes, and the region was not zzso zzso By the use of deletion analysis, in zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso we identified within the zzso promoter region three closely spaced putative binding sites for zzso zzso factor, and zzso factor 1 that are important for zzso gene zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso These zzso elements are also present in the zzso zzso substance zzso zzso zzso raising a possibility that the transcriptions of zzso and zzso genes are controlled by similar zzso
