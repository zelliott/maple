zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the adult zzso zzso is efficiently antagonized by the zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel rat zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso that generates zzso channels of low zzso sensitivity upon expression in zzso zzso zzso with the highly zzso human alpha 2 zzso and zzso zzso identified a single zzso acid exchange at position 167 that causes the altered pharmacology of alpha zzso zzso zzso by the zzso chain reaction revealed a strong decrease in alpha zzso zzso zzso during zzso spinal zzso zzso These data indicate that alpha zzso represents a zzso binding zzso of the previously identified zzso zzso zzso of low zzso zzso
