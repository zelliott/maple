zzso is an immediate early zzso factor that is induced by a variety of zzso signaling agents, including growth factors, zzso zzso and agents that elevate zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso of the gene zzso zzso by these agents is not well zzso By using the zzso gene together with zzso DNA in zzso experiments, we show that a serum response element zzso and/or a zzso response element zzso downstream of the gene mediate the response of the gene in mouse zzso zzso cells to serum, zzso growth factor, basic zzso growth factor, zzso zzso and zzso In addition, a segment of DNA just upstream of the zzso box is required for optimal zzso of the zzso
