zzso coding for the zzso protein zzso were cloned and characterized as a first step in understanding the expression of this zzso during zzso Three overlapping zzso zzso were isolated from a human zzso zzso expression zzso These zzso zzso to a zzso zzso that was present in human zzso but was not found in liver or zzso Complete sequencing of these zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso produced an zzso sequence containing a zzso zzso region for the zzso zzso zzso plots generated from the deduced zzso acid sequence showed a very zzso zzso zzso characteristic of a signal zzso zzso data showed that three different zzso acid repeats occurred a total of 16 times in the central third of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso has an internal zzso pair (19 zzso zzso zzso deletion that is not present in zzso suggesting that alternative zzso generates more than one zzso zzso The zzso protein appears to be a unique zzso zzso based on previous zzso data and the observation that zzso zzso sequences did not show any significant zzso to other sequences found in the zzso National zzso Research Foundation, or Swiss sequence zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein was produced in an zzso coli expression zzso and used to generate a zzso zzso This zzso stained the zzso cap in zzso and reacted with a similar set of peptides on Western blots as did a zzso zzso to zzso
