Human zzso is expressed in the zzso of patients with zzso arthritis zzso and can elicit a regulatory T cell response in the peripheral blood and zzso zzso However, zzso can also trigger strong zzso zzso Thus, to understand the nature of these zzso responses in zzso it is necessary to study such responses at the zzso zzso zzso This study was undertaken to characterize the disease specificity and function of zzso zzso zzso as possible zzso of zzso inflammation in zzso 

zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso incorporation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and measurement of zzso production zzso multiplex zzso and zzso zzso were performed after in zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells from patients with zzso compared with healthy zzso 

A disease zzso immune recognition, characterized by T cell proliferation as well as increased production of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found for 3 of the 8 selected peptides in patients with zzso as compared with healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeling showed that zzso T cells were the subset primarily responsible for both the T cell proliferation and the zzso production in zzso Interestingly, the human peptides had a remarkably different zzso with a zzso higher zzso ratio, compared with that of the microbial zzso 

These results suggest a zzso zzso role of zzso T cells in the inflammatory processes of zzso zzso these zzso zzso could be used as a tool to study the zzso T cell response in zzso and might be suitable candidates for use in zzso
