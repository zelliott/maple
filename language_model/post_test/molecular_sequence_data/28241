The zzso T greater than C zzso in the promoter of the A zzso or G zzso gene causes a zzso fold increase of the expression of the respective gene in adult zzso cells zzso zzso of Fetal zzso We show here that this zzso increases zzso fold the expression of a zzso reporter zzso zzso into the zzso cells zzso but not that of the same zzso in non zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso is abolished by the zzso of the binding site for the zzso specific factor zzso zzso of the adjacent binding site for the ubiquitous factor zzso does not cause zzso of the normal zzso zzso Previous results demonstrated that the zzso zzso slightly increases the in zzso binding of zzso and almost zzso that of zzso the present functional data indicate that altered binding of zzso but not of zzso is responsible for the observed zzso of the zzso zzso
