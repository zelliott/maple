A particularly important stress for all cells is the one produced by zzso oxygen species zzso that are formed as byproducts of cell zzso Among DNA damages induced by zzso zzso zzso is certainly the product that has retained most of the attention in the past few zzso The biological relevance of zzso in DNA has been unveiled by the study of zzso coli and zzso zzso genes involved in the zzso of the zzso effects of zzso These zzso zzso and zzso for zzso coli and zzso for zzso code for DNA zzso zzso of any of those genes leads to a spontaneous zzso zzso characterized by the increase in zzso to zzso zzso In zzso the zzso gene encodes a DNA zzso zzso that zzso zzso from zzso In human cells, the zzso gene is localized on zzso zzso and encodes two forms of zzso protein which result from an alternative zzso of a single zzso zzso The zzso protein has a nuclear zzso whereas the zzso is targeted to the zzso zzso studies on the zzso protein show that it is a DNA zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso Several approaches have been used to study the biological role of zzso in zzso cells, ranging from its zzso in cell lines to the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, to explore a possible role in the prevention of cancer, the zzso coding for zzso has been zzso in human zzso All these results point to zzso as an zzso source of zzso in zzso and to its likely involvement in the process of zzso A review of the recent literature on the zzso zzso zzso the main repair system involved in the elimination of this zzso zzso is zzso
