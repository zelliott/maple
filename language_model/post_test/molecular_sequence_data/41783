A computer searching zzso has been used to identify protein sequences in the zzso Information Resource zzso database with zzso mass information zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso of proteins analyzed by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso mass zzso A theoretical analysis of the zzso c family demonstrates the ability to identify protein sequences in the zzso database with a high degree of accuracy using a set of six predicted zzso zzso zzso This method was also applied to zzso determined zzso masses for a small zzso zzso a protein from pig zzso the human sex steroid binding zzso and a zzso DNA zzso The results demonstrate that a set of observed masses which is less than 50% of the total number of predicted masses can be used to identify a protein sequence in the zzso For the analysis presented in this paper, a mass matching tolerance of 1 zzso is zzso Under these conditions, mass maps created by fast atom zzso mass zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso would also be zzso In cases where multiple matches are observed or zzso of the protein identification is needed, tandem mass zzso sequencing can be used to establish sequence zzso
