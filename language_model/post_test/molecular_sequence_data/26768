The zzso zzso species zzso recently was reclassified as a new zzso zzso zzso four species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only limited zzso analysis of strains within zzso has been carried out, however, and zzso ambiguity is evident within this group, especially for zzso unusual strains and certain strains isolated from zzso zzso zzso to examine in depth the evolutionary relationships within zzso and redefine the host affiliations of symbiotic species, we examined several previously identified and newly isolated strains using zzso analysis based on multiple independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region, and the zzso zzso zzso The analysis resolved zzso as distinct from zzso zzso and other zzso of zzso and resolved zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso However, it also revealed that several previously reported strains are incorrectly identified and that substantial zzso diversity exists in this zzso Specifically, strain zzso zzso zzso and several other strains having a zzso zzso were not members of zzso zzso Furthermore, no strain previously identified as zzso zzso grouped with the type strain zzso zzso and no zzso strain of zzso zzso was identified as a zzso zzso Several additional strains identified previously as zzso zzso group instead with the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso or are members of a new zzso Two strongly supported zzso were evident within zzso zzso a zzso structure that might reflect differences in the host species or differences in the ecological zzso of zzso The results of this study highlight the importance of basing zzso conclusions on examination of type zzso
