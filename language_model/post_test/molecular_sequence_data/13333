Using a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso responses to the zzso domain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso induce an acute zzso zzso of experimental zzso zzso zzso in the Lewis zzso zzso with 100 zzso of zzso in zzso at the base of the tail induced mild clinical disease in 9 of 11 animals zzso clinical score zzso The disease was zzso zzso by the presence of inflammation and focal zzso zzso in the central nervous system zzso zzso transfer experiments suggest that this inflammatory zzso pathology is zzso by zzso between a zzso zzso zzso T cell response and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso selected zzso T cell lines, the zzso T cell response to this domain of zzso was found to zzso two distinct zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso demonstrated that the zzso B cell zzso was located within the zzso acid sequence zzso However although active zzso with synthetic peptides corresponding to the T cell zzso zzso or zzso induced an inflammatory response in the zzso this was not associated with zzso indicating that the zzso zzso response zzso other, possibly zzso dependent zzso This study unequivocally demonstrates that zzso zzso responses are alone sufficient to induce a zzso disease of the zzso and supports the proposal that zzso may play an important role in the zzso of multiple zzso
