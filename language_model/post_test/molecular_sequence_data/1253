Human zzso (formerly zzso human zzso and mouse zzso (also known as zzso zzso integral membrane zzso The human genes are located at zzso zzso and zzso which are regions frequently deleted in human zzso We have searched for additional members of the zzso family and by molecular cloning identified human zzso and its mouse zzso zzso Human zzso is located at zzso zzso In zzso analysis of public databases revealed a mouse zzso zzso three zzso zzso in the zzso fish zzso zzso and one zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The human and mouse zzso zzso have the same predicted domain zzso a signal zzso 15 tandem zzso repeats with zzso zzso and zzso zzso three zzso zzso a zzso domain, and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso domain, the zzso domain, and the zzso part of the zzso zzso the most zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and real-time zzso revealed that the three zzso zzso are widely expressed in human and mouse zzso In conclusion, the zzso gene family was found to have three widely expressed zzso zzso corresponding zzso in fish, and a zzso in zzso
