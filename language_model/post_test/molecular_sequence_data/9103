zzso a zzso zzso zzso has diverse biological zzso Previously, we have identified various biologically active sequences in zzso by a systematic zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso enhance the biological functions of the active sequences and are useful as a zzso Here, we zzso sixty biologically active zzso peptides onto zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoted various biological activities, including cell attachment, zzso and zzso zzso The biological activities of zzso zzso depend on the zzso These zzso zzso are zzso into six groups depending on their biological zzso Next, we zzso five active zzso which showed strong cell attachment activity in the each group, onto a single zzso zzso to mimic the multiple activities of zzso The mixed zzso zzso significantly promoted cell attachment and cell spreading over that observed with the individual zzso We also demonstrated that a mixed zzso zzso using four zzso zzso peptides each from a different group, enhanced the zzso These data suggest that the mixed peptides zzso induce zzso biological activities on a zzso zzso The active zzso zzso described here have potential for use as zzso for tissue engineering and zzso
