A zzso of the zzso proteins that reside in the zzso zzso and the nuclear envelope including human zzso a protein zzso in zzso zzso is called the zzso family of zzso zzso A zzso alignment of this family with zzso proteins of known structure reveals a zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso proteins within the zzso zzso A structural model predicts this zzso to be a part of an zzso zzso bond, suggesting that it may function as a zzso sensor to regulate zzso zzso In zzso experiments with zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso changes that reduce this zzso bond affect the binding of zzso and zzso and cause an attendant local zzso change detected by limited zzso zzso worms expressing an zzso gene with zzso zzso that disrupt the zzso bond have a very low zzso hatch rate compared with zzso controls, indicating these two zzso are essential for zzso zzso We propose that the zzso in zzso family proteins is a zzso zzso This regulatory mechanism may be central to the function of zzso and human zzso
