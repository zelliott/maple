Studies in our laboratory have identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated and zzso DNA fragments linked to zzso to determine if they contained additional factors associated with zzso zzso or survival in the zzso An open reading frame just upstream and zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso was identified and named zzso Northern zzso indicated that zzso is transcribed as a zzso zzso zzso encodes a predicted zzso protein with a molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso zzso contains the essential motif zzso typical of many zzso zzso and zzso zzso has significant sequence identity to zzso zzso including zzso zzso which converts a potent zzso into its active form, and neutral zzso zzso which is involved in terminating the activity of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a natural zzso of zzso Cell extracts of zzso zzso zzso at the same site as does zzso while an extract from an zzso zzso zzso zzso did zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso encodes an zzso with activity similar to that of known zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and its zzso suggests lateral genetic exchange between bacteria and zzso
