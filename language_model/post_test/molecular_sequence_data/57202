zzso we report that zzso of either human or zzso zzso zzso receptors lacking their entire zzso zzso in cells bearing functionally active zzso gamma receptors zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso in a dominant negative zzso zzso could also be induced in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso that either lack 39 zzso zzso acids or contain an zzso substitution for a functionally critical zzso zzso of the full-length zzso did not alter cellular responsiveness to zzso zzso The zzso activities of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso to a variety of cellular responses, and zzso zzso expressing zzso ratios of zzso to zzso zzso were unresponsive to zzso gamma even at doses 30,000 times greater than that required to induce a zzso response in zzso zzso These results provide an example of a dominant negative zzso that effects the complete zzso of a zzso zzso lacking a zzso domain and suggest a more general utility for dominant negative zzso in the study of zzso zzso zzso
