We present the first zzso state kinetic analysis of an zzso zzso The target zzso is the bacterial zzso DNA zzso which transfers the zzso group to the second zzso in the DNA sequence zzso The rate constant for conversion of the central complex zzso to products zzso zzso (41 zzso 7 zzso is over zzso faster than zzso consistent with our demonstration that steps after zzso transfer are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso zzso transfer at the zzso zzso zzso of zzso on each strand requires a single binding zzso
