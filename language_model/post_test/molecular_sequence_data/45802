zzso an 80 zzso protein expressed in zzso cells, promotes cell migration and invasion, and zzso tube formation in zzso zzso belongs to a new protein family with two additional members, zzso and zzso which are characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso Here, we report the identification of a 130 zzso zzso zzso of zzso that is expressed in different cell types including vascular zzso cells, as well as zzso of the zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso extension that mediates its association with zzso zzso of zzso into zzso cells zzso zzso fiber formation and changes cell zzso The zzso protein remained associated with zzso after zzso of zzso fibers with zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso does not promote cell migration and did not respond to zzso We propose that zzso and zzso play zzso roles in tube formation by affecting cell migration and cell shape, zzso
