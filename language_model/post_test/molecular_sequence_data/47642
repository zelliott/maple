zzso and 12 zzso zzso zzso proteins were surveyed for their capacity to zzso zzso by using an zzso zzso zzso Six zzso proteins identified by zzso zzso acid zzso were found to be active on zzso a barley leaf stress-related zzso two tomato fruit zzso a cherry fruit and two tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged in specific activity from zzso to 89 zzso zzso with zzso as zzso zzso activities were not restricted to zzso proteins strongly binding to zzso zzso since the two zzso were active without tight binding to zzso Some zzso proteins zzso crude zzso walls and one barley zzso zzso even zzso zzso zzso No activity was observed on zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the six zzso acted as zzso zzso leading to the formation of various zzso Thus far, the zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared different from the well-known zzso zzso zzso No activity was found with zzso zzso tobacco leaf zzso protein and four stress-related zzso proteins from barley and zzso This is the first demonstration that diverse zzso proteins are zzso zzso The functions of some zzso proteins must be zzso because they display zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso
