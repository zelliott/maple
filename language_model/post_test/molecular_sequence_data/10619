zzso zzso zzso interactions between charged zzso acids on the surfaces of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated as zzso of zzso zzso To evaluate the importance of these zzso interactions in determining the specificity of zzso formation, we constructed a pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which all the e and g positions are occupied by different combinations of zzso zzso acid, zzso or zzso The zzso properties of these zzso were evaluated based on the zzso of cells expressing zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso About zzso of the zzso do not form stable zzso Surprisingly, approximately zzso of the zzso sequences have zzso consistent with the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be classified into three types based on sequence zzso The zzso states of zzso from two of these types were determined by characterizing zzso fusion zzso The Type I zzso behaved as a zzso under all tested conditions, whereas the Type III zzso formed a variety of zzso zzso depending on the solution zzso zzso zzso comprise less than zzso of the zzso several zzso positions in these zzso could form attractive zzso zzso zzso repulsive zzso pairs are not found among the zzso zzso However, patterns of charged zzso at the e and g positions do not seem to be sufficient to predict either zzso or zzso formation among the zzso
