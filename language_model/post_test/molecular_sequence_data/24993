To establish a new protocol for sensitive detection and structural characterization of zzso zzso their sensitivities and structural information from mass zzso and tandem mass zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated in zzso Among these zzso methods, zzso and zzso gave zzso and predictable zzso carrying information on sequence and branching of zzso zzso after zzso with zzso zzso With both positive and negative zzso zzso their structural zzso promises to be straightforward, zzso zzso being measurable at as low as 200 zzso Thus, this method constitutes a powerful tool for sensitive detection and structural characterization of limited quantities of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso
