The zzso zzso zzso representing an zzso zzso an zzso protein was identified by the differential screening of a zzso library produced from zzso extracted from zzso tomato flowers zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in length and encodes a protein of 252 zzso zzso The deduced protein has a molecular mass of zzso zzso an zzso region predicted to be a signal zzso and a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso for the mature zzso The protein contains 16 zzso zzso and has zzso to zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso zzso The gene is expressed in flowers and fruit with the highest levels of transcript zzso in zzso from flowers at zzso No expression was detected in zzso zzso
