The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso recognize very similar, yet zzso promoter zzso The high zzso among the promoter sequences suggests that differential promoter recognition must derive from relatively small changes in the zzso zzso kinetic analyses of zzso from the zzso consensus promoter and from promoters modified in the region critical to specific recognition reveal details concerning which functional groups contribute to this zzso zzso include base pair zzso single base zzso zzso and simple functional group modifications at unique sites in the zzso The results show that zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso group on the zzso zzso in the major groove at position zzso while the identity of the base on the template strand is less critical to zzso In contrast, recognition at position zzso allows a greater range of modifications and seems to have a more complex zzso The results do not seem to be consistent with a single recognition contact at this zzso however, some groups may be ruled out as simple recognition zzso While major groove modifications weaken binding at positions zzso and zzso the removal of an zzso zzso group from the minor groove at either position does not disrupt zzso further supporting a model for promoter recognition in which the zzso binds to one face of closed duplex DNA in this zzso The effects of these changes in the DNA structure on the zzso of initiation are compared to complementary results from the zzso zzso
