zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family are remarkable in their ability to bind an extremely diverse range of protein and zzso zzso yet the basis for zzso recognition is poorly zzso Here, we report the zzso A X-ray structure of a complex between a zzso region of the zzso binding domain of the zzso and the third domain of zzso an escort protein for zzso family zzso The zzso domain forms a zzso bundle with two zzso sites, one for each zzso zzso The mode of recognition at each site is virtually zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso from each zzso module zzso a zzso side chain protruding from the second zzso of zzso This zzso mode of zzso recognition, together with zzso effects resulting from the use of multiple sites, represents a general binding strategy likely to apply in the binding of other basic zzso to zzso family zzso
