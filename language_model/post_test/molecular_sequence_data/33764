The zzso zzso and zzso are part of the zzso complex, which mediates zzso initiation as well as zzso zzso zzso repair zzso Although there is no zzso complex present in zzso most species contain both zzso and zzso and serve as a model for their zzso zzso Recently, a novel binding partner for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso To gain insights into its role in zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso We identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso recognizing DNA containing a 3' zzso zzso zzso conducted with DNA zzso providing different lengths of the 3' zzso indicate that zzso specifically zzso DNA in the zzso region of the 3' zzso 4-6 zzso to the zzso zzso DNA junction and thus is a zzso and not a zzso zzso In contrast, no incision was detected in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso DNA, or DNA containing few zzso zzso forming a zzso Several zzso zzso were generated based on multiple sequence alignments and examined with respect to their ability to perform the incision zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show a dramatic reduction in incision activity, indicating a pivotal role in zzso Interestingly, zzso does not exhibit any incision activity in the presence of zzso thus suggesting a role in zzso in which the zzso activity is tightly regulated until the damage has been recognized and verified prior to the incision zzso
