zzso of the zzso zzso are opportunistic human pathogens associated with urinary tract and wound infections, as well as enteric zzso The zzso zzso O zzso zzso major zzso zzso upon the cell surface and is used for zzso of zzso zzso Recently, zzso O zzso structures have been extensively zzso but no data on the location and organization of the O zzso gene cluster have been zzso In this study, the four zzso zzso sequences available were zzso and the putative O zzso gene cluster was identified in the zzso locus between the zzso and zzso zzso This finding provided the necessary information for designing zzso and cloning and sequencing the O zzso gene clusters from five more zzso zzso zzso The gene functions predicted in zzso were in agreement with the known O zzso zzso zzso zzso of the genes involved in the three-step synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was supported by cloning and zzso characterization of the corresponding zzso In one strain zzso zzso zzso no zzso product of the gene cluster in the zzso locus was found, and hence genes for synthesis of the existing O zzso are located elsewhere in the zzso In addition to the putative O zzso synthesis zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and (in three zzso zzso required for the surface expression of zzso zzso were found upstream of zzso in all species except zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of these species may be attributed to the so-called K zzso zzso The data obtained open a way for development of a zzso typing method for identification of zzso zzso
