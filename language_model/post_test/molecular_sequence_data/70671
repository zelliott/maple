The copper zzso complex of zzso in water solution at pH zzso was investigated by zzso The temperature dependence of zzso relaxation rates was measured and fast exchange conditions were shown to zzso The zzso correlation time of the complex was zzso by the zzso zzso correlation time of free zzso in water solution zzso c zzso zzso zzso at 300 zzso zzso of a zzso zzso complex was demonstrated by relaxation rates analysis and also by zzso zzso Two zzso zzso of zzso together with the zzso nitrogen and the zzso in the zzso zzso side chain, were assigned as the zzso sites and a model of the complex was built by using zzso distances obtained by zzso analysis as input zzso
