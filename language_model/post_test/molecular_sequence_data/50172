zzso zzso using zzso or zzso zzso is a popular method for generating zzso zzso zzso in model zzso zzso are mapped to specific genes by amplifying (via zzso and sequencing zzso regions zzso the inserted zzso The presence of multiple zzso templates in one sequencing reaction results in zzso sequence of zzso low zzso Standard processing of this sequence by applying zzso quality requirements results in loss of zzso zzso whereas not trimming low-quality sequence causes inclusion of zzso zzso from the ends of sequence zzso zzso mapping of the zzso sequences is complicated by the presence of gene zzso 

zzso for zzso zzso regions from sequence traces obtained by sequencing multiple zzso fragments in a single reaction are zzso The completely zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso were devised to define and select high quality matches and precisely map each insert to the correct zzso zzso These methods were used to analyze sequence of zzso zzso regions of the zzso from individual plants in a zzso population of zzso zzso and are zzso to similar situations where a reference zzso can be used to extract information from zzso zzso
