The zzso gene known as the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso coli was identified as a new gene involved in zzso and zzso zzso This gene encodes a highly zzso membrane protein that contains 10 predicted zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is an zzso substitution at position zzso in relation to the zzso start zzso increases the expression level of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gene results in resistance to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a variety of other zzso acids and zzso acid zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso in resistant cells and increased production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the respective producing zzso The zzso protein belongs to a vast family of zzso The zzso of zzso coli contains at least 10 zzso of zzso zzso analysis indicates that a common zzso of living organisms contained several zzso zzso
