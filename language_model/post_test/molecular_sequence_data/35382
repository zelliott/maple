zzso zzso infected zzso zzso accumulate in the zzso through the interaction between zzso like zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these zzso including zzso and zzso may affect their zzso or zzso zzso eventually increasing zzso and its adverse effects on pregnancy zzso A total of zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were obtained from transcripts of 20 zzso zzso infecting zzso women, resulting in 176 zzso and 191 zzso unique sequences at the protein zzso zzso alignments were divided in segments containing combinations of correlated zzso and the association of segment sequences with zzso zzso density was tested using zzso corrected zzso models, taking into consideration the weight of each sequence in the zzso Three zzso and three zzso segments contained signatures of high zzso density zzso that were highly prevalent in the zzso population zzso zzso regions included a flexible loop that contributes to zzso interaction and two zzso motifs with evidence of positive natural zzso Limited zzso responses against signatures of high zzso density among zzso pregnant women could not explain the increased zzso zzso These results suggest that a higher binding efficiency to zzso rather than reduced zzso might provide a biological advantage to zzso with high zzso density signatures in zzso zzso contributing to high zzso may be critical for the functional characterization of zzso and the development of tools against zzso zzso
