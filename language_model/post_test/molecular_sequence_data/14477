During a study intended to screen for zzso bacteria, strain zzso was isolated from black sand off the shore of zzso Island, Republic of zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso the zzso gene of the isolate had zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolate was closely related to members of the zzso zzso but was clearly discernible from reported zzso species, based on a zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso had zzso gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso the most closely related type strain of the zzso zzso These results suggest that strain zzso represents a novel species in the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso zzso B zzso
