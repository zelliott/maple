zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso membrane protein participating in zzso of zzso fatty acids and oxidized low density zzso playing an important role in zzso zzso We reported the dual promoter structures of the mouse and human zzso genes in relation to the zzso expression and regulation by zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, these structures alone could not explain a large induction of the zzso by a zzso zzso in the mouse zzso To learn more about the zzso zzso regulation of the zzso gene for zzso zzso at the whole body level, we cloned the zzso for the induced zzso in the mouse zzso and identified third promoter close to the first common zzso of the zzso The human gene also has essentially the same gene zzso zzso and Northern zzso analyses showed that the three promoters are zzso used in various mouse zzso and the cultured human zzso The zzso significance of these complex promoter structures was suggested by the differential responsiveness to a zzso zzso zzso zzso and the differences in zzso efficiencies or zzso of the zzso among the zzso
