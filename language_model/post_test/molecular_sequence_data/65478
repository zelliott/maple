In zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso model was proposed to account for zzso zzso first, the zzso zzso zzso I transfers zzso from membrane zzso to nascent zzso zzso second, the zzso zzso zzso II swaps zzso from one zzso zzso to zzso Gene zzso was reported to zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso II is a soluble form of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, timing of zzso substitution was zzso zzso substitution by zzso zzso occurs zzso probably during the backbone zzso whereas zzso addition is a very progressive zzso Thus, both zzso zzso activities appear biologically necessary for complete zzso zzso
