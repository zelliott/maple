We observed that binding sites for the zzso expressed zzso factor zzso were present in regulatory regions of multiple zzso zzso In these regions, the zzso binding site was adjacent to a site for the zzso factor zzso Using three such regulatory regions (from genes zzso the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated the functional importance of the adjacent zzso zzso In particular, zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso generating a zzso complex with zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso consensus greatly impaired zzso activity in transient zzso zzso with zzso zzso Similar results were obtained by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells showed that zzso binds in zzso to all three regulatory elements and that both zzso and zzso were present on the same zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso sites may represent a novel module for zzso expression of a number of zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso pull-down experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between zzso and zzso This may contribute to the functional cooperation between these factors and provide an explanation for the important role of ubiquitous zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso
