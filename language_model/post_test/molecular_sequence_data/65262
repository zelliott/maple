The zzso gene is a member of a family of four genes that zzso a class of zzso growth zzso This gene has been reported to express a protein designated here as zzso We describe here a novel zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso region containing a predicted type I zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were shown to be expressed on the cell surface, as expected by the presence of a predicted zzso zzso and were modified at a single zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso stabilization of expression of both proteins was seen in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that they are normally zzso by this zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in both zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso form of zzso was detected in the cell medium which showed biological activity in two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso formation in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso and expression of green fluorescent zzso proteins and zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso showed that zzso is localized to membrane ruffles, while zzso has a more zzso membrane zzso
