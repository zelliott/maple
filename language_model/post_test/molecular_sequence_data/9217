zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso proteins coded in the zzso zzso as zzso was applied for the zzso of the zzso from the zzso To construct a zzso protein database, zzso zzso of type strains of the zzso and their related zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were zzso using specific zzso designed based on zzso sequences of zzso zzso The observed zzso mass zzso of intact cells were compared with the theoretical mass of the constructed zzso protein zzso The nine selected zzso coded in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could successfully distinguish the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria strain zzso despite only one base difference in the zzso zzso gene zzso This method, named the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein mass zzso method, is a significantly useful tool for bacterial discrimination of the zzso at the strain level and can detect and monitor the main zzso zzso bacteria in the zzso
