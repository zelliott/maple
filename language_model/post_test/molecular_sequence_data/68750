A zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso from the principal zzso zzso zzso zzso of the envelope of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso has been inserted within internal zzso sites of either zzso or zzso two envelope proteins from zzso coli zzso The zzso hybrid protein zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the zzso of zzso coli zzso and the zzso loop zzso was zzso on the surface of the native protein by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso bridge between the two zzso of the loop was zzso In contrast, genetic zzso to the outer membrane protein zzso did not allow the expression of a stable hybrid zzso and major zzso zzso products of the zzso loop were detected by zzso zzso The two zzso hybrid genes were transferred to an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso loop had no zzso effect on cell growth and on the survival in zzso of the recipient zzso The zzso loop was not zzso expressed in zzso either in zzso or in zzso Live zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso loop hybrids were used to zzso zzso The zzso loop hybrid induced zzso envelope zzso zzso by Western zzso and zzso while the zzso envelope zzso induced by the zzso loop hybrid were only zzso by Western zzso In addition, zzso zzso loop hybrid protein was able to stimulate in zzso and induce in zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
