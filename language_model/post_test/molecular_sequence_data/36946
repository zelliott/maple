The recent establishment of a role for zzso in mouse lung zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso prompted us to study its expression in the developing zzso zzso A and B chains were detected in the zzso lung from the first hours of development zzso In zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso studies of lung cells in zzso indicated that both zzso and zzso produce complete zzso zzso zzso analysis of the in zzso zzso studies showed a gradual increase in zzso expression during development which was further supported by zzso and zzso The overall pattern of expression suggested that the effects of zzso in zzso were not restricted to a particular stage of zzso Furthermore, the increase in expression during late development supported a role for the zzso in the fetal zzso which was not previously zzso We next determined whether the increase in zzso production modulated the behavior of fetal lung cells as compared with their embryonic zzso We previously showed that zzso pattern formation does not occur in cultures of mixed embryonic lung cells unless zzso zzso is added zzso et zzso zzso zzso pattern formation is the result of cell sorting into zzso and zzso compartments and further zzso in a pattern resembling the tissue of zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso pattern formation occurs spontaneously in cultures of mixed fetal lung cells, which express high zzso zzso zzso formation was abolished by zzso to zzso These studies suggest a correlation between zzso expression and the ability of lung cells in culture to reproduce normal tissue zzso We conclude that zzso is critical for zzso recognition and further zzso interaction during both the embryonic and fetal stages of lung zzso
