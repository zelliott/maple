zzso is an zzso protein of zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso In this work, we report the zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso expressed and zzso from zzso coli, showed an zzso slow migration on zzso The zzso expressed protein behaves zzso Using mass zzso and zzso mass zzso we demonstrated that the protein has the expected molecular mass zzso zzso modification of zzso groups reverted the anomalous migration on zzso zzso exclusion zzso showed that zzso has a zzso radius larger than zzso zzso is zzso and lacks extensive structure, as determined by CD zzso Based on these findings, we suggest that zzso is a representative of the growing group of zzso zzso zzso
