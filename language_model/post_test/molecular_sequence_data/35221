zzso stress zzso factor zzso growth zzso clone 22 domain 3 zzso is a zzso factor that plays an zzso role in zzso zzso Its zzso and protein levels are zzso under zzso zzso However, its zzso and zzso functions have not been studied in any zzso freshwater zzso zzso is an excellent model to perform such study to unfold the functional role of zzso 

We identified the zzso zzso and performed zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso did not response to zzso stress and zzso zzso or zzso by injecting zzso or capped zzso did not change the zzso levels of any of the known zzso zzso To reveal the unknown function of zzso zzso we performed several in zzso molecular marker studies on zzso zzso and found that zzso plays zzso roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain zzso We then aimed to identify the mechanism of zzso in the earliest stages of zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso is a zzso gene that can stimulate the zzso of bone zzso protein 4 zzso and, thus, has a positive effect on the zzso signaling zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso and zzso tumor domain containing protein 4 zzso In addition, the interruption of zzso signaling by double zzso of zzso and zzso reduced the zzso effects in zzso zzso 

This is the first study to identify new zzso functions of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso is a zzso gene and plays a role in early zzso
