An zzso for detecting local clusters of zzso genes was applied to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of two or more zzso genes are abundant, totaling zzso clusters containing zzso zzso over one-fifth of all genes in zzso zzso zzso genes are distributed zzso in the zzso with the large majority located on zzso zzso arms, regions characterized by higher genetic zzso and more repeat sequences than zzso centers and the X zzso zzso genes are transcribed at much lower levels than average and very few have gross zzso as zzso by zzso reduction of zzso The molecular identity of cluster genes is unusual, with a preponderance of zzso gene families that zzso putative zzso and zzso zzso and enrichment for genes implicated in zzso zzso and innate zzso Gene zzso in zzso zzso is also substantial and the molecular identity of clustered genes follows a similar zzso I zzso that zzso zzso arms in zzso zzso undergo frequent local gene zzso and that these zzso support gene diversification and rapid evolution in response to environmental zzso Although specific gene clusters have been documented in zzso zzso their zzso zzso distribution, and unusual molecular identities were previously zzso
