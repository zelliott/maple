Members of the zzso zzso in zzso gene family are important players in the process of zzso and their zzso accounts for zzso of human male zzso zzso the zzso of the family, is mainly involved in male zzso in most zzso With the exception of zzso and zzso zzso nothing is known on the function of zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we report on three zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso whilst zzso is expressed in zzso and developing zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso differentiation whereas zzso showed no effect upon zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso egg maturation and led to female zzso We further demonstrated the evolutionary functional conservation of zzso by introducing this gene into zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to rescue the progression of fly zzso zzso In zzso our findings provide evidence for an involvement of zzso genes in male and female zzso development in one zzso Furthermore, zzso gene function is shown here for the first time in a zzso Our results point to a more diverse functional assignment of zzso zzso zzso a better understanding of zzso function in zzso can help to zzso the molecular mechanisms of and zzso zzso in higher organisms including zzso
