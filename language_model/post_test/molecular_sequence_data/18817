Rice is one of the major crop species in the world helping to sustain approximately half of the global population's diet especially in zzso However, due to the impact of extreme climate change and global warming, rice crop production and yields may be adversely affected resulting in a world food zzso Researchers have been keen to understand the effects of drought, temperature and other environmental stress factors on rice plant growth and zzso Gene expression zzso technology represents a key strategy for the identification of genes and their associated expression patterns in response to zzso Here, we report on the development of the rice zzso zzso platform which is suitable for two major rice subspecies, zzso and zzso 

The rice zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a total of zzso zzso covering 20,806 genes of zzso and zzso genes of zzso Through a validation study, total zzso isolated from rice shoots and roots were used for comparison of gene expression profiles via zzso zzso The results were submitted to zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso Data can be found under the zzso zzso number zzso zzso A list of significantly zzso expressed genes was zzso zzso zzso genes were identified among zzso zzso zzso and 463 zzso genes were found among zzso zzso zzso GO enrichment analysis demonstrates these results are in agreement with the known zzso processes of the different zzso Furthermore, zzso validation was performed on 66 zzso and found to significantly correlate with the zzso results (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The rice zzso 22 K zzso the first rice zzso covering both zzso and zzso subspecies was designed and validated in a comprehensive study of gene expression in rice zzso The rice zzso zzso platform revealed high specificity and zzso Additional information for the rice zzso zzso can be found at zzso
