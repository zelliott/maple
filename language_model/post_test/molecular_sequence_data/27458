We produced zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein of dengue zzso 2 virus zzso zzso First, a zzso protein fused to zzso C protein zzso was zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso by factor zzso zzso to obtain a zzso zzso C zzso which was then used for mouse zzso Two zzso cell lines producing zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso were successfully generated and zzso Interestingly, all of the generated zzso specifically recognized the first 20 zzso acids of the zzso C zzso as determined by zzso zzso mapping and via a zzso zzso C protein in which this region was zzso The results suggested that this region is predominantly zzso in zzso
