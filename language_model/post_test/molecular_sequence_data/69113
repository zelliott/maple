In order to identify markers of the two zzso populations which are successively involved in zzso zzso we performed a differential screening of a zzso zzso library with two zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso extracted at embryonic day zzso 17 and zzso zzso before and after the invasion of the zzso by the zzso zzso zzso One of the selected zzso the zzso zzso zzso to a very abundant embryonic zzso transcript enriched in the zzso zones at zzso and in superficial cortical layers and zzso at zzso suggesting that it is expressed mainly in zzso belonging to a late migration zzso During adulthood, it persists at a high level in the zzso layer of the zzso the zzso and the zzso bulb, which are the sites of zzso zzso and intense synaptic zzso This 2000 base zzso is enriched in zzso zzso and encodes a small putative 68 zzso acid zzso which is zzso in mouse and zzso
