Several alpha beta and gamma zzso zzso induced genes are regulated zzso via a 29 zzso zzso acting regulatory element zzso zzso Consensus zzso The zzso binding capacity of zzso cell nuclear extracts was strictly dependent on the presence of zzso zzso and zzso It increased upon alpha beta or gamma zzso treatment of the zzso Three 50 zzso synthetic zzso containing the zzso or putative zzso zzso zzso Response zzso representing portions of genes zzso by alpha beta zzso zzso and zzso or by gamma zzso were used as zzso to zzso nuclear factors interacting with the zzso All three zzso were retarded in a mobility shift zzso in two zzso zzso conditions were crucial for demonstrating their existence and/or their relative zzso A factor whose activity and/or amount was modulated upon zzso treatment, appeared to be involved in zzso dependent zzso zzso of the zzso binding proteins responsible for altered binding zzso
