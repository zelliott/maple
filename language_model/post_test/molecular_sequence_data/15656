Switching from the zzso zzso bacterial lifestyle to a zzso existence is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso controlled by zzso zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso mostly featuring zzso zzso Here, we present the expression patterns of all 28 genes that zzso zzso domain proteins in zzso coli zzso zzso genes are expressed in zzso zzso with 15 being under zzso zzso While a small subset of zzso proteins zzso and zzso is dominant and zzso zzso in zzso growing cells, a diverse battery of zzso proteins is deployed during entry into stationary phase, especially in cells grown at reduced temperature zzso degrees zzso This suggests that multiple signal input into zzso control is particularly important in zzso cells in an zzso zzso Six zzso genes zzso control the expression of adhesive zzso zzso Besides the previously described zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso these are zzso zzso which stimulates the expression of the zzso zzso and the major zzso regulator zzso and zzso which contributes to expression of the zzso structural zzso zzso Finally, we discuss why other zzso zzso zzso despite being zzso do not influence zzso and/or zzso zzso
