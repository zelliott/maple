Total of zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso was selected for further zzso zzso zzso for zzso production was implemented in two steps using response surface methodology with central composite zzso In the first step, the effect of independent zzso variables including temperature, initial pH and process time were zzso After identification of carbon and nitrogen sources affecting the production by one variable at a time method, zzso of zzso and zzso extract and also zzso size were chosen for the second central composite zzso A maximum zzso activity was obtained under optimal conditions of zzso % zzso zzso zzso % zzso extract zzso zzso zzso zzso spores as zzso size for 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso h process time and medium initial pH zzso zzso activity of the zzso is achieved at pH 11 and temperature 60 zzso The zzso is highly stable at pH range zzso and at 90 zzso after 2 zzso zzso zzso experiments provide zzso fold increases in the activity of zzso and zzso zzso and shortened the zzso time compared to that of zzso zzso The members of zzso can be promising qualified zzso producer for pharmaceutical zzso
