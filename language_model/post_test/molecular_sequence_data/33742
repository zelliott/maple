zzso zzso are pivotal regulators involved in various zzso and pathological processes via their zzso regulation of gene zzso We zzso 14 libraries of small zzso constructed from samples spanning the life cycle of zzso and discovered 50 novel zzso previously not known in animals and verified 43 of them using zzso zzso Our zzso analyses of 27 zzso zzso suggest they arise from zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and random zzso zzso which is consistent with the idea that novel animal zzso may evolve from incomplete zzso transcripts and become fixed in the process of zzso with their zzso zzso prediction suggests that the zzso zzso may have a preference of regulating genes that are related to zzso traits, and these genes can serve as potential targets for subsequent studies of the modulating networks in the development of zzso zzso
