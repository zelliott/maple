zzso of very long chain fatty acids 4 zzso is a novel member of the zzso family of genes that are involved in fatty acid zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein of 314 zzso acids that carries a possible zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso at the zzso Two distinct zzso a zzso deletion and a complex zzso from the same region in zzso 6 of this zzso have been reported so far and are associated with zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso Both of these deletions could result in zzso zzso and loss of the zzso retention signal in the zzso zzso We expressed the zzso and zzso proteins in zzso and zzso cells to study the zzso distribution of zzso and to identify possible implications of the above zzso in its zzso zzso analysis of these proteins along with zzso marker zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso deletion of the zzso motif at the zzso of the protein resulted in the loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed a similar zzso zzso pattern for the protein in human zzso These data indicate that zzso is an zzso zzso which supports its suggested function in fatty acid zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso of both zzso proteins was dramatically changed from an zzso to a zzso zzso Our observations suggest that the consequences of defective protein trafficking could zzso the molecular mechanism associated with zzso of the zzso in the patients with zzso
