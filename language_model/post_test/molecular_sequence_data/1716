During the last 3 years, zzso disease virus zzso O, named zzso caused two outbreaks in the Republic of zzso To determine if there was an obvious genetic relationship between the virus isolated in 2002 zzso and the zzso and to further analyze the zzso relationships between the zzso viruses and the viruses identified in Korea, the complete zzso sequence of the zzso and the zzso were determined by automatic cycling sequencing and primer zzso The zzso and the deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of the strains identified in Korea were compared with each other and also those enrolled in the zzso zzso In comparison and analysis of the viruses identified in Korea, any deletions or insertions in the specific zzso gene of both the zzso and zzso were not zzso However, comparison of the zzso sequence of the identified virus in 2002 from pigs with those of other zzso strains revealed significant zzso of 4 zzso in the zzso region and 8 zzso in the 3A zzso In zzso analysis based on the translated region, the identified virus in 2002 appeared to be the divergence of approximately zzso degree with other zzso zzso Also, animal experiments indicated that zzso is not zzso and develop the clinical signs in the main susceptible livestock species zzso and zzso However, zzso did not develop the clinical signs in cattle and showed severe clinical signs only in zzso These zzso data suggest that 2002 outbreaks in Korea is not zzso but zzso from zzso
