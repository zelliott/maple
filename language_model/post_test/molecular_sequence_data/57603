The clinical isolate zzso zzso zzso has a peculiar mode of resistance to zzso in that it possesses two zzso zzso proteins zzso the zzso zzso also found in other zzso and the zzso zzso The two zzso have the same low affinity for the drug and are zzso related to each zzso The zzso gene has been cloned and zzso and the derived zzso acid sequence has been compared by zzso zzso cluster analysis with that of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso coli used as the standard of reference of the zzso zzso of class zzso On the basis of the shapes, sizes, and zzso of the zzso and zzso clusters along the sequences and the linear zzso acid alignments derived from this analysis, the zzso zzso has an identity index of zzso the zzso zzso has an identity index of zzso and the zzso zzso (of zzso zzso has an identity index of zzso In spite of this zzso the zzso zzso are of identical modular design and possess the nine zzso acid groupings zzso typical of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of class zzso At zzso with the latter zzso however, the zzso zzso have an additional approximately zzso zzso stretch that is inserted between the zzso end of the zzso domain and the zzso end of the membrane zzso While the zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso the zzso gene appears to be physically linked to the zzso zzso which zzso resistance to zzso and is known to be zzso borne in almost all the zzso zzso zzso
