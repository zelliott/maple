This study documents the presence of type 1 zzso on zzso and confirms these zzso adherence structures to be bona fide components of the zzso zzso While zzso zzso strains and zzso clinical zzso failed to express type 1 zzso 6 of 20 recent clinical zzso including 4 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso strain, and 1 zzso zzso strain, produced type 1 zzso as detected by zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso production of a predominantly zzso population required serial passage every 48 to 72 h in zzso brain heart infusion broth at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso cultures were capable of zzso switching to a zzso zzso phase during serial zzso zzso on zzso soy zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso type 1 zzso contained 18 zzso compared to that of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested the presence of both shared and unique zzso on zzso coli and zzso zzso type 1 zzso Random phase variation between zzso and zzso states in zzso was accompanied by the zzso zzso associated with phase variation in zzso zzso
