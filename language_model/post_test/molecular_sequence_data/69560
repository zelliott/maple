We have zzso by zzso zzso the molecular basis of the editing function and its relation to the synthetic function of zzso coli zzso zzso The data obtained fit a model of the active site that partitions an zzso acid zzso between synthetic and editing zzso zzso and hydrogen bonding interactions direct the zzso zzso zzso through the synthetic zzso and prevent it from entering the editing zzso Two zzso interactions are zzso between the side chain of zzso and a zzso group of zzso and between the zzso ring of zzso and the zzso and zzso groups of the zzso An essential hydrogen bond forms between the OH of zzso and an electron pair of the sulfur atom of zzso zzso with these functions, side chains of zzso and zzso are localized on opposite sides of the cavity forming a putative zzso binding pocket that is observed in the three-dimensional zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have diminished ability to discriminate against homocysteine in the synthetic reaction, compared to the zzso zzso At the same time, zzso zzso have lost the ability to discriminate against zzso in the editing reaction and edited zzso to a similar extent as zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso groups, respectively, of the zzso which are essential for the synthetic function, were also essential for the editing function of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was only slightly impaired relative to the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso zzso The model also explains why the zzso homocysteine is edited by zzso zzso
