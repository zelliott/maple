zzso a calcium dependent zzso zzso consists of a zzso large zzso and a regulatory small zzso Two models have been proposed to explain zzso zzso an zzso model and a zzso zzso In the zzso model, the zzso form is the active species, which is zzso to zzso In the zzso model, zzso large zzso is the active zzso We have reported that the zzso concentration regulates zzso zzso of zzso We found further that in chicken zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso irreversible zzso from the small zzso as well as zzso So we could propose a new mechanism for zzso of the zzso by combining our zzso Our model insists that zzso large zzso remains zzso from the small zzso even after the removal of zzso to keep it zzso to zzso This model could be expanded to other zzso and give a new perspective on zzso zzso
