To assess the association between zzso zzso of zzso 37 zzso gene and zzso to zzso after zzso coronary intervention zzso in ethnic Han Chinese patients from zzso 

Five hundred and zzso patients with coronary artery disease zzso who had undergone zzso underwent coronary zzso zzso in 3 months, and were divided into in zzso zzso zzso group zzso and no zzso zzso zzso group zzso Five hundred and one healthy individuals have served as the control zzso All cases were zzso with DNA zzso 

Compared with healthy controls, the frequency of zzso C zzso was higher in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The frequency of C carries zzso was zzso in zzso patients, against zzso in healthy controls zzso The risk for zzso was significantly increased in carriers of C zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis has indicated a significant difference in the frequency of C zzso carriers between both male and female zzso patients and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For both zzso carriers of C zzso had a higher risk for zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso group, the frequency of zzso C zzso and C carries zzso were significantly higher in zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso the risk for zzso has significantly increased in carriers of C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also suggested that the frequency of C carriers was significantly higher in male zzso group compared with male zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk for zzso has increased by nearly four fold in carriers of C zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, for female patients, no significant difference was detected in the zzso risk between carriers of zzso type and zzso zzso zzso 

The C zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso gene is associated with zzso to zzso as well as zzso after coronary zzso in male patients from zzso
