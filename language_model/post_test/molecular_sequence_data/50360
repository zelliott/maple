The zzso derived zzso zzso contains an zzso acid segment with high zzso to the zzso motif zzso of other DNA binding zzso The five most zzso zzso acids in zzso are probably involved in structural formation of the zzso Their functional role was zzso by zzso zzso yielding 95 single zzso acid replacement zzso of zzso zzso Their binding efficiencies to zzso operator were zzso determined in zzso All functional zzso contain zzso acid zzso consistent with their proposed role in a zzso In particular, only the two smallest zzso acids zzso zzso can substitute a zzso zzso in the proposed first zzso without loss of zzso The last position of the first zzso the second position in the turn, and the fourth position in the second zzso require mostly zzso zzso The proposed zzso of the first zzso is supported by a more active zzso compared to zzso replacement zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The turn is located close to the protein surface as indicated by functional zzso and zzso replacements for zzso A zzso zzso at the first position in the turn can be replaced by any zzso acid yielding zzso with at least residual zzso operator zzso A structural model of the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso
