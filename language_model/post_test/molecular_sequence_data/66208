zzso sensing zzso is a bacterial zzso system that controls the expression of multiple genes in response to population zzso The zzso zzso system regulates the expression of several zzso factors in a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso has been characterized to be responsible for producing a type of zzso zzso which stimulates the expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is established as an opportunistic pathogen of several marine animals, and its zzso zzso system remains zzso To investigate the zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso zzso of both the standard strain zzso zzso and a zzso isolate zzso named zzso and zzso respectively, were zzso The zzso resulted in reduced zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased by zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso zzso exhibited a lower growth rate and defective zzso zzso They also showed a significant decrease in zzso production and an increase in both zzso zzso production and zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso system plays an important role in regulating the expression of zzso factors in zzso zzso
