We attempted to find zzso coli proteins which zzso bind to a curved DNA sequence even in the presence of an excess amount of a zzso DNA sequence as a competitor, mainly by means of a zzso gel zzso zzso Since the two sequences used had nearly the same zzso compositions, including consecutive zzso stretches, we reasoned that this strategy would allow us to identify proteins which zzso recognize an overall DNA zzso We zzso such a protein from zzso zzso Its preferential binding to the curved DNA was found to be inhibited by zzso which removes the zzso from appropriate DNA zzso The zzso protein was identified as the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso
