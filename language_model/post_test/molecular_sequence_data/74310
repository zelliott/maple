A gene zzso a putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized and its regulation was zzso The full length of the zzso gene was introduced into the shuttle zzso zzso after zzso amplification, resulting in the zzso zzso zzso The determined DNA sequence carries zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly increased in the zzso zzso cells harboring zzso The accelerated growth was observed in the zzso zzso cells, zzso the involvement of the cloned gene in the zzso zzso To study zzso regulation of the zzso zzso the zzso fusion gene was constructed using the zzso coli shuttle zzso zzso and named zzso The synthesis of zzso from the fusion gene was enhanced under carbon zzso conditions and nitrogen zzso Under the same growth conditions, the zzso zzso levels of the zzso zzso cells were zzso The zzso zzso level was markedly decreased in the zzso zzso compared with that in the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso expression of the zzso gene is zzso by a zzso factor, zzso The zzso oxygen species zzso level was diminished in the zzso zzso cells than in the control zzso The extra copies of the zzso gene were able to resist zzso of zzso level under limited carbon source condition and zzso zzso In brief, the zzso zzso zzso is linked with the zzso growth and zzso by zzso zzso stress on a zzso zzso The zzso protein is partly responsible for maintaining low zzso level under normal and stressful growth conditions in the zzso zzso
