zzso proteins belong to a family of zzso zzso Recent experimental evidence suggests that at least five of the seven members of this family, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are auxiliary zzso of zzso and regulate zzso activity in a zzso and zzso zzso These results highlight the complexity of the regulation of zzso and zzso handling by zzso which is necessary to ensure appropriate tissue functions such as zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso in zzso has been linked to cases of human zzso indicating that zzso in the regulation of zzso by zzso proteins may be critically involved in zzso zzso A better understanding of this novel regulatory mechanism of zzso should help in learning more about its role in zzso zzso This review summarizes the present knowledge of the role of zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso as well as of other zzso their regulation, and their zzso zzso
