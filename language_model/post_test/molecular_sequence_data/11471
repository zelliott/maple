Since the technique of zzso was developed in 1985 zzso et zzso many new forms of applications have been described in the zzso Of particular interest are zzso approaches, allowing amplification of unknown zzso In this review these approaches are generally termed zzso zzso While zzso zzso in the form that was first described by zzso et zzso is zzso for the amplification and subsequent detection of specific DNA zzso which are precisely characterized in length and zzso Random zzso is either used for universal amplification of prevailing DNA or for amplification of unknown intervening sequences which are not generally defined in length or zzso We depict criteria for discrimination between conventional zzso and Random zzso Furthermore, we have compiled a zzso system for Random zzso approaches based on differentiation by primer structure zzso According to this zzso system a general overview of published Random zzso approaches is zzso Future aspects of application of Random zzso are mentioned and zzso Own zzso combining Random zzso with the technique of zzso zzso and thus allowing characterization of unknown zzso or zzso fragments via zzso are zzso zzso are briefly zzso
