zzso is the binding site for zzso the DNA packaging zzso of zzso and zzso is the adjacent site at which zzso zzso staggered nicks to generate mature zzso DNA zzso There are three binding sites zzso zzso and zzso within zzso for zzso the small zzso of zzso A particular transition zzso of zzso known to weaken binding of zzso to zzso has been introduced into the other R sites, and in the present work the effects of R site zzso on zzso of zzso have been zzso zzso experiments performed in the presence of zzso suggest that the most profound zzso zzso tested (the zzso zzso would, at most, reduce zzso zzso to zzso to zzso of the level observed for the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso zzso had no significant effect on zzso zzso of the 1 strand and reduced zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso The other zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of either DNA strand when zzso was added, but in the absence of zzso most of the zzso zzso resulted in some form of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso however, are milder than the in zzso packaging defects that result from the zzso zzso only the effect of the zzso zzso on in zzso zzso zzso is reflective of the growth zzso exhibited by a zzso zzso but the zzso zzso is only observed when zzso is omitted from the zzso The proposal that the zzso zzso primarily affect DNA packaging rather than zzso zzso is zzso All of the zzso zzso affect zzso zzso to a greater extent than zzso zzso zzso that the interaction of zzso with the left half of zzso occurs via the direct recognition of zzso by zzso The level of DNA zzso required for zzso zzso zzso is approximately equivalent for reactions performed in the presence or absence of zzso indicating that zzso does not increase the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso does accelerate the rate of zzso zzso suggesting that the role of zzso in promoting zzso of the zzso zzso is primarily to increase the rate of conversion of a zzso complex into zzso A possible fourth R site, zzso is located on the other side of zzso from zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
