zzso profiling techniques rely on the separation of proteins or peptides and their subsequent zzso The reliability of this technique is still limited because a zzso profiling result does not necessarily represent the true protein composition of the zzso sample, thus seriously zzso proper data zzso Many zzso observed zzso zzso are biologically not zzso It was the aim of this study to use the knowledge of the biological context of proteins in order to establish zzso zzso profiling zzso While zzso spot patterns of total cell protein zzso were found to poorly represent the true protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were found to better represent the protein composition of the zzso zzso The application of a zzso protocol to different kinds of cells revealed several striking zzso zzso the protein composition of cultured cells of various origins is very zzso zzso zzso zzso observed with the described protocols do make sense from a zzso point of view and may thus be considered as truly representative for the zzso zzso zzso primary white blood cells isolated from different donors were found to show minor, but zzso and significant individual zzso We designate the consideration of known properties of identified proteins in zzso profiles as a zzso zzso The present data suggest that this approach may tremendously help to improve the applied techniques and assess the zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of zzso criteria of zzso profiles eventually results in reliable and biologically relevant zzso
