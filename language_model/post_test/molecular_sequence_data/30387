zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major route in the metabolism and zzso of numerous drugs and foreign zzso zzso is the target of a common genetic zzso of clinical relevance in human zzso We have used our recently isolated rabbit zzso zzso to clone three human zzso genes from human zzso zzso None of the three zzso coding sequences was interrupted by zzso Two zzso designated zzso and zzso each possessed open reading frames of zzso zzso Both genes have been assigned to human zzso 8, zzso Following zzso they were zzso expressed in monkey kidney zzso zzso zzso and zzso gave rise to functional zzso zzso as judged by their zzso zzso activity with the zzso zzso zzso Western blots with zzso zzso detected proteins of apparent molecular weight of 33 and 31 zzso in zzso and zzso cultures, zzso The product of zzso had an identical apparent molecular weight as that of zzso detected in human liver zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso also contained 6 zzso sequences which had previously been determined from zzso peptides of the zzso zzso zzso from human zzso These data suggest that zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso The third zzso zzso had multiple deleterious zzso and did not zzso a functional zzso zzso it most likely represents a zzso
