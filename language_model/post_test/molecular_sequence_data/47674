zzso zzso zzso is the zzso of a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and DNA zzso the family is defined by zzso sequence motifs A, B, and zzso We tested the effects of 12 zzso zzso and 16 conservative modifications at 18 positions of the zzso Eight zzso were identified as important for zzso zzso These were zzso zzso and zzso in motif A zzso zzso and zzso in motif B zzso zzso zzso and zzso in motif C zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may comprise the zzso zzso zzso as their replacement by zzso zzso zzso zzso retained zzso zzso Basic zzso zzso and zzso in motif B are implicated in binding to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso for zzso whereas substitution with zzso increased zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso increased zzso an order of zzso zzso binding was restored when zzso was zzso zzso in lieu of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso or zzso restored zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso instability in zzso and in zzso A second zzso zzso zzso zzso (named zzso containing motifs A, B, and C was identified and zzso zzso activity was abolished by zzso and zzso zzso in motif zzso zzso is zzso for zzso growth and, by itself, cannot fulfill the essential role played by zzso in zzso Yet, fusion of zzso in zzso to the zzso domain of zzso capping zzso allowed zzso to complement growth of zzso zzso zzso This finding illustrates that zzso zzso can be used as a vehicle to deliver zzso to nascent zzso in zzso most likely through its binding to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
