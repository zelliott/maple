zzso native to the cold environments have successfully zzso their zzso zzso and biological features, exhibiting uniqueness in their zzso zzso and membrane zzso These zzso zzso have immense zzso zzso The diversity of zzso bacteria in two different water lakes (the zzso freshwater and the zzso of Himalayas was analyzed using zzso green zzso and cultural zzso A total of 140 bacteria were isolated and were grouped as zzso zzso and zzso organisms, based on their optimal temperature for zzso The amplified zzso DNA restriction analysis using three restriction zzso facilitated the grouping of these zzso into 96 zzso at zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the bacterial strains from both lakes belonged to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso for the activity of different zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that about 16 zzso were positive, and exhibiting a wide range of stability at various temperature and zzso Our results suggest that the distinctly different zzso of zzso freshwater and brackish water lakes have diverse groups of bacteria, which can be an excellent source of zzso zzso with a wide range of zzso zzso
