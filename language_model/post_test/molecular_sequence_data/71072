The zzso of proteins within the zzso zzso membrane is thought to regulate a number of zzso processes in land plants and zzso Both light quality and intensity influence protein zzso activity via the levels of zzso produced by the zzso electron transport zzso We have isolated a family of proteins called zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso that zzso the light harvesting complex zzso zzso activity is enhanced by zzso and is associated with the zzso reaction center II and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by a gene family that has striking similarity to transforming growth factor beta receptors of zzso Thus zzso protein zzso may be regulated by a cascade of zzso zzso protein zzso
