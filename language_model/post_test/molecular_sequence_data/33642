The zzso is a useful species with which to investigate the combined genetic impact of habitat zzso over hunting, and zzso zzso variation within and between zzso zzso zzso populations was analyzed in 259 individuals from 16 sampling sites located in Italy, Spain, zzso and the Czech zzso Two zzso DNA markers zzso region and zzso b) and 11 nuclear zzso were zzso The principal results of this study can be summarized as zzso 1) high and significant differentiation between almost all zzso populations is observed even on a zzso scale, probably caused by the zzso distribution of this species, sharp geographical barriers to gene flow, and drift effects related to recent zzso 2) historical zzso events have left a clear genetic signature, including zzso zzso in some Alpine zzso 3) the zzso subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows a high and similar level of divergence (about zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Alpine zzso zzso zzso therefore, the specific status of these zzso should be zzso These results confirm the potential of population genetic analyses to dissect and interpret complex patterns of diversity in order to define factors important to conservation and zzso
