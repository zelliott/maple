In the present study, the diversity of zzso populations was monitored for 25 days, together with the process data for an zzso batch reactor treating zzso zzso To understand this microbial diversity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso was conducted at two different zzso zzso the domain and order zzso The zzso profiles of the domain zzso and the three orders zzso zzso and zzso were comparatively analyzed after each zzso band was zzso to enable zzso The zzso profiles of the three orders showed zzso belonging to each order that were not detected in the zzso profile of the zzso This zzso may have resulted from zzso bias or differences in the zzso of the three microbial orders in the zzso zzso In conclusion, to fully understand the detailed zzso diversity and dynamics in an zzso zzso it is necessary to conduct zzso analysis with zzso zzso gene zzso that target lower zzso zzso
