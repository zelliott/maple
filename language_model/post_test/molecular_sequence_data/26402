zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso alpha that has a role in maternal recognition of pregnancy in zzso Here we describe production of zzso by zzso procedures in zzso zzso A zzso gene was constructed which lacked the zzso representing the signal sequence and provided a Met initiation zzso ahead of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mature zzso This construct was placed under the control of the zzso promoter within the expression zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso in zzso coli zzso in the absence of zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso zzso zzso zzso acid was included in the zzso The zzso was deposited in inclusion bodies and accounted for as much as zzso of the total cellular zzso The inclusion bodies were isolated by differential zzso and zzso The zzso was zzso by use of zzso and zzso and allowed to zzso in zzso Final zzso was achieved by zzso exchange zzso on zzso The yield of zzso product, which had an zzso activity greater than zzso international reference zzso was approximately 20 zzso The zzso zzso was relatively stable to zzso and frozen storage, and could induce the production of an zzso protein of 70,000 zzso zzso in cultured zzso of zzso prepared from zzso on day 13 of the zzso zzso The latter protein is a characteristic product of zzso action on zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
