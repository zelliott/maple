DNA in its zzso form is energetically zzso and therefore very zzso However, DNA is involved in zzso events and thus has a continuous zzso zzso such as DNA zzso DNA repair, DNA zzso and zzso require that DNA occurs zzso in a zzso zzso This status can be achieved by zzso called DNA zzso These zzso have the power to melt the hydrogen bonds between the base pairs by using zzso zzso zzso as an energy zzso A variety of different DNA zzso have recently been identified from zzso viruses and zzso We focus on the current knowledge of these DNA zzso and their possible function in DNA zzso
