zzso A protein zzso substance P zzso zzso fusion protein was genetically engineered and used as an zzso to raise a zzso zzso to the zzso The fusion protein was expressed in zzso coli driven by the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein was zzso using an zzso column, which specifically binds proteins containing the protein A zzso The zzso fraction obtained after the zzso was zzso to produce zzso fragments, which were subsequently zzso using a fusion protein affinity zzso The serum zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso cell sorting zzso and zzso on both a zzso cell line for the zzso zzso and a cell line zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for zzso was confirmed by zzso on cells using zzso that had been zzso with the protein A fusion protein zzso zzso The zzso signal normally observed on stimulation of zzso with SP in zzso cells and SP binding to zzso cells was shown to be diminished in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso from both cell lines was zzso using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso itself did not induce zzso zzso zzso normally observed when cells were incubated with zzso zzso This specific zzso zzso will be a useful tool to investigate further the mechanisms of zzso zzso
