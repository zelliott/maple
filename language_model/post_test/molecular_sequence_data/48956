zzso zzso provide recognized mechanisms for changing the coding potential of an zzso Here, multiple zzso are identified in repetitive sequences within an zzso virus zzso early zzso zzso which is associated with the viral zzso cycle and also zzso expressed in many zzso associated zzso On the DNA strand zzso zzso there are three open reading zzso only one of which contains an initiation zzso Most zzso of the gene consists of numerous zzso varying with cell zzso zzso copies of a zzso direct repeat (called zzso 4) flanked by small unique zzso zzso may express a protein if its initiation and termination zzso reside in the same reading frame, but this is not always the zzso zzso events, occurring in short runs of zzso zzso C zzso in the repeats, give rise to zzso which may provide a mechanism for escape of an zzso function from host zzso zzso studies link these zzso to DNA replication zzso zzso the number of sites in zzso at which such zzso can occur permits a very large amount of diversity in this zzso Our data also suggest a second zzso mechanism within the protein itself, which influences its stability and may reflect a host defense zzso zzso thus provides a potentially important model for studying the quest for zzso between a virus and its zzso
