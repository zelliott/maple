A zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from a tidal flat of the Yellow Sea, zzso The novel strain, which was zzso closely related to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was studied using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at pH zzso and 30 degrees C in the presence of 2 % zzso zzso It contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso and zzso zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values zzso zzso to the type strains of species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be differentiated from members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso by differences in the contents of some fatty zzso by the absence of zzso and by differences in some zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a new zzso and novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
