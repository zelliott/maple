zzso studies suggest that zzso zzso virus replication involves host as well as viral zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of animal and plant zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso replication proteins zzso and zzso supports zzso zzso replication and zzso zzso Using the ability of zzso to replicate in zzso we show that efficient zzso zzso replication requires zzso a zzso protein related to core zzso zzso factors but shown zzso to be zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso was defective in an early template selection step in zzso zzso zzso involving the zzso replication protein zzso and an internal viral zzso element zzso with zzso zzso dependence of this interaction was suppressed by adding 3' zzso to the normally zzso zzso zzso Our results show zzso involvement in a specific step of zzso zzso replication and connections between zzso and zzso function, possibly through interaction with factors binding zzso zzso zzso
