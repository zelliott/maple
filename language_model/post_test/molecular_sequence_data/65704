zzso is a major zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso results showed that this zzso is zzso as it retained more than 50% of its activity after incubation at 80 degrees C for an zzso As this property may be of industrial use, we have cloned the full-length zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that it belonged to the zzso zzso family zzso zzso sequencing and analysis by zzso program suggested that the first 32 zzso acid zzso zzso the signal zzso zzso of the zzso clones with and without its own signal zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso produced active 55 and 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing suggested that the 55 zzso band was the mature protein while the 30 zzso band was the truncated zzso zzso analysis showed that the 55 zzso protein was zzso while the smaller protein was zzso All zzso zzso showed optimal temperature of 70 degrees C and optimal pH of zzso They retained more than 50% activity for zzso at 70 degrees zzso In addition, high zzso and low apparent zzso of these zzso proteins indicated good properties of this zzso against zzso
