zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso coli is characterized by a protein zzso fusion of the inner and outer membrane and formation of a zzso tunnel zzso In order to understand the fusion process, the zzso of protein E within the envelope complex of zzso coli was zzso zzso K protection studies showed that, during the time course of protein zzso zzso process, more of the fusion protein zzso gradually became accessible to the zzso at the cell zzso These observations zzso a zzso change in protein E during induction of the zzso process by movement of the zzso end of the protein throughout the envelope complex from the inner side to the outer side spanning the entire pore and fusing the inner and outer zzso at distinct zzso The initiation mechanism for such a zzso change could be the zzso zzso of zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 21, presumed to be in the zzso zzso of protein zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, resulted in zzso E zzso zzso zzso K accessibility studies using zzso as a reporter fused to the zzso zzso protein showed that the zzso part of the fusion protein is not zzso to the outer side of the zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso is essential for the correct folding of protein E within the cell wall complex of zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso was not zzso
