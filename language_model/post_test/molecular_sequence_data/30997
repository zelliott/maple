Recently, we have isolated and characterized a set of zzso clones which zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the sequence and identification of one of these zzso previously termed zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame zzso a predicted zzso composed of 98 zzso zzso which contained a 21 zzso acid zzso signal zzso indicating approximately 9 zzso of mature zzso The deduced protein sequence showed zzso zzso identity, zzso considering conservative zzso acid zzso with the human INF zzso gene zzso a member of the recently described zzso of zzso and zzso proteins which includes zzso factor 4, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus zzso would appear to represent the zzso zzso of the human zzso gene or a very closely related zzso
