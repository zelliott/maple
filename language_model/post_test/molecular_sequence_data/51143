A zzso clone coding for zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a guinea-pig liver zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a complete coding region of zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the guinea-pig zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso identities with those of zzso human, zzso pig zzso indicating conservation of primary structure of the zzso during evolutionary divergence of zzso The high conservation of zzso zzso of the zzso sustained the importance of them to maintain its function zzso
