zzso acid zzso is a common intermediate in the zzso pathways of several structurally related aromatic zzso It is converted into zzso zzso A zzso which is zzso to general zzso by a set of zzso Within the zzso of the extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a cluster of zzso including a zzso family zzso regulator, may be involved in zzso zzso The gene product, which we named zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated the expression of the two zzso zzso the gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the target gene expression by binding zzso zzso with a consensus sequence of zzso surrounding the zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso with a proposed binding zzso of zzso protein zzso and was effective for zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a functional zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso found in zzso coli and zzso zzso A three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso was predicted by zzso zzso In the putative structure, zzso adopts the typical three-dimensional structure of the zzso family zzso with 10 zzso A positively charged surface at the center of the zzso is similar to the zzso site of another zzso family zzso regulator, zzso zzso zzso which is involved in fatty acid zzso The zzso zzso of zzso may bind to the center of the zzso zzso in a manner similar to the binding of the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso
