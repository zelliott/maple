Balanced maternal and paternal zzso contributions are a requirement for successful seed zzso zzso contributions often cause seed abortion, a phenomenon that has been termed zzso zzso zzso of imprinted regulatory genes has been proposed to be the underlying cause for abnormalities in growth and structure of the zzso in seeds with zzso parental zzso We identified a zzso forming zzso zzso that enabled us to investigate direct effects of unbalanced parental zzso contributions on seed development and to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of dosage zzso We provide evidence that zzso expression of the zzso group zzso gene zzso is zzso responsible for seed zzso aberrations in zzso seeds with increased paternal zzso zzso We propose that imprinted expression of zzso genes is an evolutionary zzso mechanism to balance parental zzso contributions in zzso zzso zzso
