zzso zzso can lead to major disturbances of cellular processes and is associated with several zzso We report kinetic and equilibrium data by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of sufficient quality and zzso to form a basis for zzso understanding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Starting from zzso zzso in a pure buffer system without zzso we find that the zzso of zzso zzso vary strongly with zzso concentration in a highly predictable zzso The free zzso concentration in equilibrium with zzso was found to vary with total zzso concentration in a manner expected for a zzso zzso The free versus total zzso concentration was linear up to zzso zzso zzso after which free zzso decreased with total zzso toward an zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso zzso formation arises from a sequence of events in a highly predictable zzso
