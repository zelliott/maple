We have isolated a zzso pair zzso zzso in a screening for zzso genes regulated at the level of zzso by soluble zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis and comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence to protein databases unveiled zzso similarity of a zzso acid zzso zzso to published C zzso of chicken and rat zzso zzso and almost zzso identity to the product of the zzso gene from zzso Several lines of evidence confirm that the cloned gene represents the zzso structural gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene from a high copy number zzso resulted in zzso of a zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso of one zzso zzso in a zzso zzso strain resulted in 50% reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific activity and a marked decrease of zzso associated with a zzso zzso compared to zzso After zzso of zzso zzso spores containing the disrupted zzso zzso failed to enter zzso growth, despite fatty acid zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activity is essential for a process other than de zzso fatty acid synthesis and that only a single functional copy of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso and was also controlled by regulatory factors zzso zzso and zzso providing evidence that the key step of fatty acid synthesis is regulated in conjunction with zzso synthesis at the level of gene zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene contains a sequence reminiscent of an zzso element identified in genes zzso zzso zzso zzso
