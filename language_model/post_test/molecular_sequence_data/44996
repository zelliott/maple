zzso array zzso zzso chips have been designed and zzso with the capacity to rapidly zzso 160 zzso analyze 12 different samples in zzso zzso of all lanes with zzso s zzso resolution was achieved using a zzso zzso zzso The operation and capabilities of these zzso zzso were first determined by performing zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso a candidate gene for the diagnosis of zzso zzso was then performed to demonstrate the rapid analysis of biologically relevant zzso zzso multiplex zzso detection of zzso zzso was accomplished by zzso the standard zzso zzso DNA zzso with a red emitting zzso dye zzso zzso and zzso labeling of the zzso DNA with zzso zzso This work establishes the feasibility of using zzso chips for high speed, zzso zzso
