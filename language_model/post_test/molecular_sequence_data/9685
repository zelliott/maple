zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso in the nitrogen zzso cascade that controls the activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This study addresses the question of whether the two zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso occur at the same or at different active zzso The 945 zzso acid zzso zzso has been truncated in two ways, so as to produce two zzso zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso has two active zzso zzso carries a zzso activity and zzso carries an zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso reaction of the zzso domain, whereas zzso activates the zzso reaction zzso by the zzso zzso With respect to the regulation by the nitrogen status monitor zzso however, the zzso domain appears to be dependent on the zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso depends on zzso and is inhibited by zzso The zzso activity of zzso is independent of zzso (or zzso whereas in the intact zzso zzso is required for this zzso The implications of this zzso signal zzso for the prevention of futile cycling are zzso
