The interaction of the zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso with the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso was investigated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso At relatively low zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso all zzso and zzso spectral zzso at 25 degrees C were indicative of a single population of zzso lipids in a zzso zzso At these zzso ratios, zzso had only marginal effects on the size of the zzso splitting measured from zzso zzso at either the zzso zzso or the zzso segment zzso of the zzso zzso and, similarly small effects on the magnitude of the chemical shift zzso zzso of the zzso zzso With increasing amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the size of the zzso zzso splitting from zzso as well as the magnitude of the zzso decreased progressively and zzso The zzso splitting from zzso however, remained relatively zzso At yet higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso and zzso zzso indicated the presence of multiple zzso populations experiencing varying degrees of increased zzso zzso The spectral zzso of these apparently zzso spectral components reverted to zzso zzso upon lowering the measuring temperature to 5 degrees zzso At the utmost highest level of zzso measured here zzso zzso zzso all zzso and zzso zzso consisted of a single, zzso apparently zzso zzso indicative of hindered but virtual zzso zzso averaging of the zzso zzso In this case no zzso to zzso zzso could be obtained by decreasing the zzso We could obtain no evidence that the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso was responding to any specific influence of zzso on zzso surface zzso
