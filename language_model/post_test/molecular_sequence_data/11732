zzso zzso zzso have been described under various conditions in different zzso sequences such as zzso and mixed sequences including zzso while information about the zzso in zzso is zzso Using zzso zzso complexes and zzso zzso as structural zzso we show a zzso zzso triplex in zzso sequence in a zzso zzso zzso Strong modification of approximately six central zzso and approximately six zzso at the zzso of the zzso stretch as well as the zzso modification of the zzso of the zzso strand suggested the prevalence of the zzso triplex zzso At native zzso density, optimum conditions for the triplex formation were close to 1 zzso zzso pH zzso At room temperature and zzso zzso below zzso and above 5 zzso almost no triplex was zzso It is suggested that the absence of the triplex at higher zzso zzso is due to the stabilization of the duplex by zzso zzso which prevents the duplex opening necessary for the triplex zzso At higher temperatures, favorable for duplex opening zzso 55 degrees zzso the zzso triplex is formed even in the presence of 10 zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso and zzso yielded a modification pattern similar to that obtained with zzso the modification pattern produced in the presence of zzso was, however, much less zzso In the presence of 1 zzso zzso a decrease in pH from zzso to zzso resulted in a strong decrease of the triplex zzso At highly negative zzso density, the conditions for triplex formation were less zzso and the triplex was observed even in the absence of zzso
