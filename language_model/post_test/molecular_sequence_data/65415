zzso evident in the sequence alignment of human zzso with shrimp zzso and zzso suggest the indirect involvement of the heavy to light chain loop zzso zzso to E zzso in the function of these zzso zzso of the loop and adjacent zzso S 290 to N zzso decreased specific zzso activity by zzso and zzso zzso complete substitution for the corresponding zzso loop decreased activity by zzso In all cases the zzso was largely zzso The zzso stability of human zzso was not altered by deletion of E zzso to E zzso but increased on deletion of S 290 to N zzso zzso zzso the loop does not change zzso affinity but does influence activity, in part via zzso zzso
