The zzso zzso is an integral component of some zzso bacterial reaction zzso harvesting 1 zzso core zzso Many aspects of the structure of zzso are zzso including the zzso of its long zzso zzso and whether zzso processing zzso In the present report, zzso data recorded on the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso confirmed previous conclusions derived from equivalent data obtained in organic zzso that the zzso of zzso adopts a bent zzso that would allow the entire zzso to reside in the membrane interior or at its zzso In support of this, it was found through the use of zzso zzso that increasing the size of a zzso zzso on the inside of the bend in the zzso was not zzso zzso consequences of this bent zzso structure were explored using a series of zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso on the zzso face of the membrane was found to be critical for the formation of zzso of the zzso zzso It was further shown that the zzso of zzso is processed at an early stage in the development of the zzso zzso A model in which two bent zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso complex is zzso and it is proposed that the zzso of zzso from one half of the zzso engages in zzso interactions with charged zzso on the zzso surface of the zzso and zzso zzso on the other half of the zzso
