We have developed efficient transformation protocols to modify each of the zzso zzso zzso copies in a tobacco zzso The transforming DNA is introduced on the surface of microscopic zzso particles by the zzso zzso zzso for zzso is by zzso resistance based on expression of zzso from a zzso zzso gene in the transforming zzso zzso that are now feasible include replacement of zzso zzso genes with DNA sequences modified in zzso targeted gene zzso and zzso of reporter genes into the zzso zzso Alternative methods for zzso zzso zzso may be developed utilizing an zzso element which was identified during the transformation zzso Introduction of foreign genes under control of zzso gene expression elements results in zzso of zzso regulatory zzso A sensitive zzso zzso to detect deletions via such direct repeats confirmed that these sequence zzso do not result in significant zzso zzso The ability to transform zzso will facilitate the study of zzso gene regulation, and the application of genetic engineering to crop zzso
