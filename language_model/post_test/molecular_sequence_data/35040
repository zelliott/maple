In zzso the 67 zzso zzso protein zzso is essential to the zzso zzso zzso used by zzso zzso to eliminate zzso infected and zzso zzso There is indirect evidence that this zzso exists in lower zzso such as zzso fish and birds, although in zzso databases for the chicken and other bird species the zzso gene is incomplete and no full length expressed sequence tag has been zzso We present here the full gene and transcript sequence of chicken zzso The zzso protein product contains an extended zzso that is at least 90 zzso acids longer than any zzso zzso which is also evident in partial zzso sequences from other zzso To determine whether this extension is present in the translated zzso we raised two zzso zzso The zzso identified a protein of just less than 80 zzso in both zzso zzso cells and zzso A zzso chicken zzso indicating that the extended zzso is present in the mature zzso Our findings confirm that zzso exists in birds, and show that it is considerably longer than zzso of zzso zzso
