Adult pancreatic zzso comprise four cell types, zzso zzso delta and zzso expressing zzso insulin, zzso and zzso respectively, arising from cell lineages whose relationships during zzso zzso differentiation are still uncertain zzso zzso Diabetes 47, zzso As zzso zzso zzso represents an attractive zzso model to study zzso affecting pancreatic zzso zzso et zzso zzso Development zzso zzso we have investigated the expression patterns of zzso hormones in zzso zzso from the zzso (17 zzso to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that in the zzso pancreatic zzso zzso insulin is the first hormone gene to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso with insulin while zzso cells, since their appearance, are distinct from zzso or zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso but not insulin, are first expressed in zzso zzso
