DNA zzso is the DNA synthesis without cell division, resulting in the generation of a nucleus containing a larger amount of zzso DNA compared to a normal zzso zzso There are many such giant zzso in the zzso brain that are generated as a result of repeated zzso However, it has been controversial whether the zzso is the whole zzso replication zzso or the local amplification of the genes that are necessary for the zzso function zzso Here in this study, we investigated these two possibilities by zzso zzso analysis of the distribution of zzso incorporated into the zzso of the brain zzso and by zzso quantitative zzso zzso directed to two different genes expressed in specific brain zzso Our data supported the view that the DNA zzso is the whole zzso replication rather than the local amplification of a specific zzso zzso
