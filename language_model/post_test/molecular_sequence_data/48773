Species capable of zzso lost body parts occur throughout the animal kingdom, yet close relatives are often zzso zzso Why in the face of zzso of the zzso some animals zzso but others do not remains a fascinating zzso zzso zzso are well known and studied for their ability to zzso from minute tissue pieces, yet species with limited zzso abilities have been described even amongst zzso Here we report the characterization of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and its successful zzso zzso fragments cut from the zzso half of the body of this species are unable to zzso a head and ultimately zzso We find that this zzso originates during the early stages of head zzso which require zzso of zzso zzso zzso in other zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso the zzso signal zzso restored the zzso of fully functional heads on tail pieces, rescuing zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the utility of comparative studies towards the zzso of zzso abilities in zzso zzso Furthermore, the availability of zzso zzso as a zzso zzso model species provides a first step towards zzso the evolutionary mechanisms that ultimately determine why some animals zzso and others do zzso
