We identified a zzso clone for zzso which is zzso expressed in teeth, by differential zzso using DNA zzso from an embryonic day zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso encodes a member of the zzso factor family containing three characteristic zzso zinc finger zzso The full-length zzso was obtained by the zzso Cap capture zzso Except for its zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence is almost identical to the predicted sequence of zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso which was previously identified in expressed sequence tag data bases and zzso by an zzso zinc finger zzso domain search zzso zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Van zzso zzso Riviere, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 70, zzso This sequence difference is due to differences in the assignment of the location of zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is expressed by zzso dental zzso differentiated zzso and also hair zzso zzso zzso In addition, whole mount in zzso zzso showed transient expression of zzso zzso in cells of the zzso zzso zzso in developing limbs and the zzso zzso zzso of an zzso expression zzso revealed that this zzso is localized in the nucleus and promotes cell zzso Thus, zzso is a highly zzso and zzso nuclear protein expressed primarily by zzso zzso cells of teeth, hair zzso and limbs that may function in the development of these zzso by regulating cell zzso
