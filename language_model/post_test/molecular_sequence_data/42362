To study the putative binding sites of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an analogue of zzso zzso zzso forms of the zzso were zzso After zzso cultures of rat spinal zzso and zzso root zzso were incubated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen to zzso round cells with thin zzso but not to flat, zzso cells with tapering zzso The zzso zzso binding was zzso by an excess of zzso zzso zzso Light and electron zzso showed that the zzso zzso binds to a zzso component as well as to the cell zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso and an zzso zzso to a high molecular weight zzso protein in zzso root zzso cultures zzso using zzso and zzso scanning laser zzso that all zzso zzso binding cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did also bind to the zzso differentiated cells in cultures of the human zzso cell line zzso but not to those differentiated into zzso zzso The present data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso binds specifically to cell types with zzso zzso
