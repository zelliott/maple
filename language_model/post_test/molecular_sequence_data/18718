zzso zzso are rich sources of biologically active peptides that are classified into zzso peptides zzso and zzso peptides zzso zzso are the main scorpion zzso components responsible for the zzso effects observed during scorpion zzso as they usually target membrane bound zzso channels of excitable and zzso zzso Several hundred zzso have been identified and functionally characterized in the past two zzso The zzso represent a novel group of molecules that have gained great interest only recently due to their high diversity both in their primary structures and zzso This review provides an overview of scorpion zzso focusing on their therapeutic applications, modes of discovery, mechanisms of zzso genetic diversity and structural zzso It also provides a simple zzso for zzso that could be adopted and applied to other zzso identified in future zzso
