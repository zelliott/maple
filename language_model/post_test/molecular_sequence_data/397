A comparative zzso analysis was initiated to systematically investigate the zzso response of tomato zzso zzso to infection with zzso zzso zzso agent of bacterial zzso Plants of the susceptible tomato zzso zzso line zzso and the resistant zzso were either infected or not infected with zzso zzso and subsequently used for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso allowed the separation of about zzso protein spots per zzso Twelve proteins were of differential abundance in susceptible plants in response to bacterial infection, while no differences were observed in the resistant zzso zzso analysis of these spots revealed 12 zzso six of which were zzso as plant and six as bacterial zzso Among the plant zzso two represent zzso related zzso zzso one stress response zzso one zzso of zzso and energy zzso and one hypothetical zzso A zzso difference between resistant and susceptible lines was not zzso
