In conditions of fluctuating light, zzso zzso zzso excess absorbed energy at the level of the zzso the zzso zzso The zzso Orange zzso zzso zzso and Fluorescence Recovery zzso zzso have essential roles in this zzso zzso of zzso light converts the stable orange zzso zzso form found in darkness into a zzso red zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso system, we studied the interactions between zzso zzso and zzso and demonstrated that they are the only elements required for the zzso zzso In the process, we developed protocols to overcome the effect of high zzso zzso which are needed to maintain the integrity of zzso on the zzso of the zzso and on protein zzso Our experiments demonstrated that, whereas the zzso zzso does not bind to zzso the binding of only one red zzso zzso to the core of the zzso is sufficient to zzso all its zzso This zzso which is light independent, zzso the red form of zzso zzso of zzso accelerated zzso recovery in darkness by interacting with the red zzso and zzso its binding to the zzso The presence of zzso rods renders the zzso binding stronger and allows the isolation of zzso zzso zzso Using the in zzso system we developed, it will now be possible to zzso the zzso process and the chemical nature of the zzso
