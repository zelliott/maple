Based on the demonstration that active zzso is formed in zzso and in zzso from zzso fragments of the zzso chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the evidence that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso chains are in close zzso we constructed altered genes to determine whether zzso zzso zzso chains could fold and assemble into active zzso zzso Two slightly different genetic zzso led to the expression in good yield of zzso zzso zzso zzso which associated in zzso into active zzso They, in turn, combined in zzso with zzso regulatory zzso to form zzso zzso Both zzso chains began at zzso 235 in a different domain from the zzso zzso of wild type and had an overlapping sequence of eight zzso at the zzso zzso One had a zzso zzso and the other had a deletion of four zzso zzso containing rearranged chains were similar to their zzso counterparts in physical zzso Whereas values of zzso were close to those of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso values were more than zzso zzso Also the zzso properties characteristic of zzso zzso were lacking in the zzso containing zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso and recovery of activity in both rate and yield was comparable to that of zzso zzso The experiments demonstrate that folding of chains into clearly defined zzso and the assembly of active, zzso stable zzso are not dependent on the positions of zzso and zzso zzso the folded structures are a consequence of the final sequence and not the order of zzso addition of zzso zzso
