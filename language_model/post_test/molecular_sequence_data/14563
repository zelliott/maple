zzso cardiac zzso is characterized by a marked decrease in the zzso growth factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The underlying mechanism remains zzso This study examined the role of zzso in zzso cardiac zzso By expression zzso we observed a zzso increase in zzso expression in zzso zzso mouse hearts compared with zzso fetal zzso There was also a zzso induction in expression of zzso in older (10 zzso compared with younger (1 zzso zzso Interestingly, tissue distribution analysis identified zzso to be highly abundant in heart and skeletal zzso In the heart, specific expression was observed in cardiac zzso which was zzso by a variety of zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso of zzso by direct targeting of zzso and reduced signaling in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by its zzso protected zzso against zzso and zzso zzso cell death by promoting zzso expression and downstream zzso signaling zzso Additionally, our data show that zzso expression is inhibited by zzso in zzso In zzso such as zzso and fetal hearts, where zzso levels are high, we found either absent or significantly low zzso levels, suggesting an inverse relationship between these two zzso Our study identifies zzso as a new zzso zzso that targets zzso We also demonstrate the existence of a negative feedback loop between zzso zzso and zzso that is associated with zzso cardiac zzso and with the regulation of zzso survival during zzso
