Two DNA fragments of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were selectively amplified by zzso These fragments zzso a segment of the G domain of zzso initiation factor zzso and zzso factor zzso two zzso zzso This was made possible by carefully designing the zzso for this reaction to avoid the amplification of every zzso region of the zzso The sequence of two pairs of zzso was deduced from highly zzso regions, namely zzso and zzso and/or their zzso zzso zzso within each zzso zzso and zzso factors, zzso of zzso zzso On the basis of the expected size, one band was selected in each experiment, cloned into a zzso and zzso This showed zzso after comparison analysis that they belong to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This strategy seems suitable for the amplification of a segment of any gene coding for a G protein from any zzso
