The zzso gene encodes a zzso channel found only in zzso zzso This is in contrast to zzso which is expressed in many zzso Genes pertaining to male zzso especially those involved in zzso production, evolve zzso and functionally much faster than their zzso zzso A comparison of zzso channel zzso acid sequences from several species revealed a high degree of structural divergence relative to their zzso channel zzso To reveal any zzso differences accompanying this rapid structural zzso we analyzed the functional properties of zzso channels from two species, bovine and zzso We observed several functional differences including zzso range of zzso zzso and pH zzso Although zzso channel proteins from these two species lack conservation in many structural regions, we found that the first two of these three functional differences map to the same loop structure in their zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1) domain, which links the intermediate zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We found that small structural changes in this region produce major changes in the zzso range of zzso and zzso This rapidly evolving loop zzso shows the greatest length and sequence zzso within zzso zzso from many different zzso In zzso channels this region may permit evolutionary changes that tune the gating properties in different zzso
