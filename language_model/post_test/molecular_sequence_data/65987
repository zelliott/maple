zzso zzso zzso zzso converts zzso to zzso derivatives and thus decreases their local concentration and prevents them from zzso zzso zzso In this paper we report the partial zzso characterization and tissue distribution of chicken zzso A zzso of zzso was cloned from kidney zzso by reverse zzso and zzso chain zzso At the zzso acid level, the sequence of zzso product had zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with fish zzso The consensus sequences of the zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso activity motif zzso and zzso motif zzso were found in the cloned zzso Analysis of the tissue expression of chicken zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity showed a similar tissue distribution pattern in the majority of zzso High levels of expression and activity were found in zzso small zzso colon and zzso low in zzso and almost zero in brain, liver and zzso
