Many zzso zzso harbor zzso bacteria related to the soybean zzso zzso zzso but little is known about their zzso relationships or geographic zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso were analyzed in 22 zzso of this group sampled from diverse zzso in Korea, Japan, the USA, Mexico, Costa Rica and zzso Some strains from Asia and North America shared identical sequences for both zzso zzso However, pairs of strains with closely related zzso sequences were almost never found in different zzso The major exceptions involved North American zzso zzso zzso zzso 76 and zzso 94, which had zzso sequences highly similar to certain Korean zzso However, zzso zzso sequences of zzso 76 and zzso 94 were closely related to Central American rather than Asian zzso zzso that these strains are genetic mosaics combining sequences from distinct ancestral zzso Several other conflicts between zzso and zzso tree zzso indicated that the zzso histories of these zzso have been influenced by zzso lateral gene transfer zzso
