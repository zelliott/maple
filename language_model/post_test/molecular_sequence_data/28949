The zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso coli act together to process Holliday junctions formed during zzso and DNA zzso zzso has a zzso DNA binding surface that is sculptured specifically to accommodate a Holliday junction and allow subsequent loading of zzso and zzso A zzso charged pin projecting from the zzso limits binding of linear duplex zzso The zzso sequences forming the pin are highly zzso However, in certain zzso and zzso species the structure is extended by four zzso acids and two zzso zzso forming a crucial charge barrier are zzso We investigated the significance of these differences by zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance zzso revealed that this protein binds Holliday junctions and other zzso DNA structures in a manner similar to zzso coli zzso zzso it binds duplex DNA more zzso However it does not support branch migration zzso by zzso coli zzso and when bound to junction DNA is unable to provide a platform for stable binding of zzso coli zzso It also fails to restore radiation resistance to an zzso coli zzso zzso The data presented suggest that the modified pin region retains the ability to promote zzso DNA zzso but acts as a physical obstacle to linear duplex DNA rather than as a charge zzso They also indicate that such an obstacle may interfere with the binding of a zzso zzso species may therefore process Holliday junctions via zzso branch migration and resolution zzso
