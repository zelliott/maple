zzso zzso has been used extensively in metal zzso mining, paints and plastic generation zzso In this study, zzso resistance zzso gene was characterized from the environmental isolate zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences showed high zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso was carried out by using zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso coli zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso have been used as a zzso The sequence identity of zzso zzso zzso shares zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Fold recognition of zzso zzso zzso was created by using zzso web zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso from zzso coli was chosen as the zzso zzso has zzso identity and the estimated precision was zzso The zzso gene was cloned in zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso The molecular weight protein of zzso was estimated to be 25 zzso by zzso The zzso zzso coli zzso efficiently grow in the zzso supplemented LB medium and zzso zzso The order of the resistance of zzso coli zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ni zzso zzso These findings can lead to the use of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso and other heavy metals present in the zzso zzso
