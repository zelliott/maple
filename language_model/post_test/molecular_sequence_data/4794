zzso is a zzso activated in a subset of human zzso whose protein product is a zzso zzso zzso of unknown zzso zzso has a complex structure that includes several zzso and motifs found in proteins implicated in signal zzso zzso An approach to zzso zzso function is to identify proteins that interact directly with zzso and that may serve as regulators or zzso of its zzso To this end, a zzso screen of a zzso expression library was undertaken to identify proteins that interact with specific zzso of zzso An zzso protein has been identified that interacts with sequences in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1) was isolated from a zzso mouse zzso zzso has high zzso to zzso a recently cloned zzso zzso and also shows significant zzso to zzso a zzso protein cloned from human and zzso The zzso zzso has zzso to two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in cell entry into stationary phase and zzso zzso zzso binds zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso transformation of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The properties of zzso suggest that it may be involved in possible zzso functions of the zzso zzso Additionally, these results provide further evidence for the importance of the zzso zzso zzso and its binding proteins in the regulation of zzso zzso
