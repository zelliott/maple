The precise zzso in space and time, of zzso zzso genes is an essential requirement for normal zzso In order to assess for the functional potential of evolutionary zzso zzso regulatory zzso a zzso zzso zzso regulatory element necessary for proper spatial and zzso zzso of the zzso gene was replaced by its fish counterpart in the zzso complex of mice, using an zzso zzso targeted zzso zzso carrying this replacement activated zzso zzso zzso which led to a zzso shift of its expression boundary and a zzso anterior zzso of the zzso These results demonstrate the high zzso conservation of regulatory mechanisms acting over zzso zzso complexes and suggest that minor time difference zzso in zzso gene zzso may have contributed to important zzso variations in the course of zzso
