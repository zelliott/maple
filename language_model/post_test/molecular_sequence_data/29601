The zzso zzso system of a zzso zzso the Japanese zzso zzso zzso consists of three types of hormones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and four types of receptors zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso is recognized as a zzso hormone that zzso both zzso and water in zzso zzso more specifically zzso zzso in zzso zzso evidence shows that zzso is zzso in response to zzso and acts to inhibit the zzso and to stimulate the zzso of zzso but not water, thereby promoting seawater zzso zzso In fact, zzso is zzso immediately after transfer of eels to SW and ameliorates sudden increases in plasma zzso concentration through zzso of drinking and zzso zzso of zzso zzso also stimulates the zzso of zzso a zzso hormone for SW adaptation, whereas zzso itself disappears quickly from the zzso Thus zzso is a primary hormone responsible for the initial phase of SW zzso By contrast, zzso appears to be a hormone involved in freshwater zzso zzso Recent data show that the gene expression of zzso and its specific zzso zzso is much enhanced in zzso zzso In fact, zzso infusion increases zzso zzso from the environment in zzso zzso These results show that zzso and zzso despite high sequence identity, have opposite effects on zzso adaptation in zzso This difference apparently originates from the difference in their specific zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso may compensate the effects of zzso and zzso for adaptation to respective media, because it has high affinity to both zzso On the basis of these data, the authors suggest that the zzso zzso system is a key zzso system that allows this zzso fish to adapt to diverse zzso zzso particularly in the initial phase of zzso
