zzso DNA is a valuable zzso marker due to its relatively fast rate of zzso In zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease, the zzso zzso has a unique structural organization consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and thousands of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an early zzso zzso displaying remarkable genetic zzso and is recognized as a complex of six discrete typing units zzso The majority of infected humans are zzso for life while zzso develop potentially fatal cardiac and/or zzso zzso However, the relationship between specific clinical outcomes and zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The availability of whole zzso sequences has driven advances in high resolution zzso techniques and zzso interest in exploring the diversity present within the various zzso 

To describe zzso diversity, we developed a highly zzso zzso zzso sequence typing zzso scheme based on ten gene zzso A panel of 32 zzso zzso was zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso zzso of nuclear and zzso data revealed clearly zzso zzso histories among different geographical populations as well as major zzso In zzso we exploited read depth data, generated by zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso from the zzso reference strain zzso zzso to provide the first evidence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in an individual zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso provides a powerful approach to zzso at the zzso zzso This strategy will facilitate attempts to resolve zzso variation in zzso zzso and to address zzso important hypotheses in conjunction with intensive zzso zzso The observations of both general and specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicate that genetic zzso is geographically widespread and continues to influence the natural population structure of zzso a conclusion which challenges the traditional paradigm of zzso in zzso zzso
