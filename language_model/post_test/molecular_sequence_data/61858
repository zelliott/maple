A hot pepper zzso zzso zzso clone zzso zzso protein 10 zzso was isolated by differential screening of a zzso library prepared from pepper leaves zzso with tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso transcripts were induced in the incompatible interaction with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not induced in the compatible zzso zzso of zzso properties of zzso indicated that the zzso protein exhibits a zzso activity against zzso zzso as well as against pepper total zzso and shows its putative zzso activity in several zzso The zzso protein existed at very low level in leaf tissue but was dramatically induced as soon as plants were zzso with zzso and this was correlated with the increase of its zzso zzso zzso analysis and pull-down zzso using proteins extracted from pepper leaves showed that zzso zzso led to the zzso of zzso a modification that should affect its capacity for zzso zzso We present data that the induction and subsequent zzso of zzso increased its zzso activity to cleave invading viral zzso and this activity should be important to its zzso zzso during viral attack in zzso
