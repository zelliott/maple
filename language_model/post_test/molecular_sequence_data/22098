The zzso resistance protein 1 zzso mediates drug and organic zzso zzso across the plasma zzso The 17 zzso zzso zzso of zzso are linked by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of various lengths and two zzso zzso binding zzso In this study, three basic zzso clustered at the predicted zzso interface were investigated for their role in zzso expression and zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso were replaced with zzso of the same or opposite charge, expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, and the properties of the zzso proteins were zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso of zzso and zzso affected zzso zzso however, all four zzso showed a decrease in organic zzso transport with a relatively greater decrease in zzso C4 and zzso zzso These zzso also modulated zzso zzso activity as reflected by a decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso to either zzso or zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso to the plasma membrane was zzso However, only the zzso zzso zzso showed a decrease in organic zzso zzso and this was associated with decreased zzso binding and zzso zzso of zzso These studies identified a cluster of basic zzso acids likely at the zzso interface as a region important for both zzso expression and activity and demonstrated that each of the three zzso plays a distinct role in the zzso specificity and zzso activity of the zzso
