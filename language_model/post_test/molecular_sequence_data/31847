zzso engineering has created a palette of zzso fluorescent proteins zzso but there remains an zzso zzso spectral gap between the most zzso useful zzso zzso green zzso zzso zzso and the most zzso useful zzso zzso red zzso zzso zzso To fill this zzso we have engineered a zzso version of the yellow zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Our preferred zzso designated as zzso displays excellent fluorescent zzso good zzso and retains its zzso character both in zzso and in living cells in the context of protein zzso We demonstrate that zzso can serve as a good zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso when paired with an zzso zzso zzso is a valuable addition to the palette of zzso zzso that are useful for zzso imaging and zzso zzso
