A new type of zzso zzso 3, has been identified by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of mature zzso 3 and its precursor has been derived from zzso and human zzso zzso The human zzso 3 gene is spread over seven zzso as in the case of the zzso 1 zzso zzso with zzso 1 and zzso 2 indicates a strong conservation of the mature zzso but a relaxed zzso in the precursor zzso zzso 3 zzso is mainly expressed in cell lines from zzso origin, suggesting a biological role different from the other zzso
