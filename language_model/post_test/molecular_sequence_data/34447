zzso zzso zzso Sofia zzso zzso is often isolated from chickens in zzso However, despite its high frequency of isolation from chicken and chicken meat products, zzso Sofia is rarely associated with animal or human zzso presumably because this zzso is zzso in zzso The objective of this work was to investigate the zzso and molecular properties of zzso Sofia in order to assess its zzso zzso Our in zzso studies support the observation that this zzso can colonize zzso but does not cause disease in zzso This was further confirmed with tissue culture zzso which showed that the ability of zzso Sofia to zzso invade and survive zzso is significantly diminished compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso islands zzso showed that most of the differences observed in zzso to zzso of zzso Sofia could be attributed to minor changes in the zzso as indicated by a loss or gain of restriction zzso sites within these zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the majority of zzso genes identified were predicted to zzso proteins sharing a high identity zzso with corresponding proteins from zzso zzso However, a number of zzso genes in zzso Sofia have accumulated zzso predicted to affect zzso and/or zzso The zzso of this zzso is probably not the result of a single genetic change but rather of a series of zzso in a large number of zzso zzso The acquisition of any single zzso gene will almost certainly not be sufficient to restore zzso Sofia zzso
