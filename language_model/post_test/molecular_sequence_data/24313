In order to investigate the mode of existence of the zzso complex, zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the normal skeletal zzso we examined the zzso zzso and mutual spatial relationship of zzso zzso zzso and the individual components of the zzso complex by using triple zzso labeling electron zzso Each zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is located zzso or zzso near the muscle plasma membrane mostly in accordance with the zzso zzso sites against which the zzso were zzso The association of different two and/or three zzso molecules out of zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules was frequently zzso Each zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso noted along the cell surface of normal skeletal zzso Moreover, the close relation of a zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and the association of zzso with zzso were also confirmed zzso Thus, this study demonstrated that the zzso molecules of the zzso complex, zzso zzso and zzso existed in the form of a cluster at the normal muscle plasma zzso The association of zzso with zzso and its associated zzso may form a zzso signaling complex at the muscle plasma zzso
