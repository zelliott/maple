It has been proposed that the zzso regulation of secondary wall zzso in zzso is controlled by a zzso network zzso by zzso and its close zzso zzso all the zzso factors and deciphering their zzso in the network are essential for our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso regulation of zzso of secondary walls, the major constituent of wood and zzso Here, we present functional evidence that the zzso zzso factor is another molecular switch in the zzso zzso network regulating secondary wall zzso zzso is specifically expressed in fibers and vessels where secondary wall zzso zzso Its expression is directly activated by zzso and its close zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso is their direct zzso zzso zzso is able to activate a number of the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso induce zzso secondary wall zzso In addition, its zzso zzso the expression of several zzso factors involved in regulation of secondary wall zzso zzso repression of zzso functions or simultaneous zzso zzso of zzso and zzso results in a reduction in secondary wall zzso in fibers and vessels and a deformation of zzso Furthermore, double zzso knockout zzso of zzso and zzso cause a lack of secondary walls in vessels and an arrest in plant zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso and zzso both of which are zzso direct targets, function zzso in the zzso regulatory cascade leading to secondary wall formation in fibers and zzso
