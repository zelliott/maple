We used zzso and zzso zzso to characterize tissue distribution of the human zzso zzso to zzso primarily identified in the rat zzso Human zzso zzso and protein are readily identified in human zzso cells, zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso is found on the surface of the cells and is zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso kidney zzso and zzso express the protein on their zzso zzso Moreover, the protein is expressed in Type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, and the zzso body of the zzso zzso analysis of zzso fragments, obtained by zzso revealed identical zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso protein zzso revealed partial zzso with human zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings substantiate human zzso expression in a variety of human zzso expected to possess zzso zzso It may constitute a protein of utmost importance to adult and fetal calcium zzso although other important functions may also be coupled to this exceptionally large protein with highly restricted tissue zzso
