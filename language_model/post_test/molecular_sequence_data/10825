zzso a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been identified as a zzso for infections by zzso zzso of human zzso virus type 1 zzso To study its structure and function, we isolated zzso clones of human, African green monkey zzso and zzso mouse zzso and we zzso analyzed infections by zzso zzso and zzso after zzso human zzso cells with the zzso expression zzso The zzso and zzso mouse zzso proteins are zzso to zzso and zzso identical to the human zzso zzso In addition, we analyzed zzso zzso and zzso of these zzso Cell surface expression of zzso proteins was monitored by using a specific rabbit zzso and by binding the zzso zzso Our major results were as zzso zzso Two distinct zzso zzso sequences were zzso found in DNA from zzso zzso The zzso clone 1 zzso protein differs from that of clone 2 by two zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region and zzso at the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso clone 1 zzso was inactive as a zzso for all tested zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso clone 2 zzso was zzso As shown by zzso studies and zzso zzso the zzso substitution in zzso clone 1 zzso was solely responsible for blocking zzso zzso In contrast, both zzso zzso clones were active zzso for zzso Studies of DNA samples from other zzso indicated frequent additional zzso zzso and we cloned an zzso clone 2 zzso with a zzso substitution in the zzso loop 1 from one zzso This zzso zzso was active as a zzso for zzso but was only zzso active for zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso appeared to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and loop 2 regions of human zzso for zzso zzso Our results suggest major differences in the interactions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with 19, zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso with zzso in zzso loop 1; and with zzso loop 2 of human zzso zzso The zzso mouse zzso protein differs at multiple positions from sequences recently reported for other zzso strains of zzso This zzso was inactive as a zzso for zzso and zzso Studies of zzso that contained different portions of zzso mouse zzso zzso into human zzso as well as the zzso zzso indicated that the zzso region and zzso zzso 1 and 2 of human zzso contribute to its zzso activity for zzso zzso of zzso zzso differences with previous zzso zzso results occurred because the zzso mouse zzso contains a unique substitution corresponding to zzso in zzso loop 2 that is zzso for zzso zzso We conclude that diverse zzso sequences occur in zzso and mice, that zzso and zzso zzso zzso interact differently with specific zzso zzso zzso and that multiple regions of human zzso contribute to its zzso zzso In addition, we have identified naturally occurring zzso acid zzso in three zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso that do not interfere with cell surface expression or zzso binding but prevent infections by zzso zzso of zzso In contrast to previous evidence, these results suggest that zzso contains critical sites that are essential for zzso zzso
