To isolate zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso zzso zzso activity, random zzso zzso zzso zzso were screened for conditional lethal zzso on complex zzso zzso has an zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso The zzso in strain zzso was mapped to the zzso zzso which was found to lie directly upstream of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso required zzso for zzso growth in complex media, and had a complex growth zzso in minimal media with different carbon zzso The zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso activity under all growth conditions, and activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were affected by the addition of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso studies confirmed that expression from zzso was induced by zzso and leaky in its zzso zzso plants zzso with zzso were zzso and zzso with small white root zzso and had shoot dry weight and zzso content values similar to those of zzso zzso zzso clone zzso restored zzso activity to zzso zzso both the zzso growth and symbiotic zzso and was found to carry six complete zzso zzso zzso and two partial zzso zzso zzso acid cycle zzso
