DNA and zzso zzso share a core architecture composed of three structurally zzso zzso A, B, and zzso Although the zzso acid sequences of these motifs are highly zzso between closely related organisms, variation across broader evolutionary distances suggests that only a few zzso in each motif are indispensable for zzso zzso To test this, we constructed libraries of human zzso virus zzso zzso containing random single zzso acid replacements in motif B of reverse zzso zzso and we used selection in culture to assess zzso zzso Despite the nearly absolute constancy of motif B in zzso virus replicating in culture tolerated a range of conservative and zzso zzso at 10 of the 11 zzso acid positions zzso These included zzso that are zzso across all zzso zzso and highly zzso in diverse zzso Several zzso retained wild type zzso and serial passage experiments revealed replacements that were neutral or even beneficial to viral zzso In addition, a number of the selected zzso exhibited altered zzso to the zzso analog zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso zzso a range of zzso at zzso zzso zzso and that selection against slightly deleterious zzso zzso zzso in zzso masks a large repertoire of viable zzso zzso This zzso flexibility likely contributes to zzso evolution in response to changing selection pressures in infected zzso
