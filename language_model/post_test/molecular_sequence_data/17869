The synthesis of a zzso zzso possessing an zzso zzso at the designated sugar fragment, zzso zzso is zzso The zzso group was introduced to zzso zzso of zzso which was then converted to the protected zzso zzso This zzso was used for the zzso synthesis of the modified zzso zzso The zzso and CD melting behaviors indicate that the modified zzso 1 can form a duplex in zzso buffer solution similar to the unmodified strand zzso zzso The observed melting temperatures for the duplexes 1 and 7 were zzso and zzso degrees C, zzso The zzso change in the intensity of the induced CD at around 335 zzso reflected directly to the melting behaviors of duplex 1, indicating that the zzso groups zzso into the base pairs in the zzso The zzso stability of the duplex translates into a free energy cost of zzso zzso The present work provides a novel method for enhancing the affinity of zzso for their complementary zzso
