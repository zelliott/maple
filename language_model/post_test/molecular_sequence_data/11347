This first zzso zzso of split zzso zzso gene and its full length complementary DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso via zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein is the smallest and most different in structure compared to all zzso related zzso The gene isolated is zzso in size, including zzso promoter zzso A putative zzso at position zzso two consensus sequence of zzso characteristic of leader binding zzso zzso binding motifs at position zzso and zzso and nine zzso boxes were found in the promoter region of zzso zzso The zzso sequence is interrupted by five zzso The length of zzso 1 to 5 is 52, zzso 87, 53 and 518 zzso zzso The overall structural relationships of the zzso proteins among human, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso
