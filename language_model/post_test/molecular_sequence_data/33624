In the rare medical condition termed injection zzso zzso zzso of insulin are zzso We found that the segment of the insulin zzso with sequence zzso is the smallest segment that both zzso and zzso the zzso of full-length insulin in a zzso zzso manner, suggesting that this segment is central to the zzso spine of the insulin zzso In isolation from the rest of the zzso zzso forms zzso zzso with zzso zzso the structure of which we determined to 1 A zzso The zzso segments are stacked into pairs of tightly zzso zzso each pair displaying the dry zzso zzso interface typical of zzso zzso This structure leads to a model for zzso of human insulin consistent with electron zzso zzso fiber zzso and zzso zzso
