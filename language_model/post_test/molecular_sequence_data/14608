zzso of DNA replication in zzso is exquisitely regulated to ensure that DNA replication occurs exactly once in each cell zzso A zzso and essential step for the initiation of zzso DNA replication is the loading of the zzso maintenance zzso zzso zzso onto zzso at replication origins by zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of this event, we determined the structure of the human zzso binding zzso the zzso complex by zzso Our structural and zzso zzso studies showed that charge zzso is a key zzso for the specific interaction between zzso and zzso When this interaction was interrupted by zzso zzso of the zzso interacting zzso the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso were defective in DNA replication and the zzso loading of zzso resulting in cell zzso Having shown that zzso and zzso interact through their zzso and knowing that zzso is zzso to zzso during the loading of zzso our results suggest that the zzso zzso is loaded with its C terminal end facing the zzso zzso These results provide a structural basis for the zzso zzso zzso zzso
