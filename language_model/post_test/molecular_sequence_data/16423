zzso was originally identified in zzso zzso for its role in zzso zzso through the creation of specialized zzso zzso It is the most zzso zzso protein zzso with zzso in all zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been implicated in lifespan determination and regulation of the activities of zzso factors and other zzso Although zzso has not been widely implicated in zzso zzso outside zzso zzso zzso zzso were recently shown to zzso position effect zzso suggesting that the role of zzso in zzso zzso may not be restricted to zzso 

Evidence is presented that zzso zzso is also involved in zzso zzso by the zzso group zzso zzso zzso enhance the zzso of zzso group zzso and disrupt zzso of a zzso reporter zzso zzso by a zzso response zzso zzso with this, zzso is physically associated with components of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to many zzso sites on zzso zzso and zzso with zzso at most zzso 

zzso is involved in the zzso inheritance of silent zzso states zzso by the zzso zzso group proteins and is physically associated with a complex containing the zzso zzso zzso
