zzso must ensure that zzso signals in the 3' zzso are highly active, while identical signals in the zzso zzso are inactive zzso In the case of zzso both promoter proximity in the zzso zzso and zzso sequences in the 3' zzso may contribute to this zzso We have discovered a novel regulatory mechanism for zzso site zzso in zzso When zzso initiation from the zzso promoter is activated by zzso the zzso zzso site is specifically zzso while other zzso sites are unaffected by zzso zzso signals associated with this zzso effect are immediately adjacent to the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso II, activated by zzso specifically zzso the zzso zzso zzso
