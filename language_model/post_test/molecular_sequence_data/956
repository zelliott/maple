We previously reported that zzso binds directly to the zzso zzso zzso acids of Homo sapiens zzso zzso zzso zzso causing a zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ferguson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This region of zzso binds zzso protein to repress zzso DNA binding and zzso Here we show that the basic zzso zzso domain of zzso which allows for DNA binding and zzso is necessary and sufficient for interaction with zzso Interestingly, the isolated basic zzso zzso domain of zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, when the zzso region of zzso was added to in zzso zzso reactions and zzso in cells, it blocked zzso zzso zzso another basic zzso zzso zzso did not interact with zzso but zzso zzso did bind the N zzso of zzso Our studies show that, in addition to zzso and DNA zzso the well characterized basic zzso zzso domain of zzso functions in zzso zzso by binding to the N zzso of zzso to zzso zzso
