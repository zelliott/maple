In insects, zzso are responsible for the zzso metabolism of structurally diverse zzso and zzso compounds including plant zzso and zzso A novel full-length zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence is zzso zzso in length with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso analysis indicated that zzso belongs to zzso clan and second zzso of zzso which contain 11 zzso from zzso zzso real-time zzso showed that zzso was expressed only in larvae stages and had a high level of zzso in the zzso and fat zzso In addition, we cloned a zzso zzso regions and presented the zzso zzso activities of zzso We also predicted multiple putative elements for zzso factors binding in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the expression of zzso significantly increased in the zzso and fat body after lead zzso exposure for 5 zzso zzso tolerance to the zzso zzso increased in zzso and zzso zzso increased in zzso were improved after zzso to 50 zzso zzso These dates suggested that lead increased tolerance of larvae to zzso mainly through zzso induction of zzso genes including zzso
