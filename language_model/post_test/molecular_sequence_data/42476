The complete zzso sequence of the gene zzso the zzso surface protein 1 zzso from the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso AS has been determined by direct sequencing of overlapping zzso derived zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso AS zzso sequence with the previously published zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence indicates that although the zzso gene of these two zzso zzso zzso strains is highly zzso with sequence identity often approaching zzso zzso throughout the zzso are 5 regions of zzso This is at zzso with published data which suggested that the zzso zzso zzso AS and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences are largely zzso zzso mapping studies with a panel of zzso zzso zzso AS zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that whilst most of these zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso two zzso including one capable of zzso challenge infections in mice in an in zzso passive transfer zzso zzso zzso which map to the zzso
