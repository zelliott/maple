Class III zzso zzso zzso small zzso named protein zzso contains a zzso zzso Its function is to mediate electron transfer from reduced zzso to zzso required for the introduction of a zzso radical in the large zzso named protein zzso which then becomes active for the reduction of zzso By zzso zzso we demonstrate that the three zzso of the zzso zzso sequence are involved in iron zzso Such a sequence is also present in the zzso of the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso both carrying an zzso center involved in reductive zzso of zzso Even though they are able to bind iron in the zzso form, as shown by zzso zzso the corresponding zzso to Ala zzso are zzso zzso zzso of the two other zzso of the protein did not result in zzso We thus conclude that the zzso cluster has, in the wild type zzso only three zzso zzso and a fourth still unidentified zzso
