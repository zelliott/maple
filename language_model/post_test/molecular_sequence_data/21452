The highly zzso H5N1 is a major avian pathogen that zzso affects the poultry industry in Egypt even in spite of the adoption of vaccination zzso zzso drift is among the strategies the influenza virus uses to escape the immune system that might develop due to the pressure of extensive zzso H5N1 zzso in an intensified manner and is considered a potential candidate for the possible next pandemic with all the catastrophic consequences such an zzso will zzso 

H5N1 was isolated from the pooled organ samples of four different affected flocks in specific pathogen free zzso chicken eggs zzso A reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to the zzso and zzso zzso of the full length zzso was zzso zzso analyses of the isolated strains were performed and compared to all available H5N1 from Egyptian human and avian strains in the flu zzso Changes in the different zzso acid that may be related to virus zzso zzso affinity and zzso zzso were assigned and matched with all available Egyptian strains in the flu zzso 

One out of the four strains was found to be related to the B2 Egyptian zzso 2 were related to A1 lineage and the 4th was related to zzso zzso Comparing data obtained from the current study by other available Egyptian H5N1 sequences remarkably demonstrates that zzso acid changes in the immune escape zzso are remarkably restricted to a limited number of locations on the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso diversity in the zzso zzso in relevance to different zzso were not found to follow a regular trend, suggesting abrupt cumulative sequence zzso However a number of zzso acids were found to be subjected to high zzso zzso 

The current data provides a comprehensive view of zzso gene evolution among H5N1 zzso viruses in zzso Egyptian zzso are constantly undergoing genetic changes and reveal a complex pattern of zzso These findings raise the concerns about the value of using influenza vaccines in correlation with the development of zzso drift in influenza zzso
