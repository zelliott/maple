In plant zzso specific zzso zzso zzso are subjected to conversion editing, a process that often converts the first or second zzso of a zzso and hence the zzso zzso zzso No systematic patterns in converted sites were found on zzso and the converted sites rarely zzso zzso located at the active sites of zzso The role and origin of zzso editing in plant zzso remain to be zzso 

Here we study the relationship between zzso acid zzso zzso by edited zzso and the structural characteristics of these zzso within zzso zzso in zzso zzso elements of secondary structure, or protein structural zzso We find that the zzso zzso by edited zzso are significantly biased toward involvement in zzso and protein structural zzso zzso editing can convert zzso for zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso only the edited form of an zzso can be translated into a zzso with zzso and zzso zzso at the appropriate positions, which is often required for a protein to form a functional three-dimensional zzso zzso 

We have performed a novel analysis of the location of zzso affected by zzso editing in proteins in plant zzso This study documents that zzso editing sites are often found in positions important for zzso structure zzso Without zzso editing, protein folding will not occur properly, thus affecting gene zzso We suggest that zzso editing may have zzso evolutionary advantage by acting as a mechanism to reduce zzso to DNA damage by allowing the increase in zzso content in DNA while maintaining zzso zzso essential to zzso zzso required for protein folding and zzso
