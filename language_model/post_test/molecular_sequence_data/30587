The distribution of zzso zzso zzso is described in the brain and in the zzso of the zzso nerve zzso of the locust zzso zzso A single zzso pair of zzso cell bodies occurs zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso Each cell sends a process zzso which zzso into zzso and zzso running zzso The single anterior zzso passes along the zzso zzso to the brain where it ascends in a zzso running zzso giving off branches to zzso the zzso zzso and ending in an extensive network of highly zzso zzso processes in the zzso zzso No processes are seen in the zzso zzso or associated with the structured zzso of the zzso zzso The single zzso zzso from each cell passes into the zzso zzso It runs in the lateral zzso tract of each zzso in the zzso nerve zzso as a highly zzso process and in each zzso gives rise to an zzso network of zzso processes in the zzso and lateral zzso In the seventh and terminal abdominal zzso the zzso pattern exhibits sexual zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the same pair of zzso zzso and their zzso A similar pair of zzso median zzso zzso with both zzso in the zzso zzso of another species of zzso zzso zzso Although the basic distribution pattern of zzso processes is similar in both species there are also marked species differences in the zzso
