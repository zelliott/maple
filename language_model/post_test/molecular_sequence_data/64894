We have identified a mouse zzso of the zzso zzso family of zzso proteins on the basis of its high expression in primordial germ cells and zzso zzso stem cell zzso zzso is also highly expressed in zzso and zzso cells during early mouse development, and in male and female germ cells in adult zzso zzso expression is induced during derivation of embryonic stem cells and is rapidly zzso upon differentiation of embryonic stem cells in zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso physically interacts with the zzso protein zzso and can be zzso to zzso repeat DNA in mouse embryonic stem zzso zzso may be involved in the maintenance of zzso length or zzso in the zzso and during early mouse zzso
