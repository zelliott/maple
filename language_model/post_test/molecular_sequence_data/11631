DNA zzso can cause zzso of zzso when the zzso zzso zzso is limiting and thus function as zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we explored whether zzso causing zzso of the zzso binding activity of the zzso zzso thus mimicking conditions of limiting zzso zzso could convert a DNA zzso to a zzso zzso zzso We created two zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which both showed enhanced zzso zzso activities in zzso and in zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso generated by these zzso were not repaired completely in bacteria equipped with zzso zzso repair machinery, giving rise to a potent zzso zzso This is the first report showing the creation of zzso zzso from a DNA zzso and the demonstration of their zzso in living zzso
