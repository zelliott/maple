In zzso one of the major actions of zzso growth factor I zzso is to increase skeletal growth by stimulating new cartilage zzso zzso stimulates zzso in zzso to zzso new cartilage zzso measured by enhanced zzso of zzso but the addition of insulin does not produce a similar effect except when added at high zzso However, recent studies have shown that, in zzso both insulin and zzso are potent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso To further characterize the zzso activities of these hormones in fish, we have used reverse zzso zzso to analyze the expression of insulin zzso family genes in salmon zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso the zzso zzso zzso from six distinct members of the zzso gene family were zzso and sequence comparisons revealed that four of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequences that were highly zzso to human zzso whereas the zzso sequences from two of the zzso were more similar to the human type I zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a comparative reverse zzso zzso zzso revealed that the four putative zzso zzso expressed in zzso in zzso cartilage were zzso of that found in liver whereas the expressed amount of the two zzso zzso was zzso higher compared with zzso These results suggest that the zzso actions of insulin and zzso in fish are zzso by the zzso binding to their zzso zzso However, further studies will be required to characterize the binding properties and relative contribution of the individual zzso and zzso zzso
