To evaluate the genetic stability of the zzso zzso vaccine strain we have performed 10 serial passages of the seed lot virus zzso in chicken zzso zzso primary cultures zzso under production zzso The zzso sequences of the seed lot virus, the virus from a vaccine vial zzso zzso and from the 10th passage were determined and compared with each other and with sequences from other zzso The full zzso analysis of the zzso vaccine still considers it as the most divergent among all vaccine zzso The zzso sequence analyses of viral zzso from the three zzso passage levels have demonstrated that they are zzso This study shows that the zzso zzso vaccine virus is highly adapted to its zzso conditions and that its genetic stability zzso in part, to the safety profile of the zzso
