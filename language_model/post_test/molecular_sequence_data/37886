The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the unique property of recognizing incompletely folded zzso and, if they carry an N zzso zzso of catalyzing the addition of a zzso zzso from zzso Using zzso sequence information, we have isolated the complete zzso of rat liver zzso and expressed it in insect zzso The zzso specifies an open reading frame which codes for a protein of zzso zzso including an 18 zzso acid signal zzso The protein has a zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso shows the same preference for unfolded zzso with N zzso zzso as the zzso zzso from rat zzso A genetically engineered zzso zzso strain capable of producing zzso with zzso zzso was constructed and zzso acid zzso zzso was zzso zzso was used as an zzso zzso for zzso and found to be a better zzso than the previously used soybean zzso and zzso zzso rat zzso has a K zzso of 44 zzso for zzso A zzso zzso of zzso was found to retain zzso activity thus zzso the zzso site of the zzso to the zzso 37 zzso of the zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be necessary for the zzso activity of the zzso
