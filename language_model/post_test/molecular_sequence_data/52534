A structural study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and G zzso zzso isolated from apple fruit has been undertaken with zzso and molecular mechanics zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso data including nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso volumes were recorded at both 6 and 20 degrees zzso In spite of severe overlapping of zzso it was possible to estimate summed zzso for the majority of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso An zzso population of preferred zzso has been established with the zzso zzso searching zzso associated with the zzso force zzso zzso of the theoretical data obtained by zzso of the zzso volumes from the zzso distance zzso program and zzso models based on the zzso relation zzso reproduce the experimental zzso zzso averaging about the zzso zzso linkages includes both the zzso and anti zzso and a minor zzso population is highly zzso The theoretical data overestimate the zzso preference of the zzso zzso zzso linkage as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, both the zzso models and the zzso search indicate a fairly rigid backbone and greater zzso for the zzso side zzso
