A zzso zzso zzso slightly zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from sea water off the island of zzso Korea, and its zzso position was investigated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso grew zzso at 37 degrees C and in the presence of 2 % zzso zzso It contained zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso as the major fatty zzso Its DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso values between the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso and those of the type strains of recognized zzso species and of zzso zzso were in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso gene sequence similarity values of zzso % to recognized zzso species and the other species used in the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and differential zzso properties made it possible to categorize strain zzso as representing a novel zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso data zzso it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso should be classified in the zzso zzso as the type strain of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
