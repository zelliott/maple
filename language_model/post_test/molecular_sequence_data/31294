zzso systemic zzso zzso is a zzso disease characterized by deposition of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing of protein isolated from the zzso zzso of a patient with zzso identified zzso containing a position - 122 zzso zzso This change led to the prediction of a zzso zzso transition, destroying an zzso restriction zzso We confirmed the presence of the zzso DNA zzso both by Southern zzso and by zzso of zzso zzso of DNA amplified around zzso zzso by using the zzso chain zzso The patient's DNA was entirely resistant to zzso zzso therefore, only the zzso sequence was zzso DNA from none of either 24 controls or six other zzso patients contained the zzso zzso Southern zzso demonstrated that the patient's DNA contained two copies of the zzso gene per zzso the zzso was therefore zzso rather than zzso In the present case, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso a finding which is consistent with zzso zzso inheritance of this zzso
