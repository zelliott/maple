The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso folded zzso zzso zzso The domain is one of the smallest naturally occurring sequences which has been shown to zzso Recent experimental studies have shown that it folds on the zzso time zzso Its small size, simple zzso and very rapid folding have made it an attractive target for zzso studies of protein zzso We present zzso zzso studies that provide evidence for significant structure in the zzso state of the zzso zzso A set of zzso fragments derived from the zzso were also characterized in order to determine if there is a significant tendency to form a locally stabilized structure in the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to each of the three isolated zzso and to the connection between the first and second zzso were largely zzso A longer zzso zzso which contains the first and second zzso shows considerable structure, as judged by zzso and zzso zzso CD zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicate that the structure is not due to zzso zzso studies indicate that the structure is stabilized by zzso interactions involving zzso and Val zzso A zzso in which two of the three zzso are changed to zzso is considerably less zzso confirming the importance of the zzso This work indicates that there is significant structure in the zzso state of this rapidly folding zzso
