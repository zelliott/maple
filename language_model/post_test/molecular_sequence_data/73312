We have previously reported the cloning and sequencing of a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso # zzso which predicts a small protein zzso to a zzso protein in zzso and zzso In this study we show that a 330 zzso transcript zzso the putative zzso protein is expressed in zzso zzso cells under normal growth conditions zzso degrees zzso This zzso is associated with the zzso machinery and is present on zzso The zzso zzso was transcribed using zzso zzso zzso and the resulting transcripts translated in a wheat germ zzso zzso analysis of the in zzso transcribed and translated zzso zzso yields a small protein of approximately 9 zzso Using two-dimensional zzso we have established that the zzso zzso protein zzso with a small basic protein in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso proteins are indistinguishable providing support for the identity of this zzso
