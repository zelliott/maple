Analysis of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso identified as being unable to multiply in zzso cells, allowed us to identify a 11 860 zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a type IV zzso system, zzso to the zzso system of zzso zzso and the zzso system of zzso zzso DNA sequence revealed 12 open reading frames zzso zzso zzso of the 11 zzso proteins present in the zzso zzso of zzso with a similar genetic organization, and a zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso to a protein involved in mating pair formation during bacterial zzso and to zzso used by zzso species to bind to plant zzso zzso trees based on the sequences of zzso and zzso protein zzso suggest that evolution of the systems from DNA transfer towards protein zzso did not stem from a single event but that the protein zzso systems have evolved zzso Four independent zzso in zzso zzso or zzso were highly attenuated in an in zzso infection model with human zzso The zzso was restored by zzso with a zzso containing the full zzso zzso The zzso region appears to be essential for the zzso survival and zzso of zzso zzso
