In zzso zzso the synaptic zzso complex with associated zzso density is presumed to contain proteins responsible for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and for zzso signal zzso We have found that a zzso zzso protein zzso enriched in the zzso density fraction from rat brain is highly similar to the zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso protein is associated with zzso junctions in developing flies and contains a zzso zzso domain that is required for normal control of cell zzso The sequence similarity between zzso and zzso suggests that molecular mechanisms critical for growth control in developing organisms may also regulate zzso formation, stabilization, or function in the adult zzso
