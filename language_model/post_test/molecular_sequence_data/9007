Several zzso of the zzso zzso translation initiation factor 3 zzso contain zzso zzso Among them is the zzso zzso zzso domain, typically serving as the principal scaffold for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes, which constitutes most of the zzso region of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso domain is exceptional in that its zzso despite being zzso does not affect zzso zzso Here, we show that a short zzso zzso and two clustered zzso directly disturbing the zzso domain produce lethal or slow growth zzso and significantly reduce amounts of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso The extreme zzso directly interacts with zzso 1-3 of the small zzso protein zzso which is a part of the zzso head, and, consistently, deletion of the zzso coding region likewise affects zzso association with zzso The zzso domain per zzso shows strong but unspecific binding to zzso for the first time implicating this typical zzso binding domain in zzso zzso interactions zzso zzso as our clustered zzso severely reduce zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso region forms an important zzso bridge between zzso and the zzso head region by zzso zzso and most probably zzso zzso
