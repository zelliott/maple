zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit differential pigmentation of the zzso and zzso leaf regions, a visible zzso that often indicates impaired zzso zzso We performed a zzso analysis of one zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso that revealed altered levels of zzso zzso namely increased zzso and reduced zzso zzso In addition, the zzso were more sensitive than the zzso to zzso zzso and leaf zzso and zzso defects of these zzso were completely rescued by zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso experience a zzso of the conversion of zzso into zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with the participation of zzso and zzso in the same pathway, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso double zzso was zzso zzso cloning showed that the zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is assumed to be required for the conversion of zzso into zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in a zzso zzso coli strain fully restored bacterial growth in minimal zzso demonstrating the zzso activity of the zzso and zzso zzso and indicating a zzso role for zzso in these distinct and distant zzso zzso study of the zzso leaf zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso development is highly sensitive to impaired zzso zzso
