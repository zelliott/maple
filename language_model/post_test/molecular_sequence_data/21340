The zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors unique gut bacteria and produces only one-fifth the amount of methane produced by zzso per unit of zzso energy zzso We have isolated a dominant bacterial species zzso from the zzso zzso affiliated with the family zzso and implicated in lower methane emissions from zzso zzso This was achieved by using a partial reconstruction of the zzso metabolism from zzso zzso data zzso and zzso zzso pathways and zzso zzso to devise zzso strategies that produced zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirm that the zzso is zzso and produces zzso further explaining a zzso basis for lower methane emissions from zzso This knowledge also provides new strategic targets for zzso zzso and reducing methane production in zzso
