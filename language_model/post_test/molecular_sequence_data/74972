Two zzso were used to develop new techniques for the zzso and zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso d zzso The zzso was zzso from zzso house dust extract with a high zzso d I content by affinity zzso over a zzso zzso and zzso with 4 zzso zzso pH zzso This single step procedure gave 40 to 50% recovery of zzso pure zzso which, following final zzso by size exclusion zzso showed a single line on zzso and crossed zzso against zzso zzso d I and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of native zzso d I was zzso on size exclusion zzso and 17,000 under zzso conditions on gel zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso showed no zzso with other known protein zzso The combination of the zzso and zzso sequence data suggests that zzso d I is a zzso linked zzso A zzso zzso was developed using zzso directed against different zzso on zzso d zzso This zzso was zzso highly sensitive zzso zzso and showed an excellent correlation with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 27, r zzso zzso p less than zzso Cat zzso extracts used for immediate skin tests showed marked differences in zzso d I content (from zzso to 30 zzso zzso high zzso d I levels were found at monthly intervals in six dust samples from four houses with cats (10 to 100 zzso of zzso Comparisons of zzso d I and zzso and zzso zzso levels showed that house dust can contain greater than 100 zzso of either of these zzso and is a potent source of foreign environmental zzso zzso affinity zzso provides a major breakthrough in the zzso of zzso d I, from a source material that would otherwise have been considered impossible zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso d I is both more sensitive and more easily standardized than existing zzso These techniques will allow full structural and zzso analysis of zzso d I and more detailed studies on the relationship between cat zzso exposure and the development of zzso
