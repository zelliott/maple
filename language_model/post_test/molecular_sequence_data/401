Because of its extremely limited coding capacity, the zzso delta virus zzso takes over cellular zzso for its replication and zzso Despite the functional importance of host factors in both zzso biology and zzso little is known about proteins that associate with its zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of several host proteins interacting with an zzso corresponding to the right terminal zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso using mass zzso on a zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso affinity zzso and screening of a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm the interactions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the right terminal zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and with both zzso of zzso zzso within zzso zzso Our discovery that zzso zzso associates with zzso pathways and translation machinery during its replication provides new insights into zzso biology and its zzso
