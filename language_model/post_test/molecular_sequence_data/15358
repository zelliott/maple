A nuclear zzso zzso is implicated in certain human diseases, such as leukemia and zzso disorders, and a major component of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso structure, it can involve in various DNA and zzso processes and function as either an zzso or zzso Despite of numerous efforts to suggest the biological role of zzso direct target proteins of zzso in different zzso status remains zzso To investigate if zzso protein triggers the changes in certain protein networks, zzso was knocked down at both types of cell clones using zzso zzso Here we provide a zzso of zzso profiles in total cell zzso derived from normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells and a good in zzso model system for zzso the protein networks due to this zzso zzso zzso In this biological context, we compared total zzso changes by the combined methods of two-dimensional gel zzso quantitative image analysis and zzso zzso zzso There were a large number of targets for zzso which were zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells and consisted of 58 proteins (41 zzso and 17 zzso zzso regulated expression was further confirmed for some zzso of candidates by Western zzso analysis using specific zzso In the identified 58 spots, zzso of proteins are known to be associated with zzso Among others, we identified zzso related proteins such as zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso omega zzso These results are consistent with recent studies indicating the crucial role of zzso in zzso zzso We further demonstrated by zzso analysis that zzso of zzso caused zzso of zzso around zzso VI promoter which is zzso in our zzso Using zzso analysis, we have demonstrated the zzso of other zzso zzso related proteins by zzso zzso and further zzso its role in zzso zzso
