The zzso family of zzso zzso has important functions in zzso development and disease, and is widely distributed throughout the zzso In this study, we identified a novel zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso with closest overall sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso Based on comparisons of available sequence information, putative zzso of this zzso (which we designate zzso are identified in several other zzso species including zzso zzso but absent from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso deposited in zzso zzso with subsequent zzso expression detected in the neural plate at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a delay in early zzso marker zzso which can be rescued by a zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso is likely required for maintaining proper timing of zzso in zzso zzso
