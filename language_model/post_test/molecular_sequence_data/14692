Global zzso DNA zzso data indicates that the dog originates from zzso of wolf in Asia South of zzso River zzso with minor genetic contributions from zzso zzso zzso zzso data and zzso single zzso zzso data have instead suggested that dogs originate from Europe and/or South West Asia but, because these zzso lack data from zzso evidence pointing to zzso may have been zzso zzso of additional markers for global zzso including zzso are therefore necessary to test if zzso zzso reflects the actual dog history and not merely zzso events or zzso Here, we zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequence in 151 dogs sampled zzso We found 28 zzso distributed in five zzso Two zzso were universally shared and included three zzso carried by zzso of all dogs, but two other zzso were primarily restricted to East zzso zzso genetic diversity and virtually complete zzso coverage was found within zzso The 151 dogs were estimated to originate from zzso wolf founders, but there was no indication of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso data give zzso similar pictures of dog zzso most zzso that roughly 50% of the gene pools are shared universally but only zzso has nearly the full range of genetic diversity, such that the gene pools in all other regions may derive from zzso This corroborates that zzso was the principal, and possibly sole region of wolf zzso that a large number of wolves were zzso and that subsequent zzso zzso contributed modestly to the dog gene zzso
