The zzso G virus zzso is a newly described zzso that affects a high proportion of patients with chronic viral zzso our objective was to determine what role zzso might play in the course of zzso 

We evaluated stored serum samples from 108 patients with chronic zzso B and 99 patients with chronic zzso C who participated in trials of zzso or zzso for the presence of zzso B virus zzso DNA and zzso C virus zzso zzso by zzso DNA and for the presence of zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso from the zzso region of the zzso 

Initially, 20 zzso patients with zzso B and 11 zzso with zzso C had zzso zzso in their zzso Patients with and without zzso infection were similar with regard to clinical features, laboratory tests, and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels fell during zzso therapy and became zzso in those receiving the highest zzso however, zzso zzso levels returned to zzso values when therapy was zzso With zzso therapy, zzso zzso levels did not zzso zzso to zzso follow-up serum samples were available from 17 initially zzso zzso patients, of whom only 10 zzso were still zzso 

zzso infection is common among patients with chronic zzso B and C but has little effect on the short-term course of disease or response to zzso zzso zzso levels are suppressed but not eradicated by zzso and are unaffected by zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso occurs over time in a proportion of zzso
