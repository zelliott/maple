zzso translation initiation factor zzso is a key component in the regulation of zzso efficiency of zzso and its increased expression may accelerate cell growth and zzso zzso has the potential to transform rat zzso zzso cells by cooperation with zzso or zzso zzso Our previous study showed that a variety of tumor cells examined exhibited elevated levels of zzso gene zzso Thus it is thought that zzso of zzso can result in zzso growth and cell zzso 

To characterize rat zzso a clone containing rat zzso zzso was isolated from a rat zzso zzso library by screening with a synthetic probe prepared by the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso sequences between mouse and human zzso zzso two zzso zzso for zzso were zzso zzso The cloned zzso was zzso and used as a probe for analysis of the expression level of zzso zzso in normal, differentiated rat zzso by Northern zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso as a probe was carried out to identify the zzso sites in rat zzso In addition, to zzso the zzso level of zzso the proteins were zzso from rat zzso by affinity column zzso followed by zzso focusing zzso zzso 

The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is highly zzso in human, zzso and zzso zzso elevated zzso more than zzso compared with that in the adult rat zzso of zzso was observed in zzso germ cells of rats of zzso age, which was much greater than that in any tumor cell lines examined so zzso The amount of zzso zzso from the adult rat zzso was approximately 10 times higher than that from the adult rat zzso At least half of the zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso a ratio similar to that in other rat zzso such as zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that elevated expression of zzso zzso was mainly observed in zzso germ zzso 

Full activity of zzso in translation requires the zzso of the protein on a specific zzso zzso Thus the elevated level of zzso observed in the adult rat zzso should be reflected in increase of the functional activity of zzso Based on the results of in zzso zzso analysis and characterization of zzso it was concluded that abundant zzso in the zzso may play an important role in zzso through zzso regulation of zzso zzso during germ cell zzso
