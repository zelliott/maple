The currently understood function for Ras in signal zzso is in zzso the transmission of signals from external growth factors to the cell zzso zzso forms of this zzso protein are found in zzso of human zzso with particularly high prevalence in colon and pancreatic zzso These zzso destroy the zzso activity of Ras and cause the protein to be locked in its active, zzso bound zzso As a result, the signaling pathways are zzso leading to uncontrolled tumor zzso Ras function in signaling requires its association with the plasma zzso This is achieved by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso present as part of the zzso zzso terminal zzso of all Ras zzso The zzso that recognizes and zzso the zzso zzso Ras zzso zzso has become an important target for the design of zzso that might be interesting as zzso zzso Several approaches have been taken in the search for in zzso active zzso of zzso These include the identification of natural products such as the zzso and zzso acids that mimic zzso zzso transition state zzso combining elements of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso that reproduce features of the zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso This last group of compounds has been most successful in showing highly potent zzso of zzso and selective blocking of Ras processing in a range of Ras transformed tumor cell lines at zzso as low as 10 zzso Certain zzso will also block tumor growth in various mouse models, with apparently few toxic side zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso hold considerable promise as zzso drugs in the zzso
