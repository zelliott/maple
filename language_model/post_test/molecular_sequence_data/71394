Previous observations have indicated that the zzso zzso gene for A3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes might make use of similar mechanisms for regulation of gene zzso To examine the suggested similarities, we have analyzed the expression of a zzso reporter zzso construct containing the zzso and 3' regulatory regions and the first zzso of the A3 zzso gene in a variety of zzso cell zzso We found that this zzso expression cassette could drive expression of foreign genes in both zzso and avian cell zzso zzso analysis, however, indicated that neither the zzso box nor any of the promoter elements previously identified in the A3 zzso gene were required for expression in zzso zzso On the other hand, the first zzso contained an efficient promoter, exhibiting in mouse cells a zzso activity comparable to that of the zzso early zzso The first zzso of the A3 gene was also found to contain zzso DNA elements that could stimulate the zzso zzso early promoter in zzso zzso zzso activity of the first zzso of the A3 zzso gene has not been observed zzso Recently however, we described a rare A3 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, which zzso within the first zzso We suggest that the identified zzso promoter may be active not only in zzso cells but also in zzso and that it regulates the synthesis of the alternative A3 zzso zzso zzso The characteristics of the zzso regulatory region of the A3 gene described here can also be exploited in the construction of zzso zzso expression zzso
