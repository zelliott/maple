A total of zzso consecutive clinical zzso coli zzso irrespective of resistance background, were collected in the period zzso in zzso southern China, to investigate the prevalence of zzso zzso resistance zzso The dominant zzso gene was zzso followed by zzso whereas zzso was zzso A total of zzso zzso of these zzso were zzso zzso zzso of these zzso were zzso and 42 zzso found to harbor zzso 18 to harbor new zzso zzso and 74 to harbor zzso zzso The genes zzso zzso and zzso were found in 2 zzso 6 zzso and 14 zzso of zzso zzso respectively, with 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowed us to identify zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 20 zzso zzso with zzso being the most prevalent zzso The genes zzso and zzso were not found in any zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were susceptible to zzso zzso genes are therefore present in both zzso and zzso zzso and can also be transferred by zzso experiments, thus suggesting a likely future increase in zzso zzso
