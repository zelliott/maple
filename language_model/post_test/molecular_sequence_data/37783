The objectives of this study were zzso zzso assess zzso of donor plasma proteins following zzso zzso zzso identify potential zzso and zzso consider the implications of zzso formation against these plasma proteins in zzso zzso We studied liver and heart zzso in a zzso zzso zzso to zzso All zzso were examined at zzso for evidence of rat zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso were placed in recipients who had, or had not, been zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were placed in zzso recipients to see if zzso to zzso serum proteins could be zzso from the rejecting zzso zzso of zzso rats were examined for the presence of zzso zzso by zzso and by Western zzso following sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso separation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso rats were compared with those zzso from rejecting zzso zzso zzso were identified by tandem mass zzso sequence analysis, and reference to protein zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso rats recognized a minimum of four different zzso in zzso serum by zzso and a minimum of seven by the more sensitive zzso Western zzso zzso zzso from rejecting zzso bound three of seven candidate zzso recognized by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis searches revealed zzso zzso in each of the three zzso bands common to the above zzso All of these candidate zzso inhibitor zzso share a common zzso fate, zzso via the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso serum proteins hastened cardiac zzso rejection in zzso of recipients zzso on zzso zzso zzso deposition of rat zzso occurred in all rejecting zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso could disturb their functional activity and contribute to the zzso of delayed zzso zzso
