Gene expression is a coordinated zzso process that begins with zzso and zzso processing in the nucleus followed by zzso export to the zzso for zzso Here we report the identification of a zzso zzso which functions in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear protein with a concentration at the nuclear zzso zzso analyses show that zzso interacts with zzso a large zzso zzso zzso complex involved in zzso zzso and with the zzso complex, which functions in zzso export with specific nuclear pore proteins at the nuclear zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed that zzso is required for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso showed that zzso is associated with the promoter of a zzso gene during zzso zzso Finally, zzso export is impaired in zzso zzso These data provide an unexpected connection between the zzso zzso zzso complex and the zzso export zzso
