zzso zzso responses were analyzed in B10 cells, a zzso population of rat brain zzso zzso zzso zzso B10 cells lack zzso receptors as evidenced by the lack of zzso responses and the failure to amplify zzso sequences by zzso chain zzso zzso B10 cells responded to zzso zzso by large increases in zzso Half maximum effective zzso were zzso 180 zzso zzso zzso 310 zzso zzso zzso 330 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The maximum response to zzso was only zzso of that to zzso while that to zzso derivatives was zzso zzso The actions of zzso zzso were not associated with a measurable zzso of zzso zzso zzso Cross zzso of the actions of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso its action on top of that of zzso and zzso partially inhibited the action of zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso acts as a partial zzso of the zzso zzso of brain zzso zzso zzso
