zzso analysis by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso together with mass zzso was applied to screen acute phase response zzso proteins with low molecular weight in zzso skin following zzso Furthermore, Western zzso and function tests were applied to confirm the results obtained from the zzso zzso Fifteen zzso proteins with zzso spots zzso with two zzso on a zzso map were identified in this zzso Furthermore, six were known acute phase proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso and 50s zzso zzso while zzso zzso zinc finger protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator of zzso 4, zzso and zzso zzso were found by our lab to be zzso zzso In addition, our results suggest that zzso with low molecular weight can be characterized by zzso with a zzso system followed by mass zzso
