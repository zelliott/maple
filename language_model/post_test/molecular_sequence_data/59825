We have identified a novel zzso zzso degenerative zzso zzso that may be required for the initiation of zzso in zzso In des zzso zzso the primary zzso become mature in size but zzso without initiating zzso zzso zzso in their zzso We have mapped the locus of the des gene at zzso on the left arm of the second zzso and identified two zzso zzso spliced transcripts zzso zzso from the zzso The zzso DNA zzso zzso both transcripts is able to rescue the des zzso when introduced into zzso zzso The expression of the zzso transcript is significantly suppressed in the des zzso zzso whereas expression of the zzso transcript is zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso transcript encodes the des function in zzso The zzso transcript is selectively expressed in primary zzso during normal zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso transcript predicts that it encodes a novel zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that the des gene product may be required for interactions between primary zzso and surrounding zzso zzso
