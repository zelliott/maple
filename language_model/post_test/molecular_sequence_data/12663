zzso zzso and the zzso zzso proteins together establish zzso identities by zzso regulating the expression of downstream target zzso The inappropriate expression of these targets in zzso zzso zzso results in zzso transformations and zzso zzso Here we examine the role of zzso in adult development by using genetic mosaics and a zzso zzso zzso caused by a point zzso in the zzso zzso continues to be essential for the zzso of zzso zzso consistent with a continuing requirement for zzso as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso results in the zzso transformation of abdominal segments to an A5 or A6 zzso identity, the antenna and zzso to leg, and the head capsule to zzso zzso or zzso zzso leg structures are particularly sensitive to the loss of zzso although zzso does not affect the allocation of zzso zzso values of the leg zzso zzso Using zzso to induce expression of a zzso fusion zzso we show that, in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso zzso high levels of zzso expression do not cause pattern abnormalities or zzso zzso
