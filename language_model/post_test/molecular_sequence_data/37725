The newly described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked with fish kills in field and laboratory settings, and with a novel clinical syndrome of impaired zzso and memory zzso among humans after zzso toxin zzso As a result, there is a pressing need to better characterize the zzso and these zzso Advances in zzso research have been zzso however, by the absence of zzso sequence zzso We employed a sequencing strategy directed by zzso mobility zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences in complex pools of DNA and used those data as the basis for determination of the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso were developed, permitting their detection in zzso cultures and in zzso water samples collected during fish kill and fish zzso zzso These tools should enhance efforts to characterize these organisms and their ecological zzso zzso mobility zzso sequence discovery is broadly zzso and may be adapted for the detection of zzso sequence data of other novel or zzso organisms in complex zzso
