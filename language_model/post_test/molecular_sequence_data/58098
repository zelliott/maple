The liver of mice contains elevated percentages of gamma delta T cells when compared with peripheral zzso zzso We have now analyzed these cells zzso by generating a random collection of liver gamma delta T cell zzso and sequencing the zzso rearranged zzso and zzso genes in each zzso zzso zzso zzso mice of various ages, we have found that over half of their normal gamma delta T cells are one of two types, V delta zzso or V delta zzso gamma delta T cell zzso generated from mouse liver contain clones that are zzso zzso and respond to zzso protein zzso from zzso and to a zzso acid zzso from zzso heat shock zzso zzso Like similar cells found in newborn zzso or adult zzso all of the cells showing this zzso zzso pattern were found to express V gamma zzso gamma zzso gamma 4, most in conjunction with V delta zzso delta zzso zzso particularly with V delta zzso However, the gamma and delta zzso sequences of the V gamma zzso delta zzso cells isolated from adult liver differed from those found in adult zzso being less diverse, their receptors instead resemble those of similar cells from newborn zzso These data suggest that zzso gamma delta cells in adult zzso liver and zzso are independent of each other and may be resident in their respective zzso
