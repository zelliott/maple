The purpose of this study was to clarify whether there is a difference between the zzso frequency of human zzso zzso zzso in healthy Japanese people and that of Japanese couples with habitual zzso 

zzso 2, 3, 4, and zzso 4 of the zzso gene were analyzed in 20 couples with habitual abortion, using zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 of the zzso gene was also analyzed in 54 healthy zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso product of zzso 4 was further determined by direct zzso 

Two kinds of zzso sequence were identified in zzso 4 of the zzso zzso one of which was identical to that of zzso and the other was identical to that of zzso zzso and zzso The frequency of each zzso in affected women and their husbands did not significantly differ from that of healthy individuals, and no zzso was found in any affected zzso 

zzso zzso zzso seemed to have little, if any, implication in the zzso of habitual zzso
