A series of type O zzso disease zzso outbreaks occurred in China seriously affect development of Chinese zzso Its zzso zzso O zzso disease virus zzso has been evolved three zzso zzso Middle zzso Asia and Southeast Asia, specifically, the viruses of Cathay zzso are highly adapted to zzso representing the biggest threat on Chinese pig zzso The available zzso vaccine in China provides insufficient protection against some arising viruses of zzso zzso which exert important obstacle to control zzso zzso zzso in zzso To develop vaccine candidate with characteristics of good zzso and broad zzso a full-length infectious zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso was constructed, which replaced part zzso and zzso gene of zzso strain with the corresponding to the zzso of Cathay zzso zzso replaced the zzso and zzso loop of structure protein zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso were zzso into zzso cells to rescue the zzso virus in zzso 

The zzso cells showed apparent zzso effects zzso after 36 h zzso The rescued virus was checked by zzso indirect zzso electron zzso zzso show that zzso zzso was successfully rescued in zzso The study of zzso mice zzso show zzso zzso has attenuated zzso for zzso mice compared with its parental zzso 

The construction of zzso zzso zzso will lay the basis for developing novel vaccine against zzso
