The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor A and B are zzso and multifunctional, consisting of 179 zzso acid zzso with three zzso zzso Both their primary structures and zzso sequences have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso 111, zzso zzso zzso zzso Tao, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso (in zzso Though they share zzso zzso they are different in zzso zzso zzso analysis of their full-length zzso showed that there are seven extra zzso in the zzso part which might be zzso off by zzso zzso To locate the zzso sites and study the zzso relationship of the two forms A and B, the genes coding for the mature inhibitor B and its extended form were respectively cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso strain zzso Both of the gene products were zzso and characterized to have the same zzso activities as the natural zzso The gene product of the extended form was a mixture with the extended zzso part of the inhibitor either completely or partially zzso The two previously predicted zzso site zzso zzso and zzso of inhibitor B, were then respectively zzso with Ala by zzso zzso and zzso As compared with the natural zzso each of the zzso could only inhibit one zzso instead of two molecules of zzso and displayed an zzso activity against zzso thus confirming the location of the two zzso sites in the zzso The gene coding for inhibitor A, which for some reason could not be expressed in zzso zzso was successfully expressed in the reconstructed zzso zzso in zzso coli strain zzso with the expressed product existing in the inclusion zzso After zzso and zzso the active inhibitor A was obtained and zzso by zzso affinity zzso Using zzso zzso two zzso of inhibitor A, zzso zzso and zzso prominently different from zzso and zzso in inhibitor B, were replaced by these two corresponding zzso zzso As compared with the natural inhibitor A, its zzso zzso showed a lower zzso activity toward zzso whereas a higher activity was found in the zzso zzso Meanwhile, both of their zzso zzso activities became weaker than the natural zzso The important zzso role of the zzso of position 87 in causing the difference in zzso properties between inhibitor A and B was zzso
