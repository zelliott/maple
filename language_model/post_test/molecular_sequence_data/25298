We established tobacco zzso cell lines from crown zzso induced by zzso zzso fragments containing zzso DNA junctions were cloned from one of the cell lines, which has a single copy of the zzso in a unique region of its zzso We also isolated a DNA zzso that contained the integration target site from zzso tobacco zzso zzso sequence analyses showed that the right and left zzso of the zzso mapped zzso zzso zzso internal to the right 25 zzso border and zzso 350 zzso internal to the left border zzso When the zzso sequences around these zzso were compared with the sequence of the target, significant zzso was seen between the region adjacent to the integration target site and both external regions of the zzso zzso In addition, a short stretch of plant DNA in the vicinity of the integration site was zzso This deletion seems to have been promoted by zzso zzso between short repeated sequences that were present on both sides of the deleted zzso Minor zzso which included base zzso insertions and zzso also took place around the integration site in the plant zzso These results, together with previously reported results showing that in some cases sequences zzso to those in zzso are present in plant DNA regions adjacent to left zzso zzso indicate that sequence zzso between the incoming zzso and the plant zzso DNA has an important function in zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
