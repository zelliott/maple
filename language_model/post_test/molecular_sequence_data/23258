zzso and binding of specific sites on DNA by proteins is central for many cellular functions such as transcription, zzso and zzso In the process of recognition, a protein rapidly searches for its specific site on a long DNA zzso and then strongly binds this zzso Here we aim to find a mechanism that can provide both a fast search zzso zzso and high stability of the specific zzso complex zzso zzso Earlier studies have suggested that rapid search involves sliding of the protein along the zzso Here we consider sliding as a one-dimensional diffusion in a zzso rough energy zzso We demonstrate that, despite the zzso zzso rapid search can be achieved if one-dimensional sliding is accompanied by three-dimensional zzso We estimate the range of the specific and zzso zzso energy required for rapid search and suggest experiments that can test our zzso We show that optimal search requires a protein to spend half of its time sliding along the DNA and the other half zzso in three zzso We also establish that, zzso realistic energy functions cannot provide both rapid search and strong binding of a rigid zzso To reconcile these two fundamental requirements we propose a zzso mechanism that involves the zzso of protein binding and partial protein zzso The proposed mechanism has several important biological implications for search in the presence of other proteins and zzso simultaneous search by several zzso zzso The proposed mechanism also provides a new framework for interpretation of experimental and structural data on zzso zzso
