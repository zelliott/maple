In this study, we describe the cloning of the mouse zzso of the orphan zzso zzso zzso a member of the nuclear zzso zzso from a mouse muscle zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of mouse zzso gamma zzso zzso is highly zzso to that of human zzso zzso with an overall identity of zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso from different zzso showed that zzso gamma was found to be highly expressed in skeletal muscle, liver and zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso element using in zzso zzso zzso gamma revealed that it binds as a zzso to response elements composed of a single core motif zzso preceded by a 6 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso specificity was further defined by zzso analysis of the consensus zzso zzso gamma was able to activate zzso zzso of the zzso reporter gene in mouse zzso D1 zzso zzso alpha 1 and zzso gamma inhibit the zzso induced by zzso gamma in zzso D1 cells suggesting that these receptors compete for binding to the same zzso
