zzso is an zzso responsible for the formation of the modified base zzso zzso found at position 8 in some zzso zzso This base acts as a sensitive trigger for the response mechanism to zzso exposure, providing protection against its damaging zzso We present the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso revealing an extended zzso architecture in which an zzso zzso domain zzso connects the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain with a zzso domain, an ancient predicted zzso domain that is widespread in all zzso of zzso We describe the structure of the zzso domain, which appears to be unrelated to zzso zzso of known zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso domain onto the zzso structure suggests that these zzso jointly form the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso L-shaped form of zzso and the existence of a zzso zzso joining the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso suggest that structural changes may occur in both molecules upon zzso
