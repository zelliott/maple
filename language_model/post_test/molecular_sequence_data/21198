The aims of this study were to investigate zzso diversity in the plateau lake and to explore the value of these zzso in such ecological zzso 

zzso were isolated from 9 water and 4 soil samples collected in zzso lake in Yunnan zzso The zzso were identified by using zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso domain sequence analysis and traditional zzso The ability of the zzso strains to produced various zzso was zzso 

In total 64 zzso strains were isolated, these strains were identified as 22 species in 8 zzso including 4 suspected new species or zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shared in the water and soil zzso Nine strains with zzso zzso activities were zzso One of them could produce both zzso and zzso 

The preliminary result showed the zzso of zzso in zzso lake and the application potential of the zzso zzso
