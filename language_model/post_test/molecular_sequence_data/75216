The sequences of two zzso from the zzso DNA of the zzso strain and one of the Y strain of zzso zzso are zzso These zzso zzso molecules have a peculiar sequence organization, the most distinctive feature being the occurrence of a 120 zzso sequence repeated four times, located at 0, 90, 180 and zzso degrees along each zzso We have termed these zzso regions in this species zzso zzso have a zzso higher concentration of zzso zzso in comparison with the variable regions and contain the universal zzso motif zzso present in all zzso zzso and which was shown to be involved in DNA zzso A consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso was determined using the 20 zzso present in five known zzso zzso zzso zzso This consensus sequence contains regions which have been remarkably well preserved in strains which show great biological zzso In addition a low level of zzso sequence similarity was also observed within the variable region, but this similarity did not extend between zzso The abundance of zzso zzso sequences containing zzso restriction sites in zzso zzso cells may prove valuable for the development of new direct diagnostic methods for zzso disease based on DNA probe zzso
