We report zzso of the water content and swelling of zzso films of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as a function of relative humidity zzso The water contents zzso of water molecules per base pair of zzso of these films are found to be quite similar, indicating that the identity of the zzso species is zzso for the water zzso Since the A to B transition for these zzso occurs at different zzso the corresponding water contents of the A to B transition are found to be quite zzso These films swell as a function of zzso in a very similar manner, zzso that the changes in the zzso bonds in the different zzso are zzso zzso changes are observed in the dimensions of the films above zzso zzso for all types of zzso Combining the water content and swelling zzso yields the dependence of the volume per base pair on water zzso The volume per base pair is observed to be a zzso function of water content, indicating zzso mixing of the water with the zzso
