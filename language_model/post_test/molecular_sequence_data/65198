DNA family zzso was used to create zzso zzso B proteins with improved activity toward the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and shuffled to generate a diverse gene zzso A zzso screening zzso was developed and used successfully to identify zzso zzso B proteins having a zzso higher activity toward zzso than zzso B from zzso zzso zzso and a zzso higher activity than the most active parent derived from zzso zzso zzso In addition, the stability characteristics of several highly active zzso proteins were also improved as a result of family zzso For example, the zzso at 45 degrees C and melting point zzso of one zzso exceeded those of zzso B from zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso degrees C, respectively, which closely approached the stability characteristics of the most zzso parent derived from zzso zzso CBS zzso
