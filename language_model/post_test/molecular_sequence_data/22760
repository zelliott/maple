To investigate the zzso activity and synergistic effect, zzso were designed to increase not only net positive charge by zzso but also zzso zzso region by zzso from CA zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso In particular, zzso analogue zzso zzso designed by flexible region zzso zzso zzso 4, 8, 14, zzso and zzso zzso 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17, zzso zzso showed potent zzso activity in minimal zzso concentration zzso and minimal zzso concentration zzso without having zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso has potent synergistic effect against tested cell zzso As determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso showed that zzso plus zzso cells had higher zzso intensity than zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effect on plasma membrane was examined by investigating the zzso potential zzso experiments of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The result showed that the zzso exerts its zzso activity by acting on the plasma zzso Furthermore, zzso caused significant zzso zzso of zzso zzso as shown by scanning electron zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is an excellent candidate as a lead compound for the development of novel zzso agents and synergistic effects with conventional zzso agents but lack zzso zzso
