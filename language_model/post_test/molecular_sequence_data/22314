zzso is known to be a zzso zzso zzso protein that has two zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso factor zzso protein zzso However, the zzso function of zzso is still not zzso Here we have shown that transient expression of zzso in zzso cells results in specific zzso of zzso and the zzso is inhibited by zzso of a dominant negative form of zzso We have also found that a zzso form of zzso that is unable to bind zzso fails to induce zzso zzso and that a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, transient zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso results in reduced zzso zzso after zzso growth factor stimulation in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso zzso in growth factor zzso linking the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso through its ability to interact with zzso
