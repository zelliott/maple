The major outer membrane zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an essential protein that mediates zzso exchange between the zzso and its environment and also plays multiple roles in human host zzso To facilitate zzso studies of zzso multiple roles, we performed zzso zzso at the zzso locus and used deep sequencing to identify essential versus zzso zzso Random zzso in zzso were generated in a zzso zzso and zzso gene pools were transformed into zzso zzso to select for zzso that maintained bacterial zzso Deep sequencing of the input zzso pools and the output zzso zzso zzso DNA pools identified zzso present in each, and the zzso in both pools were compared to determine which changes could be tolerated by the zzso We examined the zzso of zzso zzso acids in the mature zzso protein and found that 308 of them were likely to be zzso and that 20 zzso acids were likely to be zzso A subset of these predictions was validated zzso This approach to identifying essential zzso acids in a protein of interest introduces an additional application for next-generation sequencing technology and provides a template for future studies of both zzso and other essential bacterial zzso
