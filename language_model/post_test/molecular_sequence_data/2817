Five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of bovine zzso type 1 zzso were isolated by selection for resistance to the zzso analogue zzso The genetic zzso in zzso B1 was localized in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which maps between zzso and zzso within the zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso genes from zzso and the zzso B1 to B5 were cloned and zzso using eight unique synthetic zzso designed from a published zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence for the strain zzso contained some differences compared with that published previously for strain zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso with different zzso zzso revealed five strongly zzso regions and also identified putative functional relationships with other zzso Several interesting features were apparent in the zzso gene sequences from the zzso zzso The zzso zzso B1 was a typical zzso and chain termination zzso due to the deletion of a single zzso The zzso gene sequence of zzso B2 revealed the deletion of three bases resulting in the loss of zzso at zzso acid zzso 174 of the zzso zzso The zzso genes of zzso B3 to B5 contained an identical change of a single base addition resulting in zzso and premature chain zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the zzso zzso were incapable of zzso zzso zzso from zzso
