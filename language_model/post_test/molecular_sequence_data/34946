The zzso rhythm is originally generated by a zzso based zzso loop where zzso and zzso genes locate in its zzso In the rat brain, rhythmic expressions of zzso and zzso were observed not only in zzso of the zzso zzso nucleus zzso but also in those of zzso regions including the cerebral zzso The zzso zzso elements possible to regulate zzso of zzso and zzso genes were highly zzso in rats and zzso When zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso were zzso each of both proteins showed two molecular zzso The presence of these higher molecular weight forms seems to be correlated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso This mechanism might not be involved in the zzso zzso suppression of zzso since adding zzso did not change the content of the higher molecular forms of zzso and zzso
