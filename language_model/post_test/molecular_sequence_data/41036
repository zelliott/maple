Fundamental differences in the distribution of oceans and zzso in the Northern and Southern zzso potentially impact patterns of biological diversity in the two zzso The evolutionary history of zzso provides an opportunity to explore these zzso because the majority of extant conifer species belong to lineages that have been broadly confined to the Northern or Southern Hemisphere during the zzso zzso genetic information with a critical review of fossil evidence, we developed an zzso zzso sampling zzso of living conifer zzso Most extant conifer species zzso recently during the zzso within zzso that generally were established during the later zzso but lineages that diversified mainly in the Southern Hemisphere show a significantly older distribution of divergence ages than their counterparts in the Northern zzso Our tree zzso and divergence times also are best fit by diversification models in which Northern Hemisphere conifer lineages have higher rates of species turnover than Southern Hemisphere zzso The abundance of recent zzso in northern zzso may reflect complex patterns of migration and range shifts during zzso cycles over the later zzso leading to elevated rates of zzso and zzso whereas the scattered persistence of mild, zzso zzso in the Southern Hemisphere may have favored the survival of older zzso
