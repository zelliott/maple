As in many other zzso cells, cell division in zzso zzso depends on the assembly of an zzso ring that zzso the middle of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential gene necessary for zzso ring assembly and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso is a member of a family of proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are involved in zzso or other zzso zzso Using indirect zzso we show that zzso is located in the cell division ring and not in other zzso zzso When zzso zzso is located at a zzso spot in zzso that anticipates the future ring zzso zzso zzso is altered in zzso ring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit no specific zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit a zzso cortical zzso spot in place of a zzso zzso zzso cells generally exhibit a zzso spot with a single zzso strand extending in a random zzso Based on these patterns, we present a model in which ring assembly originates from a single point on the zzso and in which a molecular zzso for the functions of zzso proteins is zzso Finally, we found that zzso and zzso zzso show a zzso genetic interaction, and a zzso domain of zzso binds directly to zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that one function of zzso in ring assembly is to bind zzso
