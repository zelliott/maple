zzso zzso zzso zzso an integral component of the zzso basement membrane zone, serves as zzso in a blistering disease, zzso zzso In this study, we have generated zzso corresponding to human zzso zzso Two zzso a zzso zzso product zzso with human zzso zzso as template and a zzso zzso isolated from human zzso zzso zzso library, were zzso for zzso in zzso zzso to establish the zzso location of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso human peripheral blood zzso were examined by zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso were identified by zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that the human zzso gene is at locus zzso This conclusion was supported by zzso with a panel of human X zzso hybrid cell DNA, which indicated zzso with human zzso zzso Because different genes zzso human basement membrane components have been mapped previously to zzso other than 6, the results further indicate that human basement membrane zone genes are widely dispersed within the human zzso
