The zzso gene is expressed only during the early stages of zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso promoter region contains a functionally important binding site for members of the zzso family of zzso zzso We found that both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso bind efficiently to this site in zzso By contrast, zzso the zzso cellular zzso of zzso and the zzso more zzso expressed zzso protein zzso zzso with this binding zzso DNA binding by both zzso and zzso however, could be increased zzso to zzso by deleting as few as 16 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence is highly zzso between zzso and zzso but is not present in either zzso or zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso acids of zzso with those of zzso decreased DNA binding by zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcripts zzso proteins of different lengths suggested that zzso binds DNA as a zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain appears to interfere directly with DNA binding and not with zzso Finally, the functional relevance of zzso factor binding to the zzso promoter site was evidenced by the stimulation of zzso through this site by a zzso fusion zzso Together, these data suggest that one or more zzso family factors are involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
