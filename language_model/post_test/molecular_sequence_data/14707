During fetal development zzso zzso migrate across the entire body surface and differentiate into zzso the zzso zzso zzso in this precisely regulated process can lead to white spotting zzso White spotting patterns in horses are a complex trait with a large zzso zzso ranging from minimal white zzso up to completely white zzso The zzso zzso pattern is primarily characterized by an extremely large blaze, often accompanied by extended white zzso at the zzso limbs and blue zzso zzso but not all, splashed white horses are zzso We analyzed a Quarter zzso family segregating for the splashed white coat zzso zzso linkage analysis in 31 horses gave a positive zzso score of zzso in a region on zzso 6 containing the zzso zzso However, the linkage data were not in agreement with a zzso inheritance of a single fully zzso zzso We zzso the zzso gene and identified a zzso zzso in some, but not all, splashed white Quarter zzso zzso association analysis indicated a potential second signal near zzso We therefore zzso the zzso gene and found a 10 zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso promoter zzso was present in some splashed white Quarter zzso from the studied family, but also in splashed white horses from other horse zzso Finally, we identified two additional zzso zzso in the zzso gene in unrelated horses with white spotting zzso Thus, several independent zzso in zzso and zzso together with known zzso in the zzso and zzso genes explain a large proportion of horses with the more extreme white spotting zzso
