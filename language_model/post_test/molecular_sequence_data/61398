The branching coral zzso zzso one of the most abundant zzso zzso along the coasts of the Red Sea, has been used for many years as a model species for coral biological zzso Here we characterize the first coral heat shock protein 70 gene zzso cloned from zzso zzso to be used as a tool for studying coral stress zzso The cloning was carried out by a combination of zzso methods using zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso screening of a zzso zzso The zzso clone zzso zzso contains a complete 1953 zzso zzso open reading frame, and zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso boxes as well as 11 putative heat shock elements were identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso site was identified in the 3' zzso zzso zzso protein sequence resembles the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed zzso zzso expression in zzso grown within their normal zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso has been shown to belong to the coral zzso and not to its symbiotic algae one, as revealed by zzso zzso amplification, using zzso zzso and coral DNA zzso
