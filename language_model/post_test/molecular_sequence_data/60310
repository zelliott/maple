zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of 35 zzso per zzso which interacts specifically with zzso In this work, we compared different zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in their structure as zzso to purify the zzso zzso zzso From the zzso tested, zzso was the most potent inhibitor of the zzso activity and the better zzso for zzso zzso however, the use of zzso zzso from zzso represented the cheapest method to purify this zzso zzso zzso released from the zzso used as affinity zzso and those from different zzso were less zzso than parental zzso The zzso of the zzso is zzso moreover, this is the only example of a zzso isolated from this zzso to be a zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences with zzso activity for the zzso showed a different pattern in the zzso which confirms that zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso and, probably, distances among zzso zzso zzso
