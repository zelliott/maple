zzso dynamics play a critical role in regulating zzso zzso however, the molecular mechanism underlying this process is not well zzso We report here the identification and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Plants lacking zzso were hypersensitive to drought stress and exhibited reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso shares sequence similarity only with plant proteins and contains a previously undiscovered zzso binding zzso During zzso closure, zzso filaments switched from a zzso orientation in open zzso to a zzso orientation in closed zzso This switch took longer in zzso plants than in zzso plants and was correlated with the delay in zzso closure seen in zzso zzso in response to drought zzso Our results suggest that zzso is required for the precise regulation of zzso filament reorganization during zzso zzso
