In an effort to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso with potential for zzso zzso from mice zzso infected with zzso zzso were used to screen an zzso zzso zzso DNA expression zzso Among 17 zzso zzso several contained sequences that zzso a predicted zzso protein zzso Five overlapping zzso peptides zzso to zzso of approximately 40 zzso each were generated and zzso zzso zzso reacted with fragments zzso and zzso at zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, and reacted with an zzso zzso membrane extract at a dilution of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso from mice zzso infected with zzso zzso did not react with zzso and zzso zzso from mice naturally infected with zzso zzso but not zzso from mice naturally infected with zzso zzso reacted with zzso and zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso and with a zzso band in zzso zzso zzso but did not react with a protein of the same size on zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso or unrelated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso amplified DNA from zzso zzso and all five primer sets amplified DNA from zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that may have potential for use in zzso
