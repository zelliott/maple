To improve zzso structure predictions of more difficult targets, the next generation of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso incorporates more accurate zzso contact restraint predictions from a new approach, the zzso method, based on consensus restraints generated by an improved zzso algorithm, zzso which uses zzso evolved and zzso template sequences as zzso zzso was tested on a zzso benchmark set of zzso zzso single domain proteins zzso or zzso zzso that cover the zzso Data Bank at zzso zzso sequence zzso Compared with the average fraction of accurately predicted zzso contacts of zzso using zzso with zzso template zzso the average accuracy of the zzso method increases to zzso The resulting zzso models are closer to their native structures, with an average root zzso zzso of zzso A compared to the zzso A result of zzso Defining a successful prediction as a model with a root zzso zzso to native zzso A, the success rate of zzso zzso for zzso targets zzso with good zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the Hard targets zzso zzso For Easy targets zzso zzso the success rate slightly increases from zzso to zzso
