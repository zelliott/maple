Many zzso peptides form zzso when bound to a zzso In addition, around zzso of zzso in zzso proteins are found in zzso zzso The orientation and location of such zzso peptides and proteins in the membrane are key factors determining their function and zzso Here we present a new solution state zzso method for obtaining the orientation of zzso peptides in a zzso environment zzso without any chemical zzso of the zzso zzso By monitoring zzso zzso relaxation rates upon addition of the freely zzso and zzso zzso probe zzso to an zzso zzso a wavelike pattern with a zzso of zzso zzso per turn is zzso The tilt and zzso zzso angle of the zzso determine the shape of this zzso relaxation wave and can be obtained by zzso fitting of measured relaxation zzso zzso are presented for the zzso zzso zzso zzso which forms an zzso zzso almost parallel to the surface of the zzso Thus, a few fast experiments enable the identification of zzso regions and determination of the zzso orientation within the zzso without the need for zzso zzso zzso zzso or sophisticated zzso This approach opens a path toward the zzso determination of zzso zzso without the need for a complete zzso structure zzso
