The zzso gene zzso which encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a useful diagnostic marker because it occurs only in invasive strains of this zzso A zzso gene also occurs in some strains of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso genes from two different strains of zzso zzso and from zzso zzso revealed a substantial number of zzso at the 3' ends of the zzso genes of the so-called American and European zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, several zzso and a deletion of 5 zzso were found in the zzso of zzso zzso These findings were used to develop a zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso which yielded a zzso product in as little as 50 zzso The zzso was zzso specific in terms of its ability to identify potentially zzso strains of zzso zzso regardless of zzso or zzso The zzso yielded an zzso that was visible on zzso gel zzso from as few as 100 zzso or 10 zzso when the zzso was combined with dot zzso zzso with a zzso zzso probe that corresponded to an internal sequence of zzso These results establish the value of the zzso gene as a target for the identification of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the usefulness of zzso for this zzso
