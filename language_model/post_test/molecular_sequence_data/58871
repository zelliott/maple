zzso factors constitute a family of zzso regulatory proteins expressed with distinct zzso and zzso profiles and thought to regulate zzso programs of gene zzso Here we describe the molecular zzso zzso location, and zzso of the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a predicted zzso zzso which is highly zzso among zzso and includes the two adjacent zzso zzso characteristic of the zzso factor zzso zzso maps to human zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The gene is transcribed in a pattern overlapping that of zzso zzso for both of these genes are prominent in heart, zzso and zzso but only zzso zzso is found in lung and zzso zzso transcripts are also detected in cultures of human and rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso In zzso zzso transcripts are zzso regulated when zzso cultures are zzso to zzso in response to zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is subject to both zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso is a prime candidate for a gene that might regulate the zzso state of zzso
