The study of human zzso replication has been hampered by the lack of an in zzso system which reliably supports virus zzso Recent results from the bovine zzso zzso system indicate that the E1 and zzso proteins are the only viral gene products required for zzso By zzso with zzso virus 40 large T zzso E1 is thought to possess zzso and zzso activity, which may play a direct role in viral DNA zzso The precise role of zzso is zzso but it may function in part to help zzso E1 to the replication zzso We have initiated a study of replication in the human zzso type 11 system which, by zzso to zzso has focused on the E1 and zzso proteins of this zzso We have expressed the full-length E1 and zzso proteins in zzso insect cells by using a zzso expression zzso Both the zzso E1 protein and the zzso zzso protein are nuclear zzso The E1 and zzso proteins form a zzso complex within the insect cells, and both proteins zzso to a DNA zzso which contains the viral origin of zzso In addition, we have detected an zzso zzso and zzso activity, which is likely part of an zzso system for the zzso activity which is predicted for this zzso The human zzso type 11 E1 and zzso proteins possess the same zzso activities exhibited by the corresponding zzso zzso suggesting that the replication activities of these viruses are tightly zzso
