zzso a process involving the zzso and joining of two separate zzso can expand the zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso are increasingly described in zzso The widespread presence of zzso resistance genes in natural environments and human zzso is becoming an important challenge for public zzso Certain zzso resistance zzso such as zzso resistance gene zzso are frequently used in zzso zzso Until now, zzso involving zzso zzso zzso transcripts and zzso cellular zzso has not been zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a key zzso involved in cellular cholesterol zzso The zzso human zzso zzso zzso can produce zzso and zzso zzso with different zzso zzso Here, we show that human zzso zzso zzso is produced from an zzso species generated through the zzso of an zzso transcript zzso by the zzso strand of zzso zzso present in common zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is presumably processed through a prior event of zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments containing the zzso with an upstream zzso cryptic promoter and the corresponding zzso zzso transcripts have been detected in human zzso Our findings shed lights on the mechanism of human zzso zzso zzso production, reveal an zzso zzso system, in which zzso zzso zzso transcripts are linked with zzso cellular zzso in human cells, and suggest that zzso DNA might affect human gene expression at both DNA and zzso zzso
