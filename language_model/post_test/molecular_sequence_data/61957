zzso with human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso results in adult zzso leukemia and zzso zzso zzso zzso Tax, a zzso zzso regulates viral and cellular transcription, host signal zzso the cell cycle, and zzso Tax has been shown to zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso however, to date, its role in binding to various host cellular proteins involved in zzso has not been fully zzso In this study, we describe the zzso proteins and their functions in cells using several zzso Tax zzso from a zzso column mostly at an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso Following Tax zzso washes with high salt zzso two-dimensional gel zzso and mass zzso analysis, a total of 32 proteins was zzso Many of these proteins belong to the signal zzso and zzso pathways and zzso zzso A few of these zzso including zzso have been shown previously to bind to zzso The interaction of Tax with small zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicates how Tax may regulate migration, invasion, and zzso in zzso zzso Finally, the physical and functional association of Tax with the zzso zzso zzso complex was assessed using in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso cells, and zzso interference zzso zzso Tax is able to bind and regulate many cellular proteins that regulate zzso and zzso related zzso which might explain the zzso effects of Tax leading to zzso transformation and leukemia in zzso zzso
