To identify the bacterial and zzso composition in a zzso zzso zzso treating pig zzso and to compare the consistency of two zzso zzso methods to investigate the microbial zzso 

zzso bacterial operational zzso units zzso and 25 zzso zzso were identified by sequencing two zzso zzso clone zzso Most bacterial zzso were identified as zzso of zzso zzso of total zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were the dominant zzso Only zzso of bacterial and zzso of zzso zzso matched cultured zzso at a similarity index of zzso About zzso of the dominant bacterial (with abundance zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were recovered from the zzso zzso gel zzso zzso bands of zzso regions in zzso zzso 

In the zzso most bacterial and zzso species were zzso bacteria belonging to zzso zzso and zzso seem to take charge of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the most zzso were typical zzso or zzso zzso profiles reflected the dominant zzso 

This study gave a first insight of the overall microbial structure in a rural zzso zzso and also indicated zzso was useful in displaying its dominant zzso
