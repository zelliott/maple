We applied, for the first time, next-generation sequencing zzso technology on Egyptian zzso Seven zzso zzso obtained from five randomly selected Third Intermediate to zzso Egyptian zzso zzso zzso and two unearthed zzso zzso zzso skeletons were generated and zzso The zzso were contrasted to three recently published zzso zzso obtained from zzso regions, zzso the zzso the zzso zzso and the Alpine zzso Analysis was done using one million reads of each newly generated or published zzso zzso and zzso results were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso results were zzso by specific and sensitive zzso chain reaction zzso protocols in ancient DNA dedicated zzso Here, we provide zzso identification of authentic DNA in Egyptian zzso The zzso zzso showed variable contents of zzso DNA zzso in zzso Three of five zzso displayed a human DNA proportion comparable to the human read count of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso signature unique to zzso was zzso By applying a zzso zzso discrimination among zzso and other remains from warm areas outside Egypt was zzso Due to the absence of an adequate environment monitoring, a bacterial bloom was identified when zzso different zzso from the same zzso taken after a zzso of time of zzso zzso Plant kingdom representation in all zzso zzso was unique and could be partially associated with their use in zzso zzso Finally, zzso data showed the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso indicating malaria and zzso in these zzso We demonstrate that zzso ancient DNA can be extracted from zzso and serve as a proper template for the zzso technique, thus, opening new pathways of investigation for future zzso sequencing of ancient Egyptian zzso
