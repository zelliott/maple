An apparently unique protein produced in large quantities by the zzso of the zzso which zzso to, or is incorporated into, the zzso capsule that surrounds the zzso zzso in early pregnancy, has been characterized and partially zzso It has a molecular mass of approximately 18 zzso on zzso gels and is zzso as assessed by a sensitive zzso detection zzso zzso of its first 24 zzso zzso acids with all entries in the databases failed to show any significant identity with any other protein zzso zzso of the protein appears to be zzso dependent, as its presence in zzso zzso zzso with peripheral serum zzso profiles during the zzso cycle and its zzso can be induced in zzso zzso by administration of a synthetic zzso However, in pregnant zzso the protein disappears from the zzso after about day 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso despite the persistence of high serum zzso of zzso indicating that additional mechanisms control its synthesis and zzso The strong association of the protein with the zzso capsule that surrounds the zzso zzso suggests that it may be incorporated into the capsule as the capsule expands from day 11 after zzso zzso or zzso it may be involved in the transport of nutrients or other substances through the zzso and may therefore play an important role in the maintenance of zzso
