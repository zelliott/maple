zzso and zzso are zzso for two zzso zzso coli genes whose products function in the synthesis and degradation of zzso zzso during the stringent regulatory response to zzso acid zzso The zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso group transfer reaction, and the zzso protein has a zzso zzso zzso zzso Both genes have been zzso zzso the zzso gene produces an zzso zzso and the zzso gene is deduced to zzso a zzso zzso We report here that the protein sequences of the zzso and zzso genes are extensively zzso
