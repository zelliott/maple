Full length zzso zzso zzso coding for an avian liver zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso The zzso isolation relied on zzso to a zzso zzso coding for a portion of the active site of zzso zzso The identity of the avian liver zzso was confirmed by comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence with zzso determined protein sequence data generated upon isolation and analysis of several zzso zzso peptides prepared from the zzso zzso avian liver zzso zzso comparisons with the zzso zzso also support this zzso In liver, two distinct forms of zzso zzso exist to support zzso and zzso zzso although this latter zzso accounts for most of the zzso zzso In order to determine which zzso is zzso by the isolated avian liver zzso the deduced zzso acid zzso protein zzso and zzso have been compared with the corresponding protein chemistry data that were zzso determined using the zzso zzso zzso of these comparisons zzso indicate that the zzso encodes the avian liver zzso zzso zzso differences between deduced and zzso determined sequence data rule out the possibility that differential zzso of a primary transcript derived from one gene can account for both zzso
