A molecular dynamics calculation of the zzso acid polar requirement is used to score the zzso genetic zzso zzso Carlo simulation shows that this zzso polar requirement has been zzso by the zzso genetic code, an order of magnitude more than any previously known measure, effectively ruling out a vertical evolution zzso The sensitivity of the zzso to the precise metric used in code scoring is consistent with code evolution having proceeded through the communal dynamics of statistical proteins using horizontal gene transfer, as recently zzso The extreme zzso of the genetic code therefore strongly supports the idea that the genetic code evolved from a communal state of life prior to the last universal common zzso
