zzso a protein involved in sea zzso zzso recognition and zzso is under positive selection in zzso with zzso species but zzso zzso in zzso in which all species are zzso This pattern has led to suggestions that reinforcement may be the source of the observed zzso zzso character zzso or increased divergence of zzso characters in areas where closely related species zzso is often a consequence of reinforcement and has been shown to be present in one zzso species of the zzso zzso In the Atlantic species of the same zzso positive selection has been shown to act on zzso of zzso zzso To examine whether the source of this selection is zzso we determined variation on the first zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in the Caribbean, where it is zzso with zzso zzso and in the rest of the Atlantic, where zzso zzso is zzso There was no differentiation between zzso sequences from the two geographic zzso similar levels of positive selection were found to be acting in both zzso The similarities were not due to gene zzso zzso DNA from the two regions indicates that zzso zzso populations most likely originated in the Atlantic and have not exchanged genes with Caribbean populations for approximately 200,000 zzso The lack of evidence of stronger selection on zzso of zzso zzso in areas of zzso with its sister species suggests that the source of selection is not zzso zzso acting within species, such as sexual selection, zzso competition, or sexual conflict, are more likely to be involved in the evolution of this zzso
