zzso leukemia virus zzso is silent in most cells zzso in zzso and the repression of its expression allows zzso to evade the zzso immune zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso zzso of DNA might be involved in the regulation of the expression of zzso in zzso To investigate the effects of zzso zzso on the activity of the long terminal repeat zzso of zzso we measured the zzso activity of this region after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso reporter zzso The activity of zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso we examined the extent of zzso zzso of the zzso region and part of the R region of the zzso in zzso cattle and in zzso zzso sheep at various clinical stages by the zzso zzso sequencing zzso We detected no or minimal zzso zzso at all stages examined in cattle and zzso and our results indicate that zzso zzso probably does not participate in the zzso of zzso in zzso
