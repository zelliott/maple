zzso is a highly zzso 76 zzso acid protein that is generated in the cell by zzso of larger proteins containing either zzso chains or zzso fused to zzso extension proteins zzso In humans, the two human zzso genes are zzso and zzso which code for zzso fused to zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Working from a recently generated physical map of human zzso zzso we determined the genetic and physical location and the zzso structure of the zzso gene in its zzso A comparison of zzso to zzso revealed that the two genes share a zzso zzso structure, but that the structure of the zzso coding regions was not zzso Analysis of 400 zzso of the promoter of zzso revealed strong similarity not only to the zzso promoter, but also to the other known human zzso gene promoters that have been identified to zzso zzso searches also detected the presence of a zzso for zzso and the structure of this sequence feature is also zzso
