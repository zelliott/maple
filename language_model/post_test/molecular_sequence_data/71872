The zzso system of zzso zzso mediates resistance to zzso zzso and cadmium through zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing of the region upstream of the zzso zzso located on zzso zzso revealed the zzso end of zzso and a gene for a zzso protein which is transcribed in the orientation opposite that of zzso Additional open reading frames upstream of zzso had no zzso in the current zzso Using zzso Northern zzso experiments, a zzso zzso message and a zzso zzso message were found, and the presence of 6, zzso zzso message zzso Van der zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed a similar zzso zzso was induced best by 300 zzso zzso less by 300 zzso zzso and only slightly by 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso gave evidence for additional continuous zzso from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso but not between zzso and zzso nor between zzso and a zzso open reading frame following zzso The zzso putative response regulator was zzso and shown to bind in the zzso region of zzso A reporter strain carrying a zzso zzso on zzso zzso was constructed, as were zzso and zzso zzso of this strain and of zzso wild zzso zzso on zzso growth of these strains in liquid culture containing 5 zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso in the reporter strains by zzso zzso and cadmium, and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso synthesis under inducing and zzso conditions showed that the zzso zzso regulatory system is involved in zzso zzso
