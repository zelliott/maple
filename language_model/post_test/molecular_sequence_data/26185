Single satellite DNA constitutes about 50% of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 142 base pair long satellite zzso on zzso zzso gel shows retarded mobility, a characteristic of fragments with zzso DNA zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso satellite zzso revealed the existence of 2 bend centers in the zzso zzso We calculated the trajectory of DNA zzso axis according to the zzso of De zzso et zzso This model predicts that T zzso naked satellite DNA forms a zzso structure with left-handed zzso One turn of the zzso has approximately 310 base pairs and a 33 zzso zzso Point zzso found in the satellite DNA zzso influence zzso zzso but do not distort the general geometry of satellite zzso
