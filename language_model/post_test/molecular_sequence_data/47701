We have identified zzso and zzso clones zzso a zzso of pancreatic zzso termed zzso as a candidate protein involved in the zzso penetration of the egg zzso zzso in zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicates that zzso is zzso identical to pancreatic zzso Analysis of Northern zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction reveals that the mouse zzso gene is zzso expressed in all zzso tested, including the zzso and zzso and the transcript is present in the zzso stages of male germ zzso Moreover, zzso analysis of mouse zzso zzso zzso using an zzso zzso against bovine pancreatic zzso shows that zzso is localized only in the zzso zzso and is released during the zzso reaction induced by calcium zzso zzso These findings may open a new point of view regarding the molecular mechanisms of the zzso zzso including the zzso penetration of the egg zzso zzso
