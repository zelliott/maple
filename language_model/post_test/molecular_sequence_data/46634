zzso have acquired photosynthesis through secondary zzso they have engulfed and retained a zzso zzso The remnants of this zzso zzso are severely reduced, but a small volume of zzso surrounding the zzso zzso along with a residual nucleus (the zzso that encodes only a few hundred zzso We characterized zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso Despite the apparent absence of zzso in the zzso we recovered genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The presence of zzso genes in the zzso indicates that some component of the zzso is still present in the zzso zzso despite the fact that very little zzso remains, no zzso is known in the zzso and zzso have never been observed anywhere in the zzso zzso analyses with zzso zzso and zzso support the origin of the zzso zzso from a red zzso We also characterized alpha and zzso from the host nucleus of zzso zzso and compared these with zzso we isolated from two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously proposed to be related to the zzso zzso zzso analyses support a relationship between the zzso host and zzso but do not support any relationship between zzso and zzso
