zzso are a diverse family that zzso a fusion zzso protein to enter cells via fusion of the viral zzso zzso with a target cell zzso Although certain regions of the F protein are known to play critical roles in membrane fusion, the function of much of the protein remains zzso zzso alignment of a set of zzso F proteins and analysis utilizing Block Maker identified a region of zzso zzso acid sequence in a large domain between the zzso repeats of zzso designated zzso We employed zzso zzso to analyze the function of completely zzso zzso of zzso in both the zzso virus 5 zzso and zzso virus F zzso The majority of zzso point zzso were deficient in zzso formation, zzso processing, and transport to the cell zzso For some zzso F zzso zzso zzso and surface expression could be restored by expression at 30 degrees C, and varying levels of fusion promotion were observed at this zzso In addition, the zzso zzso F zzso displayed a zzso zzso at both 30 and 37 degrees C, indicating that this zzso allows for efficient fusion with only an extremely small amount of zzso active zzso The recently published zzso structure of zzso F zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso indicates that zzso within and zzso zzso interact with the fusion zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso zzso interactions are critical for the initial folding of zzso F proteins from this important viral family and can also zzso subsequent membrane fusion zzso
