We have recently screened 112 separate zzso of the zzso zzso collected from neutral and alkaline hot water springs on four continents, for the presence of the zzso restriction zzso zzso I zzso One particular isolate from the zzso zzso zzso was found to contain high levels of a restriction zzso with the same recognition and zzso site as zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the partially zzso zzso from strain 32 was considerably more resistant to heat zzso than the zzso zzso zzso I, being able to withstand temperatures at least 10 degrees C higher than zzso I, before showing evidence of heat zzso zzso it became clear that the partially zzso extract from strain 32 contains two separate zzso both of which are zzso of zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso I, has similar zzso stability characteristics to zzso I, whereas the second zzso I zzso zzso II, found in the same zzso isolate as zzso I, is considerably more zzso than zzso I, retaining full zzso activity up to a temperature of 85 degrees zzso zzso I and zzso II were further distinguished by virtue of their different requirements for zzso zzso
