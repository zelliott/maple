The zzso in solution in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso with zzso of the linear zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso The temperature dependence of the chemical shift of the zzso of the zzso zzso suggested that the zzso group of zzso is involved in hydrogen zzso most probably to the zzso of the zzso which showed restricted zzso as indicated by the large chemical shift zzso for the zzso of the beta zzso zzso A zzso structure is proposed for the zzso zzso of zzso which is further supported by various zzso interactions involving the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
