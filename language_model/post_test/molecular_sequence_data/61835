We have previously found using zzso of protein zzso that zzso of zzso may be involved in zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso modification occurs in zzso zzso induced by a pathological condition in the absence of zzso zzso of cultured human zzso with growth medium for 24 h after exposure to saline solution for 30 zzso induced an increase in terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso cells and nuclear zzso zzso and zzso hallmarks of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso of the nuclear zzso fraction and zzso zzso analysis showed that the treatment with saline solution caused rapid changes in zzso of zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso The zzso of the two zzso increased zzso whereas the zzso of one zzso zzso In contrast, exposure to zzso an artificial zzso fluid zzso was associated with little induction of zzso cell death and induced less changes in zzso zzso These results support the previous idea that chemical modification of zzso is involved in the DNA fragmentation in zzso undergoing zzso
