A molecular basis for the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was investigated using synthetic zzso fragments covering the zzso domain of zzso S zzso zzso binding zzso showed no zzso binding of the rat zzso to zzso but the binding capacity was markedly increased by base substitution of zzso to A at the position corresponding to zzso of zzso coli 23 S zzso The association constant (K zzso for the rat A 1878 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso which was comparable with that of the zzso coli zzso (K alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso G 1878 zzso in the resistance for zzso On the other hand, the zzso fragments of the two species had a similar binding capacity for zzso coli zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under a high zzso condition, however, revealed a difference between the two zzso zzso coli zzso formed stable complexes with both the zzso coli zzso and the rat A 1878 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso while rat zzso failed to exhibit such complex zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso protein may also be an element giving the resistance for zzso These results are discussed in terms of preserved three-dimensional zzso of the zzso backbone between zzso and higher zzso
