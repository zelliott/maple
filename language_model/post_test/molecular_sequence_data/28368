We have zzso the zzso of the regions that zzso the zzso protein zzso of the zzso disease viruses zzso zzso and A zzso zzso acid sequences and secondary protein structures are zzso Both proteins consist of 212 zzso zzso The sequences and secondary structures are compared to those of zzso zzso a strain previously endemic in the Near zzso zzso zzso among the three sequences is highest for zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso for each other zzso Thirty zzso acid zzso are observed between zzso and A5 zzso or A zzso whereas the latter two differ by 27 zzso The secondary structures of all three proteins are zzso A zzso is considered to belong to a thus far unknown zzso
