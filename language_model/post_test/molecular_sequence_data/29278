It has been established that the precise positioning of zzso on zzso DNA can be zzso at least for a minority of them, through zzso zzso However, to what extent DNA sequences play a role in the positioning of the major part of zzso is still zzso The aim of the present study is to examine to what extent long-range correlations zzso are related to the presence of zzso Using the zzso transform technique, we perform a comparative analysis of the DNA text and of the corresponding zzso profiles generated with zzso tables based on zzso positioning zzso The exploration of a number of zzso and bacterial zzso through the zzso of the so-called zzso transform zzso reveals a characteristic scale of zzso zzso that separates two regimes of different zzso Here, we focus on the existence of zzso in the small-scale regime zzso zzso which are actually observed in zzso zzso in contrast to their absence in zzso zzso Analysis of viral DNA zzso shows that, like their zzso zzso zzso viruses present zzso but zzso viruses do zzso There is one exception for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which do not replicate in the cell nucleus and do not exhibit zzso No small-scale zzso are detected in the zzso of all examined zzso zzso with the exception of zzso These results together with the observation of zzso between particular sequence motifs known to participate in the formation of zzso zzso AA zzso strongly suggest that the zzso zzso zzso are a signature of the zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we discuss possible interpretations of these zzso in terms of the physical mechanisms that might govern the positioning and the dynamics of the zzso along the DNA chain through cooperative zzso
