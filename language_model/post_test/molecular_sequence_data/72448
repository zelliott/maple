To identify the bovine zzso protein zzso a search for the zzso zzso of human zzso was carried zzso zzso clones zzso bovine zzso were isolated from a bovine liver zzso library using a zzso zzso zzso a short collagen region, neck domain and zzso recognition domain of human zzso The zzso carried an insert of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with a signal zzso of 19 zzso The zzso protein fraction of bovine serum that zzso with 100 zzso zzso from a zzso column was analyzed under reducing conditions by zzso The major band of 33 zzso obtained reacted with zzso zzso rabbit zzso The partial zzso sequence of the zzso zzso protein was identical to the zzso sequence deduced from the obtained zzso zzso of the passive zzso experiment using sheep zzso coated with zzso zzso suggest that this zzso has the ability to activate zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a zzso zzso that was expressed only in the zzso Based on results of zzso analysis, this bovine zzso is likely to be a zzso of human zzso and to also have zzso to rat and mouse zzso which are localized in liver cells rather than to rat and mouse zzso found in zzso zzso of bovine zzso show that bovine zzso cannot be included among the other bovine zzso such as bovine zzso zzso and zzso Finally, these zzso and biological analyses indicate that the zzso obtained here zzso a bovine serum zzso
