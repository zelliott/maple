The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso zzso from the human malaria zzso zzso zzso is zzso The gene product is a zzso zzso acid protein that contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso found in zzso zzso and has the highest identity to a zzso zzso of unknown function from zzso zzso In zzso zzso to the zzso zzso detects a single band at zzso Northern analysis reveals only low levels of transcripts in larvae and zzso but more abundant zzso products occur in zzso Interestingly, this analysis also shows that adult males express much higher levels of zzso zzso than zzso In addition, zzso mosquitoes express higher levels of zzso zzso than susceptible mosquitoes although the biological significance of this remains to be zzso The zzso is the primary site for expression in the zzso The lack of a dramatic increase in zzso zzso levels following blood feeding suggests that this zzso is not involved in zzso zzso zzso induction does not follow cold zzso septic zzso bacterial injection, zzso injection or zzso zzso zzso
