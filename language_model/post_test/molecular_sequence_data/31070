We have isolated and characterized a human zzso zzso that is zzso to novel member zzso of the zzso channel zzso gene family expressed in rat zzso zzso zzso was detected predominantly in zzso areas and zzso The primary sequences of the zzso zzso channel proteins exhibit major differences to other members of the zzso gene zzso The bend region between segments zzso and zzso is unusually long and does not contain the zzso site commonly found in this zzso They might be zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso following zzso in in zzso transcribed zzso or zzso zzso showed that the zzso proteins form zzso zzso channels with novel functional and pharmacological zzso These channels are different to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
