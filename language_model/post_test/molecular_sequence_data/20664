The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso amplified and cloned with zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification obtained five products ranging from zzso to zzso zzso Three clones were obtained and zzso from all fragments with the exception of zzso zzso These products were designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contained genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso was almost the same as the zzso zzso but without zzso zzso contained zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso The number of copies of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso ranged from at least six to seven and zzso zzso had at least seven zzso The sequences zzso zzso and zzso showed a high similarity among the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences zzso to zzso Little variation was found for zzso which does not seem to be sufficient to distinguish these two closely related zzso Based on the findings, we confirm a close genetic relationship among zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that they may be descended from a common zzso in the zzso zzso
