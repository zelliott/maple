zzso of the zzso properties and structural information regarding the zzso acid zzso that comprise the active site of an zzso allows one, in principle, to use zzso zzso to construct genes that zzso zzso with altered zzso However, such information about most zzso is not known and the effects of specific zzso acid zzso are not generally zzso An alternative approach is to substitute random zzso for key zzso in a gene and to use genetic selection to identify new and interesting zzso zzso We describe here the construction, selection, and characterization of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso either with different zzso properties or with enhanced zzso From a library containing 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each with a different zzso sequence at the putative zzso binding site, we obtained zzso active zzso Using this library and one previously constructed, we identified by secondary selection zzso coli harboring zzso zzso zzso clones that were unable to grow in the presence of zzso of zzso zzso that permits colony formation by zzso coli harboring the zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso exhibited a reduced zzso for zzso one of which displayed a higher zzso efficiency for zzso over zzso relative to that of the wild zzso We also identified one zzso with enhanced zzso These zzso may have clinical potential as the promise of gene therapy is increasingly becoming a zzso
