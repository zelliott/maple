The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso also called the zzso or zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene by interacting with zzso or zzso response zzso This paper presents evidence that a metal zzso probably zzso is an essential zzso for the zzso zzso This paper also maps in detail the interactions between the zzso response element zzso and the zzso zzso from the rat zzso cell line zzso zzso were mapped by three methods, 1) zzso interference zzso 2) mobility shift competition experiments, using a series of synthetic zzso with systematic zzso in the zzso response element core zzso and 3) zzso zzso These findings suggest the following consensus sequence for DNA recognition by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso acid inhibited the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso in a concentration dependent manner, suggesting that the zzso activity of the zzso requires zzso metal zzso zzso was due to zzso zzso 1) zzso was almost completely prevented by the presence of zzso or other zzso metal zzso having high affinity for the zzso used, while metal zzso with low affinity did not zzso 2) the zzso activity of the zzso could be restored by dialysis to remove zzso but only in the presence of zzso while dialysis in the absence of metal zzso reversed zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The involvement of a zzso zzso in zzso function, possibly bound via zzso was also suggested by the finding that zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso Once bound to the zzso DNA zzso the zzso could not be inhibited by zzso suggesting that the essential metal zzso must become zzso to zzso when the zzso binds zzso The zzso requirement of the zzso zzso is similar to that of the zzso and the zzso receptors and is consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is a member of the steroid and zzso hormone zzso zzso
