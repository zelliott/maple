An extensive family study on zzso was performed in 105 families living in northeastern zzso In a linkage study between zzso and other zzso zzso five apparent zzso between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso frequency zzso with maximum probability was estimated to be zzso by the zzso score zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in unrelated parents were determined by direct zzso The most common zzso was zzso with the frequency of zzso and the second was zzso with zzso Nine zzso and six zzso zzso were in significant linkage zzso Seven kinds of extended zzso were observed to be over zzso in which the most common zzso zzso occurred at zzso Moreover, we found two zzso zzso zzso in this zzso The first one possesses a single base substitution from zzso resulting in an zzso acid zzso The other is most likely to be formed by an zzso zzso between zzso and zzso
