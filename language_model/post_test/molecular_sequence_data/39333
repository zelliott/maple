Cell death plays a ubiquitous role in zzso zzso given that it is associated with both susceptible and resistance zzso A class of cell zzso zzso termed zzso proteins zzso has been reported in bacteria, zzso and zzso These proteins induce zzso necrosis in a variety of zzso zzso Here, we describe three members of the zzso family from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso with a zzso zzso virus X zzso we showed that zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso and the host plant zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso is zzso during late stages of infection of tomato by zzso zzso We compared zzso zzso activity to zzso zzso a well-studied protein that triggers the hypersensitive response in zzso zzso Using zzso gene zzso we showed that the cell death induced by zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso In addition, cell death triggered by zzso but not that by zzso was dependent on the zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting distinct signaling zzso Combined expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso resulted in enhanced cell death, suggesting synergistic interplay between the two zzso zzso Altogether, these results point to potentially distinct but interacting zzso pathways induced by zzso and zzso in zzso
