zzso analysis of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso virus zzso revealed that it is composed of three zzso zzso regions, representing the first 864 zzso of the zzso an internal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso of the parental zzso zzso zzso had three base zzso within the leader sequence and also a deletion of nine zzso located at the junction of the leader and the remaining zzso zzso A system was developed for generating zzso zzso to study the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso A zzso copy of zzso zzso was placed downstream of zzso zzso zzso promoter to generate zzso zzso capable of extremely efficient replication in the presence of a helper zzso We demonstrated that, in the zzso zzso cells, the leader sequence of these zzso zzso was switched to that of the helper virus during one round of zzso This zzso leader sequence exchange was not observed if a zzso stretch at the junction between the leader and the remaining zzso sequence was zzso This observation suggests that a free leader zzso is zzso for the replication of zzso zzso
