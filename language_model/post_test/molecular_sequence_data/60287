This study had three zzso zzso to characterize the structures of the chicken zzso and zzso zzso zzso to determine if zzso zzso and zzso genes are expressed in chicken zzso zzso zzso if zzso is expressed in chicken zzso to determine if the zzso zzso zzso carried by the retinal zzso zzso chicken is associated with degenerative changes within the zzso zzso of these zzso 

zzso and zzso gene structures were determined by analyses of chicken zzso and zzso zzso The putative zzso start points for these genes were determined using zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were analyzed using Northern zzso and zzso zzso light zzso was used to examine zzso zzso 

Chicken zzso and zzso genes are arranged in a zzso zzso Each protein is zzso by 4 zzso that are interrupted by 3 zzso of variable zzso the positions of which are identical within each zzso The putative zzso start points for zzso and zzso are 314 and 243 bases upstream of the translation start zzso of these zzso zzso As in zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are expressed in the chicken zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso is present in both the zzso and zzso of the zzso chicken, only the zzso appears to undergo zzso 

The identical arrangement of chicken, human, and mouse zzso genes suggests that these genes originated from an ancient gene zzso event that occurred during evolution prior to zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso in chicken zzso is consistent with the hypothesis that chicken zzso contains a functional zzso zzso The absence of cellular zzso in the zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso is not critical for zzso cell zzso
