A human zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned by functional zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso protein of zzso zzso The deduced sequence has regions that are highly zzso to zzso sequences obtained from zzso pig liver zzso and shows limited zzso to the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso coli results in elevated expression of an zzso with characteristics of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso a zzso cell lacking zzso activity, overcomes the cell's requirement for zzso and zzso but does not overcome the cell's zzso zzso consistent with expression of the protein in the zzso but not the zzso
