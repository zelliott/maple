Two simple methods for the synthesis of zzso bearing a zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and/or zzso zzso groups are zzso By forming complexes between a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso derivatives of the latter, it is shown that the introduction of a dye at the end of an zzso chain strongly zzso its complementary zzso The zzso and the zzso parameters zzso zzso delta zzso delta zzso of complex formation were zzso According to these data, zzso of a dye with the zzso zzso group is the most zzso delta zzso degrees zzso is increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso which connects the dye to the zzso from a zzso up to a zzso usually leads to zzso of the zzso zzso The complementary complex formed by the zzso zzso of the zzso was found to be the most stable among all duplexes zzso Relative to the unmodified complex the increase in free energy was zzso zzso zzso zzso The association constant of this modified complex at 37 degrees C is zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the analogous value for the unmodified complex is only 3 zzso zzso zzso
