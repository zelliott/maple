An important first step in the zzso zzso process is the initial binding of a zzso zzso to a zzso zzso We have investigated the ability of zzso (a zzso zzso involved in the signal zzso zzso to interact with its zzso binding site located in the promoter region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso promoter, when this site was zzso into a zzso Two different zzso assembly systems were employed to assemble principally zzso or zzso zzso The ability of zzso to interact with an zzso or an zzso zzso differed zzso zzso bound to an zzso zzso with only a zzso to zzso reduction in DNA binding affinity compared with naked zzso zzso the binding of zzso to a single zzso site incorporated into an zzso zzso resulted in the complete disruption of zzso structure without zzso zzso Moreover, this disruption was sufficient to facilitate the subsequent binding of a second zzso zzso
