zzso zzso in zzso cells is present in zzso and zzso Its absence in zzso results in embryonic zzso due to the failure to amplify zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso results from differential translation initiation at two zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a single zzso Here we show that expression levels of the two zzso depend on the efficiency of translation initiation at each zzso zzso and on the presence of a short upstream open reading frame zzso resulting in the zzso zzso being about zzso as abundant as the nuclear zzso zzso initiation at the zzso zzso is restricted by the zzso while expression of the nuclear zzso requires zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso after termination of zzso translation or new initiation by zzso skipping the zzso and the zzso zzso Such zzso organization of zzso zzso allows tight control of expression of zzso zzso in zzso where its excess or absence can lead to cell death, without affecting the expression of the nuclear zzso zzso
