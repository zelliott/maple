We describe a new form of protein zzso C zzso with a molecular weight of 97 zzso higher than the known forms of zzso zzso This putative new zzso weight zzso which we are calling zzso zzso is increased in the membrane fraction either upon application of zzso zzso or with zzso synaptic stimulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The protein zzso on zzso with zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso derived from the zzso of zzso zzso it does not zzso however, with zzso against the zzso region of zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is localized primarily in brain, in contrast to zzso zzso which is found predominantly in lung and zzso
