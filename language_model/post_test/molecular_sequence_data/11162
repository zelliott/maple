Fusion genes implicating the zzso gene have been recently demonstrated in various zzso zzso abnormalities in human zzso zzso We analyzed a zzso zzso detected in a secondary acute zzso zzso This zzso results in fusion of the zzso gene on zzso to a previously unknown gene on zzso 6 that differs from the previously reported zzso partner gene zzso The novel zzso named zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein with strong similarities to the two FH family members whose genes are already known to be involved in zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso in these zzso the zzso are located at the same position within the FH zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could define a new FH zzso particularly involved in human zzso
