A new approach to simultaneous detection and typing of related agents by the multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso is zzso The reaction was been applied to human zzso by zzso amplification of fragments of the DNA zzso zzso During the first amplification, zzso were used as two zzso zzso of zzso zzso aligning the zzso with selected consensus regions, and their zzso with the zzso sequences of each zzso to be zzso The specific fragments obtained were the zzso for a second, multiplex reaction for which zzso were designed to produce zzso fragments for each related zzso The results showed high specificity for the detection and typing of the human zzso with known sequences and no amplification of human DNA, in spite of the presence of the same consensus regions within human DNA zzso zzso It is concluded that this new approach would be useful for the differential diagnosis of zzso as well as for other groups of agents with zzso regions in their zzso and causing similar zzso
