zzso are marine zzso algae that possess secondary zzso of green zzso zzso Although zzso are a small group (the zzso of zzso contains 14 species in 8 zzso they have variable and complex life cycles that include zzso zzso and/or flagellate zzso The majority of zzso possess two or more cell types in their life cycles, and which cell types are found is one of the principle zzso criteria used for species zzso Here we describe an unidentified zzso that was isolated from an artificial coral reef that calls this criterion into zzso The life cycle of the new strain includes all three major cell types, but DNA zzso based on the established zzso ITS sequences showed it to share zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso was also isolated from a coral reef, but is defined as completely lacking an zzso stage throughout its life zzso We conclude that zzso zzso possesses zzso diversity between culture zzso and that the new strain is a variety of zzso zzso which we describe as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to include the zzso stage in the formal description of zzso zzso This zzso variation suggest that gross zzso stages maybe lost rather zzso and specifically that the type strain of zzso zzso has lost the ability to form the zzso stage, perhaps zzso This in turn suggests that even major zzso characters used for zzso of this group may be variable in natural zzso and therefore zzso
