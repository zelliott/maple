Although engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso are finding increasing applications in zzso their generation remains a challenging, zzso zzso As new zzso zzso zzso scaffolds are identified, however, an alternative paradigm is zzso identification of an zzso scaffold whose native zzso site is a close match to a desired target zzso followed by small-scale engineering to modestly refine recognition zzso The application of this paradigm could be accelerated if methods were available for fusing zzso and zzso zzso from newly identified zzso into zzso zzso with hybrid zzso zzso Here we have analyzed the structural requirements for fusion of zzso extracted from six zzso zzso family zzso spanning zzso zzso acid zzso Our analyses demonstrate that both the zzso zzso interface zzso and the zzso zzso composition have important effects on the stability and activity of zzso zzso Using a simple domain fusion method in which zzso zzso zzso predicted to contact their respective zzso are zzso and in which limited variation is introduced into the zzso zzso and nearby interface zzso zzso active zzso were zzso for zzso zzso of domain zzso This method will be useful for creating large numbers of zzso zzso for zzso engineering zzso
