Although the regulation of zzso stimulating hormone zzso gene zzso has been zzso zzso the functions of zzso factors involved are not fully zzso The authors found that the zzso promoter region of the zzso interacts specifically with nuclear proteins derived from zzso tissue or from cultured zzso zzso The actual binding site at the zzso level, as revealed by zzso I protection zzso includes the consensus sequence for nuclear factor I zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso expression is restricted to zzso cells in the anterior zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso binds most efficiently to the zzso region of zzso zzso The forced expressions of zzso markedly reduced zzso promoter activity and its zzso zzso Furthermore, it was also shown that the zzso region is involved in the zzso repression of the zzso It was of particular interest to observe that zzso was recruited to the zzso region of the zzso promoter in an zzso zzso Taken together, this study provides new insights of the delicate regulations of energy metabolism and hormonal zzso
