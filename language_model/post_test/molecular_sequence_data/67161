zzso is an important source of nitrogen for many zzso including zzso and its availability also has substantial effects on the nitrogen metabolism and development of zzso zzso Three ammonium zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso and zzso were identified on the basis of zzso acid sequence similarity to members of the ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso A series of strains were constructed that carry all combinations of zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso and tested for growth on low ammonium and resistance to the toxic ammonium analog zzso The zzso delta and zzso delta single zzso had different growth zzso and the zzso delta zzso delta double zzso displayed a much more severe growth zzso on zzso or zzso 5 zzso zzso All single zzso exhibited zzso resistance but to different zzso zzso delta was the most resistant and zzso delta was the zzso These results suggest that the zzso genes zzso functional zzso with distinct zzso zzso In response to ammonium zzso the zzso strain zzso to the zzso delta zzso underwent zzso growth underneath the surface of solid zzso No such zzso invasive growth, however, was observed for the zzso delta zzso indicating that zzso zzso is required for ammonium zzso zzso invasive zzso
