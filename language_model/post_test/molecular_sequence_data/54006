Little is known of mechanisms regulating zzso zzso We identified zzso in a screen for zzso with defects in patterning of a zzso marker at certain zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein contains zinc zzso zzso and other zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso fail to accumulate zzso zzso retract synaptic zzso and zzso extend zzso Some motor zzso branch and zzso others show altered synaptic zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to rescue zzso in these zzso Certain zzso zzso are temperature sensitive, revealing that zzso function can be zzso by maintaining zzso at the zzso temperature at stages commensurate with zzso formation in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso functions cell autonomously during zzso to regulate zzso zzso
