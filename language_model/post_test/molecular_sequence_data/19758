zzso are required for the function of zzso a zzso complex implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease zzso We analyzed expression of the zzso 1 zzso zzso We show that zzso recognizes avian zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs on the zzso promoter located at zzso zzso zzso and zzso and activates zzso zzso with promoter fragments containing or not the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso selection we identified interactions between the zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso 415 zzso acids of zzso used as zzso zzso contained the zzso region of zzso starting from zzso acid zzso This zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso protein expression from the zzso gene in zzso zzso In cells zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was eliminated with increasing levels of zzso Progressive zzso deletions of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso indicated that sequences crucial for repression of zzso and interactions with zzso in zzso zzso zzso are located between zzso acids zzso and zzso This was correlated by the effect of progressive zzso deletions of zzso which indicated that sequences required for repression of zzso lie between zzso acids 1955 and zzso Similarly, deletion to zzso acid 1889 eliminated binding in zzso zzso zzso Testing various shorter fragments of zzso as bait indicated that the region essential for binding zzso is within the zzso acid region zzso which contains the central zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso deletions of zzso showed that zzso between zzso acids 200 and zzso are required for binding to zzso zzso and zzso deletions of zzso indicated that zzso acids zzso are also zzso Furthermore, data from zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso interacts with the zzso promoter in zzso
