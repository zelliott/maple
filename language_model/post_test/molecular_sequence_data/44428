The zzso gene in the zzso arm of zzso 1 encodes one of the receptors for the nerve growth factor and is frequently activated as an zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso is due to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso domain to zzso sequences from different zzso The zzso zzso zzso are activated by zzso with at least three different zzso the gene coding for zzso and zzso both on zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso In a previous study, we showed that two tumors carrying the zzso zzso contained structurally different zzso named zzso and zzso In this paper, we report zzso the zzso structure of zzso zzso evidence that zzso is generated by different zzso in two zzso tumors, and zzso a detailed analysis of the three different zzso zzso With molecular studies based on Southern zzso zzso zzso and sequencing, we show that all the zzso are nearly zzso involving zzso zzso or zzso of only few zzso In one case, an additional zzso involving sequences derived from zzso 17 was zzso
