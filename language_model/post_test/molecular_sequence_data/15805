A zzso zzso human zzso zzso library was screened using a zzso probe zzso the zzso region of human beta zzso and with a synthetic zzso having a sequence corresponding to that of the zzso end of the zzso zzso The newly isolated zzso was found to code for the zzso and the zzso region, primed at an zzso region in the coding zzso A complete zzso acid sequence has been deduced which shows only one membrane zzso domain near the zzso zzso of the sequence to the soluble zzso suggests zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso obtained information of human beta zzso makes it possible to study DNA zzso responsible for genetic defects such as the altered expression of zzso found in a zzso of zzso zzso anemia type II zzso
