To analyze the zzso and genetic divergence in the zzso zzso from environment and cases of zzso disease, and to compare these two groups in terms of zzso and other biological zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso zzso were carried zzso 

The main zzso of cases zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the main zzso of environmental zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso strain was isolated from zzso Most cases zzso were zzso positive and zzso negative, which account for zzso while most environmental zzso were zzso negative and zzso negative, which account for zzso zzso indicated that zzso zzso was the dominant clone zzso including zzso zzso zzso (29 zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso and these strains were all obtained from cases of zzso zzso No dominant clone cluster was found in environmental zzso 

zzso zzso from cases of zzso disease in Shenzhen mostly were zzso zzso positive and zzso negative, there were dominant zzso type in cases zzso the main zzso was zzso while environmental zzso mostly were zzso zzso negative and zzso negative, no dominant zzso type was zzso
