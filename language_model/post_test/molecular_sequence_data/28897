zzso are widely distributed in food and the environment, and some colonize the human body as zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the species of zzso that colonize the zzso and compare them with those found in food and the zzso 

Thirty-five zzso strains from women from seven countries were isolated, and sequences from zzso zzso genes were determined and compared with existing data in zzso A zzso tree was achieved using the zzso method based on the analysis of 1465 zzso The results showed that most zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso from a native American woman displayed distinct zzso indicating novel zzso Few zzso zzso matched food or environmental zzso zzso 

Most women worldwide were zzso by three common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso species richness and distribution in women worldwide may lead to the design of better zzso products as bacterial replacement zzso
