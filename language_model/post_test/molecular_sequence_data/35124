zzso zzso is a key zzso factor in the regulation of plant oil synthesis in seed and zzso zzso The structural features of zzso important for its function are not well zzso zzso of zzso zzso across many diverse plant species revealed a zzso 9 zzso zzso zzso the zzso acids zzso zzso zzso of zzso acids within the zzso zzso of zzso failed to restore the full oil content of zzso seeds, providing direct evidence for an essential role of this small zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to have three alternative zzso zzso To understand expression of these zzso forms we performed zzso of zzso developing seeds and zzso other zzso and zzso databases from several zzso and plant zzso In all cases, only one zzso form was detected and zzso was observed in transcripts of all zzso zzso zzso We also characterized a zzso distant zzso zzso zzso as an example of a zzso zzso that is highly expressed in the zzso tissue of oil zzso The zzso region of zzso is over 90 zzso acids shorter than zzso and has surprisingly low sequence zzso Nevertheless, the zzso protein can restore multiple zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso including reduced seed oil, the zzso seed coat, reduced seed zzso and impaired zzso zzso Taken together, this study provides an example of combining zzso analysis with zzso zzso technology and zzso analysis to examine key elements of the structure and function of the zzso plant zzso zzso
