We have examined the effects of zzso glacial range expansion on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Say zzso zzso because aquatic insects are zzso in zzso studies (and in zzso in zzso and because the effects of ecological degradation on the population zzso of environmental indicator species like zzso zzso cannot be measured unless the underlying zzso is zzso zzso data from a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I zzso gene were subjected to zzso and zzso zzso analysis for 30 populations zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed substantial population zzso zzso of the zzso zzso among zzso Three zzso zzso are zzso one from Tennessee into Illinois, Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan and Ontario, a second that radiated eastward from Pennsylvania, and a third that moved along the coast from North Carolina into Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maine and then into New zzso The latter two of these zzso were the result of zzso range expansions, while the former expansion, out of Tennessee, appears to have been rapid with little gene flow from the source zzso Additional zzso included a group of zzso in central Kentucky that appear to have expanded along zzso zzso and zzso in North Carolina and Georgia that have remained centrally zzso zzso diversity decreased from south to north, a pattern that has been widely reported for animal and plant populations that expanded with the retreat of the zzso zzso
