We have used zzso I zzso to compare the stability of parallel triple zzso containing different numbers of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have targeted a zzso containing the zzso sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which form zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso of the target site zzso zzso zzso I zzso has shown that at pH zzso the zzso zzso of these zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, revealing that increasing the proportion of zzso triplets increases triplex zzso The results suggest that the positive charge on the zzso zzso contributes to triplex stability, either by a zzso interaction with the stacked zzso or by screening the charge on the zzso zzso In the presence of a zzso triplex binding zzso all three zzso bind with similar zzso At pH zzso these zzso only form in the presence of the triplex binding zzso while at pH zzso zzso are only seen with the zzso which generates the fewest number of zzso triplets zzso in the presence of the zzso
