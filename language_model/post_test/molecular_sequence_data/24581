The complete sequence of the zzso locus has been zzso the coding region of the gene is zzso and placed within a 12 zzso region flanked by the zzso and zzso zzso The immediate promoter region has an zzso site with zzso to the zzso consensus known to bind the zzso zzso factor zzso however, promoter deletion analysis and zzso studies have failed to show zzso through this element by zzso zzso within the coding region, immediate zzso promoter region and a variable number tandem repeat zzso zzso within the locus have been examined in a collection of Caucasian families and African zzso zzso analysis shows linkage zzso between the zzso and zzso coding region red hair zzso zzso which can be used to estimate the age of these zzso zzso Assuming a mean zzso zzso rate of zzso and a star zzso we estimate the zzso zzso arose zzso years before the present day, suggesting these zzso may have arisen in the Caucasian population more recently than previously zzso
