zzso mapping analysis has shown that members of the zzso and zzso gene families are zzso in the zzso zzso To obtain direct evidence that members of these gene families are physically linked, an zzso liver library was constructed and zzso clones were analyzed for zzso to both zzso and zzso gene zzso Four clones were identified which contained both zzso and zzso zzso restriction zzso Two clones containing rearranged zzso genes were also found to zzso with the zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of three of the zzso restriction fragments indicate that all are zzso which contain interruptions at either the zzso and/or 3' ends of the zzso coding zzso Given the zzso location of at least a portion of the zzso gene family relative to zzso in zzso mice, and the known correlation between D proximity and the frequency of zzso gene zzso 22 zzso zzso cell lines were analyzed for zzso gene zzso More than zzso of the identified H chain zzso zzso in this survey used members of this gene zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso zzso from zzso fetal liver and adult zzso also indicates preferential zzso of zzso family in fetal zzso zzso studies show, however, that there are no changes in relative zzso throughout fetal zzso The implications of these findings for the expression and zzso of the zzso repertoire are zzso
