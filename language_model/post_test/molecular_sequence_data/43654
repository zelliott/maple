The zzso zzso gene is extinguished in hybrids formed between zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with constructions containing segments from the promoter region of the zzso placed upstream of an zzso expressed promoter (the zzso virus zzso zzso gene zzso showed that the zzso zzso sequence contains at least one negative element active in zzso zzso this sequence behaves as an zzso in zzso zzso We identified such a zzso negative region, localized between zzso positions zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso specifically binds zzso nuclear zzso generating three zzso The sequence from zzso to zzso was shown to be responsible for both the formation of these complexes and the negative activity of zzso These results suggest that the binding of nuclear factors to the zzso promoter region contributes to zzso the zzso gene in zzso cells, such as zzso and thus to establishing zzso expression of the zzso zzso
