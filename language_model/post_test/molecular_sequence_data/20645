zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are widely distributed in cellular zzso of various zzso but have not previously been found in zzso In this study, we cloned a gene zzso the mouse cardiac zzso channel zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso Another zzso zzso identical in zzso acid zzso was also identified by sequence zzso The zzso sequences of the two zzso zzso type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso differed by three zzso insertions and one zzso substitution in the zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence demonstrated that zzso was a unique zzso channel zzso in mouse zzso with zzso acids zzso being identical to zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso acids zzso corresponding to zzso channel zzso M alpha member zzso These findings suggest that a unique zzso channel zzso is expressed in mouse zzso
