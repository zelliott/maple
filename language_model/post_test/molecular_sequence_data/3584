The zzso finger proteins of the Sal family regulate zzso zzso evidence from zzso has shown that zzso zzso can alter gene expression in a cell autonomous fashion, but Sal proteins have never been directly analyzed for their ability to activate or repress zzso In this report, we show that a member of the Sal family, mouse zzso is a potent zzso zzso When fused to a zzso zzso domain, zzso zzso zzso of a zzso reporter by over zzso zzso of the N zzso alone is sufficient for zzso repression that, as shown by deletion analysis, requires the extreme zzso zzso acids of the zzso The N zzso of zzso can repress at both short and long range relative to the promoter, and treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso repression by zzso The same regions of the protein that are required for repression physically interact with components of zzso zzso complexes, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso is localized to discrete nuclear zzso and this zzso depends on the zzso repression zzso Together, these results suggest that the N zzso of mouse zzso can recruit zzso complexes to mediate zzso zzso
