We have investigated the parameters affecting the zzso of a short synthetic zzso associated with zzso The model zzso used had the sequence zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso was measured by the ability of zzso zzso to zzso with the parent zzso By itself, the zzso was not able to induce significant zzso zzso However, zzso were shown to be able to render the zzso zzso nevertheless a number of parameters were zzso to be zzso the zzso had to be surface bound, rather than zzso within the zzso and an zzso zzso zzso A zzso had to be present in the same population of zzso Additionally, the intensity and duration of the immune response were found to be dependent both on the charge of the zzso neutral zzso yielding a longer lasting response than zzso charged zzso and on the zzso schedule where a long time period between zzso and boosting yielded a better result than a short time zzso To account for these phenomena we propose a model in which zzso zzso targets zzso zzso to B zzso specific for the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso can act as carriers to induce a long-lasting zzso response against zzso eliminating the need of protein carriers and conventional zzso Such an approach may be useful for designing synthetic zzso
