The zzso ITS regions of five zzso species were zzso Each zzso species was found to have a unique sequence in the ITS region, so that they could be easily distinguished at the DNA zzso The aligned zzso zzso of the ITS region includes 235 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 246 zzso zzso One hundred and zzso sites are zzso The sequences of zzso zzso could be easily distinguished from the other four zzso species according to the sequence variation at 11 sites, 7 in zzso 1 in zzso and 3 in zzso These could be used as molecular characters to distinguish the stems of zzso zzso from the zzso
