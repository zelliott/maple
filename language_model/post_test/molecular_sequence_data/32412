In the present study, we investigated the zzso zzso of the isolated alpha domain of human zzso zzso zzso with specific emphasis on resolving the debate concerning the cooperative nature of the zzso zzso The zzso reaction of the zzso alpha domain with zzso was unequivocally shown to proceed by a zzso mechanism at zzso pH by CD and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data clearly show the presence of intermediate partially zzso zzso species under limiting zzso zzso zzso with four zzso zzso of zzso was required for the formation of the zzso species in zzso zzso The implications of a zzso zzso mechanism are that the partially zzso and zzso species are stable zzso and thus may have a potential role in the currently undefined function of zzso
