zzso species of zzso have been known to be one of the most prevalent zzso One important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) was identified by means of zzso with a serum pool of allergic patients on a two-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso coding for zzso zzso 1 was cloned and zzso The clone encodes a full-length protein of zzso zzso acid precursors of 42 zzso After zzso of a putative signal zzso of 21 zzso acids and a zzso of 100 zzso zzso a mature protein of 282 zzso acids was obtained with a molecular mass of 33 zzso and a zzso of zzso A degree of identity was found in a range of 27 to zzso among related zzso derived from bacteria zzso zzso mold zzso zzso c 1, and zzso factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 1) was cloned into zzso zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso as a zzso fusion protein and zzso to zzso The zzso binding capacity of zzso zzso 1 was tested by zzso using a serum pool of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly with zzso specific for natural zzso zzso 1 and zzso c 1, indicating that common zzso zzso may exist between zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
