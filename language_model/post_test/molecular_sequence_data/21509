The crystal structure of zzso bound to a zzso zzso zzso shows that the accessory zzso extends away from the zzso in an zzso zzso binding another zzso and zzso its zzso to clamp zzso In contrast, the accessory zzso in the zzso complex parallels the zzso complex in a zzso zzso Here we use targeted zzso zzso zzso and a functional zzso that zzso zzso zzso to show that the zzso switch from open to closed in zzso is needed for zzso to trigger zzso zzso fusion requires the zzso of three crucial zzso zzso in the switch region zzso zzso of zzso zzso switching in zzso is integral to clamp release and is probably triggered when its accessory zzso is released from its zzso to the neighboring zzso allowing the zzso to complete zzso and open a fusion zzso
