In culture zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the first time a zzso of molecular weight 58 zzso was identified, which had all the characteristics of an zzso zzso and which was therefore identified as zzso O zzso In the case of zzso zzso a second major zzso protein of molecular weight 24 zzso zzso with zzso However, the function of this protein has to be zzso In culture zzso of zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso activity could be zzso both zzso activities together contributing to the pronounced zzso caused by zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and the 24 zzso from zzso zzso are zzso
