zzso is a very potent for zzso zzso showing a few times stronger binding activity and much more enhanced biological activity than zzso zzso This synergistic outcome has been suggested to be due to the interaction with the zzso aromatic and/or zzso zzso acid zzso crucial to zzso zzso In order to identify such zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso loop, we prepared a series of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to be as active as zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso exhibited considerably reduced activity for zzso exhibiting no synergistic activity zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are directly involved in the interaction with zzso zzso was found to bind strongly both zzso and zzso although it zzso no biological zzso All these results indicate that the consecutive zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical to the zzso of the zzso zzso but not to zzso
