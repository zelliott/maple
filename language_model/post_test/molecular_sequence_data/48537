The gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso from a newly isolated strain of zzso zzso has been isolated, cloned and zzso Following zzso zzso and structural characterization have been zzso The zzso exhibited zzso activity at a broad temperature range between 55 and 65 zzso clearly higher than that of other zzso zzso The optimum pH was zzso and zzso activity increased by of zzso and zzso A noticeable preference was demonstrated for zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso possibly due to zzso zzso The affinity for CD zzso increased in the order of zzso but zzso increased as zzso zzso that increased zzso zzso are mainly attribute to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso process showed that improved activity zzso in zzso is accompanied by increases in zzso zzso zzso for aforementioned zzso zzso zzso on the binding interactions between zzso and active site zzso revealed a considerably higher accessible surface area for the active site zzso in the presence of zzso than zzso indicating that interactions in the transition state are stronger in the presence of zzso This result explains the increased zzso of the zzso process and increased zzso of the zzso in the presence of zzso compared to that of zzso This study, which presents the first detailed comparative analysis on the zzso preference of zzso zzso for different zzso may shed some lights into the molecular mechanism of these zzso
