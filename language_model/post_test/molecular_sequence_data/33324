Basic zzso zzso proteins constitute a large family of zzso regulators in zzso Although they have been shown to play important roles in a wide variety of zzso zzso relatively few have been functionally zzso Here, we describe the zzso cloning of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this locus prevent root hair development, which also zzso root zzso colonization of the host root by zzso zzso We show that the zzso gene encodes a presumed zzso zzso factor that functions in a zzso manner to control root hair development in zzso zzso zzso search and zzso zzso experiments defined three members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein family, zzso zzso and zzso as functionally equivalent to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species accumulate independently from the known positive regulators of root hair cell fate, while all three genes act in a partially redundant manner to regulate root hair development in zzso
