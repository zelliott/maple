The zzso zzso (6 zzso zzso zzso channels form the largest zzso channel family, some members of which are zzso and others are zzso There are no reported channel structures to match the wealth of functional data on the zzso zzso We determined the structure of the zzso regions of the bacterial zzso zzso channel zzso a zzso 6 TM zzso The structure showed how the zzso domain and its associated zzso can serve as a clamp to zzso the gate of the pore and possibly function in concert with zzso zzso to regulate the opening of the zzso The structure also led us to zzso a new mechanism by which motions of the zzso inner zzso can gate the zzso zzso zzso at a position along the pore closer to the selectivity filter than the zzso zzso bundle zzso
