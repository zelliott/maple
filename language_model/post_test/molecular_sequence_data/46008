10 young zzso females and 30 zzso subjects were studied for zzso in two X linked zzso zzso and zzso A novel zzso zzso lacking zzso 4, which occurred de zzso on the paternal zzso was identified in one of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was seen in this subject and in 11 of 14 zzso zzso and zzso females using a single zzso zzso found at 3' zzso Additionally, the zzso transcript was present in two zzso (with and without zzso 7) in nine of 10 zzso females and in 30 zzso subjects, including parents of the zzso female having only the complete transcript with zzso 7, and from the whole brain of a zzso The novel truncated zzso product may have a regulatory role, as reported in other proteins (for example, zzso zzso by attenuating the function of the full length zzso resulting in a reduction of the mature zzso Three zzso protein structures were zzso using comparative zzso and significant changes were suggested in the protein zzso for these two zzso zzso
