zzso zzso zzso dominate contemporary zzso zzso with roughly 250,000 species, but their origin and early evolution are still poorly zzso In recent years, molecular evidence has accumulated suggesting a zzso origin of zzso zzso reconstructions have suggested that several zzso groups that include zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso branch off as the most zzso among zzso This has led to the concept of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we present the sequence and zzso analyses of the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso analyses of our zzso data set, consisting of zzso aligned zzso positions per zzso zzso revealed consistent support for zzso being a divergent member of a zzso zzso zzso Three distinct zzso lineages were supported in the majority of our zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso lineage leading to the grasses was the deepest zzso Although analyses of only one individual gene alignment (out of zzso is consistent with some recently proposed hypotheses for the zzso of zzso we also report observations that nine genes do not support zzso of zzso Instead, they support the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this finding, we also report observations suggesting that the zzso lineage leading to the grasses has the strongest zzso affinity to zzso Our findings have general implications for studies of substitution model zzso and analyses of zzso zzso zzso
