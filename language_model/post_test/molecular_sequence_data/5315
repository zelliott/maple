We have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso of zzso a gene essential for zzso zzso and enteric nervous system development in zzso During zzso zzso zzso transcripts are expressed in a number of zzso including spinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the enteric nervous zzso We have examined in detail the expression of zzso during the development of identified spinal primary zzso zzso expression is regulated in a cell zzso manner among the three primary zzso zzso is expressed at its highest levels in zzso primary zzso zzso and transcripts can be detected shortly before the expression of the zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso may play a role in specifying zzso cell zzso zzso is expressed at low levels in the other primary zzso and also in a subset of secondary zzso suggesting that it may also play a broader role in zzso survival or zzso
