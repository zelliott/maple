The zzso zzso zzso occurs in some human and bovine zzso and also in lower zzso and zzso It has been found in zzso as well as terminally zzso forms at the zzso end of zzso zzso but it has not been reported previously at truly internal positions of zzso zzso Here, we describe zzso conversion of zzso zzso into zzso The extension zzso zzso by human serum, were modeled after analogous zzso transfer processes that generate zzso The newly zzso zzso linkages were zzso identified by nuclear magnetic resonance data, including the appropriate long-range correlations in zzso multiple bond correlation zzso The novel zzso zzso proved to be a functional zzso for several zzso zzso suggesting that human zzso may contain internal zzso units in many distinct zzso The zzso zzso was unusually resistant toward zzso zzso the slow degradation should lead to a convenient method for the search of putative internal zzso zzso in natural zzso zzso
