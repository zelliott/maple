zzso is the founding member of a novel family of zzso zzso that defines a new class of zzso zzso T cells, termed zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso and zzso cells cause pathology in zzso but little is known about mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso through its zzso zzso activates genes typical of innate immune zzso such as zzso and zzso despite minimal sequence similarity in their respective zzso A previous zzso study predicted a zzso in zzso receptors with zzso to a zzso zzso domain, termed the zzso zzso However, the zzso domain lacks motifs critical for bona fide zzso zzso and its functionality was never zzso Here, we used a zzso system in zzso zzso to map functional zzso within zzso We demonstrate that the zzso domain mediates zzso signaling independently of classic zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Moreover, we identified a previously zzso zzso zzso required for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso domain revealed a site analogous to the zzso zzso in zzso which renders mice insensitive to zzso However, a putative salt bridge typically found in zzso zzso appears to be zzso We further identified a zzso domain required for zzso of zzso and induction of a subset zzso target zzso This zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso reveals important differences in zzso compared with zzso zzso
