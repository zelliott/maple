A moderately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso chimney located on the Eastern zzso Spreading Centre in the Pacific Ocean at a depth of about zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were ovals to short rods with a single polar zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter and zzso zzso long, growing zzso or in zzso The temperature range for growth was zzso zzso with an optimum at 50 zzso The pH range for growth was zzso with an optimum at pH zzso Growth of strain zzso was observed at zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso with an optimum at zzso zzso The isolate used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extract as electron donors for growth and zzso zzso All electron donors were oxidized completely to zzso and zzso zzso (in the form of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso sulfur zzso were the electron zzso that supported zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that the novel zzso was related to representatives of the orders zzso and zzso with zzso sequence similarity and formed a distinct zzso branch in the zzso On the basis of its zzso properties and results of zzso zzso it is proposed that the new isolate represents the sole species of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
