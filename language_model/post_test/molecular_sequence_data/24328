The zzso bond pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso family, was determined by mass zzso Four zzso zzso bonds of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Three strategies were used in this zzso One zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso linkages were detected by standard zzso zzso The zzso bonds zzso and zzso were analyzed using a modified partial reduction procedure and zzso The last two zzso bonds were characterized by a zzso zzso The strategies developed in this work could be applied more generally to detection of zzso bond zzso
