The presence of a zzso protein which does not exhibit a zzso effect has been found only in fish living in fast flowing zzso We report the cloning of the first zzso effect zzso zzso from an adult Atlantic salmon kidney zzso zzso sequence analysis of this zzso shows that the predicted zzso zzso comprises 147 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of 15 zzso Da and an overall zzso acid zzso of 40 to 50% to higher zzso and zzso to fish zzso This sequence confirms the important zzso acid zzso which are changed thus causing loss of the zzso effect zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1975) zzso adaptation to zzso zzso the zzso system of zzso zzso Topics zzso zzso 9, zzso This loss allows the zzso protein to have a higher oxygen zzso as it does not release oxygen when the pH of the surrounding environment zzso which is an important ability for the fish in times of zzso
