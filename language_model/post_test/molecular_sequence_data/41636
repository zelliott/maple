zzso complex V zzso zzso or zzso uses the zzso zzso to generate zzso during zzso zzso and requires several helper zzso including zzso to form the zzso in a zzso process in which nuclear DNA is combined with zzso zzso zzso We report the clinical and molecular findings in three patients presenting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All three showed an isolated zzso of fully assembled zzso zzso in association with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, one of the patients also showed zzso zzso pulmonary zzso hypertension, a finding never before associated with zzso zzso In addition to widening the clinical and zzso spectrum of defective zzso zzso our study also suggests that zzso zzso associates in high molecular weight complexes zzso when expressed in zzso cells and exerts a direct action in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the incorporation of F1 zzso
