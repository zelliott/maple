Black queen cell virus zzso infection is one of the most common viral infections in zzso zzso zzso A zzso tree was constructed for 19 partial zzso sequences for the zzso region of South Korean zzso which were also compared with 10 previously reported zzso sequences derived from different zzso The Korean zzso zzso were highly zzso and showed zzso zzso They also showed zzso similarity with other country zzso and showed no significant zzso in the zzso zzso In order to investigate this phenomenon in more detail, the complete zzso sequence of the Korean zzso strain was determined and aligned with those from a South African reference strain and European zzso zzso and zzso A zzso tree was then zzso The Korean zzso strain showed a high level of similarity zzso with zzso but low similarity zzso with the South African reference zzso zzso of the Korean and other sequences across different zzso regions revealed that the zzso the zzso region, and the zzso regions of the zzso zzso were highly zzso zzso (a zzso protein coding zzso was more variable than zzso (a structural protein coding zzso The zzso third of zzso was particularly variable and contained several zzso This phenomenon may be explained by zzso zzso between the Korean and other zzso zzso this appeared to have happened more with the South African reference strain than with the European zzso
