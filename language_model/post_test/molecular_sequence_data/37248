The zzso genes function in the assembly of zzso clusters and are zzso in many zzso and zzso zzso In most bacteria zzso the zzso zzso can be deleted without loss of cell zzso indicating that additional systems for zzso cluster assembly must zzso Several laboratories have described nutritional and zzso defects resulting from zzso in the zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso in two genes of unknown function, zzso and zzso result in similar cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed these deficiencies in the zzso and zzso zzso distinguishing them from previously described zzso zzso The deficiencies caused by the zzso and zzso zzso were zzso which is consistent with zzso and zzso having redundant functions or with zzso and zzso functioning in different areas of zzso cluster metabolism zzso zzso cluster assembly and zzso cluster zzso Both the zzso and zzso proteins are similar in sequence to proteins that function in metal zzso zzso Like the zzso with sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso protein was able to zzso zzso The data zzso are consistent with the hypothesis that the zzso and zzso proteins function in zzso cluster metabolism in zzso
