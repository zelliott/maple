zzso zzso are approximately 21 zzso zzso zzso that regulate gene expression in plants and zzso Most known plant zzso target zzso factors that influence cell fate determination, and biological functions of zzso regulation have been reported for four of 15 known zzso gene families: zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here, we identify a zzso role for zzso regulation of zzso zzso which zzso a family of zzso factors that includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso of a zzso version of zzso zzso from the zzso promoter causes zzso in zzso zzso zzso and floral development, including zzso orientation zzso reduction of zzso leaf zzso dramatically zzso zzso leaves, one to four extra zzso and one or two missing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso including zzso and floral organ zzso zzso zzso also leads to zzso not previously observed in zzso zzso zzso including leaf and stem zzso These likely reflect the zzso of other zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso for which zzso zzso products were zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso regulation of zzso is necessary for normal zzso zzso and floral zzso They also show that proper zzso dosage or zzso is required for separation of adjacent zzso zzso and floral zzso thus implicating zzso as a common regulatory component of the molecular zzso that controls the separation of different developing zzso and thereby exposes a zzso layer of zzso gene regulation during plant zzso
