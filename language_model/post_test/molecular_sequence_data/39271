A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated from a zzso pond located within the campus of Seoul National University, zzso Analysis of its zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso belongs to the family zzso and is closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso and to other members of the zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso and pH ranges for growth were zzso degrees C and pH zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The major fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated that strain zzso could be assigned to the zzso zzso but distinguished from recognized species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore proposed as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
