Following the identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as major human zzso virus zzso factors produced by zzso T cells, several zzso receptors were found to serve as membrane zzso for zzso zzso zzso The two most widely used zzso thus far zzso zzso and zzso are expressed by both activated T zzso and zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso is used zzso by zzso zzso and zzso strains and by zzso zzso virus zzso whereas zzso a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso is used by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso Other receptors with a more restricted cellular distribution, such as zzso zzso and zzso can also function as zzso for selected viral zzso The third variable region zzso of the zzso envelope zzso of zzso has been fingered as a critical zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we document a consistent pattern of evolution of viral zzso usage and sensitivity to zzso suppression in a zzso follow-up of children with progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained during the zzso stages generally used only zzso as a zzso and were inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso By contrast, the majority of the zzso derived after the progression of the disease were resistant to zzso zzso having acquired the ability to use zzso and, in some cases, zzso while gradually losing zzso zzso Surprisingly, most of these zzso were also insensitive to zzso even when used in combination with zzso An early acquisition of zzso usage predicted a poor zzso In children who progressed to AIDS without a shift to zzso zzso all the sequential zzso were zzso but showed a reduced sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso domain of zzso were associated with the loss of sensitivity to zzso zzso and the shift in zzso zzso These results suggest an zzso evolution of zzso in zzso leading to escape from the control of the zzso zzso zzso
