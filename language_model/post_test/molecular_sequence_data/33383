A recent analysis of the human zzso zzso confirmed the expression of zzso zzso type zzso and terminal zzso sequences previously implicated in the suppression of the innate and zzso immune responses, zzso In this study, zzso analysis of seminal plasma zzso derived from four fertile men was carried out to determine if the same sequences were expressed on the zzso and zzso of human seminal plasma zzso Three major families of zzso were zzso zzso high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex type zzso with antennae terminated with zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex type zzso with antennae capped with zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso revealed Core 1 and Core 2 type structures that are also zzso or zzso or a combination of zzso The same high zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso are also present in seminal zzso zzso type zzso expression is greatly decreased compared to zzso while zzso zzso are abundant in some individuals and minor in zzso In zzso the zzso profile of seminal plasma zzso is consistent with the zzso of the zzso but not the innate arm of the human immune zzso
