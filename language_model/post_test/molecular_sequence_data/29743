The zzso of zzso zzso which combine characteristics of both zzso and zzso zzso is currently of high zzso In particular, it is not clear whether delivery of membrane proteins to the zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso or some novel targeting zzso zzso expression of zzso has established that this membrane protein contains targeting signals for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso is therefore an ideal probe with which to determine the signals required for targeting to zzso zzso We have exploited zzso zzso and zzso zzso to monitor targeting of zzso expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The exposure of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso was also determined as a third monitor of zzso zzso zzso Our data show that zzso accumulates in zzso zzso of zzso cells using those zzso sequences previously found to be sufficient for targeting to conventional zzso This work highlights the similar sorting signals used for targeting of membrane proteins to conventional zzso and zzso zzso
