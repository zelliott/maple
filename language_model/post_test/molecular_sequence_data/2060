A comprehensive range of chemical zzso and zzso was employed to investigate the interaction of the antibiotics zzso and zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso complex and with the zzso zzso Both antibiotics block processes associated with the zzso zzso but differ in their effects on zzso zzso which is inhibited by zzso and zzso by zzso The interaction sites of both drugs were shown to occur within the zzso sequences zzso within the protein zzso binding site on zzso zzso This region of the zzso structure is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the stringent zzso No effects of drug binding were detected elsewhere in the zzso zzso In general, the two drugs afforded zzso zzso similar protection from the chemical and zzso zzso in zzso with their similar modes of zzso One important exception, however, occurred at zzso zzso within a terminal loop where zzso protected the zzso position while zzso rendered it more zzso This difference zzso with the opposite effects of the two antibiotics on zzso zzso
