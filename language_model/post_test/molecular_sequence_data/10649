A novel zzso was isolated from zzso soil and was studied zzso and zzso zzso of this zzso were gram positive, not acid fast, zzso zzso irregular zzso to short rod zzso and zzso The cell wall zzso contained zzso and was zzso via an zzso zzso zzso The major zzso was zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unknown zzso zzso acids were zzso The cellular fatty acid profile was complex, with large amounts of saturated and zzso zzso acids and smaller amounts of iso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was 66 zzso Comparative zzso zzso DNA studies revealed that strain zzso zzso represents a novel lineage within zzso zzso distinct from all previously described zzso and most closely related to members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the family zzso On the basis of our results, we suggest that strain zzso zzso should be classified in a new zzso and species, for which we propose the name zzso zzso The type strain and the only strain of the zzso and species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
