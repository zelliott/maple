The production and zzso of asexual spores in a diverse group of zzso play a crucial role in their infection zzso These processes are regulated by a set of zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in the production, zzso zzso and differentiation of zzso In this study, we identified and characterized the zzso zzso which is the first zzso gene identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso has two zzso zzso protein 6 zzso Single zzso zzso and zzso variations were detected in the coding region of zzso among five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was expressed at the highest level in resting zzso of zzso and gradually decreased after zzso and zzso However, at zzso at the stage of forming large amounts of zzso on leaves, the amount of zzso zzso was sharply increased but only zzso that of resting zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was located in the zzso of zzso The results suggest that zzso may play a role in formation or survival of zzso zzso
