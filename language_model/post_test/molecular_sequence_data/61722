During zzso zzso zzso development, the anchor cell zzso in the zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso precursor cells zzso and thereby inducing and patterning zzso Previous studies with zzso zzso and zzso expression have revealed that the level of zzso in the zzso must be precisely regulated for proper zzso zzso To understand how zzso expression is achieved in the zzso we identified a 59 zzso zzso zzso sufficient to activate zzso zzso solely in the zzso The zzso contains two zzso zzso and one zzso nuclear hormone zzso zzso binding site that is zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that both zzso and the zzso binding site are necessary to express zzso in the zzso In zzso zzso studies and in zzso functional zzso indicate that distinct zzso factors, including the zzso zzso zzso and unidentified nuclear hormone zzso are necessary for zzso zzso in the zzso and thus are involved in zzso zzso
