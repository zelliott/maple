zzso zzso discovery and validation are crucial for diagnosis, zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso approaches bring new insights in this zzso In particular, the combination of zzso in array format with mass zzso efficiently extends the classical zzso format and includes molecular zzso Here, we coupled surface zzso resonance imaging zzso with zzso mass zzso in a zzso technique which enables zzso zzso of binding by zzso and molecular characterization of interacting partners by subsequent zzso zzso This adds zzso because zzso enables differentiation of molecules that are difficult to distinguish by use of zzso for example zzso zzso or protein zzso Proof of concept was established for zzso zzso and characterization of a potential breast cancer marker, the zzso zzso at zzso added to human zzso The zzso performance of this new method, dubbed zzso was established, particularly its specificity zzso zzso 10) and reliability zzso zzso identification with high significant mascot score zzso The adjusted format for zzso collective, and automated zzso zzso analysis is robust at the zzso level and has numerous potential applications in zzso
