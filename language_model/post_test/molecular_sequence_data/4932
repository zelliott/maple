zzso are involved in the execution of cell death in all zzso organisms so far zzso including the zzso worm, fruit fly and zzso While zzso zzso has only a single identified zzso zzso whose activity is absolutely required for all zzso programmed cell deaths, most zzso cell types express multiple zzso with varying zzso The fruit fly zzso zzso is genetically zzso less complex than zzso and possesses two known zzso zzso and zzso The fly may therefore provide a good model system for examining the hierarchy and relative roles of individual zzso in the execution of zzso We have examined the role of zzso in in zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso We show that zzso zzso made from zzso cells undergoing zzso induced by either zzso zzso expression or zzso treatment contain a zzso activity with zzso specificity which can cleave zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and which can trigger zzso zzso in isolated zzso Using zzso specific to zzso we show that zzso of zzso from these zzso is sufficient to remove most measurable in zzso zzso activity, and that zzso of zzso zzso to such zzso zzso restores zzso zzso We conclude that, at least in zzso cells, zzso can be the sole zzso zzso of zzso
