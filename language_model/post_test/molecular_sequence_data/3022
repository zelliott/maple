Two zzso have been cloned from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso DNA, each of which encodes the three core zzso of distinct zzso zzso c zzso The two zzso are only 72 to zzso similar to one another at the zzso level in the most zzso zzso One of these, zzso is induced zzso in the middle to late stages of zzso zzso Analysis of green fluorescent protein reporters indicates that this zzso is expressed specifically in zzso and zzso The other zzso zzso is induced only zzso following nitrogen zzso and is expressed in all zzso Surprisingly, a disruption zzso of zzso the gene zzso zzso I of the zzso zzso grows normally in the absence of combined zzso It is likely that zzso and/or two other putative terminal zzso present in the zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso are able to compensate for the loss of the zzso zzso in providing zzso for nitrogen fixation and maintaining a low oxygen level in zzso
