An ordered sequence of events occurs following tissue damage to bring about zzso One zzso involved in this process is zzso zzso rat linear incision and full zzso zzso models, we have investigated the ability of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to enhance tissue repair under normal and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso per zzso produced a significant zzso improvement in wound strength in a zzso zzso Similarly, a single application of zzso zzso zzso per zzso linear incision would significantly increased zzso strength approximately zzso at nine days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, in zzso rats, the application of zzso zzso per wound zzso or 517 did not significantly influence zzso zzso In the full zzso skin zzso wound model, a single application of zzso zzso zzso per wound at the time of surgery significantly reduced average wound area at days 3 and 5, when healing was impaired by zzso zzso zzso area was also reduced by zzso treatment at day 3 in the normal animal, but this effect was not statistically zzso We suggest zzso benefits of zzso and zzso may activate wound zzso proliferation or stimulate other cell types in the wound site through an zzso zzso
