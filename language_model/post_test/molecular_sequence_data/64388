zzso sequences of zzso hormone genes were amplified and examined for sequence divergence among members of three different zzso of the zzso zzso rainbow trout zzso zzso Atlantic salmon zzso zzso and Arctic zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso (formerly known as zzso and zzso were zzso similar in coding regions and zzso similar in zzso regions among zzso but comparisons within species between zzso and zzso were only zzso similar in coding regions and zzso similar in zzso zzso zzso in the parents of mapping families for each species allowed for linkage mapping of the zzso gene in all three species and the zzso gene in rainbow zzso zzso maps to linkage group 6 in rainbow trout, linkage group 16 in Atlantic salmon and linkage group 25 in Arctic zzso zzso mapped to linkage group 30 in rainbow zzso
