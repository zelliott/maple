Trace zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso zzso However, zzso recognition properties of zzso remain poorly zzso as most are zzso zzso without known zzso Here, we identify the first zzso for many zzso zzso and zzso these receptors into two zzso based on the zzso and binding preference for primary or zzso zzso Some mouse and rat zzso have similar response profiles, although independent zzso gene expansions led to highly related receptors with altered zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we identified an odor contact site in zzso zzso III that functions as a selectivity zzso zzso models based on the zzso zzso zzso structure indicate spatial proximity of this site to the zzso zzso zzso at this site created zzso receptors with radically altered odor recognition zzso These studies provide new zzso zzso valuable tools for studying zzso function, and general insights into the molecular pharmacology of G zzso zzso
