Five zzso bacterial zzso recovered from an outbreak that occurred in March 2006 in zzso Spain, affecting adult diseased cultured wedge sole zzso zzso zzso were characterized zzso and zzso in order to clarify their zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, the zzso were included in the zzso zzso within the zzso zzso species group, their closest relatives being the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The highest sequence similarities were recorded with the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso genes zzso and zzso clearly differentiated the zzso from currently described zzso species, the highest sequence similarities recorded to type strains being below zzso for both zzso zzso analysis using zzso sequences of the three genes showed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as the closest reference zzso zzso zzso zzso with related strains confirmed that these zzso belong to a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel species could be easily distinguished from zzso related species by several zzso zzso including gelatin zzso acid production from zzso and growth at zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the novel species is zzso for wedge zzso
