The zzso zzso represents carnivorous plants with pitcher traps capable of efficient prey capture and zzso The possible involvement of plant zzso in this process was studied in zzso zzso Two different types of zzso were identified in the liquid of closed traps exhibiting zzso specificity for either long zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into such closed sterile pitchers induced the appearance of additional zzso zzso with zzso specificity only for long zzso zzso No significant zzso zzso or zzso activity could be detected in the zzso or induced trap zzso Four genes representing two zzso of basic zzso zzso as zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso The main differences between the two zzso are the presence of a zzso hinge region only in zzso and a zzso putative zzso targeting extension only in zzso indicating different zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso evaluation of zzso levels showed that the zzso genes are zzso expressed in the zzso cells while zzso of zzso genes is induced by zzso zzso These results show for the first time the involvement of genes zzso zzso in zzso interaction and their differential expression and activity during prey zzso
