When bacteria cells are exposed to higher temperature, a set of zzso proteins zzso is induced rapidly and zzso to cope with increased damage in zzso The mechanism underlying induction of zzso has been a central issue in the zzso response and studied zzso in zzso zzso Immediately upon temperature zzso the cellular level of zzso 32 responsible for zzso of zzso genes increases rapidly and zzso The increase in zzso 32 results from both increased synthesis and stabilization of zzso 32, which is zzso very zzso A clue to further understanding of early regulatory events came from recent analysis of zzso induction and subsequent zzso of zzso 32 zzso Whereas a zzso region of zzso for zzso 32 is involved in the induction zzso by the zzso secondary structure, a distinct segment of zzso 32 zzso further downstream is involved in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 32 that may be mutually zzso
