zzso zzso showing brown felt blight were collected along zzso long zzso at the zzso in the Swiss zzso and zzso cultures were zzso zzso of the zzso 48 strains were zzso zzso based on sequence comparisons of the internal transcribed zzso zzso A zzso strain was tentatively identified as another, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso Most strains were from zzso zzso zzso zzso the rest from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each zzso was zzso by a different zzso as revealed by zzso zzso More than one clone was present on some needles and zzso Thus, importance of zzso zzso growth for zzso seems to be limited to the spread of the disease to zzso of the same tree or of immediately adjacent trees, and, consequently, zzso occurs mainly by zzso The zzso zzso strains could be assigned to five distinct groups based on the zzso zzso The strains from zzso zzso formed one of these groups but the other groups did not correlate with either host, zzso or position along the zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso factor zzso and ITS sequences confirmed the subdivision into five zzso zzso differentiation among groups was distinct with zzso values varying between zzso and zzso zzso zzso seems to be composed of several cryptic species, one of them specific to zzso zzso
