Gene expression plays an important role in determining the fate of zzso after zzso To identify additional genes that promote survival or execute programmed cell death in zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was constructed from zzso of rats subjected to global zzso With use of a differential screening technique, a zzso was identified that was zzso after zzso The zzso was found to have high zzso with human zzso H at both the zzso level zzso and the zzso acid level zzso Northern zzso detected zzso H zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso H message was found in zzso zzso in zzso zzso After zzso expression was increased primarily in the zzso zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso of zzso H zzso detected by western zzso of zzso zzso was increased after global zzso but expression of zzso B1 and D1 and other related cell cycle genes zzso and zzso was not zzso zzso H zzso was found exclusively within zzso After zzso there was increased zzso within zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso H is expressed in normal zzso zzso and expression is increased in zzso that are zzso yet zzso These results suggest that zzso H may have functions in zzso other than cell cycle regulation, including other known functions such as DNA zzso
