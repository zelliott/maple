There are two types of transcripts for the human zzso zzso zzso They are expressed in a zzso manner in human zzso and contain distinct zzso Previously, it had appeared that the two transcripts may have occurred through alternative zzso The transcript beta has two upstream zzso zzso which in zzso zzso zzso cells leads to a reduced level of zzso zzso When zzso sequence including sequences zzso to zzso start site, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, and coding sequence was inserted into an expression zzso zzso the resulting transcripts had the same overall structure as the transcripts present in human zzso zzso extension and zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends of zzso from zzso cells revealed the zzso start sites for these two transcripts occurred in what previously had been termed zzso These results were confirmed with similar analysis of zzso derived from human zzso Two zzso putative zzso boxes zzso and zzso are located upstream of the zzso start sites for transcripts alpha and zzso When the zzso boxes and their zzso sequences were fused to a zzso zzso gene containing zzso zzso both demonstrated strong promoter activity in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso A directs the synthesis of transcript zzso and promoter B directs the synthesis of transcript zzso zzso A contains a series of zzso elements between the putative zzso box and the zzso start, which accounts for a major portion of the promoter activity based on deletion and zzso zzso In general, promoter A is more active than promoter B in zzso zzso The zzso zzso box in promoter B plays a more important role in promoter activity than the zzso box in promoter zzso The human A1 zzso zzso gene appears to use two separate promoters to direct synthesis of distinct zzso which can then regulate the relative abundance of A1 zzso zzso in zzso We have zzso the human A1 zzso zzso gene structure based on these new zzso
