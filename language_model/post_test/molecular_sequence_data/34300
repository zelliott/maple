zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso proteins and play a key role in the regulation of zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for cancer and zzso zzso In this study we investigated the zzso effect and mechanism of action of zzso a class I zzso inhibitor with preference for zzso Both local and systemic administration of zzso zzso bone zzso in animal zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity of the early zzso marker zzso alkaline zzso zzso in bone tissue and zzso zzso By using a series of zzso promoter deletion zzso and a DNA affinity zzso zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso as a factor that binds to the zzso response element in the zzso zzso We also found that zzso binding to the zzso response element is crucial for zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso physically zzso with a subset of zzso zzso and zzso whose protein levels were zzso by zzso and forced expression of these zzso blunted the zzso effects of zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results of our study show that zzso zzso zzso zzso by decreasing the interaction of zzso with zzso which can at least in part contribute to the bone anabolic effects of zzso
