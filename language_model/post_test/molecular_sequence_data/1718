zzso influenza virus caused a pandemic in 1957 and has the possibility to cause outbreaks in the zzso To assess the evolutionary characteristics of zzso influenza viruses isolated from migratory ducks that zzso in zzso Japan, on their zzso of migration from zzso in 2001, we investigated the zzso relationships among these viruses and avian and human viruses described zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene of zzso zzso and the PA gene of zzso zzso belonged to the American lineage of avian virus and that the other genes of the zzso belonged to the zzso zzso These results indicate that the internal protein genes might be transmitted from American to zzso avian zzso Thus, it is further confirmed that zzso transmission of influenza viruses occurred between the North American and zzso zzso The fact that zzso could be generated in the migratory ducks between North American and zzso avian virus lineage further stresses the importance of global surveillance among the migratory zzso
