zzso were designed to clone and identify genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed at high levels during growth on the compatible host zzso zzso when compared with expression in zzso zzso A zzso clone zzso that zzso zzso to a zzso probe prepared from infected leaves was isolated by the differential screening of a zzso library from a zzso zzso culture of zzso zzso The DNA sequence of zzso is highly zzso to genes for zzso zzso zzso in other zzso zzso contained all of the zzso regions assigned as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso sequences indicated that in zzso zzso the zzso gene is present as a single copy with three zzso To our knowledge this is the first report of the cloning of a zzso from a zzso zzso A second clone zzso was also isolated and represented a partial zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Because zzso did not zzso to plant zzso under zzso zzso conditions, it was used as a reference to zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso during zzso in zzso zzso compared to zzso growth in zzso zzso The results indicated that elevated expression of zzso occurred during zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso particularly at early stages of infection where expression was about zzso higher than during growth in rich culture zzso This work also demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso fragments, such as zzso have considerable utility as a reference for zzso pathogen gene expression in infected zzso
