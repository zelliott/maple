zzso can both stimulate zzso via the zzso sequence as well as inhibit gene expression via zzso Certain viral and cellular proteins can abrogate the zzso stimulation of zzso by physical zzso In addition, it has been shown that the large zzso protein of zzso type 12 zzso zzso zzso can block the zzso zzso potential of zzso without binding to zzso Here we show that this zzso protein also can prevent the repression of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in transient zzso In cells containing zzso zzso but zzso expressing high levels of zzso zzso no induction of zzso zzso after X-ray zzso could be zzso In contrast, expression of another zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso of an zzso shift zzso indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cannot be explained by zzso of the zzso capacity of zzso A biological consequence of expression of zzso zzso is the loss of zzso zzso arrest after X-ray zzso while cells expressing the zzso zzso still arrest in zzso after DNA zzso
