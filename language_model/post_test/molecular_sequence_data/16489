Members of the zzso zzso Factor 2 zzso family of zzso factors play key roles in the development and differentiation of numerous cell types during zzso development, including the vascular zzso zzso is expressed very early in the development of the zzso and genetic studies in mice have demonstrated that zzso is required for vascular zzso However, the zzso pathways involving zzso during zzso cell development have not been zzso As a first step towards identifying the zzso factors upstream of zzso in the vascular zzso we screened for zzso enhancers from the mouse zzso gene that regulate vascular expression in zzso In this study, we identified a zzso zzso from the mouse zzso gene sufficient to direct expression to the vascular zzso in transgenic zzso This zzso is active in zzso cells within the developing vascular system from very early stages in zzso and the zzso remains robustly active in the vascular zzso during zzso and in zzso This zzso zzso cell zzso contains four perfect consensus zzso zzso factor binding sites that are efficiently bound by zzso protein in zzso and are required for zzso function in transgenic zzso Thus, these studies identify zzso as a direct zzso target of zzso factors via an zzso zzso zzso zzso and establish a direct link between these two early regulators of vascular gene expression during zzso cell development in zzso
