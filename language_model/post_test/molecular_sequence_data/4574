zzso is an zzso member of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso implicated in zzso extension in the course of embryonic zzso Here we have isolated and characterized the gene zzso chicken zzso zzso of zzso sequences with zzso sequences provides the structure and zzso of zzso boundaries and indicates that zzso zzso are generated by alternative zzso of its zzso The zzso gene is composed of 33 zzso distributed over 72 zzso Each of the six zzso and five zzso zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso While zzso between zzso are of phase 1, others are of phase 0, 1, or zzso Alternative zzso of zzso is zzso regulated as shown by zzso chain reaction zzso Furthermore, zzso libraries from long range zzso chain zzso zzso of zzso were used to examine and zzso the distribution of alternatively spliced zzso in individual zzso zzso We found 50 different zzso zzso at different zzso stages and revealed the existence of one major zzso in comparison with multiple zzso zzso zzso
