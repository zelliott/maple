Although most zzso events appear to be modulated by zzso protein zzso little is known about the role of this regulatory system during the development of zzso zzso Here we have studied the zzso protein zzso zzso 1 and 2A in the early embryonic rat kidney with regard to expression and effects on growth and zzso All zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso expressed in 15-day embryonic zzso zzso (in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso for zzso zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso was detected only in zzso stem cells in the outer cortical zzso zzso is a novel marker for these zzso The abundance of the zzso zzso confirmed with zzso was high in the embryonic zzso In organ culture of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited growth and zzso formation zzso zzso effect at 6 zzso zzso 10 zzso had little effect on the growth of cultured zzso zzso whereas zzso formation was disturbed and zzso evidence of zzso was zzso In zzso this study points towards important roles for protein zzso 1 and/or 2A in regulation of zzso activity in the early embryonic zzso
