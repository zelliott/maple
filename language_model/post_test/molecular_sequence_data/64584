Many commonly used drugs, such as zzso and zzso can generate a very unique type of DNA damage, namely zzso zzso zzso An zzso can severely block DNA replication and zzso and cause programmed cell zzso The molecular mechanism of repairing the zzso damage has not been well zzso We have studied the role of zzso zzso zzso group zzso protein in zzso zzso DNA repair and zzso The results obtained from our zzso studies revealed a very similar zzso frequency in both human normal zzso cells and zzso zzso The zzso zzso generated in both cells, however, were very different: most of the zzso generated in the normal zzso cells were zzso zzso whereas most of the zzso generated in the zzso cells were zzso zzso When a zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso zzso into the zzso cells, the zzso zzso were increased and the zzso zzso were zzso We also determined the DNA repair capability of the zzso cells using both the zzso zzso and the in zzso DNA repair zzso The results obtained from the zzso zzso experiments revealed an effective zzso of a zzso reporter gene from the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The results obtained from the in zzso DNA repair experiments demonstrated that the zzso nuclear extract is normal in introducing dual incisions during the zzso zzso repair zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein has important roles in the zzso zzso DNA repair and zzso
