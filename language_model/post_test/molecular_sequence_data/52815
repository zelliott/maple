We have investigated the zzso domain compartment in living cells by zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso engineered to contain a nuclear zzso signal zzso coupled to the green fluorescent zzso In human zzso zzso cells, this zzso protein was deposited in zzso zzso both at 37 degrees C, the zzso temperature for assembly of the zzso zzso and 28 degrees C, the optimal temperature for zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso protein was assembly zzso However, when zzso into a zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso as a fluorescent zzso into the structures formed by zzso and allowed us to zzso the outgrowth of the zzso fibers after a temperature shift to 28 degrees C in living zzso In particular, we followed the zzso outgrowth of fibers from nuclear dots, first connecting two dots each and with time three and more, eventually generating a zzso restricted fiber system consisting of few zzso zzso zzso the zzso Virtually identical results were obtained when the temperature was lowered only to 30 and 32 degrees C, zzso An engineered human zzso without need for temperature shift, formed seemingly identical patterns of nuclear zzso at 37 degrees C in three additionally zzso human cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso When the zzso zzso pair 8 and 18 was expressed in the nucleus via an engineered zzso in the zzso 18 zzso more zzso extended filament zzso were zzso zzso in zzso experiments with zzso zzso we observed that the formation of these zzso networks at 37 degrees C initiated from dots that nearly entirely zzso with the zzso zzso zzso After a shift to 28 degrees C, extending zzso zzso and zzso filaments frequently followed the same path through the zzso These data indicate that zzso cells contain a seemingly zzso accessible zzso zzso
