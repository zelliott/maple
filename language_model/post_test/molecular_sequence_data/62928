Multiple zzso as well as zzso closely related to them have been characterized previously from many insect species and the corresponding zzso have been zzso However, the identification of the entire assortment of genes for zzso family proteins and their differences in zzso properties have not been carried out in any individual insect zzso The completion of the entire DNA sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and identification of open reading frames presents an opportunity to study the structures and functions of zzso zzso and also to identify new members of this family in zzso We are, therefore, interested in studying the functional zzso of zzso gene families in zzso 

We searched the zzso protein sequences database using fully characterized insect zzso sequences and zzso software, identified all the putative zzso proteins zzso in zzso zzso and predicted their structures using domain analysis zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso proteins from zzso and several other insect species was carried zzso The structures of these zzso were modeled using zzso modeling zzso 

Our analysis revealed the presence of 18 zzso proteins in the zzso protein zzso Among these are seven novel zzso proteins that contain four signature zzso acid sequences of zzso belonging to family 18 zzso including both zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso critical for zzso zzso All the proteins contain at least one zzso domain with one having four zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso proteins from zzso and other insects revealed an evolutionary relationship among all these zzso which indicated gene zzso and domain zzso to generate the observed diversity in the zzso zzso zzso modeling showed that all the zzso zzso proteins contain one or more zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that insects zzso multiple family 18 zzso zzso and also zzso zzso proteins for zzso to zzso in different insect anatomical zzso structures, such as the zzso zzso zzso trachea and mouth parts during insect development, and possibly for other roles including zzso zzso
