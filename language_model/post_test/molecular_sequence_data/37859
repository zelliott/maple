zzso induced to zzso with zzso in a zzso zzso extract organize into zzso zzso in a zzso process that is driven by zzso zzso and structural zzso These zzso zzso accurately reflect the zzso aspects of zzso zzso pole zzso We show here that zzso zzso gene zzso is an abundant component of these zzso We have prepared zzso zzso and show by zzso that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is severely inhibited in the absence of zzso and silver stain analysis of the zzso zzso indicates that it is not present in a zzso complex and is the only protein removed from the extract during zzso Furthermore, the reduction in zzso zzso efficiency in the absence of zzso is dependent on zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a major constituent of zzso zzso assembled in a zzso zzso extract and that it is required for robust zzso zzso in an zzso manner in this system even though zzso is zzso These data, coupled with zzso and genetic data derived from analysis of zzso proteins in other organisms, indicate that zzso is a key factor regulating zzso dynamics during zzso
