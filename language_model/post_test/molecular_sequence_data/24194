The suppression of plant zzso reactions plays a crucial role in causing plant zzso In this report, we show that zzso plant zzso are zzso during the development of zzso leaf spot zzso In the early phase of infection of sugar beet zzso zzso zzso leaves with the zzso fungus zzso zzso , a reduction in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso genes was zzso zzso reduction was found at the transcript and zzso activity zzso In order to zzso the signal zzso process responsible for suppression, the zzso promoter was zzso An zzso zzso and zzso deletion series of the promoter was zzso using transient zzso zzso which showed that the activity of a truncated promoter from positions zzso to zzso relative to the zzso starting site, retains approximately 30 of the activity of the full-length zzso The region within the zzso promoter required for the reduction in zzso was identified as being positions zzso to zzso with respect to the start of the zzso This region is equivalent to the core promoter, zzso by the zzso an zzso zzso and an unknown downstream element in the region between zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso plant zzso responses are zzso during the development of zzso leaf spot disease and zzso the PAL core promoter is involved in the detection of the repression zzso
