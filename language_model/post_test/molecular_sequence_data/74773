zzso plays an important role during zzso wound zzso zzso mice were generated using the zzso zzso to direct expression of zzso human zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in which the zzso domain zzso was truncated at zzso 331 and the zzso zzso binding motif was zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso transgenic mice exhibited a normal zzso while zzso zzso transgenic mice were born with tails of normal zzso but three to eight days after birth their tails zzso leaving only a short tail zzso The tissue zzso in the tail started between zzso zzso with zzso of bone and zzso tissue zzso to the zzso which was replaced with zzso tissue heavily infiltrated with inflammatory zzso The tail zzso site revealed zzso in enlarged vessels and marked zzso that eventually led to loss of the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the mice exhibited focal skin blemishes and inflammation that exhibited an increase in the number of zzso zzso and blood vessels, enlargement of the hair zzso due to increased number of zzso reduction in the zzso tissue content, and a zzso of the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of the zzso from tail tissue in the transgenic mice indicated a loss of the cell zzso markers zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso expression of a zzso zzso of zzso has effects on zzso of the zzso tissue in the tail, as well as the maintenance of the zzso and its zzso
