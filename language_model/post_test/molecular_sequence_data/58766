We have constructed a zzso infectious zzso zzso lacking the signals for addition of three zzso zzso situated in the zzso C4 and zzso regions of zzso zzso When comparing zzso virus with zzso virus we found essentially no differences in the zzso characteristics of the two viruses except for the expected zzso mobility shift of zzso zzso zzso resulting from the missing zzso Thus, the zzso zzso and the capacity to induce zzso were similar for the two zzso The sensitivity of zzso and zzso virus to a number of zzso agents was zzso As expected, the zzso virus was significantly less sensitive to zzso by Con A, with affinity for the zzso zzso We found, however, that zzso to the zzso loop and zzso neutralized zzso virus as efficiently as zzso virus, whereas zzso a zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding to the zzso domain, neutralized zzso virus better than zzso zzso zzso the data suggest that the three zzso zzso zzso despite their location in immediate association with the zzso domain, which is an important zzso zzso are not essential for virus replication in cell culture and they are not engaged in shielding zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso However, the zzso evidently influence the three-dimensional zzso of zzso since their presence increases the availability of the zzso zzso of zzso
