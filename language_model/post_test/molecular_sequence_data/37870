Scaffolding proteins are required for high zzso assembly of most high T number zzso viruses such as the large zzso and the zzso zzso They function by zzso binding and positioning the coat protein zzso during zzso zzso In both zzso zzso and the zzso the extreme scaffold C zzso is highly charged, is predicted to be an zzso zzso and is sufficient to bind the coat zzso suggesting a common mode of zzso zzso studies show that the coat zzso domain of zzso scaffolding protein exhibits a zzso motif stabilized by a zzso zzso One face of the motif is characterized by a high density of positive charges that could interact with the coat protein through zzso zzso zzso from previous studies with a zzso zzso and the observed salt sensitivity of the assembly process are explained by the zzso zzso
