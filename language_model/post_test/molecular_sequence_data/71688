A general problem in comparative modeling and protein design is the zzso evaluation of zzso with a certain sequence in specific environmental protein zzso zzso of different sequences and structures on similar scaffolds are common in the zzso Data Bank zzso In order to explore both structural and sequential diversity of them, a data base of zzso connecting similar secondary structure fragments is constructed by searching the data base of families of structurally similar proteins and zzso A total of 84 loop families having zzso zzso are found among the zzso structures of resolution better than zzso zzso Eight zzso 20 zzso 19 zzso and 37 zzso families are zzso Every family contains more than 5 loop zzso In each family, no zzso share same sequence and all the zzso are well zzso zzso new loop classes are distinguished in the data zzso The structural zzso of zzso in zzso proteins are examined and shown in 44 zzso zzso families are characterized with geometric parameters and sequence zzso The zzso of zzso in each family are clustered into zzso using average linkage cluster analysis zzso Information such as geometric properties, sequence profile, sequential and structural zzso in loop, structural alignment zzso sequence similarities, and zzso results are zzso zzso between the zzso of zzso and loop zzso motif zzso and global sequence of zzso chain are examined in order to find how loop structures depend on their sequences and how they are affected by the local and global zzso Strong correlations (R zzso zzso are only found in 24 zzso The best R value is zzso The data base is available through the zzso
