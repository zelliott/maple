Continuous replication of human zzso virus type I zzso requires balanced expression of spliced and zzso zzso in the zzso This process is regulated zzso by the zzso Rev zzso An important prerequisite for Rev responsiveness is the presence of weak zzso sites in the viral zzso We have investigated the zzso of the second zzso of the zzso zzso transcript in zzso and show that the zzso site region is responsible for the inefficient zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso site is highly functional in combination with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transcript in nuclear extract leads to a rapid zzso of 50 S zzso zzso zzso These complexes contain mainly zzso and U2 small nuclear zzso and are formed independently of the presence of the downstream zzso zzso The zzso zzso which do proceed through the first zzso step, zzso primarily a zzso as the branch zzso zzso zzso comparison with other zzso zzso suggests that zzso other than zzso are commonly used as branch points in these zzso
