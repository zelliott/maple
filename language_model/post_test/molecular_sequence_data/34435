zzso are very often modular zzso composed of one or more zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso connected by a flexible zzso zzso Usually, when these proteins are processed they lose their zzso zzso Here, the role of the zzso regions and zzso or zzso zzso in the processing of zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with different zzso lengths were tested, these being unable to avoid protein zzso Moreover, several fusion proteins between the zzso and zzso zzso were obtained and their zzso stability was zzso We demonstrate that zzso processing takes place even in the complete absence of the zzso zzso We also show that the specific zzso module determines this zzso in the proteins zzso
