Assuming that the L-shaped three-dimensional structure of zzso is an architectural framework allowing the proper presentation of identity zzso to zzso zzso implies that altered and/or simplified zzso zzso can fulfill this role and be functional zzso of these zzso provided they contain correctly located identity zzso In this work, this paradigm was submitted to new experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso was the model zzso and the extent to which the zzso structural framework of zzso zzso can be altered without losing its ability to be zzso was zzso Three novel zzso recognized by the zzso were zzso The first resembles that of zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso The second lacks both the zzso and zzso and the zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso The third structure is a construct in which the zzso and zzso zzso are joined by two zzso zzso specificity of these zzso is verified by the loss of zzso activity upon zzso of the putative identity zzso zzso data indicate that the first two zzso are mimics of the whole zzso zzso while the third one behaves as an zzso zzso zzso zzso confirm the primordial role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and demonstrate that neither a zzso structure in the zzso domain nor the presence of a zzso or zzso is mandatory for specific zzso but that activity relies on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso
