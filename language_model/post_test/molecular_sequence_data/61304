zzso belongs to a cluster of human zinc finger genes residing within a zzso region at zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso preceding zzso domain, a potent zzso repression motif present in hundreds of zzso zinc finger protein zzso composed of two protein zzso A and zzso Three zzso placed at identical positions in zzso zzso interrupt four zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso and the remaining coding region zzso to the zzso zinc finger zzso Since the zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by dedicated zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso skipping may lead to differential usage of these zzso in alternative gene zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that, while skipping of the zzso and/or zzso zzso was not zzso the use of alternative zzso sites upstream of the zzso zzso generates multiple zzso transcripts potentially zzso zzso differing in the zzso region and expressed in different zzso The expression pattern in cell hybrids containing either active or inactive X zzso indicates that zzso which resides within a region of the X zzso that includes genes that are both subject to and escape zzso is susceptible to zzso zzso
