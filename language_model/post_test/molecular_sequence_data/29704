In this study, we describe the characterization of a gene zzso a novel zzso zzso named zzso zzso encodes a relatively zzso basic zzso zzso Its five tandem zzso zinc finger motifs exhibit the highest zzso to those of members of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso microscopic analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso to the zzso Analysis of the zzso structure of the zzso gene showed that it is composed of 6 zzso separated by 5 zzso spanning a zzso region of more than zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso mapped the mouse zzso gene to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene encodes a zzso transcript that is most abundant in adult mouse zzso By in zzso zzso expression was localized to zzso and neural tube, and during zzso development predominantly to the zzso zzso precursor of the collecting zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso deletion zzso identified a novel zzso function zzso at the N zzso The zzso of zzso through this zzso domain was totally suppressed by two zzso functions just downstream from the zzso One of the zzso functions is contained within the first zinc finger zzso The level of zzso zzso and repression varied with the cell line tested, which might be due to differences in cell zzso expression of zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso behaves as a zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso functions may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression during embryonic zzso
