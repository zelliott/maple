zzso A from the zzso zzso zzso zzso displays many structural differences compared with zzso A of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A lacks the usual zzso and zzso groups but is zzso with a zzso acid zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso A often contains an zzso acid zzso in place of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences also exist in the secondary zzso chains attached to zzso coli versus zzso zzso zzso A, specifically the presence of zzso and the absence of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Recently, we have found that zzso A isolated by pH zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells is more zzso than previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso White, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso zzso zzso A species lacking the zzso zzso zzso on the zzso unit contribute to this zzso We now describe a zzso zzso from zzso zzso that removes a single zzso zzso zzso from some zzso A zzso including zzso X, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso does not cleave zzso coli zzso A or zzso A precursors containing an zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso is not present in extracts of zzso coli or zzso zzso but it is readily zzso in zzso of zzso zzso which also contains a significant proportion of zzso zzso A zzso zzso reaction rates are seen between pH zzso and zzso The zzso requires a zzso zzso and zzso metal zzso for zzso It zzso the zzso zzso X at about zzso the rate of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso reaction product, generated with zzso zzso as the zzso confirms unequivocally that the zzso zzso only the zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso
