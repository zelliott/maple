zzso zzso Poly zzso zzso T cells of narrowly defined fine specificity as represented by the two zzso T cell zzso zzso and zzso Both these zzso recognize the minimum zzso zzso sequence zzso We have characterized the zzso involved in the recognition of zzso zzso by these zzso with synthetic peptides and discovered a distinct functional hierarchy for the zzso in the zzso Even with the repeating zzso zzso which is recognized by zzso cells, the zzso that are essential cluster near the middle of the sequence but not near the zzso or zzso zzso Different zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso were found for each of the zzso The results suggest that different T cells either recognize different parts of the zzso zzso complex or that the zzso binds to zzso in multiple zzso This was supported by the fact that Poly zzso is zzso but the peptides used here showed only a slight propensity to adopt this structure and it did not correlate with their functional zzso We also found that zzso does not compete with zzso in the stimulation of zzso cells despite its obvious capacity to interact with zzso when it stimulates zzso zzso This may be because these peptides have a low affinity for zzso and therefore only appropriate zzso interactions would stabilize the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso interaction appears to be a dynamic process which allows recognition of different zzso of a T cell zzso by different T zzso
