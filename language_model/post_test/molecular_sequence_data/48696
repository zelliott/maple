Plants differ greatly in their zzso to insect zzso suggesting both local adaptation and resistance zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lines to map a quantitative trait locus zzso for the zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the same locus was also associated with high levels of zzso zzso zzso and low levels of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso with candidate genes from the region of the zzso identified three zzso zzso that convert zzso to zzso Variation in zzso production was attributed to a natural zzso family zzso zzso that zzso zzso in zzso lines with low zzso zzso When tested with a population of 26 diverse zzso zzso lines, zzso zzso produced more progeny on those with high zzso and low zzso Although zzso was more toxic to zzso zzso than zzso in zzso zzso activity and the resulting decline of zzso upon zzso to zzso were associated with reduced zzso deposition as an zzso defense response in zzso Thus, a natural zzso zzso appears to mediate an ecologically relevant zzso between the direct toxicity and zzso properties of zzso zzso
