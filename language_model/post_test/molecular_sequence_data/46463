The zzso detection reaction zzso associated with universal zzso zzso uses a zzso zzso probe zzso and a zzso zzso probe to detect single zzso zzso in DNA target zzso When used for zzso the zzso technique uses two zzso each specific to an zzso and zzso with a different zzso The fluorescent signals are processed to calculate the zzso The uneven zzso of zzso due to zzso and zzso cycles and the zzso unequal zzso level can lead to erroneous zzso zzso To circumvent this problem, an indirect zzso strategy was developed based on the substitution of the zzso with zzso 22 zzso universal zzso sequences zzso zzso is achieved with zzso zzso zzso complementary to the zzso zzso The strategy improved the uniformity in probe zzso and generated results comparable to those using zzso zzso as shown by zzso 22 zzso sites in 70 samples with both zzso This method can be easily implemented in the routine screening with zzso or other zzso Moreover, the approach results in a significant cost reduction over traditional direct zzso and offers the possibility to interchange zzso and to increase the fluorescent signal by using zzso zzso
