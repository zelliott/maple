zzso zzso zzso also including zzso zzso of artificially contaminated milk, could be identified by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using zzso zzso designed according to zzso parts of the zzso zzso gene and, after sequencing, according to zzso zzso parts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region and with zzso zzso detecting an internal zzso of the group G zzso zzso factor gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor gene zzso zzso zzso could be used together in a multiplex zzso No zzso could be observed with other group G zzso zzso or with any of the other control strains of various zzso species and zzso The zzso methods presented in this study allowed a rapid and reliable identification of zzso zzso and might help to improve the diagnosis of this bacterial species in animal and human zzso
