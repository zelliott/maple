zzso comparison of zzso to the human zzso generally associated with AIDS revealed a closer relationship to zzso than to zzso A common feature zzso zzso and zzso from zzso is the size of the zzso portion of the zzso which is smaller zzso in zzso and zzso than in zzso zzso The presence of this truncated form of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso is apparently related to the presence of a translation termination zzso in the zzso gene of all zzso zzso analyzed as well as in one zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso of the envelope zzso protein has been implicated in the zzso effect of zzso in zzso we decided to investigate whether putative expression of the open reading frame located after the termination zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso in zzso We generated two synthetic peptides from the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso and tested their zzso by Western zzso against the zzso of naturally and zzso infected monkeys as well as against zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the protein zzso from this open reading frame is expressed in zzso since an zzso can be detected against the synthetic peptides in two of three zzso zzso zzso However, no correlation can be found between its expression and disease progression at this zzso Furthermore, a rabbit immune serum raised against the synthetic zzso failed to identify any specific protein in zzso zzso
