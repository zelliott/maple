The available zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso show the presence of a closely zzso segment in the middle of the light chain zzso 50 zzso which is the zzso active portion of the zzso This segment contains the zinc binding motif of zzso zzso Atomic zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso A, B, and zzso made on the basis of this observation demonstrated the presence of one zinc zzso of zzso zzso zzso were found for the removal of the zinc zzso with zzso agents and for the restoration of the normal metal zzso The zzso segment, which includes the zinc binding zzso was zzso and shown to bind zzso Chemical modification experiments indicated that two zzso and no zzso are involved in zzso coordination in agreement with a probable zzso role for the zinc zzso The present findings suggest the possibility that zzso zzso are zinc zzso
