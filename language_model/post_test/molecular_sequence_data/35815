zzso of zzso may represent new alternatives in the treatment of cardiovascular zzso Recent investigations have linked the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso However, since zzso converting zzso zzso is widely recognized to contribute to the zzso clearance of zzso we characterized the specificity of zzso towards zzso We also determined whether zzso zzso the conversion of zzso I zzso I) to zzso II by pulmonary zzso The zzso activity toward the synthetic zzso zzso zzso was measured in zzso using both a zzso lung preparation and pooled rat zzso The zzso activity was inhibited at increasing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso competitively inhibited pulmonary zzso with a Ki of zzso zzso In rat serum, zzso also competitively inhibited zzso The zzso of zzso I into zzso II by pulmonary zzso was inhibited to a similar extent by both zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso These findings are the first to show that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso also zzso zzso We suggest that the reported zzso actions of zzso may be due to the reduction in both zzso metabolism and zzso II generation arising from the blockade of zzso
