zzso is a mouse zzso that is highly similar to the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies characterizing the zzso activity of zzso showed that this zzso like zzso inhibited the zzso zzso mast cell zzso and zzso zzso Using an expanded panel of zzso zzso zzso we now show that zzso like zzso inhibited zzso K, zzso zzso and V but not zzso B or zzso These interactions were characterized by zzso of zzso that were nearly zzso and zzso rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso site loop zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso employed different zzso centers to neutralize the zzso and zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso that serves as a dual inhibitor of both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso by employing an zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit both zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso may not be a recent event in zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that the zzso and zzso genes evolved from a common zzso approximately zzso million years zzso When the fact that zzso and birds zzso approximately 310 million years ago is considered, an ancestral zzso zzso with dual zzso activity may be present in many zzso zzso
