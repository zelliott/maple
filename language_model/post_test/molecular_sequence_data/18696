zzso is a tightly controlled degradation process of all zzso It includes the zzso of zzso contents and zzso within a zzso zzso zzso involves core zzso related zzso genes as well as genes regulating zzso zzso Previously, we analyzed the impact of proteins of the core zzso machinery zzso zzso and zzso on the sexual and zzso development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso While deletion of zzso and zzso abolished zzso formation and impaired zzso growth, zzso is required for zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein sorting 34 zzso and its zzso membrane targeting unit, the protein zzso zzso have been shown to be important regulators of zzso and zzso protein zzso However, their exact role in zzso zzso remains zzso To determine the function of zzso and zzso we isolated genes with high sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso For both genes we were not able to generate a zzso knockout zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso are required for zzso Furthermore, we analyzed the repertoire of zzso genes zzso by zzso zzso and could identify putative zzso of nearly all of the 61 zzso genes of zzso zzso
