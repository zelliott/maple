A novel zzso gene has been isolated, cloned and zzso A zzso amplified zzso of the gene was originally identified from human zzso DNA, and the full-length zzso was subsequently isolated from zzso cells and zzso The novel zzso is very high in protein sequence similarity zzso to the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso but contains substantial differences in the zzso site loop zzso including a different zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso The gene product, named zzso is expressed in zzso cells, zzso cells and human zzso The protein has a predicted zzso of zzso and an zzso point of zzso which is consistent with the more zzso form of zzso associated with zzso cell zzso
