An zzso gene zzso zzso from race 3 of zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The gene corresponded to a single open reading frame of zzso zzso identified by zzso zzso and zzso This zzso encodes a predicted zzso protein of 276 zzso acids zzso zzso It effects the expression of a resistance mechanism governed by a single genetic locus in zzso zzso of resistance at the zzso locus of pea was observed towards race 3 and a zzso carrying the cloned zzso gene according to the predicted zzso ratio of zzso zzso progeny from a cross between zzso zzso zzso and zzso Wonder zzso zzso DNA zzso studies showed zzso to be zzso in race 3 and suggested the presence of other zzso on one of the zzso plasmids of races 1 and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of race 1 and its zzso confirmed its behavior towards pea zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso does not match any zzso pattern of interaction with bean zzso
