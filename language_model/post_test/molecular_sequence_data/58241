Band 3 protein is a typical zzso membrane protein and mediates the exchange of the cellular zzso with zzso in zzso which has been known as the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso red blood cells can discriminate the metabolically active cells from inactive cells and deliver oxygen particularly to metabolically active zzso that produce carbon zzso Thus, band 3 protein is a sensor for metabolically active zzso and no excess oxygen is supplied to zzso as far as oxygen is delivered by red blood zzso In this chapter, we review the zzso role of the zzso exchange zzso by band 3 protein and our work concerning the structure and function relationship in band 3 zzso that, is, affinity labeling of the active center for the zzso exchange with zzso zzso zzso change during the zzso exchange process, examination of zzso of zzso prediction on band 3 zzso and zzso transport zzso by band 3 protein and its clinical zzso
