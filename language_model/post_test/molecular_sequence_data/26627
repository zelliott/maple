We have previously tested zzso from zzso breast zzso with a zzso functional zzso in the context of a prospective clinical trial zzso zzso zzso The goal of the trial was to determine whether zzso status could be used to select patients who would benefit from inclusion of zzso in zzso zzso The results of the trial were zzso To test whether this was because the functional zzso zzso the zzso we have zzso two groups of zzso by zzso sequencing and Roche zzso next generation sequencing zzso zzso of zzso data with pooled zzso sequencing data in an initial cohort of 69 zzso showed that conventional sequencing is insensitive when the zzso zzso content is zzso A second cohort of 48 zzso was used to compare directly the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence was difficult to detect in sequence zzso of pooled zzso whereas zzso unequivocally identified zzso in every case classified as zzso by the functional zzso The zzso data showed that small zzso probably caused by zzso zzso account for most of the unexplained background in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso detection techniques that test multiple zzso such as the zzso functional zzso and zzso are more reliable than zzso sequencing of pooled zzso that the high zzso zzso rate zzso seen with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso trial reflects this high zzso and that zzso with Roche zzso technology could be used to identify the zzso zzso in the remaining zzso previously tested in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
