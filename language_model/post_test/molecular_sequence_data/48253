zzso a protein zzso by the human zzso zzso family zzso contains zzso acid motifs which resemble the nuclear import and export signals of the viral regulatory proteins Rev zzso zzso zzso and Rex zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso indeed has a zzso function and mapped the zzso zzso element to a sequence in the 3' long terminal zzso a zzso similar to zzso the responsive element in zzso type zzso zzso we have given the element the designation zzso zzso and zzso stabilize zzso and incompletely spliced viral transcripts and enhance their nuclear export via the zzso export zzso So far, zzso is the only zzso zzso family with a complex regulation at the zzso zzso It may be regarded as an intermediate in the evolution from simple to complex zzso
