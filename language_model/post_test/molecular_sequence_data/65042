The insect zzso control region zzso is a rarely used genetic marker in zzso studies and population genetic zzso zzso for this are that the high AT content and the presence of tandem repeats and zzso pose technical and zzso zzso We provide a new pair of zzso and the first zzso zzso description of control region zzso structure in an insect order after sequencing it in 31 zzso zzso We assessed levels of variation occurring in the zzso and zzso zzso I zzso by sequencing and zzso zzso analyses in five species of butterflies showed that zzso was more variable than zzso zzso variation from three populations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was slightly lower in the zzso than zzso with regard to zzso zzso but the results were zzso between both markers and highly zzso with regard to population zzso Using 15 species of zzso we found that the zzso has the same, or stronger, zzso resolution as zzso Our results indicate that the zzso can be of importance in addition to zzso in population genetic zzso zzso for the whole zzso are direct and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso show zzso zzso but make this marker more complex to use than zzso for higher zzso zzso Nevertheless, alignments at the generic level are straightforward over one part of the zzso The combination zzso appears to be a very promising zzso tool to resolve zzso zzso zzso
