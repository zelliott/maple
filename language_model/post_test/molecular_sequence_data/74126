zzso tissue is a metabolically responsive zzso organ that zzso a myriad of zzso zzso drugs such as zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso target zzso tissue gene expression and correct zzso via zzso insulin zzso The mechanism by which altered gene expression in zzso tissue affects liver and muscle insulin sensitivity (and thus zzso zzso is not fully zzso One possible mechanism involves the zzso in zzso zzso in particular the zzso of zzso factors that increase zzso insulin zzso Here, we report the use of zzso profiling to identify genes zzso for zzso proteins the expression of which is regulated by zzso zzso Of the zzso genes robustly regulated by two structurally distinct zzso zzso in the zzso white zzso tissue zzso of zzso mice, 33 zzso for known zzso zzso one of which was zzso Although zzso was recently reported to be zzso in cultured zzso by zzso zzso and in liver by zzso zzso and induction of zzso states, we demonstrate that the protein is zzso zzso in zzso tissue in zzso by zzso zzso treatment and under a variety of zzso conditions, including zzso and high fat diet zzso In addition, we found that circulating levels of zzso protein were increased upon treatment with zzso zzso and under zzso zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in zzso the zzso activities of zzso zzso
