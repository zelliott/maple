Heat shock protein zzso plays important roles in cellular regulation, primarily as a zzso for a number of key zzso zzso We report here that the two zzso zzso alpha and zzso also zzso on the surface of cells in the nervous system and are involved in their zzso A zzso surface zzso the zzso zzso which was previously shown to be involved in migration processes during development of the nervous system, is shown to be identical to zzso using mass zzso zzso This identity is further confirmed by zzso experiments and by induction of zzso zzso expression in heat zzso embryonic rat brain zzso Moreover, zzso on live zzso rat cells reveals cell surface zzso of both zzso and zzso Cell migration from zzso and zzso nerve zzso is inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso similarly to the zzso observed with zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso of zzso zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso against both alpha and beta zzso of zzso reveals that zzso activity is associated with zzso zzso organization, necessary for zzso zzso
