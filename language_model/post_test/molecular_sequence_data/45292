zzso gene repair is a potential technique for agricultural trait modification in economically important zzso However, large variation in the repair zzso among the scientific reports indicates that there are many factors influencing the repair zzso We report here a transient zzso system using zzso as a reporter for testing the efficiency of zzso DNA repair in cultured wheat zzso This zzso showed that zzso medium supplemented with zzso increased the zzso frequency, and that the repair of a point zzso was more efficient than repair of a single base deletion zzso in cultured zzso cells of immature wheat zzso This study provides the first evidence that zzso zzso is zzso to zzso cultured wheat zzso zzso
