We have previously zzso and cloned human zzso and rat zzso protein zzso which are tissue zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In this study, we have cloned and zzso the gene zzso rat zzso with zzso at positions zzso which is identical to the zzso center of human zzso zzso zzso is highly similar to human zzso sharing zzso and 57% sequence identity at the zzso and the zzso acid zzso The rat zzso gene exists in a single copy and is located on zzso zzso An zzso zzso is found between zzso and zzso rats at or near the rat zzso gene zzso Two zzso acid zzso of the rat zzso gene between these two strains were found by sequence zzso A candidate promoter in the zzso region zzso zzso of the rat zzso gene has been identified by reporter zzso The expression of rat zzso in the liver is zzso and zzso during acute phase zzso zzso rat zzso produced in zzso coli is able to bind to tissue zzso and the interaction is inhibited by zzso These characteristics define rat zzso as the counterpart of human zzso
