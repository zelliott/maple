zzso muscular zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso Their severe manifestations consist of early zzso and zzso markedly delayed motor milestones and zzso often associated with joint zzso zzso changes seen in muscle zzso consist of large variations in muscle zzso size, a few zzso and zzso zzso and a marked increase in zzso collagen zzso Diagnosis is based on clinical features and on zzso zzso In several zzso cases, we have demonstrated an absence of one of the components of the zzso zzso around muscle zzso the zzso M chain, now referred to as the alpha 2 chain of zzso zzso We localized this zzso locus to zzso zzso by zzso mapping and linkage zzso The zzso alpha 2 chain gene zzso maps to the same region on zzso zzso zzso zzso We therefore investigated zzso for the presence of zzso zzso in zzso alpha 2 zzso zzso families and now report zzso site and nonsense zzso in two families leading presumably to a truncated zzso alpha 2 zzso
