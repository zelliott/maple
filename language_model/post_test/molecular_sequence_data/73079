zzso belong to the zzso family and are small, zzso zzso viruses containing one positive zzso zzso Human zzso 16 zzso belongs to the major zzso group of zzso for which the cellular zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso In many zzso one of the viral coat proteins zzso contains a zzso pocket which is occupied by a fatty zzso zzso or so-called zzso zzso zzso agents have been shown to bind to the zzso pocket in zzso replacing the pocket zzso The presence of the zzso compound blocks zzso of the virus and in some cases zzso zzso zzso A zzso high-resolution structure would be expected to provide further information on the nature of the pocket factor and other features previously not clearly zzso 

The structure of native zzso has been refined to a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso pocket in zzso is observed in two alternative zzso In one of these, the pocket is filled by a pocket factor and the protein structure is similar to zzso compound zzso In the other zzso the zzso pocket is collapsed and zzso zzso bases stack against both a zzso and a zzso zzso on the internal surface of the viral zzso zzso zzso of the zzso which is zzso across the zzso to zzso zzso results in zzso zzso Five zzso N zzso of coat protein zzso form a zzso zzso beta barrel around the base of the zzso fivefold zzso The N zzso of zzso are zzso alpha zzso which stack on the outside of this beta zzso The N zzso of zzso and zzso have not been observed previously in zzso zzso 

The observation of a partially occupied zzso pocket in zzso forms a missing link between zzso which is always observed with no pocket factor in the native form, and zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso which contain pocket zzso The pocket factor molecules probably regulate viral entry, zzso and zzso zzso assembly is known to proceed via zzso therefore, the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso across twofold axes between zzso may play a role in zzso zzso The positioning of a zzso on the zzso fivefold axes and the structure of the N zzso of zzso and zzso around these axes suggest a mechanism for the zzso of zzso
