The understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso action zzso the identification of a core active zzso The major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides zzso A zzso zzso with a zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso replacing the zzso was zzso more potent than zzso in promoting zzso survival, acting at zzso zzso To identify the active site in zzso over 50 related fragments containing an zzso zzso acid attachment and an zzso C zzso were zzso zzso and tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso from the C zzso of zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso captured the zzso effects offered by the entire zzso parent zzso zzso and protected against zzso toxicity in zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso sites and enhanced zzso zzso activity as well as cognitive functions in Alzheimer's zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies following zzso administration of zzso zzso demonstrated intact zzso in the brain 30 zzso after zzso Thus, zzso zzso fragments offer zzso and stability, providing lead compounds for drug design against neurodegenerative zzso
