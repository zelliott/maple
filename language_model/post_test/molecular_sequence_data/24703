The zzso family of zzso class zzso proteins present foreign and zzso zzso for specific recognition by T zzso Based on previous experience with zzso class I and II zzso it seems likely that a thorough knowledge of the zzso trafficking and zzso of zzso proteins will be essential to fully understand their functions in zzso presentation and immune zzso Two studies in this issue of zzso take a detailed look at factors affecting the zzso of mouse zzso proteins to the zzso system of zzso zzso Their results provide intriguing evidence for the involvement of two critical components of the zzso class II zzso processing pathway, zzso S and the zzso chain, in the normal functioning of zzso
