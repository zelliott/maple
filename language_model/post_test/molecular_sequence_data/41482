zzso among the zzso family of zzso zzso receptors leads to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso Unlike other members in the family, the zzso domain of zzso lacks key zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso As a result, zzso is suggested to serve as an zzso zzso of other zzso family members which include zzso zzso and zzso To study the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of downstream signaling zzso we constructed zzso zzso receptors by replacing the zzso zzso domain zzso or both the zzso domain and the zzso tail zzso with the zzso counterparts and expressed the zzso receptors in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso While over expression of the intact human zzso transformed zzso cells with zzso properties such as zzso zzso and increased proliferation and migration, zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso showed significantly reduced zzso zzso and decreased zzso of both zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a total loss of downstream zzso zzso in response to zzso but maintained partial zzso of zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso zzso play a crucial role in zzso function as an zzso zzso and its role in downstream zzso
