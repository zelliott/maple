We have succeeded in constructing an effective system for the expression of zzso under the control of a human zzso promoter, which ensures a high level of production of zzso in zzso The engineered zzso zzso based on zzso secondary structure, were relatively stable and were transported to the zzso where they could be zzso with their target zzso The activity of the exported zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso that remained in the zzso This chapter examines the methods for construction of the appropriate zzso that can produce zzso zzso with high-level zzso activity and for analysis of the zzso in zzso
