zzso zzso zzso from zzso bacteria are generally devoid of metal zzso in their zzso zzso However, three metal zzso zzso zzso and iron, have been found in AK from zzso zzso Crystal structures of zzso AK from zzso zzso with three different metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bound in its zzso domain have been determined by X-ray zzso to resolutions zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zinc and iron forms of the zzso were zzso in space group zzso whereas the zzso zzso were zzso The presence of the metals was confirmed by calculation of anomalous difference maps and by X-ray zzso zzso The work presented here is the first report of a structure of a zzso AK from a zzso zzso The native zzso was zzso and only zinc was detected in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained by zzso the protein in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso in the zzso unit, whereas zzso zzso as a zzso Nevertheless, all three crystal structures are very similar to each other, with the same zzso domain zzso the only change being the presence of the different metal zzso In the absence of any zzso the zzso domain of all zzso of AK was present in a fully open zzso zzso zzso mode analysis was performed to predict fluctuations of the zzso domain along the zzso zzso
