Several species of zzso the so-called zzso accumulate extremely high levels of zzso zzso in their blood zzso We previously identified a family of zzso zzso named zzso from blood cells and blood plasma of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso the zzso zzso protein in blood cells, has been revealed, and the zzso properties of zzso have been studied in zzso Here, we used Far Western zzso to identify a novel protein that interacts with zzso from a blood cell zzso zzso The zzso named zzso protein 1 zzso was localized in the zzso of zzso ring cells and giant zzso Using a zzso method, we revealed that zzso zzso with zzso 1, 2, 3, and 4 but not with zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso was shown to be important for the zzso Further, zzso was found to interact with all of the other zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso act as metal zzso or target proteins in zzso
