The zzso zzso zzso for zzso G zzso zzso functions to transport maternal zzso to the zzso animals and protects zzso from zzso The present study identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso transcripts were detected in zzso kidney cell line zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, and zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso encodes the full-length zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso codes for a truncated zzso zzso with deletion of 92 zzso acids matching the zzso domain of zzso zzso was zzso expressed by zzso zzso however, zzso was not zzso in zzso zzso and cell lines although its transcript was zzso Despite the lack of native zzso zzso was readily detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed to bind zzso at pH zzso but not at pH zzso however, zzso failed to bind zzso at both pH zzso and zzso zzso was expressed on the cell surface and mainly localized in early zzso In contrast, zzso was absent from cell surface and primarily localized in the zzso and zzso trafficking to zzso was independent of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso may explain the absence of native zzso protein zzso In addition, the trafficking of zzso to the zzso compartment suggests that in addition to sorting signals in its zzso tail, the zzso structural integrity may be important for proper zzso trafficking and zzso
