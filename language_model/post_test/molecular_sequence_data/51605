The product of the zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso must be more active zzso than zzso to promote normal embryonic zzso The majority of the zzso protein in the zzso is present in the zzso zzso form and appears to be evenly distributed in the zzso space, indicating that the zzso activity of zzso zzso must arise zzso A dominant zzso form of zzso that does not require zzso of the zzso for activity zzso delta N) is active both zzso and zzso The zzso delta N zzso zzso the requirement for five other maternal effect zzso indicating that these five genes exert their effects on zzso patterning solely by controlling the zzso of the zzso zzso We propose that zzso asymmetry is initiated by a zzso zzso in the zzso membrane that zzso an zzso zzso zzso complex, leading to the production of zzso active zzso zzso
