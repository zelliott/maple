In this communication, we show that the zzso zzso drastically reduced the zzso and zzso content of the zzso acid zzso zzso by the fungus zzso zzso at pH zzso compared to a control zzso By using zzso differential display reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction, we isolated two zzso from the control zzso strain that were not detected in the zzso zzso strain that zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Thus, a zzso in the zzso zzso of proteins could be the consequence of zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes for a nuclear zzso zzso that may have specific functions in the processing of zzso zzso similar to its zzso zzso in zzso zzso
