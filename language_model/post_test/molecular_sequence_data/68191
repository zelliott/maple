We have previously identified zzso a protein component of steroid zzso complexes, as an zzso binding protein zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report that zzso is also found to be a major zzso in chicken zzso by virtue of binding to zzso as well as positive zzso with a zzso zzso directed against human zzso Limited zzso of zzso chicken zzso with zzso zzso C result in the production of a unique zzso having a mass of about 17 zzso zzso as judged by Western zzso zzso mapping provided additional proof that zzso is a zzso which comprises the entire zzso binding domain I of chicken zzso terminating with an zzso which might represent a processing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso is zzso with a calculated zzso of 42 zzso Since size exclusion zzso of zzso complexes indicates that the active species is a zzso with a mass of zzso zzso the zzso calculated for the zzso complex is approximately zzso Furthermore, unlike zzso chicken zzso bound to zzso does not bind to zzso zzso This work demonstrates the zzso of a domain from an zzso protein that is active in binding zzso and functionally distinct from zzso a protein of similar size and zzso
