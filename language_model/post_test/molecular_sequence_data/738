zzso a giant DNA virus zzso zzso infecting species of the zzso zzso was first identified in zzso With a particle size of zzso in diameter, and a zzso size of zzso zzso more than 900 zzso it is the most complex virus described to zzso Beyond its unusual size, the zzso zzso was found to contain the first viral zzso of many genes thought to be the trademark of cellular organisms, such as central components of the translation zzso These findings revived the debate on the origin of DNA zzso and the role they might have played in the emergence of zzso Published and ongoing studies on zzso continue to lead to unexpected findings concerning a variety of aspects, such as the structure of its zzso unique features of its replication cycle, or the distribution and abundance of zzso relatives in the zzso Following a summary of these recent findings, we present preliminary results suggesting that zzso might have come in close contact with an zzso of zzso and that modern sponges might be host to a yet unidentified, even larger, member of the zzso
