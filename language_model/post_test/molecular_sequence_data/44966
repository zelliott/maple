zzso protein of zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso share more than zzso zzso acid zzso Most of the zzso acids involved in the binding of zzso and zzso to zzso are zzso in zzso zzso This zzso shows an efficient zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Winkler, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but a low zzso zzso zzso activity, whereas zzso shows a high efficient zzso zzso zzso activity and a low zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify the structural factors responsible for these differences, comparative kinetic and binding studies have been carried out on both zzso protein of zzso coli and zzso of zzso zzso The zzso constant of zzso protein for zzso is zzso higher than that of zzso The chemical mechanism of zzso zzso zzso by zzso protein is shown to proceed through a zzso mechanism involving zzso zzso with zzso with rates associated to the zzso and zzso processes of 280 zzso and 20 zzso zzso No zzso zzso effect is observed suggesting that the zzso step is not zzso The rate of zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso and is hydride transfer limiting, at least zzso less efficient compared with that of zzso zzso Thus, it can be concluded that it is only the structure of the zzso that prevails in forming a zzso complex zzso productive (or zzso for hydride transfer in the zzso zzso This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the rate of zzso for zzso zzso by zzso is zzso zzso and is limited by the zzso step, whereas zzso zzso zzso is efficient and is not zzso zzso zzso Substituting zzso for zzso on zzso zzso a zzso zzso to facilitate hydride transfer as a base zzso decreases zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso positioning of the zzso atom of zzso zzso relative to the zzso of the zzso within the zzso complex is responsible for the low zzso zzso No zzso activity on zzso zzso with zzso protein is observed although the zzso site is operative as proven by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Thus the binding of zzso zzso to the zzso site likely is not productive for attacking efficiently the zzso intermediate formed with zzso zzso whereas a water zzso is an efficient zzso for the zzso of the zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso activity, this zzso to an zzso of the zzso step by zzso zzso zzso these results suggest subtle structural differences between the active sites of zzso and zzso protein that could be revealed and/or modulated by the structure of the zzso zzso This also indicates that a protein engineering approach could be used to convert a zzso zzso zzso into an efficient zzso one and vice zzso
