This study presents a comparative zzso analysis of the membrane zzso of whole zzso zzso using zzso zzso or zzso methanol to enrich and zzso membrane proteins for strong zzso exchange zzso and zzso liquid zzso mass zzso zzso A total of zzso proteins were identified by our zzso method, and 300 proteins were detected by our zzso zzso zzso Although the total number of proteins obtained using the zzso zzso was higher than the total obtained by organic zzso the ratio of predicted membrane proteins to total proteins identified indicates up to an zzso greater enrichment efficiency using zzso Using two different zzso approaches, between zzso and zzso of the total proteins identified by the zzso method were classified as containing at least one putative zzso domain as compared to zzso for zzso In terms of protein zzso as determined by the GRAVY index, it was revealed that methanol was more effective than zzso for zzso membrane proteins ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was also approximately zzso more effective than zzso in identifying zzso repeat zzso zzso The ability of methanol to effectively zzso and zzso both zzso and zzso proteins was demonstrated using zzso and zzso zzso respectively, where both proteins were identified with at least zzso sequence coverage from a single zzso zzso zzso Overall, our data show that methanol is a better alternative for identifying a wider range of membrane proteins than the zzso zzso zzso
