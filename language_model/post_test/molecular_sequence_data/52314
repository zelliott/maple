Two peptides zzso 26 zzso and zzso 22 zzso were zzso with zzso acid sequences identical to two of the long segments of zzso chain rich in zzso zzso and charged zzso acids that link the zzso zzso together in the zzso zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso complex of zzso zzso The circular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the peptides indicated that they lacked regular secondary zzso Even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso they appeared to acquire a zzso content of only zzso However, zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso bonds were all zzso zzso in the trans zzso compared with a value of zzso for the zzso bond in the model zzso zzso which is a zzso sequence motif in zzso and zzso zzso in peptides representing the zzso and zzso halves of zzso zzso the zzso bonds were again all zzso zzso suggesting that zzso length is the essential zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were raised against peptides zzso and zzso the latter representing a third zzso segment of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Martin, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite extensive sequence similarity among peptides zzso zzso and zzso only limited zzso zzso was observed, which suggests that the zzso zzso in the peptides are different and zzso It is likely that these peptides are representative of a class of zzso zzso or zzso found in a wide variety of proteins and endowed with varying degrees of flexibility and zzso to match their particular biological zzso
