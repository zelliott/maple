We have previously described a novel artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso site, which when introduced into the zzso precursor protein zzso significantly enhances zzso zzso by zzso in in zzso and cellular zzso In this study, we describe the identification and characterization of a single chain zzso of variable region zzso specific to the zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and its conversion to zzso Both the zzso displayed on zzso and zzso show exquisite specificity for binding to the zzso zzso without zzso to other zzso containing peptides or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can detect as little as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with alkaline zzso and zzso in various biological zzso In the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso with excellent zzso In an zzso stable zzso cellular zzso the zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was 236 zzso consistent with values derived using an zzso zzso zzso In an zzso zzso mouse model, both zzso and zzso peptides in brain zzso showed excellent gene dosage zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso is a novel zzso for zzso inhibitor discovery for both in zzso cellular screening zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The methods described zzso are generally zzso to novel synthetic zzso and zzso targets to enable robust screening platforms for zzso zzso
