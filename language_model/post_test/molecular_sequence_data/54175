zzso zzso zzso strains are native to tropical zzso fields and contribute to the carbon and nitrogen economy of such zzso zzso engineering was employed to improve the nitrogen zzso potential of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso enhanced expression of an additional integrated copy of the zzso gene from a zzso promoter elevated zzso protein expression and enhanced functional zzso frequency in the zzso zzso The zzso strain displayed consistently higher zzso activity than the zzso strain and appeared to be in zzso with compatible zzso of photosynthesis and zzso The enhanced combined nitrogen availability from the zzso strain positively catered to the nitrogen demand of rice zzso in short-term zzso experiments and supported better zzso The engineered strain is stable, zzso and useful for environmental application as nitrogen zzso in zzso zzso
