Although zzso B virus zzso infections are a major health problem in Turkey, there is little information on the zzso distribution of the zzso In this study, zzso zzso were determined by DNA sequencing and restriction zzso analysis of the S zzso 

The S genes of zzso B virus isolated from 23 chronically infected zzso Turkish patients were amplified and directly zzso zzso sequences were then aligned with reference zzso from the zzso database and subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso zzso 134, zzso and 160 were analyzed using translated zzso The amplified products were also subjected to restriction zzso analysis using zzso zzso I, zzso I, and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis showed zzso of all samples with zzso D zzso The mean zzso divergence was zzso zzso zzso All zzso were zzso as predicted from translated zzso The results of the restriction zzso analysis of the samples were consistent with the zzso zzso 

Our data complement the findings that zzso D viruses are prevalent in the Turkish zzso Being rapid and zzso restriction zzso analysis described in this study should be useful for large-scale zzso analysis of zzso zzso
