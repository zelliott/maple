zzso zzso zzso genes zzso a type III zzso system required for disease development in host plants and for hypersensitive response zzso on zzso zzso genes are expressed in the presence of plant cells through the zzso zzso This zzso which requires physical interaction between the bacteria and the plant cell, is sensed by the outer membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso the plant cell zzso signal through a complex regulatory cascade integrated by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we have identified two zzso named zzso and zzso that belong to the zzso gene cluster and whose predicted products show zzso with zzso function zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso in zzso show a delayed zzso zzso toward host zzso zzso control the plant cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene expression is induced by a signal present in the plant cell zzso that is not zzso zzso evidence shows that zzso act upstream of zzso in the regulatory zzso likely zzso the signal sensed by zzso through the zzso as described for signal transfer systems through three zzso This is the first report of such a surface signaling mechanism zzso zzso zzso in response to a zzso plant cell wall zzso
