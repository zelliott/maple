Of the four species of zzso found on zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are endemic while the fourth, zzso zzso is probably a recent introduction from the African zzso The evolutionary relationships of these species with zzso species from Africa were studied by zzso analysis of DNA sequence variation at two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and large zzso zzso zzso or zzso The observed levels of zzso divergence within zzso were substantial but may underestimate the true levels as there was evidence of zzso of transitional zzso at both zzso A putative secondary structure model for the zzso segment of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso changes only for both zzso showed that there were contrasting levels of divergence within the four species zzso zzso zzso was consistently placed within the zzso zzso group, appearing ancestral to this group and was closest to the zzso zzso within zzso Together with zzso zzso the two species appear to have been isolated on Madagascar for a long time, contrasting with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso that appear more recent zzso however, estimate of exact times of divergence is zzso A zzso zzso was developed to enable identification and discrimination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso variation within the zzso To enable population genetic analysis within zzso zzso zzso markers were developed using an enrichment method and 8 primer pairs are zzso Laboratory infection experiments using zzso zzso zzso from the zzso area showed that certain populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso
