We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained an open reading frame zzso a 425 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso domain was located near the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the reading frame was most similar to that of the mouse class III zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso transcripts first appeared at the early zzso stage of zzso and zzso increased zzso A significant level of zzso however, was not found in adult zzso except in the zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso transcripts were localized in the neural zzso of zzso but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso In adult zzso the zzso transcripts were detected in the restricted regions of the zzso zzso and zzso expression patterns suggest that zzso has distinct roles in the early neural development of zzso
