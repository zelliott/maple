The zzso zzso zzso from the extremely zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso It contains 10 open reading frames zzso organized in five putative zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the largest zzso zzso zzso showed similarity to bacterial zzso proteins known from zzso and plasmids with zzso zzso zzso From the comparison of the zzso acid zzso a novel family of zzso zzso proteins was zzso The zzso zzso protein shared zzso identical zzso with zzso protein genes zzso by the zzso zzso plasmids zzso and zzso Two DNA regions capable of forming extended zzso structures were also zzso in the three plasmids zzso sequence zzso In addition, a putative zzso regulatory protein gene zzso was found, which was zzso among the three plasmids and the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of this gene was also found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA of both zzso strands was detected with a zzso bean zzso protection zzso using zzso detection of protected fragments, giving additional evidence for an zzso mechanism of zzso
