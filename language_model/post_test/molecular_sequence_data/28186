The zzso zzso zzso gene contains a small zzso that is unique in two zzso First, it interrupts the zzso zzso that zzso translation of the zzso zzso Second, it contains a sequence at the zzso zzso junction zzso that differs from the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and from the zzso found at the corresponding position in nearly all zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed both the transcripts derived from the zzso gene and the zzso of its zzso We show here that an zzso zzso precursor constituted a minor fraction of the total zzso message, even when the gene was zzso We also show that both major transcripts derived from zzso had been zzso Our results suggest that at least in the case of zzso a zzso can function as efficiently as the highly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
