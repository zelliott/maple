zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated in the United States in 1991 and have high levels of resistance to zzso zzso zzso of 8 and 32 zzso of zzso per zzso zzso zzso but not zzso also showed high-level resistance to zzso As both strains expressed the zzso zzso zzso were very closely related in overall zzso and possessed identical or closely related mosaic zzso zzso and zzso zzso it is likely that they have arisen from a recent common zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso was entirely due to zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso since a mixture of the cloned zzso and zzso genes from the resistant strains could transform the susceptible strain zzso to the full level of zzso resistance of the clinical zzso Both zzso and zzso of these strains were more resistant to zzso by zzso than those of typical highly zzso zzso The zzso genes of zzso and zzso were identical in zzso and the fourfold difference in their levels of resistance to zzso was due to a zzso substitution at the zzso following the zzso zzso motif of zzso This substitution was also the major cause of the zzso resistance of zzso to zzso The zzso gene of zzso in an appropriate genetic background, could provide resistance to 16 zzso of zzso per zzso but only to zzso zzso of zzso per zzso zzso of the zzso 550 zzso resulted in a zzso gene that provided resistance to 4 zzso of zzso per zzso and 4 zzso of zzso per zzso The zzso substitution in zzso therefore appears to provide increased resistance to zzso zzso but a loss of resistance to zzso
