The present study describes the distribution of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso throughout the brain of a zzso zzso rock hind zzso zzso The objectives of this study were to describe the zzso distribution in the brain of rock hind for potential linkages of the zzso hormone system with zzso behaviors observed in this species and to examine zzso differences that might zzso An zzso was designed for rock hind zzso against the deduced zzso acid sequence for the third zzso zzso zzso zzso identified with zzso showed high zzso with zzso zzso identified with in zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso expression was widely distributed throughout the brain, indicating that zzso may act as a zzso via this zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso were present in regions associated with behavior, reproduction and spatial learning, as well as sensory functions such as vision, zzso and lateral line sensory zzso We observed high zzso expression in zzso cell zzso in the internal cellular layer of zzso bulbs, zzso zzso zzso layer of the corpus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the lateral and zzso zzso and zzso zzso High protein and zzso expression was also observed in the zzso area, anterior zzso and zzso zzso No obvious sex differences were noted in any region of the rock hind zzso
