One function of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is to relieve zzso repression of zzso zzso and other genes in response to zzso zzso To identify genes that regulate zzso zzso activity, we have selected zzso that inappropriately express a zzso gene fusion when grown in zzso and that require zzso function for this zzso zzso representing two new zzso groups zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso affect two distinct responses to zzso the zzso zzso repression of zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso induction by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso relieve zzso repression of zzso and zzso zzso and, in combination with zzso zzso cause an extreme slow growth zzso The zzso gene was cloned by zzso of the zzso zzso delta slow growth zzso and encodes a previously zzso zzso zzso
