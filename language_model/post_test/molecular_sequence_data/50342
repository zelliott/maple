To examine the feasibility of a beta structure for the zzso region of the zzso zzso channel, we have characterized a family of 12 zzso zzso Each is comprised of four identical pairs of zzso organized with approximate zzso symmetry about a channel zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso pairs are assumed to be at the zzso end of the channel, and each pair is connected by a hairpin turn at the zzso end of the zzso The models differ in the zzso located in the hairpin turn and in the orientation of the two strands of each pair in the barrel, zzso whether the zzso of a pair is zzso zzso or zzso zzso from the zzso when the channel is viewed from outside the zzso Following known structure zzso and potential energy predictions, the barrel is assumed to be zzso in all zzso All models have crowded layers of zzso aromatic zzso near the center of the channel which could regulate channel zzso The models with an odd number of zzso acids in the hairpin turn have the advantage of predicting that zzso points into the barrel, but the disadvantage that zzso does zzso Of these models, two of the models are most consistent with the external zzso zzso block data, and of those, one zzso zzso zzso is most consistent with the internal zzso block zzso
