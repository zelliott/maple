zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a sole nitrogen zzso The initial attack on zzso acid occurs through two zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso by zzso and hydride zzso I zzso by zzso are responsible for the hydride zzso Database searches with the zzso genes have indicated the presence of a putative zzso regulator, zzso Here, the zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the protein was zzso and shown to form a complex with zzso regions between open reading frames A and B and between zzso and zzso within the zzso gene zzso A change in zzso complex formation occurred in the presence of zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso By constructing a zzso zzso we demonstrated that both zzso regions caused the expression of reporter gene zzso zzso both of these regions contain zzso A deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed in which part of zzso was zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was induced by zzso in the zzso strain, while in the zzso these genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso involved in zzso acid zzso
