zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso activities of zzso zzso injection of the modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in a rabbit model of zzso in zzso 

A modified human zzso gene containing an zzso motif was obtained by rapid zzso zzso Forty New Zealand white rabbits underwent alkaline burn and developed zzso which were randomly divided into four groups: an experimental control group, a zzso empty zzso group, a zzso group, and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso groups received injections into the superior zzso zzso after the zzso An injection of 5 zzso was given twice at zzso zzso Four eyes of two rabbits received neither treatment nor alkaline burn and served as absolute normal zzso The areas of zzso were monitored after 7 and 14 zzso zzso were examined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso expression was detected by zzso after 7 and 14 zzso zzso liver, and kidney were examined by zzso and zzso expression in the inflammatory cells was detected by zzso at 90 zzso 

zzso injection of both native zzso and modified zzso genes resulted in a significant suppression of zzso in zzso with modified zzso being more effective than native zzso The mean concentration of zzso in the zzso group significantly decreased compared to the means in the other zzso Upon zzso examination, the zzso and zzso eyes showed significantly less zzso area and fewer vessels than the control and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue sections were normal, and there was no inflammatory cell zzso zzso 

Native and modified zzso can significantly inhibit zzso by suppressing the expression of zzso However, modified zzso with the zzso motif is far more effective than the zzso gene in zzso zzso
