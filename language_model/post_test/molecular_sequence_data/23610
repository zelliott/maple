zzso zzso an important pathogen in humans, zzso an zzso specific zzso named zzso To zzso the mechanism that is responsible for this zzso we have here characterized the activity of zzso in zzso Both gamma chains of human zzso or its zzso zzso were zzso in the hinge region after zzso by zzso but other proteins or synthetic peptides containing sequences such as the zzso segment in the zzso zzso site, or long peptides resembling the zzso zzso were not zzso at zzso This is likely due to a second binding site interacting with the zzso part of zzso The lack of zzso activity on zzso zzso necessitated the development of an zzso with zzso as the zzso for kinetic zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso curve at zzso zzso zzso and a declining zzso rate at higher zzso zzso This zzso zzso curve suggests product zzso and/or zzso control, which again indicates the presence of an zzso involved in zzso zzso The zzso constant for zzso zzso of zzso was 90 zzso The zzso exhibited activity in the pH range of zzso with an optimum at pH zzso zzso was stable above pH 10 but not at zzso zzso It exhibited an activity maximum around 37 degrees C and a decreased zzso stability at 42 degrees zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso as expected for a zzso zzso and zzso evidence verified this zzso zzso and chicken zzso specific zzso of family C1 and zzso zzso zzso were without effect on zzso activity, as were class specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No significant similarities were found in protein sequence comparisons with known zzso families, suggesting that zzso represents a novel family of zzso zzso
