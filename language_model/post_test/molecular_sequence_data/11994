We investigated the association between zzso zzso repeat zzso lying upstream of human zzso zzso zzso gene and bone mineral density zzso as well as zzso markers for bone metabolism in 144 healthy zzso Japanese zzso The zzso was classified into zzso through 'R' according to the number of the repeats, from 10 to zzso zzso was expressed in Z score (a zzso from the zzso average zzso of each age using the standard zzso as a zzso The people having zzso C (12 repeats of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly lower Z score of spine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and of total body zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso than those without this zzso zzso zzso zzso They also had significantly higher levels of serum intact zzso urinary zzso and urinary zzso These results suggest that genetic variation at the zzso locus may be associated with some zzso for zzso and bone metabolism in zzso zzso
