A method has been developed for the detection of zzso zzso in peptides based on reversed zzso performance liquid zzso zzso zzso spectral zzso It has been found that zzso peptides show a zzso shift of the aromatic zzso maximum when the zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso likewise reveal a zzso shift of the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso compared to the unmodified zzso This method allows mapping of zzso zzso sites in proteins after zzso into smaller peptides and separation and zzso spectral analysis of the latter by zzso It zzso provides a useful way for the characterization of synthetic zzso zzso
