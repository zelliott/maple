The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso complex and composed of four zzso zzso rings arranged in a zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso from zzso zzso at zzso zzso The analysis of the structure of early and late assembly zzso of this zzso gives new insights in the maturation of zzso zzso and indicates similarities to assembly zzso observed in zzso We also show a striking difference in mechanism and regulation of zzso access between zzso and zzso zzso zzso While zzso zzso are zzso by the zzso tails of the outer zzso by imposing zzso closure with a characteristic sequence motif zzso and show regulatory gating this segment is zzso in the zzso and differently structured in the zzso of zzso leaving a pore leading into the particle with a diameter of zzso zzso and functional studies indicate the absence of regulatory gating in the zzso zzso zzso
