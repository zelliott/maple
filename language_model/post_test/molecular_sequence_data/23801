To construct a zzso expression zzso zzso the gene of zzso region of type II transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso to express the protein in zzso cell line and to determine its biological zzso 

The zzso region zzso acids zzso of the human zzso II zzso was amplified by zzso from a zzso II zzso zzso the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by inserting the zzso II zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence was confirmed by double zzso and the zzso II zzso was zzso into the zzso cell zzso The zzso II protein was confirmed by Western zzso analysis and its biological function was zzso 

The specific protein was observed in western zzso and the protein zzso the zzso effects of zzso on mink lung zzso cells zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso II has been successfully constructed and the zzso II protein with biological activity zzso
