In zzso the replication of zzso DNA is coordinated by a replication timing program that temporally regulates the firing of individual replication zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying the program remains zzso Here, we report that the zzso protein zzso plays a crucial role in the control of replication timing in zzso zzso A DNA element located zzso to a late origin in the zzso arm zzso initiation from the origin in early S zzso zzso deletion and substitution experiments demonstrated that two tandem zzso repeats are essential for this zzso The zzso repeats recruit zzso a counterpart of human zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso regulates about half of zzso late origins, including those in zzso The zzso mechanism prevents zzso zzso zzso zzso loading onto the zzso Our results demonstrate that the replication timing program in zzso zzso uses the internal zzso repeats and binding of zzso
