Cell attachment and membrane penetration are functions of the zzso outer zzso spike zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso of zzso produces the zzso fragment, zzso which is the viral zzso and an important target of zzso zzso We have determined, by X-ray zzso the atomic structure of the zzso core bound to zzso acid and, by zzso zzso the structure of the zzso zzso zzso The domain has the zzso fold of the zzso a family of sugar binding zzso The surface corresponding to the zzso zzso binding site is zzso and zzso zzso instead binds zzso acid in a shallow groove between its two zzso There appears to be a small induced fit on zzso The zzso that contact zzso acid are zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso escape zzso are widely distributed over the zzso surface and cluster in four zzso From the fit of the zzso core into the zzso zzso we propose that zzso arose from the zzso of a host zzso binding domain into a viral membrane interaction zzso
