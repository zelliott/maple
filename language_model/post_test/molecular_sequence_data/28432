zzso cell zzso is a zzso zzso associated zzso zzso with zzso specificity released zzso during mast cell zzso To determine the full primary structure of the zzso domain and precursor forms of zzso and to gain insight into its mode of zzso we cloned zzso coding for the complete zzso acid sequence of dog mast cell zzso and a second, possibly zzso zzso zzso Using zzso from dog zzso cells, we constructed a zzso library in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the library with an zzso probe based on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso from the same cell source allowed us to isolate and sequence overlapping clones coding for dog mast cell zzso The zzso sequence includes the essential zzso of the zzso zzso and an zzso acid at the base of the putative zzso binding pocket that zzso zzso zzso and zzso specificity on zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso A zzso in this position has not been observed previously in zzso zzso and suggests a novel mode of zzso Additional screening of the library with a zzso zzso led to the isolation and sequencing of a full-length clone apparently coding for the complete sequence of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso which is only zzso identical with the dog zzso sequence but which contains an apparent zzso zzso also terminating in a zzso Thus, the zzso zzso by these cloned zzso may share a common mode of zzso from zzso extended zzso
