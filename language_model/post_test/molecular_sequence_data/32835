zzso zzso zzso have advantages of zzso gene expression by acting specifically, independently of cellular zzso and within all cell zzso However, there are concerns about inefficient zzso because of reduced zzso zzso of target zzso by zzso To enable production of defined zzso zzso and thereby increase effectiveness, we developed zzso zzso zzso that generate several zzso zzso units from a single zzso zzso and trans zzso zzso as assessed in zzso against three different sites within the X sequence of zzso B virus zzso occurred efficiently and precisely according to predictions deduced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of markers of viral replication in zzso cultured zzso cells was achieved by zzso Pol II expression zzso To assess zzso efficacy of zzso prepared in zzso zzso and zzso zzso reactions were carried out to prepare defined zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was capable of zzso zzso surface zzso zzso from zzso cells without associated zzso of zzso or zzso zzso into the culture zzso The approach described here is potentially useful for several applications, such as generation of zzso interference zzso zzso which require rapid and inexpensive generation of defined zzso zzso
