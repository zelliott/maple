In the zzso zzso system, the zzso zzso interacts with three putative zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso The zzso proteins contain a DNA binding domain that recognizes and binds a DNA sequence zzso the zzso zzso present in the promoter region of a large number of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now investigated the zzso expression of zzso zzso genes in zzso We isolated a tomato zzso gene that contains two zzso boxes in its promoter region and demonstrated that the abundance of the zzso transcript rapidly increases during an incompatible interaction involving zzso tomato plants and the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso tomato expressing the zzso zzso In addition, we found that transcripts of two other tomato zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and at least one zzso zzso zzso all of which contain zzso boxes in their promoter regions, rapidly accumulate in the incompatible zzso These data support the hypothesis that the tomato zzso zzso regulates the expression of certain defense genes in tomato by interaction with zzso factors that bind the zzso zzso
