A zzso library from zzso cucumber zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso clones zzso putative zzso were isolated by means of a synthetic probe based on a partial zzso acid sequence of a 33 zzso zzso zzso that had been previously shown to be induced by zzso DNA sequencing indicates that the two clones were derived from two closely related zzso species that are related to published plant zzso zzso Southern analysis indicates that there are zzso copies in a zzso zzso of a gene zzso to the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences are zzso with a tobacco zzso sequence zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso and a potato zzso zzso The cloned sequences do not zzso the 33 zzso zzso from which the original synthetic probe was been zzso but rather other putative zzso An increase in the level of zzso is evident by 3 hours after zzso or zzso treatment and zzso by 15 zzso
