The zzso protein was a zzso zzso that sensed very low concentration of copper and regulated the copper transport in zzso zzso Here, we cloned a gene from zzso zzso named zzso whose deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso identical to zzso Furthermore, two zzso repeats metal binding motifs of zzso one in the zzso zzso and one in the zzso zzso were also present in zzso A deletion zzso of zzso was hypersensitive to the copper zzso and showed poor zzso zzso the function was recovered by the gene zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene fully zzso growth defects of zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was activated at low concentration of copper and depressed when the concentration of copper excess zzso Furthermore, the zzso intensity enhanced at copper zzso and decreased under copper excess by fusion the zzso to the zzso It proved that the expression of zzso was exactly regulated by copper zzso because zzso and zzso were expressed under the control of the same one zzso We also cloned a gene named zzso with zzso With a series of experiments, we proved it was the target gene of zzso To sum up, zzso may zzso a zzso zzso regulated zzso copper transport in zzso zzso
