Traditionally, the selection of zzso libraries is performed on zzso zzso zzso immobilized to a solid zzso However, this approach may not be zzso for some zzso such as membrane zzso which for structural integrity strongly rely on their native zzso Here we describe an approach for the selection of zzso against membrane zzso The envelope zzso zzso of the Human zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as a model for a zzso integral membrane zzso zzso zzso expressed on the surface of zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso virus zzso was zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso was zzso into zzso by the simultaneous removal of zzso and free zzso zzso zzso by zzso The resulting zzso preparation, termed zzso was captured on zzso plates coated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and used for rounds of selection zzso of a zzso zzso library derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso an identical experiment was performed with zzso zzso disrupted by zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and soluble zzso were selected for zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso using our zzso zzso the novel panning strategy described here may be zzso for selection of zzso against membrane zzso
