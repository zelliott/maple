The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor known as zzso which is zzso regulated by zzso can induce zzso arrest when zzso and inhibit the zzso activity of a wide variety of zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that a portion of the zzso region of zzso zzso acids zzso which is zzso to similar regions in the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso can bind to zzso and that this region is essential for zzso zzso However, the zzso on zzso that are involved in zzso binding have not been zzso We therefore created zzso zzso molecules with various zzso and zzso deletions and tested each for their ability to bind to zzso by the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso None of the deletion zzso tested bound to zzso by either zzso We next tested whether zzso could bind to zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso By both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to bind to this zzso consistent with previous zzso However, hybrid molecules consisting of the zzso half of zzso and the zzso half of zzso zzso could bind to zzso by both zzso whereas the zzso hybrids could zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso identical with zzso failed to bind to zzso by both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hybrids but not zzso hybrids could bind to zzso These results suggest that the zzso half of zzso is important for zzso zzso consistent with the recently published zzso zzso Our data also suggest that the three-dimensional structure of zzso is likely altered by creating deletion zzso from either the zzso or zzso end of the zzso Finally, we have zzso the zzso hybrid protein and isolated several zzso which are able to bind to zzso This approach may be useful for identifying zzso in zzso and zzso that affect their ability to bind to zzso and complement the zzso zzso
