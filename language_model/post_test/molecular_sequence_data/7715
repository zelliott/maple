The zzso patterns of a genetically engineered human zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso cells from long-term suspension and zzso cultures in the presence and absence of fetal calf serum were zzso zzso was used as a model protein in studying the effect of different controlled cell culture conditions on the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso contains a single zzso acid substitution zzso generating a potential zzso recognition site zzso in addition to the natural zzso at position zzso Parallel cell zzso were carried out in two continuously zzso zzso stirred zzso under defined culture zzso Major differences were found in the zzso products obtained during these different zzso zzso zzso cultures resulted in a higher level of terminal zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso as well as the amount of zzso product and the zzso of zzso carbohydrates in the model protein exhibited major differences depending on the presence or absence of serum, the condition of growth and the zzso zzso
