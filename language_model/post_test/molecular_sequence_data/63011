zzso zzso can be divided into four branches zzso zzso zzso and zzso according to the number of zzso acid zzso in the third zzso zzso In general, it is widely accepted that the zzso signal peptides of each zzso are strictly zzso Recently, we cloned six zzso of novel zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso belonging to either zzso or zzso zzso These zzso judging from the putative zzso sequences deducted from zzso are rich in zzso zzso and share highly zzso signal and zzso zzso However, they are quite different from the reported zzso of zzso and zzso branches even in their signal zzso which in general are considered highly zzso for each zzso of zzso The signal sequences of zzso and zzso zzso composed of 24 zzso start with zzso while those of zzso and zzso zzso composed of 25 zzso start with zzso It is another example that different types of signal peptides can exist within a zzso besides the zzso zzso In addition to the different zzso connectivity of zzso zzso from that of zzso or zzso zzso the sequence zzso preferential zzso zzso usage and zzso tree analysis suggest that zzso and zzso zzso have much closer relationship, being different from the zzso of other two branches zzso and zzso of zzso
