Human zzso zzso a target for zzso and zzso chemotherapy, exists as two zzso types I and zzso zzso sequences of each zzso were zzso in an zzso zzso strain of zzso coli and zzso to zzso Both zzso zzso were zzso which was in agreement with the zzso structure of the native zzso zzso The results of initial zzso and product zzso studies were consistent with an zzso zzso zzso kinetic mechanism for both zzso zzso affinities were similar for types I and II with zzso values of 18 and zzso zzso respectively, for zzso and 46 and 32 zzso respectively, for zzso values were zzso and zzso zzso at 37 degrees C for types I and II, zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the two zzso with identical zzso patterns and zzso zzso zzso acid, however, inhibited the type II zzso with a zzso lower K than the type zzso Selective zzso of the zzso type II zzso may mitigate toxicity caused by zzso of the zzso expressed type I zzso
