Previous kinetic investigations of the zzso zzso recognition motif zzso domain of zzso protein zzso interacting with its zzso target zzso hairpin II, provided experimental evidence for a zzso and zzso model of binding in which zzso interactions first guide the zzso to the zzso and close range interactions then lock the two molecules zzso To further investigate the zzso step, here we examined the zzso roles of two sets of positively charged zzso acids in zzso that do not make hydrogen bonds to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso close to the zzso site, and zzso zzso and zzso located on zzso of the zzso domain, away from the zzso Surface zzso zzso kinetic studies, supplemented with salt dependence experiments and molecular dynamics zzso indicate that zzso predominantly plays a role in association, while nearby zzso zzso and zzso appear to be at least as important for complex zzso In contrast, kinetic analyses of zzso away from the zzso indicate that they have a minimal effect on association and zzso Thus, zzso positively charged zzso can be important for both initial complex formation and complex zzso illustrating the multiple roles of zzso interactions in zzso zzso
