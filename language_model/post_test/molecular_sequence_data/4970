The genetic diversity and expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso in environmental samples were determined in order to show in parallel the existing and active members of zzso zzso DNA and total zzso were extracted from different zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed into zzso zzso zzso was performed to amplify a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene and its zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis was used to separate the zzso products according to their sequence and thereby to zzso the individual community zzso zzso strains corresponding to amplified zzso zzso transcripts were regarded as metabolically active, because in pure cultures transcripts were zzso in zzso growing cells but not in cultures in the stationary zzso DNA sequencing and comparative sequence analysis were used to identify the detected organisms on the basis of their zzso zzso zzso The genes of characterized zzso zzso showed a considerable extent of divergence zzso zzso whereas sequences obtained from bacterial populations of the zzso showed a low level of variation and indicated the coexistence of closely related strains probably belonging to the species zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, all detected populations were zzso under zzso conditions, no zzso zzso zzso was zzso Changes in activity and composition of zzso populations caused by changes in the environmental conditions could be monitored by using the approach described in this zzso
