To clarify the zzso status of two recently described zzso zzso groups, groups zzso and zzso three group zzso strains and eight group zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso ticks in Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the United Kingdom were zzso zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene restriction analysis, zzso zzso gene sequence analysis, randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso were used for genetic and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso patterns of three group zzso strains and eight group zzso strains were identical but differed from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from all group zzso and zzso strains yielded three fragments zzso zzso and zzso zzso and four fragments zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, zzso with an zzso coli zzso + zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein profiles of group zzso and zzso strains were zzso zzso analysis of the partial zzso zzso gene sequences showed that group zzso and zzso zzso were members of a zzso species distinct from previously characterized members of the zzso zzso Based on our present study and data from previous zzso zzso a new zzso species, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso complex, is zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of this new zzso
