We have previously isolated four zzso peptides from the immune zzso of the fifth zzso larvae of cabbage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, zzso They were induced by live, zzso gram negative zzso One of these novel zzso peptides was named zzso zzso zzso I is heat zzso its activity was retained after 60 zzso incubation at 100 degrees C, being effective against gram negative and/or gram positive zzso zzso I and zzso II showed a powerful synergistic effect on the zzso of bacterial zzso zzso acid composition was analyzed and the molecular weight was determined to be zzso Da by the zzso mass zzso To zzso the primary structure of zzso I, the zzso acid sequence of this zzso was determined by zzso sequencing zzso The zzso half of the zzso was rich in charged zzso acids and was zzso whereas the zzso half was zzso
