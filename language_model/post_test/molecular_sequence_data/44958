zzso II, a product of the brain of the adult zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso cells of three different species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso cell line of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Crude zzso cell membrane preparations were used to show that the zzso zzso zzso binds its zzso in a specific, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso constant of the zzso complex is zzso zzso zzso binding studies and zzso analysis suggest that every zzso cell displays zzso receptors on the zzso The zzso zzso zzso complex has an apparent molecular mass of about 300 zzso as determined by zzso Reduction causes the zzso zzso to zzso into two zzso with molecular masses of 90 zzso and 116 zzso The size and zzso structure of the putative zzso zzso on zzso cells show some similarities to the zzso insulin zzso
