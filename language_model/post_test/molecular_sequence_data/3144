zzso zzso outer membrane proteins zzso can elicit immunity to zzso in a zzso infection zzso Previously characterized zzso appear highly zzso and thus their potential to stimulate zzso immunity is of critical zzso In this study we undertook a global analysis of zzso zzso which were obtained by zzso zzso extraction and phase zzso zzso membrane zzso were isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso grown at 20, 30, and 37 degrees C with or without zzso fetal calf serum and, finally, in zzso zzso The zzso were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso patterns from each of the five conditions were compared via image analysis, and 37 zzso proteins were zzso zzso and characterized by mass zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso was used to rapidly identify zzso zzso present in sequence zzso zzso identified by this approach included the outer membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No known proteins from any cellular location other than the outer membrane were zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain zzso sequence information from eight novel proteins designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was not apparent at temperatures above 30 degrees C or under zzso zzso The expression of zzso was also zzso after iron zzso The zzso major zzso zzso was observed to undergo substantial zzso under all conditions except iron zzso Additionally, significant zzso of these mass forms was observed under iron limitation at 30 degrees C, but not at 30 degrees C alone, suggesting that zzso processing is dependent on zzso zzso zzso However, separate zzso products responded differently to changes in growth temperature and medium constituents, indicating that more than one process may be involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, under zzso conditions there was no zzso increase in the levels of the intact form of zzso The zzso and zzso expression of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso were confirmed by zzso with specific zzso Global analysis of the cellular location and expression of zzso proteins will be useful in the zzso of zzso sequence data and in providing insight into the biology of zzso
