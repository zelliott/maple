Previously, we described the generation and initial characterization of four zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso with impaired ability to degrade carbon zzso zzso et zzso zzso In this study, we show cloning and sequencing of an zzso zzso region in which all four zzso were zzso This zzso encodes eight potential genes and is located in the central part of the 25 zzso zzso recently identified by Lewis et zzso zzso and shown by them to be sufficient to zzso carbon zzso transformation capability upon other zzso The four zzso zzso zzso mapped in zzso F and I designated by Lewis et zzso zzso This is consistent with the results by Lewis et zzso zzso that zzso required for carbon zzso zzso We further established that zzso is required for zzso degradation since the three zzso in this zzso were unable to degrade carbon zzso We present our analysis of the gene and protein sequences from the zzso zzso region and propose a tentative model for the role of different genes in the synthesis and activity of zzso zzso the zzso factor responsible for carbon zzso zzso We also found a putative promoter that zzso with a zzso sequence in the region upstream of zzso zzso To test this putative promoter region and zzso we generated and zzso DNA fragments containing zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed promoter activity that is regulated by the concentration of iron in the zzso Finally, we screened a selection of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso strain known to produce zzso the presence of the genes characterized in this zzso None of the strains tested positive, suggesting that zzso zzso strain zzso may possess a distinct zzso zzso for zzso zzso
