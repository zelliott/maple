Following a blood zzso the zzso Aedes aegypti will have acquired an enormous sodium load that must be rapidly zzso to restore zzso zzso It is a process that demands robust sodium and fluid transport zzso Even though the identities of the components involved in this zzso transport across the zzso zzso zzso zzso have not been completely determined, zzso studies suggest the contribution of a zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso driven zzso by the zzso zzso created by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We have identified the putative zzso and designated it zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso gastric zzso and zzso When zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells lacking zzso zzso and zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and restores the zzso ability to grow in high zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells results in an zzso zzso zzso To determine the zzso kinetic properties, we zzso zzso from zzso cells expressing the protein into zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso exchange by zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso mediates zzso exchange of zzso and zzso for zzso We propose that zzso may be coupled to the inward zzso zzso across the zzso zzso and plays a role in the zzso of excess sodium and zzso while maintaining steady zzso pH in the principal zzso
