zzso which mimic functional activities of zzso were prepared by a technology of zzso zzso library using zzso zzso against zzso These peptides were named zzso zzso zzso prepared with zzso zzso by this technology were found to contain zzso as common zzso and they showed zzso activity not only on zzso between zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, but also on zzso of the tumor cell to the liver and zzso The zzso motif seems to be important to mimic the functional activity of the zzso zzso Next, we prepared zzso peptides using a zzso zzso against zzso zzso A zzso zzso with highest affinity to zzso was used to zzso mice to examine if the mice show their immune response to raise zzso against zzso We confirmed the immune response and succeeded in the production of a zzso zzso zzso against zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed specific binding to zzso on a zzso zzso plate and also melanoma zzso Interestingly, the zzso acid sequence of the zzso regions of light and heavy chains showed high similarity with those of the original zzso zzso zzso zzso used for the preparation of zzso zzso The technology of the zzso zzso library was applied to in zzso zzso study using an zzso experimental zzso The obtained peptides were found to show strong binding property to the zzso system and to be quite useful to carry an zzso drug to the tumor zzso Based on these experimental results, we discuss about some applications of this method to drug zzso
