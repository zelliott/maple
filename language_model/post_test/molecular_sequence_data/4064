Essential hypertension is a prevalent complex zzso disease and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in developed zzso Because of its complex and zzso nature, its genetic zzso still remain largely zzso The zzso zzso zzso rat model exhibits impaired sodium zzso which is hypothesized to play a key role in the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, genes associated with zzso regulation of salt and water balance are a zzso likely candidates for a zzso role in hypertension zzso The functional properties and zzso expression of the recently characterized zzso zzso suggest a putative zzso role in zzso sodium and fluid zzso Based on these zzso we investigated the potential involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We performed zzso analysis of the zzso zzso locus with zzso hypertension in an zzso zzso S X zzso zzso zzso hybrid male cohort characterized for blood pressure by zzso after 8 weeks of high salt zzso Further molecular analysis was done to identify putative zzso zzso molecular zzso that could account for the zzso zzso zzso involvement in zzso hypertension zzso 

The zzso zzso was mapped to rat zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso to the zzso marker by radiation hybrid mapping zzso zzso trait locus zzso analysis detected a highly significant linkage of the zzso zzso locus with high blood pressure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso S and zzso R zzso zzso zzso revealed two zzso acid zzso in the zzso S zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to the zzso R zzso zzso These zzso are associated with an increased zzso affinity for both zzso zzso and zzso and an enhanced zzso by the zzso resulting in increased zzso of zzso zzso with zzso increase in zzso zzso 

The observed molecular dysfunction in the zzso S zzso zzso is consistent with increased zzso sodium and fluid zzso observed in zzso S zzso Interestingly, the zzso locus is within the narrowed zzso 1 zzso region for blood pressure detected in different rat zzso linkage zzso Altogether, the data strongly suggest that the zzso zzso is a hypertension zzso gene in the zzso S rat model, as well as raises the hypothesis that it too zzso the zzso 1 blood pressure zzso identified in other hypertension rat zzso
