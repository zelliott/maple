The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is known to regulate expression of several genes concerned with carbon zzso Using a previously derived consensus sequence for zzso zzso additional potential operators were identified and tested for zzso binding in DNA band migration zzso zzso zzso in the control regions of zzso concerned with carbon metabolism bound zzso while those in zzso not concerned with carbon metabolism did zzso In zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso controls the expression of zzso zzso genes zzso key zzso of virtually every major zzso of carbon zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso altered the rates of zzso of at least 36 carbon zzso In general, zzso rates for zzso substances were enhanced while those for zzso substances were zzso zzso of zzso operators revealed that the consensus sequence for zzso binding is the same for zzso that are activated and zzso by zzso and permitted zzso of a revised zzso consensus zzso The reported observations indicate that zzso zzso the direction of carbon flow by zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso concerned with zzso and zzso carbon flow and by repression of those concerned with zzso carbon zzso
