We analyze zzso relationships among zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso species of the zzso zzso and zzso species zzso based on sequence data of zzso and zzso genes and discuss the evolution of temperate species in these zzso with reference to their zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso (the temperate zzso zzso off first in the tree based on the combined data set, but zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso zzso off first in the trees based on single zzso Thus, zzso relationships in this zzso are still zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso species are zzso close to the zzso species, and these zzso and zzso species form a cluster with the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that perhaps the zzso species derived from the zzso species and the zzso species derived from the zzso zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso species, the zzso zzso species may be better able to colonize temperate areas since, as in the temperate species, they have an ability to develop their zzso at moderately low zzso However, the zzso zzso species, as well as the zzso zzso species, were much less cold tolerant than the temperate zzso zzso considerable genetic zzso would be required for both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso species to adapt to temperate zzso
