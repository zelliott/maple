zzso is the smallest zzso protein and zzso the outer surface of the zzso shell of zzso zzso zzso It is located on the zzso at zzso amounts with zzso Its small size zzso zzso zzso and high copy number make it an attractive zzso to use as a probe to investigate the complex pattern of zzso protein zzso An in zzso zzso binding zzso and a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso were used to identify zzso zzso important for its interaction with zzso To test for regions of zzso that may be essential for binding to zzso three small zzso deletion zzso were generated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their zzso refer to the zzso acids deleted by the zzso The zzso at the C zzso of the zzso which encompasses a region of highly zzso zzso abolished binding to the zzso and the zzso of zzso to the nucleus in characteristic large zzso Additional zzso revealed that a region of zzso spanning from zzso 50 to 112 was sufficient for the zzso of the fused protein zzso to the nucleus and for it to bind to zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso two key zzso for zzso interaction, zzso and zzso were identified as judged by the zzso of zzso to nuclear zzso When these zzso were analyzed in the zzso binding zzso they were also found to eliminate binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Surprisingly, additional zzso that affected the ability of zzso to bind to zzso in zzso were zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a reduced ability of zzso to bind to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso In addition, the block of zzso zzso acids in the zzso end of the zzso had the most profound effect on the ability of zzso to interact with zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in a greatly diminished ability of zzso to bind zzso Yet, all of these zzso other than zzso were able to efficiently zzso or concentrate zzso into the nucleus, giving rise to the zzso zzso Thus, the interaction of zzso with the zzso appears to occur through at least two separate zzso The initial interaction of zzso and zzso may occur in the zzso or when zzso is localized in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for this zzso interaction, resulting in the zzso of zzso in the nucleus in concentrated zzso zzso to this association, additional zzso acids of zzso including those in the zzso zzso domain, are important for interaction of zzso with the three-dimensional zzso zzso
