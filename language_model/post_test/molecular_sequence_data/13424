zzso zzso induced in animals zzso with zzso a class III zzso agent, would spontaneously terminate and zzso into a zzso zzso This phenomenon has been attributed to the class III action of this drug, zzso zzso of zzso action potential duration and effective zzso zzso Since various observations suggested that these alone cannot explain the zzso phenomenon, we zzso that zzso affected zzso zzso synchronization by increasing zzso zzso Our recent experimental studies have shown that zzso antagonized the cellular decoupling to guinea pig zzso muscle strip caused by zzso with either a hypoxic normal zzso solution or an zzso high zzso zzso zzso We assumed that the most likely mechanism for the restoration of zzso zzso would be increasing zzso zzso zzso In order to test this hypothesis, we studied the modification of this zzso zzso by a zzso dependent protein zzso zzso The results clearly supported our assumption since the addition of zzso zzso zzso A- zzso zzso prevented the aforementioned cellular zzso action of zzso in a zzso zzso It can thus be concluded that changes in zzso zzso level are involved in the zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso
