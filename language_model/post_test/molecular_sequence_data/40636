zzso zzso are a closely related family of proteins that perform both zzso zzso zzso sulfur zzso and zzso zzso to modify zzso acid or protein targets with a zzso zzso group zzso Members of two of the four known zzso of zzso have been zzso typified by zzso which zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso which zzso a specific zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso In this work, we have characterized the two zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and find that, consistent with zzso predictions, zzso is required for zzso formation zzso zzso and zzso is required for modification of zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso The zzso responsible for the latter activity belongs to a third zzso zzso no member of which has previously been zzso We performed zzso experiments between zzso and zzso to narrow down the protein zzso responsible for distinguishing zzso from zzso and found that the zzso zzso domain, zzso involved with zzso zzso is likely not involved with this zzso Finally, we performed a zzso analysis to identify candidate zzso outside the zzso domain that may be involved with zzso zzso These zzso represent interesting targets for further zzso
