The strains of zzso zzso that contain the nitrate zzso zzso element zzso replace their zzso respiratory chain by an zzso counterpart made of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in response to nitrate and oxygen zzso This replacement depends on zzso and zzso two zzso to sensory zzso factors zzso in a zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is an zzso protein required in zzso to activate zzso on its own zzso promoter and on that of the zzso zzso but not required for the expression of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is required for the zzso of these three zzso and also for the repression of zzso the zzso that encodes the major respiratory zzso zzso expressed during zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that low zzso zzso allows the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso promoter and its transcription, whereas higher zzso zzso are required to repress zzso on the zzso zzso In conclusion, our data show a complex zzso mechanism by which zzso functions as the zzso switch that allows the zzso to take the control of the respiratory metabolism of its host during adaptation to zzso zzso
