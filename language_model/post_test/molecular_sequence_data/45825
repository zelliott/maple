The small zzso B virus surface zzso zzso is capable of driving the assembly and zzso of zzso delta virus zzso particles by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso Previously, a specific domain of the zzso protein zzso zzso including a zzso zzso at position 196 zzso was proven essential for zzso maturation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso particle zzso zzso but deleterious to zzso zzso zzso Here, the zzso zzso zzso was assigned to a loss of its ability for interaction with the large zzso zzso zzso a major component of the zzso Because the overall zzso zzso zzso is particularly rich in zzso an zzso acid frequently involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted to investigate the function of the zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso Single zzso of zzso between positions zzso and 201 with zzso or zzso were tolerated for zzso zzso but those affecting zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for zzso zzso This was proven to result from a reduced capacity of the zzso for interaction with zzso In addition, a zzso zzso zzso which has been described in zzso strains that arose in a few cases of zzso zzso patients, was deficient for zzso assembly as a consequence of its impaired capacity for interacting with zzso Interestingly, the fact that even the most conservative substitution of zzso for zzso at positions zzso zzso or 201 was sufficient to zzso interaction of zzso with zzso suggests that zzso zzso and zzso are located at a binding interface that is central to zzso zzso
