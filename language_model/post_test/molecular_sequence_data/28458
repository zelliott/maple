The structure of zzso a zzso zzso protein integral to cardiac zzso zzso was zzso using ultraviolet zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined in three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reflected its aromatic zzso acid zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso 265 and 268 zzso were attributed to zzso one zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 16 by the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso exhibited no zzso changes when examined in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso possesses a very high content of zzso in all three zzso and is unusually resistant to zzso zzso of zzso zzso by boiling in zzso increased the zzso content, suggesting that the highly ordered structure is not dependent upon zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso the zzso putative zzso domain, also exhibited a circular zzso spectrum characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were very similar, indicating that zzso does not alter zzso secondary structure zzso The results are consistent with a zzso model of zzso in which each domain contains a zzso and zzso may act to rotate one domain relative to the zzso
