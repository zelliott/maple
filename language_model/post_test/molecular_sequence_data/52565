A new zzso strain, designated zzso that is defective in the conversion of nascent zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso 2, has been zzso The zzso strain requires zzso for zzso zzso of cells with zzso followed by analysis of the zzso demonstrates a 50% increase in the labeling of zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso formation in the zzso relative to the parental zzso The zzso gene was isolated by zzso and it restores zzso zzso and zzso the defective zzso metabolism of the zzso zzso The zzso gene is zzso to the zzso drug resistance zzso zzso and is zzso to zzso which encodes a zzso transfer zzso The zzso zzso displays zzso but not zzso transfer activity, and its zzso causes suppression of zzso zzso However, zzso of the zzso gene fails to suppress the conditional zzso of zzso zzso The zzso metabolism of zzso to zzso occurs in zzso wild type zzso but is dramatically reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells demonstrates that the zzso strain accumulates nascent zzso in the zzso apparatus and a novel light membrane zzso consistent with a zzso in zzso transport processes that control zzso access to zzso zzso zzso
