We have investigated the ability of various zzso cell zzso types to induce primary zzso zzso T zzso zzso responses by single in zzso zzso Of these zzso types, only zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso cells could induce primary zzso responses, but by divergent zzso DC were capable of generating primary zzso zzso either by presenting viral zzso or processed infectious zzso In contrast, zzso cells could not present zzso zzso zzso after virus infection, but this cell line very efficiently presented zzso viral peptides to induce primary zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso B cell blasts or the zzso zzso cells did not have the ability to trigger zzso T cells by single in zzso zzso We have investigated several characteristics important for primary zzso response induction by DC and zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso response induction by DC or zzso cells was blocked by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso DC rapidly zzso with zzso T cells, which was independent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells did not form zzso with zzso T zzso Despite their abundant major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso DC did not bind much zzso added viral zzso In contrast, the zzso class I molecules on zzso cells bound a large quantity of zzso administered zzso Powerful zzso by DC and high expression of relevant zzso complexes on zzso cells are important features in the initial contact with zzso T zzso In a later stage of zzso both DC and zzso cells activate zzso (and zzso molecules at the T cell surface to strengthen and maintain the contact between T cell and zzso
