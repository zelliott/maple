zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that is linked with human zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso This zzso acid zzso originally identified from the zzso zzso has been found in more than 60 zzso zzso In addition to the zzso domain, many proteins in this class contain known zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso We have determined the zzso structure of the zzso zzso domain to high resolution using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this structure to a previously determined structure of the zzso zzso domain shows a significant difference in the zzso zzso zzso to structures of other zzso zzso shows a high degree of similarity to the zzso domain structures from zzso and zzso The results of selected and amplified binding zzso and zzso zzso with DNA suggest that the zzso zzso domain may function as a zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso we propose a model of the interaction of the zzso domain with zzso
