zzso is maintained by both known and unknown zzso regulatory zzso In the present study, we have identified zzso a zzso finger zzso as a novel zzso factor and characterized its role in zzso stem zzso We show that zzso is expressed highly in various types of zzso stem cells but not in their differentiated zzso We identified the presence of zzso nuclear zzso signals in particular zinc finger motifs and identified them as responsible for the nuclear zzso of zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed the presence of a zzso active zzso zzso Moreover, we confirmed the binding of zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter region of zzso indicating that the expression of this gene is regulated by a zzso zzso factor zzso We found that the expression of zzso zzso elements zzso such as zzso A zzso zzso zzso Long Interspersed Nuclear zzso zzso and Short Interspersed Nuclear zzso zzso zzso is significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso In line with the zzso of zzso we observed the occurrence of spontaneous DNA damage in zzso zzso Furthermore, we tested whether zzso can interact with zzso a zzso protein with a zzso repression function, and found the interaction between these two proteins in both in zzso and in zzso zzso The challenging of zzso cells with DNA damaging agent revealed that these cells are inefficient in repairing the damaged DNA, as cells showed presence of zzso zzso for a prolonged zzso zzso our study identified zzso as a novel zzso factor and unveiled its function in zzso integrity maintenance mechanisms of mouse embryonic stem zzso
