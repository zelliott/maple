We have recently assigned a locus for familial psoriasis zzso zzso to the region containing the zzso differentiation complex gene cluster on zzso zzso Gene zzso maps within this cluster and is reported to be markedly zzso in the skin zzso of zzso zzso In order to zzso zzso as a candidate for zzso zzso we have determined its zzso structure regarding zzso boundaries and the zzso start zzso The gene is zzso in three zzso and two zzso spanning zzso zzso The zzso zzso region contains zzso and zzso motifs and a zzso zzso We have performed functional zzso by using the zzso gene as a reporter and have confirmed that this region has strong promoter zzso To search for zzso variation within zzso we have designed a set of zzso to amplify each zzso and the gene zzso zzso chain reaction products from 15 unrelated zzso patients selected from zzso zzso and 25 normal controls have been zzso by zzso zzso zzso and direct sequencing zzso These analyses have revealed the presence of two zzso in the promoter region zzso and zzso zzso neither of which shows preferential association with the zzso Our results indicate that zzso can be excluded as a candidate for zzso zzso
