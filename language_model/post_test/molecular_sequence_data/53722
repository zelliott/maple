DNA sequences of the zzso gene coding for the 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso analysis in zzso A set of 12 zzso was developed and the entire gene was zzso for 16 zzso and zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences were compared to data from zzso for additional zzso zzso Analysis of the sequences revealed zzso zzso variation from zzso to zzso depending on the part of the gene zzso and the zzso level zzso zzso are discussed in comparison to previous data from zzso and zzso zzso sequencing and suggest the 42 zzso zzso gene as a potential molecular marker for reconstructing zzso relationships in the zzso zzso at species zzso
