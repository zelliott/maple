We have previously identified in the human zzso sequence data base four overlapping clones that could be aligned with both a predicted protein zzso deduced from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial zzso acid zzso obtained for a protein from canine pancreatic zzso We suggested that these proteins are zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and termed them zzso Here we verified the predicted protein sequence of human zzso by sequence analysis of the corresponding zzso Multiple alignment of related sequences identified these proteins as true zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis of the canine protein characterized zzso as a soluble zzso of the pancreatic zzso zzso This pancreatic zzso protein was shown to interact with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso interacts with zzso protein that may be involved in protein zzso We propose that zzso represents a zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and is involved in folding and maturation of newly zzso zzso
