Even though a zzso box element is localized approximately equal to 80 base pairs upstream of the zzso initiation site in many zzso zzso it is not recognized by a single ubiquitous zzso zzso We show here that such a sequence present in the rat zzso promoter binds a protein distinct from the zzso zzso factor zzso or from the zzso protein zzso previously zzso The protein binding to the zzso zzso sequence zzso or zzso zzso zzso is not exclusive to liver, since we found a protein with identical properties in zzso
