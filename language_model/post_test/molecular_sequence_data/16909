zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso surface protein implicated in formation of zzso by zzso isolated from chronic zzso zzso The presence of potential zzso motifs in the zzso acid sequence of zzso prompted us to investigate the effect of calcium on the zzso behavior of zzso zzso We found that addition of zzso amounts of calcium to the growth media inhibited zzso zzso of and zzso formation by zzso strain zzso zzso of zzso but not addition of zzso also inhibited zzso formation, whereas bacterial zzso in liquid media was greatly enhanced by zzso zzso In contrast, calcium or zzso agents had virtually no effect on the zzso of zzso strain zzso The zzso zzso by zzso of zzso into the zzso of a zzso strain exhibited a similar dependence on the calcium zzso indicating that the observed calcium zzso was an inherent property of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of two of the putative zzso zzso resulted in a zzso strain that was capable of forming a zzso but whose zzso was not inhibited by zzso Our results indicate that zzso binds zzso with low affinity and that zzso binding renders the protein zzso for zzso formation and for zzso zzso The fact that calcium zzso of zzso zzso behavior takes place in zzso at zzso similar to those found in milk serum supports the possibility that this zzso is relevant to the zzso and/or epidemiology of the bacteria in the zzso zzso
