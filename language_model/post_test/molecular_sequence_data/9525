The zzso zzso system zzso is the main zzso system of zzso Recent evidence suggests that the UPS plays a regulatory role in zzso zzso Here, we explore the possibility that the UPS is involved during zzso zzso of the sea cucumber zzso zzso These organisms can zzso most of their zzso tract following a process of zzso Initially, we identified components of zzso zzso zzso including sequences for zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins from the zzso sequences showed high degree of conservation that ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that these genes were zzso during zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated expression of alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins during zzso zzso and detected them in the zzso and zzso tissue of the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso was altered in animals treated with zzso a zzso zzso These findings support our contention that zzso are playing an important role during zzso zzso
