In search of vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation zzso we identified two genes zzso members of a new family of type II integral membrane zzso Both are zzso zzso and zzso alternative zzso initiation and zzso generate at least two major zzso of each zzso with the smaller zzso being truncated at the zzso We have named these proteins zzso and zzso for nuclear envelope zzso zzso as they are characterized by the presence of zzso clustered zzso repeats, zzso nuclear zzso sequences and a zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso demonstrated their zzso to the nuclear membrane with a novel zzso zzso sequence essential for zzso zzso Using zzso to zzso we documented its zzso with zzso zzso and zzso at the nuclear zzso and zzso labeling confirmed its presence at the nuclear envelope and in the nucleus where it zzso with zzso zzso is zzso regulated in both smooth and skeletal muscle and is zzso from the nuclear envelope to the nucleus and zzso during zzso zzso zzso These data and structural analogies with other proteins suggest that zzso may function as zzso of the zzso to maintain nuclear organization and structural zzso
