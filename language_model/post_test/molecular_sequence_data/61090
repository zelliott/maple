To gain insight into the role of the general zzso factor, zzso in the expression of nuclear genes involved in zzso zzso we investigated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso beta zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso promoters zzso into zzso cell zzso The numbers and organization of zzso elements vary in the four zzso but the magnitude of zzso by zzso human zzso was zzso A feature common to the four promoters is the presence of zzso zzso zzso elements that account for 50% or more of the zzso zzso by zzso The distribution and function of individual zzso zzso elements is less defined and appear to be more zzso Finally, data from zzso zzso cells provide the first direct proof for the involvement of zzso in the negative regulation of the zzso promoter and as a possible participant in repression of the zzso zzso The role of zzso in both the positive and negative regulation of zzso promoters is zzso
