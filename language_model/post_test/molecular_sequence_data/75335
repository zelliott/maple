zzso 15 zzso activities and its zzso levels are higher in zzso than in zzso from male zzso zzso zzso of zzso male mice resulted in repression of zzso zzso in zzso but increased it in zzso Two types of zzso zzso zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were previously cloned from zzso female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso With the use of zzso zzso as a probe, Type I and II zzso zzso zzso were isolated from libraries of zzso kidney zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso showed that Type I and II zzso from liver and kidney were identical and shared zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from a full-length Type I zzso indicated that Type I zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of zzso Nine zzso acid zzso were found in the Type II clone in 432 zzso acids overlapping Type zzso Type I zzso clones accounted for approximately zzso zzso zzso clones isolated from a male kidney library, whereas approximately zzso of zzso clones in a female kidney library were Type zzso Liver zzso libraries from males and females contained similar ratios of Type I and zzso zzso of zzso on Type I and II zzso were determined by Southern zzso of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso from kidney and liver zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and zzso prior to gel zzso to create the diagnostic restriction fragments specific for Type I or zzso zzso resulted in decreased levels of Type I zzso in male zzso In male liver, only Type I zzso rose significantly in response to zzso zzso administration returned the Type I zzso to normal levels in zzso zzso It therefore appears that the high levels of zzso zzso in male kidney were due to zzso induction of Type I zzso Both zzso I and II were zzso in male liver, which results in decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso was responsible for the repression and expression of Type I in liver and zzso but not Type zzso
