The zzso factor neural zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for rod zzso differentiation during zzso retinal zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and other zzso factors and zzso regulates the activity of zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso gene are associated with retinal degenerative zzso Here we report functional analyses of 17 zzso acid variations and/or zzso of zzso We show that 13 of these lead to changes in zzso zzso Six zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso identified in patients with zzso dominant zzso zzso result in a major zzso zzso that exhibits reduced zzso but enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso The truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso not zzso to the nucleus because of the absence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins do not bind to the zzso element, as revealed by zzso mobility shift zzso These three and zzso zzso zzso show reduced zzso activity and may contribute to zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso variations in zzso do not appear to directly cause zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of uncertain zzso Our results support the notion that zzso zzso in the zzso gene cause zzso dominant zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that differential zzso of zzso zzso its zzso regulatory activity, leading to a more precise control of gene zzso
