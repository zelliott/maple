Studies of the distribution of the three group I zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso had suggested that they were transferred to a common zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after it had zzso off from zzso zzso zzso AT and zzso A exhibited vertical inheritance and zzso in concert with their zzso zzso loss could occur after its zzso Loss of any one of the three zzso could occur in zzso zzso whereas only loss of zzso T had been found in the majority of zzso zzso zzso The existence of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with three zzso suggested that zzso loss could be reversed by zzso acquisition and that the whole process is a dynamic zzso This process of zzso acquisition and zzso loss reached different equilibrium points for different varieties and subgroups, which explained the irregular distribution of these zzso in zzso zzso Each of the three group I zzso was more closely related to other zzso sequences that share the same zzso point in the zzso zzso than to each zzso These zzso in zzso related organisms appeared to have a common zzso This system had provided a good model for studies on both the lateral transfer and common ancestry of group I zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
