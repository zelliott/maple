zzso zzso zzso active zzso of zzso in zzso is a key step in the zzso of the zzso zzso hormones zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso have been identified as a cause of zzso zzso transport zzso zzso and their investigation has yielded valuable zzso information on zzso Here we report novel findings derived from the thorough characterization of the zzso zzso zzso located in the second zzso loop zzso zzso zzso is incompletely zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso protein zzso As a result, zzso zzso is not targeted to the plasma membrane and therefore does not mediate any zzso transport in zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso is zzso active, as revealed by its ability to mediate zzso transport in membrane zzso Of all the zzso acid zzso we carried out at position 124 zzso D, zzso A, W, N and zzso only zzso restored targeting of zzso to the plasma membrane and zzso activity, suggesting a key structural role for the zzso group of zzso in the zzso maturation and cell surface zzso Using our zzso zzso model based on the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we propose an interaction between the zzso group of either R or zzso and the zzso group of zzso located in zzso We conclude that the interaction between zzso and zzso is critical for the local folding required for zzso maturation and plasma membrane zzso
