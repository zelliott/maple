In specialized parts of the body, free exchange of substances between blood and tissue cells is hindered by the presence of a barrier cell zzso Specialized milieu of the compartments provided by these zzso zzso seems to be important for specific functions of the tissue cells guarded by the zzso In zzso zzso such as the zzso barrier, zzso fluid barrier, zzso barrier, zzso barrier, zzso barrier, zzso barrier, and zzso barrier, zzso or zzso cells sealed by tight zzso or a zzso cell zzso serve as a structural basis of the zzso A selective transport system localized in the cells of the barrier provides substances needed by the cells inside the zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso is abundant in cells of the zzso zzso is concentrated at the critical plasma zzso of cells of the barriers and thereby constitutes the major machinery for the transport of zzso across these barriers where transport occurs by a zzso zzso In the barrier composed of zzso zzso such as the zzso of the zzso body in the case of the zzso barrier, gap junctions appear to play an important role in addition to zzso for the transfer of zzso across the zzso
