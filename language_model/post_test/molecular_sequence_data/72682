By using a zzso chain reaction based cloning strategy we isolated the gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The deduced zzso a zzso zzso zzso showed great similarity to zzso zzso from other zzso and bacteria, especially in the zzso zzso The main zzso regions found in other zzso zzso which are thought to be essential for the zzso activity, are present in the sequence from zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene in zzso coli showed that, as in other zzso and bacteria, a single zzso zzso the four zzso that convert zzso to zzso zzso zzso indicated that the level of expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso increased in response to blue zzso The zzso of this increase in zzso of the gene after blue light induction zzso and zzso zzso exhibit a zzso zzso dependence on zzso rate, suggesting that there could be two separate components involved in the reception of the low and high blue light zzso The presence of vitamin A in the medium zzso transcript zzso in the wild type and in some zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso did not affect the level of zzso of this zzso
