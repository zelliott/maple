The novel zzso rice zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso was not zzso but the components were separated clearly by two zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso focusing with zzso zzso zzso The major spots were located at zzso zzso and zzso and minor spots at zzso zzso zzso and zzso all spots were distributed at about zzso zzso Other faint spots were sometimes detected just below the major zzso In the western zzso analysis, all the spots reacted with the zzso zzso specific to zzso which bound to zzso and inhibited the zzso activity to zzso rabbit zzso The proteins of the spots at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso The major proteins at zzso zzso and zzso also had the common zzso acid sequence at zzso zzso which is almost identical to salt and drought zzso zzso gene products in rice zzso High zzso was also zzso in both the zzso and the zzso clones zzso the zzso component at zzso zzso which were selected with zzso zzso and an zzso designed from the partial zzso acid zzso All results suggest that zzso is composed of several zzso if not, related proteins having a common zzso and may belong to a family of zzso zzso
