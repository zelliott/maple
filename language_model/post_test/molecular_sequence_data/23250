Many biological processes rely on targeted protein degradation, the zzso of which contributes to the zzso of various zzso zzso plays a well-established role in this process, in which the zzso attachment of zzso chains to protein zzso culminates in their degradation via the zzso The three-dimensional structural zzso of zzso is highly zzso as a domain found in a variety of proteins of diverse biological zzso Some of these so-called zzso family zzso have recently been shown to bind components of the zzso zzso via their zzso zzso thus implicating zzso activity in pathways other than protein zzso In this chapter, we provide a structural perspective of how the zzso family of proteins interacts with the zzso
