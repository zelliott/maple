The zzso gene is one of the 19 open reading frames zzso found in the cop cluster borne by the large zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The entire cluster is involved in zzso of copper from the zzso as well as from the zzso The function of the corresponding zzso zzso is not yet clear, but it seems to be involved in the late response zzso We have cloned zzso and zzso and zzso the corresponding zzso zzso is rather unique as only one zzso can be found in the zzso It is a zzso protein with a molecular mass of 13 200 Da per zzso and located in the zzso The metal binding properties of zzso were examined by using a series of techniques such as zzso zzso circular zzso zzso electron zzso resonance zzso surface zzso resonance zzso mass zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso All together, the corresponding data are consistent with a zzso protein containing one zzso site per zzso These sites have a high affinity for zzso but can also bind zinc or zzso zzso does not contain any zzso or zzso but contains two zzso zzso and zzso features are consistent with the presence of zzso type 2 centers in a nitrogen zzso zzso zzso data confirm the involvement of the zzso zzso in copper zzso CD and zzso data reveal that zzso is partially zzso
