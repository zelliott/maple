We have analyzed the DNA sequence requirements for zzso of a 30 zzso zzso that contains a strong zzso T4 type II zzso zzso A novel method was used to generate zzso with each of the four zzso at 10 positions surrounding the zzso site, and zzso zzso were also prepared for the four internal positions of the staggered zzso zzso The zzso were tested for zzso in the presence of several zzso that induce zzso zzso four zzso agents of different classes (an zzso a zzso zzso an zzso zzso and an zzso and one zzso zzso At eight zzso positions zzso the zzso site, the same preferred bases were found regardless of which inhibitor was zzso These preferred bases show zzso symmetry with respect to the zzso site, indicating that both zzso of the zzso zzso interact with DNA in an analogous zzso In addition, we found that the preferred bases on the zzso side of each zzso zzso bond are highly specific to the inhibitor used in the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso interact directly with the DNA bases at the zzso site, placing the inhibitor binding site precisely at the site of DNA zzso
