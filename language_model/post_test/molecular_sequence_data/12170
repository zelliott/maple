zzso zzso and zzso are two major zzso zzso zzso present at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso properties of these two zzso isolated from rat zzso were studied and compared with those from rat zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso zzso were zzso from the respective zzso using both acid and salt extraction zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that acid exposure during isolation affects the zzso structure of both the zzso domain (in the presence of 1 M zzso and the zzso zzso (in the presence of zzso zzso The zzso of rat zzso DNA, as measured by circular zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso was at least 10 times more efficient than zzso by the zzso zzso zzso A site size of zzso base pairs was calculated for the zzso zzso zzso Among the different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest zzso property, followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the zzso zzso condensed rat zzso DNA more efficiently than linear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso condensed zzso zzso zzso prepared from rat liver zzso with relatively equal zzso On the other hand, there was no zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso specific zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed several interesting differences in the occurrence of zzso motifs at the zzso A striking observation is the presence of a direct repeat of an zzso motif zzso in zzso zzso that is absent in zzso zzso
