Human zzso zzso zzso invade the maternal zzso To identify the molecules involved in zzso invasion, we raised a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso with human zzso The molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was 160 zzso Although the zzso partial zzso acid sequence and one internal sequence are still zzso the other three internal sequences matched those deduced from the coding region of the estimated sequence tag zzso zzso zzso Based on this information, the full-length of the coding zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso which has not been reported elsewhere, was determined by zzso zzso This novel zzso named zzso has a zzso zzso motif containing a zzso active zzso It also has a zzso domain near the zzso Its zzso acid sequence is zzso with zzso zzso These data indicate that human zzso express zzso a novel protein belonging to zzso zzso
