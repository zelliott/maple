zzso induced DNA damage is implicated in disease, unless it is repaired by DNA zzso zzso in DNA repair capacity may be a risk factor for various disease zzso Thus, DNA repair proteins may be used as early detection and therapeutic zzso in cancer and other zzso For this purpose, the measurement of the expression level of these proteins in zzso will be zzso We applied liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso for the identification and zzso of DNA repair proteins human zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso DNA zzso zzso which are involved in zzso repair of zzso induced DNA zzso We zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these proteins to be used as suitable internal standards to ensure the accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso with zzso and analyzed by zzso Numerous zzso peptides of both proteins were identified on the basis of their zzso mass zzso These peptides matched the theoretical zzso fragments expected from zzso zzso and provided statistically significant protein scores that would unequivocally identify these zzso We also recorded the product zzso zzso of the zzso peptides and defined the characteristic product zzso zzso of the zzso proteins and their zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso monitoring on the basis of product zzso The results obtained suggest that the methodology developed would be highly suitable for the positive identification and accurate zzso of DNA repair proteins in zzso as potential zzso for cancer and other zzso
