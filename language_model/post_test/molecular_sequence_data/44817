We cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein from an zzso human zzso leukemia cell zzso The zzso was isolated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso parental leukemia cells versus those from a zzso zzso of the same zzso The selected zzso encodes a protein that is a close zzso of one zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressed protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso was directly confirmed by Northern zzso zzso to be substantially enhanced in the zzso cells compared with the zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso in zzso leukemia cells was sensitive to the stage of the cell cycle and to induction of zzso Although the relationship between these observations and the zzso state of the human zzso leukemia cell line used in these studies is unknown, to our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in zzso cells of zzso and cell cycle zzso and zzso expression of a member of the zzso zzso gene zzso
