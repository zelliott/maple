The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a protein involved in zzso development and zzso The salient feature of zzso is the presence of four zzso zzso zinc fingers in the zzso zzso to zzso an zzso zzso alternative zzso event zzso three zzso acids zzso between the third and fourth zinc fingers, which zzso DNA zzso The ratio of zzso zzso is crucial for normal zzso Previous work has shown that zzso zzso interacts with zzso factors and that zzso zinc fingers, particularly zinc finger one, bind to zzso in zzso In this study we investigate the role of zinc finger one and the zzso zzso in zzso by expressing zzso proteins in zzso cells and zzso zzso We find that both full-length zzso zzso and deletion zzso that include zinc finger one zzso with zzso particles zzso on density zzso In zzso zzso both zzso located to the lateral zzso of zzso zzso zzso only the zzso zzso was detected in zzso but not when zzso with zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso which is consistent with an in zzso interaction between zzso via the zzso zzso zzso was also detected in the zzso zzso component of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was most zzso bound to zzso followed by the zzso the least zzso bound was zzso zzso minus zinc finger zzso zzso of the zzso factor early growth response 1 zzso whose three zinc fingers zzso to zzso zinc fingers zzso caused general zzso loop zzso and zzso zzso However, a construct in which zzso zinc finger one was added to zzso zzso the properties of zzso zzso We suggest that in evolution, zzso has acquired the ability to interact with transcripts and zzso factors because of the modification of zinc finger one and the zzso alternative zzso
