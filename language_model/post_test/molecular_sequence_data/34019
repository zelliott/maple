zzso roles of putative zzso 8 in the zzso tail of the human zzso zzso zzso were investigated using deleted and zzso zzso zzso While the deletion of the zzso tail did not decrease the total expression level, surface zzso or zzso binding zzso the zzso zzso response, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were totally zzso The zzso lacking the zzso tail also failed to respond to an inverse zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso tail is involved in the regulation of zzso activity by changing zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso acids in the putative zzso 8 such as zzso at position zzso zzso and 423 zzso or zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso were important for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso also resulted in a zzso that was less responsive to zzso by the inverse zzso zzso the existence of an intermediate zzso that can be either activated or zzso Our results suggest that zzso interface of putative zzso 8 is important for the regulation of zzso zzso activity, presumably by stabilizing the zzso to the plasma zzso
