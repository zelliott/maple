zzso zzso cleave the zzso zzso channel zzso at several positions zzso in part, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso increases zzso activity by increasing open zzso however, the role of zzso zzso from the channel core remains zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso unexpectedly targets to the nucleus being particularly strong in zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso targets to the zzso and plasma membrane in a manner similar to full-length zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the nucleus has functional consequences for zzso of zzso proteins containing this segment of the channel, but not the zzso zzso decrease zzso activity in a zzso zzso The mechanism of this negative regulation is associated with a decrease in the functional zzso of zzso at the plasma zzso zzso of the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso reveals possible nuclear zzso signals zzso zzso at the extreme zzso zzso and just preceding the first zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso preceding the first zzso domain in zzso but not that at the extreme zzso zzso zzso both targeting to the nucleus and negative regulation of zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the release of the zzso zzso of zzso following zzso being functionally important for signaling to the nucleus in a manner similar to zzso signaling and release of the zzso zzso tail of zzso
