zzso II zzso zzso originally described as zzso zzso protein of the anterior zzso is present in large dense core zzso of several zzso cells and zzso We raised zzso in rabbits to zzso of two synthetic peptides zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso flanked in the primary structure of zzso II by pairs of basic zzso and used them to investigate the zzso processing of this protein by zzso and a newly developed zzso The sensitivity of this zzso was 30 zzso for zzso zzso and 60 zzso for zzso zzso The highest degree of processing of zzso II zzso zzso occurs in zzso One of the peptides zzso zzso is not generated to any significant zzso The other zzso zzso zzso however, is formed in zzso and in brain the free zzso apparently represents the zzso zzso The highest zzso of zzso zzso are found in the zzso two- to zzso lower levels are present in the zzso zzso nucleus, zzso and zzso These zzso are comparable to those of established zzso In order to indicate the special relevance of zzso II and of this zzso for brain we have named this zzso zzso The newly developed zzso for this zzso will be a useful tool to establish its zzso role in zzso
