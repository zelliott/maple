The tissue polarity gene fuzzy zzso has two roles in the development of zzso wing zzso One is to specify the correct orientation of the hair by limiting the site of zzso initiation to the zzso zzso of the wing zzso The other is to control wing cell hair number by maintaining the integrity of the zzso components that direct hair zzso The requirement for zzso in these processes is temperature dependent, as the zzso zzso zzso is cold zzso Analysis of mosaic wings has shown that the zzso gene product functions cell zzso We have cloned the zzso transcript, which encodes a novel zzso zzso protein that shares significant zzso with proteins zzso by zzso zzso The fourth putative zzso domain does not appear to play a significant role in tissue polarity as it is deleted in a weak zzso zzso zzso of the zzso transcript is zzso regulated and zzso sharply at the time of wing cell zzso zzso
