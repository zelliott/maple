zzso zzso is an important zzso species that causes zzso in many zzso of plants causing severe economic losses zzso A primer set was designed based on the sequences of the zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso regions for use in a conventional zzso zzso The primer set zzso amplified a single product of zzso with DNA extracted from 20 Mexican zzso of zzso zzso The specificity of zzso was confirmed by the absence of amplified product with DNA of four other zzso species and zzso different zzso zzso This primer set is capable of amplifying only zzso zzso from different contaminated zzso or zzso structures, thereby zzso rapid diagnoses as there is no need to isolate and cultivate the fungus in order to identify zzso The sensitivity of detection with this zzso method was zzso of zzso DNA from the zzso This is the first report of a zzso zzso primer zzso It allows rapid pathogen detection and provides growers with a powerful tool for a rational selection of zzso to control zzso in different crops and in the zzso zzso
