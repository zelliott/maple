zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso peptides with established potential for treatment of type 2 zzso They bind and activate the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso with similar affinity and potency and thereby promote insulin zzso in a zzso zzso zzso belongs to family B of the seven zzso zzso coupled zzso The zzso zzso domain zzso is a zzso binding domain with differential affinity for zzso and zzso low affinity for zzso and high affinity for zzso The superior affinity of zzso for zzso was previously explained by an additional interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso In this study we have combined zzso and pharmacological approaches thus relating structural properties of the zzso in solution to their relative binding affinity for zzso We used both a zzso competition zzso and zzso zzso stabilization of zzso to measure the relative affinity of full zzso zzso and zzso zzso for soluble zzso zzso The zzso in solution and the zzso consequences of zzso binding to zzso were characterized by circular zzso and zzso zzso We found a correlation between the zzso content of the free zzso and their relative binding affinity for zzso supporting the hypothesis that the zzso are zzso at least in the segment that binds to zzso The zzso of zzso was not necessary to maintain a superior zzso of zzso compared to zzso The results suggest that the differential affinity of zzso is explained almost entirely by divergent zzso in the central part of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso In view of our results it appears that the zzso plays only a minor role for the interaction between zzso and zzso and for the differential affinity of zzso for zzso and zzso
