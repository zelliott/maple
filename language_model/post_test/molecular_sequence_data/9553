The Marin strain of zzso zzso Say is a zzso population that was collected in Marin County, California, in 2001 and subsequently maintained in the laboratory under regular zzso zzso 

In this study, two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso of these genes indicated that they belong to the Delta class of insect zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso were 59 and zzso identical zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso coli and zzso by affinity zzso The zzso zzso exhibited unique selectivity towards the general zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also differed in their sensitivity to known zzso of zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity with zzso zzso while zzso appeared to lack this zzso zzso was able to metabolize zzso zzso while zzso metabolism by zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso showed no zzso metabolism of zzso Gene expression of zzso and zzso in Marin mosquitoes was elevated about twofold in comparison with that found in a zzso zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso and zzso have unique zzso zzso but they do not appear to play major roles in zzso resistance in Marin zzso
