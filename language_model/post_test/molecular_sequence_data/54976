zzso mapped protein 1 zzso is a newly discovered protein in zzso zzso It is recognized as a potential vaccine candidate against zzso zzso and a highly zzso protein in zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was predicted in the zzso zzso zzso it was still not identified and zzso In this study, zzso sequence zzso zzso was cloned by zzso from zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso was zzso by an open reading frame of zzso zzso which zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that there was neither a signal zzso nor a zzso region present in the zzso zzso acid zzso However, several kinds of functional protein zzso including an zzso site and a zzso site were zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and then zzso zzso was used to prepare specific zzso in zzso Mouse zzso zzso raised against the zzso recognized an approximate 43 zzso native zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was localized on the membrane of zzso zzso zzso The zzso site and the zzso site were found to contribute to the zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso could inhibit cell invasion by zzso zzso zzso in zzso All the results indicate that zzso is likely to be a membrane protein of zzso zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso
