The neurological mouse zzso shambling zzso exhibits zzso and zzso zzso zzso cloning of zzso showed that it encodes zzso protein zzso which is required for formation of the zzso junction in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso in the zzso gene that results in a frame shift and a premature stop zzso at the zzso The truncated zzso protein that is generated lacks the zzso and zzso zzso Here, we found that the zzso zzso of zzso mice lack zzso junctions and contain large zzso and abnormal zzso of zzso zzso that indicate altered zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso mice showed reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are thought to form a protein complex in the zzso zzso protein zzso however, was normally zzso The zzso mice had zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso of zzso zzso was reduced in zzso nerves and that the visual response was attenuated in the primary visual zzso These abnormalities likely contribute to the neurological zzso of the zzso zzso
