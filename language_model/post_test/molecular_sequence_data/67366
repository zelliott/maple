Human respiratory zzso virus zzso is the most important viral cause of serious pediatric respiratory illness zzso Currently, the most promising zzso vaccine candidate is a zzso zzso zzso virus named zzso in reference to its set of attenuating zzso In a previous clinical study, more than one-third of zzso zzso wash zzso exhibited partial loss of the zzso zzso Most of this instability appeared to be due to zzso at a zzso point zzso called zzso This zzso zzso is a zzso zzso substitution at position zzso zzso of the zzso L protein that contributes to the zzso and zzso zzso of the vaccine zzso The goals of the present study were to identify a zzso zzso at position zzso zzso a comparable level of zzso and to use this to develop a genetically stable version of the vaccine zzso We modified zzso zzso zzso to insert each of the 20 possible zzso acids at position zzso 19 viruses were zzso We also investigated small deletions at or near this position, but these viruses were not zzso zzso analysis identified alternative attenuating zzso acids for position zzso Several of these zzso acids were predicted, based on the genetic code, to be zzso to zzso Classical zzso using temperature stress tests in zzso combined with zzso sequencing, confirmed this stability but identified a second site with a zzso zzso at position zzso It was possible to stabilize the zzso site as well, providing a stable zzso zzso Further stress tests identified additional incidental zzso but these did not reverse the zzso zzso An improved version of the vaccine candidate virus was constructed and validated in zzso by temperature stress tests and in zzso by evaluation of zzso in zzso zzso In addition to developing an improved version of this promising zzso zzso vaccine candidate, this study demonstrated the propensity of an zzso virus to escape from zzso but also showed that, through systematic analysis, zzso can be used to cut off the routes of zzso
