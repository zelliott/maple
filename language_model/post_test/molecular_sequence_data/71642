zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare neurological syndrome characterized by zzso in combination with zzso abnormal red cells zzso A partial zzso artificial zzso zzso of the zzso critical region on zzso zzso has been constructed, and 21 expressed sequence tags have been zzso We have subsequently cloned zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, and have identified zzso in the zzso The zzso structure of both genes has been established after construction of a bacterial artificial zzso zzso that showed zzso and zzso to be in a zzso arrangement zzso Northern analysis found zzso to be zzso expressed and zzso to display a more restricted pattern of zzso zzso analysis of the coding regions and zzso sites for zzso and zzso in 10 affected individuals from different families identified no changes likely to cause zzso however, two distinct single zzso zzso in the coding region of zzso have been zzso This study has excluded two plausible candidate genes from involvement in zzso and has provided a solid platform for a zzso cloning zzso
