A novel zzso cell line, designated zzso was established from the zzso zzso of a zzso patient with Hodgkin's disease zzso of zzso zzso zzso The majority of cells grow zzso and display typical zzso characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso large zzso and zzso cells with prominent zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and lack of zzso zzso zzso cells strongly expressed zzso a recently described intermediate zzso zzso the expression of which is restricted to H cells, zzso cells, and in zzso cultivated peripheral blood zzso In addition zzso expression of zzso zzso factor 1 zzso could be induced in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis did not detect zzso of T cell zzso beta and zzso H zzso thus demonstrating the lack of zzso zzso zzso cells were also devoid of zzso virus zzso zzso cells zzso express zzso for zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso increased zzso expression as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and induced the de zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso into severe combined zzso zzso mice by intravenous or subcutaneous zzso led to development of zzso tumors with zzso and destructive zzso In addition zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso analysis of tumor cells revealed the same features as zzso zzso This cell line might be an important tool for understanding the zzso and biology of zzso In addition the zzso mice model might prove helpful in developing new therapeutic zzso
