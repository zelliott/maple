zzso of zzso in cells can suppress the zzso of specific zzso Because several of these genes have common zzso regulatory zzso we investigated the possibility that this effect of zzso is zzso through a specific zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso detect only one form of zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso either zzso or zzso contain at least three forms of zzso zzso characterization of the various zzso forms showed that they have the same native molecular weight but differ in charge zzso The more zzso charged zzso forms present in zzso cells are converted into that found in normal cells by treatment with acid zzso suggesting that they represent a more zzso form of the zzso zzso The various zzso forms have a similar zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso from zzso promoters is specifically suppressed in cells that zzso zzso zzso This effect requires zzso zzso zzso promoter activity is also suppressed in zzso cells during active growth zzso to the zzso zzso Interestingly, actively growing zzso cells contain forms of zzso similar to those in zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso forms present in cells that express high amounts of zzso correlate with a lower zzso rate of zzso promoters in zzso Our results provide a basis for the suppression of specific gene zzso by zzso
