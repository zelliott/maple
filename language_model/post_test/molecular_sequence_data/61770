The zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso which is essential for viral zzso zzso expression in bacteria generated zzso to zzso lower yield and zzso less product per zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso than type zzso Further, unlike type zzso zzso type zzso zzso failed to exhibit cooperative properties in the zzso described zzso zzso in zzso stability may partially account for the inability to efficiently zzso zzso gel zzso analyses confirm differences between these zzso zzso although affinity for the column rather than size may account for the differences in zzso To further address this complexity, a panel of zzso type zzso zzso zzso were evaluated and zzso a role for the thumb zzso of zzso zzso zzso as critical for cooperative zzso
