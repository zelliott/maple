zzso zzso a key zzso in the hormonal zzso pathway, mediates the conversion of zzso to zzso This work describes the molecular cloning of the zzso zzso the European sea bass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by means of reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The zzso is zzso in length and encodes a putative protein of 517 zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso expressed a transcript of about zzso in zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence indicated zzso identity with zzso zzso of other zzso fish, the highest identity being found with the Japanese flounder, zzso zzso zzso was lower zzso with the zzso forms first reported in zzso zzso Only zzso identity was observed with the corresponding zzso of the zzso fish, zzso zzso zzso revealed that the sea bass zzso zzso was also zzso at low levels, in zzso and zzso Between the zzso and zzso terminal regions zzso the sea bass zzso gene contains eight zzso All zzso conform to the zzso rule for zzso zzso and are inserted in exactly the same positions as those found in zzso zzso and the human zzso zzso
