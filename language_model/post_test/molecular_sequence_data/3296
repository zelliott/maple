zzso relationships among the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso resistance gene zzso zzso from 30 zzso and nine families were evaluated relative to zzso for these zzso More than 800 zzso zzso were zzso primarily from zzso zzso zzso and zzso species, but also from representatives of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso maximum likelihood, and distance methods were used to zzso these zzso relative to previously observed gene zzso as well as within more closely related sequence zzso zzso sequences using a distance zzso of 250 zzso units zzso accepted zzso per 100 zzso identified at least five ancient sequence zzso with representatives from several plant families: the previously observed zzso gene zzso and a minimum of four deep splits within the zzso gene zzso The deep splits in the zzso zzso are also reflected in comparisons of zzso acid substitution rates in various species and in ratios of zzso zzso substitution rates ( zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Lower zzso zzso values in the zzso than the zzso sequences suggest greater functional constraints in the zzso zzso At least three of the five identified ancient zzso appear to zzso the zzso zzso zzso sequences are absent from the zzso zzso as observed in previous zzso In both zzso zzso with sequences separated by approximately 150 zzso units are family but not zzso specific, providing a rough measure of minimum dates for the first diversification event within these zzso Within any one zzso particular zzso may be dramatically zzso or zzso suggesting preferential expansions or losses of certain zzso types within particular zzso and suggesting that no one species will provide models for all major sequence types in other zzso
