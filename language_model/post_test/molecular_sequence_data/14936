zzso zzso that can zzso zzso compounds have been isolated, identified and characterized from different microbial species in order to use them in zzso of zzso zzso We isolated a bacterial strain zzso from an agricultural soil bacterial zzso which can zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that strain zzso is capable of degrading pesticides zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso amplification were performed for strain characterization and zzso respectively, showing that the strain zzso is related to the zzso zzso zzso which has a single zzso of zzso zzso and has no zzso zzso library was constructed from DNA of zzso zzso zzso A gene called zzso zzso zzso from zzso consists of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of 25 zzso which was isolated using activity zzso This gene zzso had no similarity to any genes reported to degrade zzso When zzso cassette was placed in the gene zzso zzso activity was suppressed and zzso zzso zzso had no growth with zzso as a nutrients zzso
