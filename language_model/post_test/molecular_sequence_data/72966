The zzso zzso folate zzso contains nine zzso The first six genes are involved in the zzso of zzso acid and zzso and have been characterized zzso The zzso of the folate zzso contains three additional zzso zzso potentially zzso a zzso protein of 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of 338 zzso acids with zzso to the zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso and a putative zzso zzso gene zzso Four transcripts were identified which zzso the first two, eight or all nine proteins or only the last protein zzso The folate zzso contains two zzso one upstream of the first gene and the second preceding zzso zzso of the entire folate zzso starts 33 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso of zzso the first gene of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso dramatically reduces the zzso levels of the folate zzso transcripts zzso the first eight and all nine zzso but only has a relatively small effect on the zzso level of the zzso zzso transcript zzso the first two genes of the zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso of the folate zzso is regulated in a zzso zzso zzso were present in very low levels after zzso phase, but were dramatically increased directly after transfer of the cells to fresh zzso These results indicate that zzso of the folate zzso is regulated by zzso and also depends on the growth phase of the zzso
