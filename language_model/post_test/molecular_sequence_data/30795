The nuclear zzso is an intermediate zzso network underlying the inner nuclear zzso zzso of zzso proteins is believed to cause zzso zzso during zzso and zzso M phase, but the M zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso a major element implicated in controlling the zzso cell cycle, zzso chicken zzso zzso in zzso on sites that are specifically zzso during M phase in zzso zzso zzso zzso is capable of inducing zzso zzso upon incubation with isolated zzso One of the target sites of zzso zzso is identified as a motif zzso zzso in the zzso domain of all zzso zzso These results lead us to propose that zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso results from direct zzso of zzso by zzso zzso
