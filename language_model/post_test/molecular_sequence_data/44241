The complete DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso IV has been zzso Apart from zzso zzso which contains the 1-2 zzso zzso zzso zzso IV is the longest zzso zzso zzso It was split into three parts, which were zzso by a consortium from the European zzso the zzso Centre, and groups from St Louis and Stanford in the United zzso The sequence of zzso base pairs contains zzso predicted or known zzso zzso zzso of which have been previously zzso Of the zzso new zzso 225 zzso are zzso to previously identified genes and zzso zzso have unknown functions or zzso to zzso open reading frames zzso On average there is one gene approximately every two zzso zzso on alternating regional variations in zzso zzso there is a large central domain with a lower zzso content that contains all the zzso zzso zzso elements and most of the zzso zzso zzso IV shares with zzso II, zzso zzso zzso and zzso some long clustered zzso which partly explain its zzso
