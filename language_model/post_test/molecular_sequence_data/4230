We have isolated a zzso zzso the zzso zzso by zzso on zzso zzso zzso from both human heart and zzso The sequence zzso with the rat and mouse zzso receptors was zzso zzso of identity in the zzso acid zzso None of the 24 zzso acid zzso observed between rat and human receptors are at positions likely to modify their zzso Comparing the pharmacological properties of six zzso and five zzso on rat and human zzso receptors revealed no significant zzso We have analyzed the behavior of zzso a full and a partial zzso on mouse zzso zzso and human heart biological responses zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso was zzso lower than that of zzso for the stimulation of zzso receptors zzso in two different cell lines zzso and zzso but increasing the zzso density suppressed the partial zzso effect of zzso
