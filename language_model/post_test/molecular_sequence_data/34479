Reliable and robust systems for engineering functional major zzso complex class II zzso proteins have proved zzso zzso of such systems would enable the engineering of zzso zzso complexes for therapeutic and diagnostic zzso In this paper, we have developed a system based on insect cell surface display that allows functional expression of zzso zzso molecules with or without a zzso bound human zzso basic protein zzso zzso which is amenable to directed evolution of zzso zzso with improved T cell zzso zzso zzso This study represents the first example of functional display of human zzso complexes on insect cell zzso In the process of developing this zzso engineering system, we have also explored the potential of using zzso surface display for the same zzso Our data suggest that zzso display is a useful system for analysis and engineering of zzso binding of zzso zzso but not suitable for directed evolution of zzso complexes that bind with low affinity to zzso zzso
