Two chemical zzso have been developed for identifying and zzso peptides which either could be biologically active by virtue of their zzso or could be zzso for zzso zzso zzso The first zzso is specific for the zzso of zzso Using zzso the zzso was converted via a Hoffman reaction into a primary zzso which was then zzso by zzso The second zzso is specific for zzso at the zzso of a zzso zzso at the zzso was zzso to form zzso which was then separated and zzso by reverse phase zzso These zzso were used to detect peptides in zzso extracts of bovine zzso bovine anterior lobe zzso and zzso heart which may be of biological zzso
