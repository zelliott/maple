zzso zzso of zzso class II genes is commonly carried out using zzso chain reaction zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso or a combination of the zzso and restriction zzso length zzso methods zzso However, the identification of the zzso type by zzso and zzso is very time-consuming which is zzso for the typing of zzso organ zzso We have developed a zzso typing method using zzso in combination with zzso amplification zzso which allows the identification of the 17 most frequent zzso in one step using seven amplification zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso typing is easy to perform, and the results are easy to interpret in routine clinical zzso The zzso method is therefore better suited to zzso typing for organ transplantation than other zzso
