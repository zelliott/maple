zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are common soft tissue zzso of zzso zzso they often show zzso zzso In some cases, differential diagnosis of zzso and zzso is zzso It has been reported that zzso zzso are characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this results in two types zzso I and type zzso of zzso fusion zzso In this study, the zzso zzso transcripts in seven zzso soft tissue tumors of Asian patients were analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction, DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso One zzso zzso and two round cell zzso possessed a zzso transcript whose fusion point was the same as that of the type I fusion transcript reported previously for zzso zzso We were thus able to detect the type I zzso fusion transcript in clinical specimens of zzso from Asian patients, including the first examples of round cell zzso These results suggest that the detection of zzso zzso transcripts or zzso genes can be used as a diagnostic tool for the pathological diagnosis of zzso
