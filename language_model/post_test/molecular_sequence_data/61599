The zzso region of zzso codes for several membrane zzso most of which are involved in immune evasion and prevention of host cell zzso We explored the zzso and targeting mechanisms of zzso the most recently described member of this group, by using an in zzso translation system supplemented with zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso one of the smallest zzso proteins known, zzso across the membrane of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso yet zzso manner, reminiscent of the zzso of zzso zzso Our analysis also demonstrated that zzso could achieve several distinct zzso zzso In addition to the previously zzso type III orientation zzso termed zzso we detected a zzso form adopting the opposite orientation zzso termed zzso as well as the possibility of a fully zzso form (N and C zzso are both zzso termed zzso Due to the zzso of a positively charged domain, both the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso constitute exceptions to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso are the first examples of zzso zzso proteins in higher zzso that are not tail zzso zzso zzso forms were also found in zzso cells, as both N and C zzso of zzso were detected on the zzso surface of zzso zzso The demonstration of unexpected zzso forms and zzso mechanisms for zzso zzso conventional thinking about membrane protein zzso and advises that both the mode of targeting and zzso of zzso proteins should be determined zzso
