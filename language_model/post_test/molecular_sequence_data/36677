The zzso zzso region that carries a copy of the mouse Y zzso zzso gene can be attached to the zzso end of either the Y or the X zzso During male zzso zzso zzso freely between the X and Y zzso with an estimated zzso frequency not significantly different from 50% in either zzso During female zzso zzso zzso freely between the X zzso to which it was attached and an zzso zzso A male mouse carrying the original zzso region on its Y zzso and the shorter zzso zzso on the X, also showed 50% zzso between the sex zzso Evidence of unequal zzso between the two zzso regions was zzso using five markers deleted from zzso 3 zzso zzso regions were detected in 159 progeny zzso Four other zzso (one from the original cross and three from later zzso were presumed to have been derived from illegitimate pairing and zzso between zzso and the zzso region on the short arm of the Y zzso The generation of new zzso throws light on the arrangement of gene zzso and other markers within the short arm of the mouse Y zzso
