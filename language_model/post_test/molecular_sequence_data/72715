A new zzso sequence zzso was identified in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as an zzso segment containing zzso terminal zzso repeats and flanked by zzso direct zzso The three zzso copies of this element have two overlapping open reading frame zzso genes named zzso and zzso However, significant variations between individual copies were found, suggesting that zzso zzso have occurred in an original single zzso zzso the consensus zzso element derived from the comparison of the three available copies should contain a single zzso sufficient to zzso a basic protein of 267 zzso acids which exhibited high similarity to the putative zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso A minimum of five to seven copies were detected by zzso experiments in the zzso zzso In remarkable contrast with the two previously reported zzso zzso zzso several copies of zzso have been detected in all of the clinical zzso tested so zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a close relative of zzso does not contain this element, but its occurrence in the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that this species has exchanged DNA with zzso zzso directly or through an intermediate zzso
