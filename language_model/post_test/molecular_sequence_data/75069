The zzso b gene of zzso zzso has an zzso zzso near its zzso end but the zzso b genes of the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lack an zzso Recent results have shown that 34 zzso that are not zzso in the zzso are added within the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso b transcripts during or after zzso These additions create an zzso in the transcript that is 20 zzso acids upstream of the zzso predicted from the zzso zzso We report here that the zzso b transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso also contain added zzso within their zzso zzso The additions occur in similar numbers and positions and an in frame zzso is created at a similar site in all three zzso These data strongly suggest that the created zzso functions as the initiation zzso for zzso b in these zzso Since some other zzso zzso genes also lack conventional initiation zzso creation of initiation zzso may be an important function of zzso zzso
