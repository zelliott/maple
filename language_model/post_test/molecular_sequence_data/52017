We describe here a method for DNA zzso of human zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of DNA from zzso hybrids, following zzso with restriction zzso DNA zzso with restriction zzso prior to zzso amplification reduces the total number of amplified zzso The number and pattern of bands of zzso products observed in an zzso medium are zzso specific and provide a zzso zzso for individual human zzso Using this approach, we have produced fingerprints for human zzso 2, 5, 7, 9, and zzso The zzso of this approach to zzso identification was assessed by comparing the fingerprints obtained for two different hybrids containing zzso zzso DNA fragments specific for the long and the short arms of human zzso 12 have also been zzso In addition, zzso DNA fragments, specific for different zzso were used to probe Southern blots of a hybrid cell panel to identify human zzso present in hybrid cell zzso The zzso specificity of these zzso permits the identification of intact as well as rearranged zzso composed of segments arising from more than one zzso
