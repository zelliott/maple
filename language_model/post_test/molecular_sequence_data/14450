zzso zzso an zzso marine zzso was isolated from Mediterranean seawater at zzso beach, Valencia, zzso The strain was characterized in a zzso study and was placed zzso within the zzso zzso in the family zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso is related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso analyses also showed that strain zzso forms a stable zzso only with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso plus a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso to grow, does not reduce nitrate to zzso and uses a large number of carbohydrates as sole carbon zzso It is positive for zzso and zzso activities and zzso zzso zzso activities displayed in the zzso zzso strip were alkaline zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso Major cellular fatty acids were summed feature 8 zzso and/or zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests allowed clear zzso differentiation of this isolate from the only described species of the zzso zzso It is evident from the zzso and zzso data obtained that the strain should be classified in a novel species in the zzso zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
