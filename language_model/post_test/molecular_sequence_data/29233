zzso zzso species initiate infection of a zzso host by inducing their own zzso into zzso zzso During the zzso process, the bacteria zzso an intrinsic zzso system to release proteins that enter host zzso The zzso zzso proteins subsequently interact with host cell components that induce zzso in the zzso zzso To identify potential cellular zzso of invasion, we employed a zzso zzso system using the zzso zzso invasion protein zzso as the bait zzso This system identified zzso supportive components of the zzso zzso as proteins that may physically interact with zzso zzso studies revealed an zzso of zzso invasion when a dominant negative zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso did not enter zzso cells expressing the dominant negative zzso These results suggest that an interaction between zzso and zzso may occur as part of zzso zzso
