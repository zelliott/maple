Many zzso factors in zzso zzso belong to a class of zzso zzso proteins containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated the existence of zzso zzso factors in zzso In this article, we report on a novel member of this zzso factor family from zzso designated zzso It has one zzso zzso recognition motif and a zzso zzso domain highly enriched in zzso The zzso recognition motif shows significant zzso to all animal zzso proteins identified to date, but the intermediate region does not show any zzso to any other known zzso zzso we characterized two zzso from zzso that are highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their deduced zzso acid sequences indicate that these proteins constitute a new family of zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to restore zzso in zzso zzso human zzso zzso This indicates that zzso is a true plant zzso factor and plays a crucial role in zzso similar to that of other zzso zzso zzso All of the three genes are zzso expressed in a zzso zzso The isolation of this new plant zzso factor family zzso the essential group of zzso domain zzso zzso Furthermore, because no animal equivalent to this protein family has been identified to date, our results suggest that these proteins play key roles in zzso and alternative zzso in zzso
