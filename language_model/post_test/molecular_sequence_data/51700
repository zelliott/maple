The B cell zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso growth of human T cells by binding the T cell zzso zzso In mice, the zzso zzso zzso has also been shown to act as a zzso for T cell zzso In this study, we have evaluated the contributions of B7 and zzso to the zzso activity of zzso cells zzso Mouse B7 provides zzso activity for zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso Human zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso fused to an zzso C gamma fragment, binds to zzso zzso zzso therefore, use human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to analyze the relative contributions of B7 and zzso to the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal that both zzso B7 and zzso are expressed by zzso cells and by zzso zzso B zzso Either zzso alone or zzso alone inhibited zzso T cell proliferation to zzso by zzso zzso while zzso and zzso together were far more efficient in zzso zzso expansion of zzso T zzso These results demonstrate that functionally defined zzso involves at least B7 and zzso and suggest that signals delivered by B7 and zzso zzso in promoting T cell zzso
