The human zzso C gene was cloned using a synthetic zzso predicted from a portion of its zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the restriction zzso zzso with the zzso confirms the existence of one zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of human zzso C and its relationship to zzso However the deduced zzso sequence differs in one position from the sequence of the zzso C zzso deposited as zzso zzso in zzso cerebral zzso with zzso of zzso zzso
