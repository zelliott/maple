zzso gas zzso produced by bacterial zzso of biomass can be a sustainable energy zzso The ability to produce zzso gas during zzso zzso was previously thought to be restricted to a few species within the zzso zzso and zzso This work reports zzso evidence for the presence of novel zzso bacteria zzso in zzso zzso communities that were enriched using molasses zzso The majority of the enriched dominant populations in the zzso zzso system were affiliated with zzso zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso designed to specifically target bacterial zzso yielded 17 unique zzso sequences whose zzso acid sequences differed from those of known zzso The putative zzso bacteria comprised 11 novel zzso closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of the alcohol zzso zzso also pointed to an zzso zzso zzso which is known to have a high conversion rate of zzso to zzso and zzso We also found six novel zzso that were associated with zzso zzso and zzso bacteria in the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the microbial ecology of zzso and zzso zzso zzso involves many other bacteria in addition to zzso and zzso
