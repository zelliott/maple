zzso zzso is a risk factor for zzso It is generally accepted that zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is a key zzso in the regulation of vascular zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso in the presence of zzso in human zzso zzso cells, induced by zzso low density zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso for 4 zzso were examined by oil red O zzso The activity of zzso was detected by real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso The capability of DNA zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso activity, and the zzso promoter zzso level was determined by quantitative zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso increased the activity of zzso and the level of zzso gene DNA zzso resulting in a decrease of zzso zzso zzso and zzso could antagonize the zzso effect on zzso expression through DNA zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggested that zzso decreased the expression of zzso by zzso zzso DNA zzso levels, which can repress the zzso of some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso DNA zzso and could be useful for preventing zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso
