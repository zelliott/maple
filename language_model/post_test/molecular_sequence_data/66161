zzso zzso zzso is present in zzso to zzso of patients with acute zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso fusion protein alone is not sufficient to induce zzso but the nature of the additional genetic zzso is zzso It is unclear whether zzso zzso acquisition of these cooperating zzso We show that zzso zzso genes involved in multiple DNA repair zzso potentially through a mechanism involving direct binding at promoter zzso and increases the zzso frequency in zzso zzso cells display increased DNA damage in zzso and have an activated zzso zzso This results in increased zzso zzso and enhanced sensitivity to DNA damaging zzso zzso zzso data indicate that zzso patient samples exhibit decreased expression of DNA repair genes and increased expression of zzso response genes compared with other acute zzso leukemia zzso patient zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso increases the resistance of zzso cells to DNA zzso We thus speculate that zzso may facilitate zzso of genetic zzso by suppressing zzso DNA zzso It is possible that the superior outcome of zzso patients is partly due to an activated zzso pathway, and that loss of the zzso response zzso is associated with disease zzso
