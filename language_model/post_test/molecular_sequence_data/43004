The early zzso nature of avian zzso virus zzso 7 S DNA zzso zzso indicated by our preceding findings zzso et zzso zzso has been confirmed using various experimental zzso It has been shown by zzso and zzso gel zzso that this DNA represents actually a collection of molecules the size of which is strongly reminiscent of the minute early zzso structures found in DNA of sea zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso With such a characteristic zzso the sequence properties of the individual zzso DNA zzso the majority of which were found to be zzso with zzso motifs and stretches of zzso carrying zzso requirements for zzso In comparative zzso experiments, zzso DNA exhibited the highest zzso with chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso activity of zzso DNA was also found its specific zzso zzso The constancy of the virus content of this DNA and its virus zzso zzso changes taking place inside the virus core structure open the question of possible significance of this special host DNA for the reaction machinery represented by the zzso zzso core zzso
