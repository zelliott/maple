The availability of zzso insect zzso has allowed for discovery and functional characterization of novel genes and zzso We report use of the zzso zzso zzso (red flour zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and characterize a novel zzso we named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a full-length zzso zzso clone zzso revealed sequence zzso to zzso in zzso zzso family 9 zzso and verified presence of a change zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso domain for zzso zzso This zzso zzso clone was predicted to zzso a zzso protein with a calculated zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cell cultures resulted in zzso of a zzso zzso as determined by Western zzso The expressed protein was used to characterize zzso zzso activity against two cellulose zzso to determine its specificity and zzso Our data support that zzso as a novel zzso the first functional characterization of a zzso zzso derived from an insect zzso with potential applications in the zzso industry due to its high relative activity at alkaline zzso
