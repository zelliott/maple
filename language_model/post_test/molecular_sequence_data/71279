Unexpectedly low levels of zzso DNA zzso zzso b sequence divergence are found between species of the zzso coral zzso zzso zzso of zzso positions of the zzso b gene of two out of the three Caribbean zzso species with seven of their Pacific zzso shows only zzso sequence zzso Species in these zzso regions have been evolving independently for at least three million years (since the rise of the zzso of zzso and this geological date is used to estimate zzso divergence zzso The results indicate that the zzso zzso b gene is evolving at least zzso times slower than the zzso zzso zzso clock and is one of the most slowly evolving animal zzso genes described to zzso The possibility is discussed that, unlike higher animals, zzso may have a functional zzso mismatch repair zzso
