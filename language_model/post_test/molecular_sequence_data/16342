zzso as well as internal zzso acid sequence data were obtained from the zzso dependent, zzso growth factor zzso binding zzso zzso zzso from human zzso Based on these sequence data, full-length zzso clones of zzso have been isolated, and the complete deduced sequence of zzso zzso This sequence contains a 27 zzso acid putative signal sequence followed by a mature protein of 264 zzso acids containing 18 zzso zzso clustered near the zzso and zzso The deduced protein sequence of zzso has zzso zzso acid identity including conservation of all 18 zzso zzso with the recently cloned zzso a smaller human zzso protein identified in zzso fluid and also zzso by the cell line zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso zzso in zzso tissue culture cells results in zzso of the protein into the culture zzso This expressed protein is identical to zzso zzso in its zzso high affinity binding of zzso and zzso and mobility on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso
