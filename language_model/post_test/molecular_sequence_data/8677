We have recently described a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso which is zzso into the zzso medium by zzso zzso In this study, the presence of the zzso protein and the zzso gene among clinical zzso of zzso zzso and among other zzso species known to interact with zzso was zzso This task was pursued at the DNA, zzso and protein zzso It was found that the zzso gene was unique to zzso zzso and highly zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso protein was produced by all zzso zzso strains investigated but was not detected in all bovine zzso zzso because of zzso degradation by simultaneously produced zzso zzso It was concluded that the zzso gene was unique to zzso zzso and that it could be used in the identification of zzso zzso
