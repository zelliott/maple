The zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso hormone zzso and their receptors play critical roles in zzso zzso In order to study zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and tested for zzso by zzso from representative fish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine zzso and human zzso The study reveals complex relations between the zzso hormones and their zzso Each zzso activated its own zzso zzso However, zzso was also activated by zzso and zzso was activated by zzso zzso and zzso For zzso the only zzso detected was for zzso which was activated by zzso and zzso These findings are of great interest and zzso in the context of zzso of various zzso by their zzso and by zzso from other zzso Analysis of the three-dimensional models of the structures highlights the importance of zzso outside of the currently established zzso interface zzso In addition, the interface zzso in zzso and the effect of zzso duplication, which causes an insert in the zzso domain, are suggested to affect the interaction and binding of zzso
