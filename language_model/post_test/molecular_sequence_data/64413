Human zzso zzso with low zzso contents in their zzso zzso have been shown recently to exhibit potent zzso cellular zzso zzso in zzso To additionally investigate the efficacy of the human zzso with enhanced zzso we generated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited much higher zzso using human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso as zzso cells compared with the highly zzso but otherwise identical zzso zzso In addition, zzso also exhibited potent zzso in the presence of lower zzso of human zzso than zzso Because zzso is a selective marker of zzso zzso the effectiveness of zzso for zzso zzso was evaluated in several mouse zzso First, to compare the zzso activity of zzso and zzso we constructed a human zzso mouse model to determine zzso efficacy with human zzso zzso In this model, zzso showed significantly higher zzso efficacy than zzso indicating that zzso retains its high potency in zzso Second, zzso suppressed tumor growth in both zzso and zzso mouse models in which human zzso were not zzso Although zzso zzso cells exhibited marginal zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso unexpectedly showed higher efficacy than zzso in a zzso mouse model, suggesting that zzso functions in zzso zzso system in zzso via an unknown mechanism that differs from that in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso with enhanced zzso as well as potent zzso activity in zzso are promising candidates for the novel zzso zzso
