IGF-1 regulates the growth of diverse zzso cell types including several human zzso cell zzso The IGF-1 zzso is a zzso zzso which, upon binding with IGF-1, zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso is a strict requirement for its zzso zzso 

In this study, we have assessed the role of the IGF-1 zzso in the proliferation of zzso zzso cell lines in zzso zzso of zzso and sense zzso to IGF-1 zzso zzso were zzso 

The human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso both grew autonomously in zzso zzso and their growth was further zzso by the addition of zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso corresponding to the IGF-1 zzso zzso markedly inhibited cell proliferation both in zzso medium and in the presence of zzso The zzso of cell growth by the zzso corresponded to a reduction in the amount of zzso zzso IGF-1 zzso 

The findings indicate that IGF-1 and its specific zzso mediate the zzso proliferation of human zzso zzso cell zzso
