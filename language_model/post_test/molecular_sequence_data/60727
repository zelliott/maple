zzso zzso major basic protein zzso is expressed exclusively in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In our previous study, we demonstrated a major positive regulatory role for zzso and a negative regulatory role for zzso in zzso gene zzso Further analysis of the zzso promoter region identified a zzso zzso zzso consensus binding site 6 zzso upstream of the functional zzso site in the zzso zzso In the cell line zzso which is capable of zzso towards both the zzso and zzso lineages in response to zzso acid zzso zzso zzso expression decreased significantly zzso with zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso expression was markedly zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso protein could bind to the potential zzso site zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, we have demonstrated that both zzso and zzso can bind simultaneously to the zzso and zzso sites in the zzso zzso To determine the functionality of both the zzso and zzso sites, we analyzed whether zzso and zzso can stimulate the zzso promoter in the zzso and zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso expression zzso produced a zzso increase compared with zzso with the zzso or zzso expression zzso zzso In addition, zzso pull-down experiments demonstrated a physical interaction between human zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which binds to zzso and acts as a zzso for zzso zzso decreased zzso activity of zzso for the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso Our results provide the first evidence that both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the promoter of an zzso zzso protein gene and that zzso may act as a negative zzso for the zzso zzso unlike its positively regulatory function for the zzso and zzso zzso
