We have developed sets of zzso zzso designed to detect pol gene sequences from any member of the zzso zzso when used as zzso in amplification techniques such as the zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso primer set zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso regions common to zzso zzso Our protocol is based on primary amplification with zzso and zzso followed by secondary amplification with a zzso primer set based on the zzso motif found in all reverse zzso (or zzso in the opposite zzso and zzso a block of zzso zzso zzso just downstream of zzso zzso analysis of DNA from cells infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso resulted in the amplification of appropriately sized zzso zzso analysis of the zzso products, cloned into zzso zzso indicated that at least zzso (most often, zzso zzso contained the predicted zzso pol zzso Greater than zzso of the zzso products contained the expected zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso pol sequences could typically be detected at levels of one copy in 2 zzso zzso cells after secondary zzso No specific zzso zzso products were detected in DNA from zzso human or mouse zzso zzso or bovine zzso zzso rat or human zzso cell lines, chicken zzso zzso zzso lung cells, or cell lines infected with the following zzso which are not zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso leukemia virus or Kirsten zzso virus, mouse zzso tumor virus, human zzso zzso virus I, and zzso leukemia zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
