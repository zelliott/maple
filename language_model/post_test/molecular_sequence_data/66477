zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on a wide range of important crops, can be controlled by plant resistance zzso zzso but these are rapidly overcome by zzso zzso evading zzso It is unknown how this rapid evolution occurs without apparent loss of zzso zzso R proteins recognize zzso zzso molecules from zzso in a zzso manner and trigger defense zzso We identify zzso and zzso of barley powdery zzso zzso zzso zzso f zzso zzso zzso and show that they induce both cell death and zzso when zzso expressed in zzso and zzso barley zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast with other reported zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins that lack zzso signal peptides and enhance infection success on susceptible host plant zzso zzso and zzso belong to a large family with zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso sequences are present in other zzso zzso of the fungus infecting other zzso Our findings imply that the zzso fungus has a repertoire of zzso zzso which may function as zzso and contribute to zzso zzso Multiple copies of related but distinct zzso zzso zzso might enable populations of zzso to rapidly overcome host R genes while maintaining zzso
