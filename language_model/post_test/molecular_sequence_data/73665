The aim was to explore whether zzso zzso cells show zzso zzso receptors and to investigate their role in zzso zzso zzso In both, isolated rat zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line, binding of zzso occurred with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso cells, zzso To characterize the involved second messenger, zzso zzso levels were monitored by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso produced an increase in free zzso zzso levels that declined to baseline values describing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso decreased zzso of the response and increased zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in zzso zzso The zzso zzso originated from zzso sensitive zzso stores and from the zzso zzso The zzso response could partially be blocked by zzso and completely by zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso In the isolated zzso guinea pig liver, a model with high zzso zzso flow, zzso induced a dose dependent decrease of zzso flow by zzso zzso zzso at 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso pressure or zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso leads to zzso This could be because of changes in zzso zzso and/or zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso
