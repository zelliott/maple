A cucumber mosaic virus zzso from zzso is unusual in that it does not support the zzso of some zzso zzso satellite zzso in zzso zzso can support a particular satellite zzso zzso which causes lethal tomato necrosis when zzso with other zzso strains but not when zzso with zzso This difference in ability to support zzso of specific satellite zzso is apparent even when their sequences differ by only 10 zzso zzso of tomato zzso with combinations of zzso or zzso zzso plus the same satellite zzso showed similar differences in zzso indicating a zzso in satellite zzso replication and not movement or zzso zzso virus infections between zzso and zzso indicated that the zzso zzso responsible for this zzso reside on zzso 1 since only combinations with zzso zzso 1 failed to replicate satellite zzso The complete zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and compared with the zzso of other zzso zzso is most similar in zzso and protein sequence to zzso 1 zzso and zzso but slightly less similar than they are to each zzso zzso and all zzso strains zzso thus far share a domain in the 3' untranslated portion of their zzso zzso in which 39 of 40 bases are completely zzso
