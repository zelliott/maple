Avian zzso virus zzso is known to cause several zzso conditions in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and other types of zzso including zzso We describe zzso the identification of unique zzso zzso DNA sequences in an zzso chicken bone affected with zzso The zzso bone was obtained from an affected zzso brown layer during an outbreak of zzso in Costa Rica in zzso Analysis of zzso DNA in the 23-year-old zzso bone revealed unique zzso zzso sequences that were named zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and 3' long terminal repeats zzso in the zzso DNA were identical to each zzso The zzso regions in the zzso were most similar to equivalent sequences in zzso while zzso was identical to known zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso envelope protein was most similar to the envelope of zzso associated virus type 1 zzso although the percentage of zzso acid sequence similarity to zzso was low zzso The variable and zzso regions of zzso displayed several zzso compared to representative strains of zzso The zzso zzso or zzso envelope protein showed three zzso to zzso zzso that may represent important changes in the zzso of this zzso a finding that is currently being zzso Several zzso events may have contributed to the emergence of zzso because each analyzed segment was similar to a different zzso zzso may represent a unique zzso based on distinctive characteristics of its predicted envelope protein in comparison to previously reported zzso
