Human zzso contains candidate regions for several disorders, yet is predicted to be a zzso zzso zzso We have developed a zzso map for the entire zzso band to facilitate the identification of the relatively small number of expected candidate zzso Two approaches were taken to identify zzso zzso a group of 64 unique zzso that were generated during the physical mapping of the region were used in zzso with zzso from human adult and fetal brain and zzso zzso that have been broadly mapped to this region of the zzso were finely mapped using a high-resolution zzso artificial zzso zzso This combined approach identified four distinct regions of zzso activity within the zzso zzso Among them is a region at the zzso boundary that contains candidate regions for several rare zzso disorders zzso zzso zzso zzso syndrome, zzso syndrome, and zzso zzso Two zzso active regions were identified in the center of zzso and include candidate regions for zzso mental zzso syndrome 6, zzso progressive cone dystrophy, zzso zzso zzso 24, and a prostate cancer zzso zzso The fourth region of zzso activity encompasses the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The analysis thus suggests clustered zzso in zzso and provides candidates for several zzso disorders for which the zzso genes have not yet been zzso
