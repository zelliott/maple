zzso bite can cause allergic reactions in zzso There is no information about zzso zzso zzso 

The current work aims to purify and characterize zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso a 1 and zzso a 2 with molecular weight of 26 and 35 zzso respectively, were zzso and characterized from 60,000 pairs of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Their primary sequences were determined by zzso degradation and zzso zzso Their zzso was examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tests, and zzso 

zzso demonstrated zzso binding by 32 and 34 of 37 zzso and zzso subjects' zzso to zzso a 1 and zzso a 2, zzso They were identified as an zzso zzso zzso 5) protein and zzso zzso zzso inhibitions of serum zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso extract zzso using zzso zzso a 1 and zzso a 2 were significant (about zzso In addition, these proteins showed some zzso capacity to zzso of subjects with zzso sting zzso 

We have first identified and characterized two zzso zzso zzso a 1, an zzso zzso protein and zzso a 2, a zzso from the zzso zzso zzso They appear to be of importance for the allergic reactions induced by zzso zzso These zzso are thus not only found in stinging but also found in zzso zzso These results also provided support for the presence of the so-called zzso syndrome zzso
