zzso zzso zzso zzso often use repeat domain proteins as zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso are determined for the zzso zzso repeat and zzso repeat families, but not for the zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso repeat proteins zzso which assemble with zzso B and C and zzso We determined the crystal structures of the zzso complex of zzso zzso as well as the interacting zzso domain of zzso and used structural comparisons to establish a model for the complete zzso zzso zzso The structures reveal a distinct architecture of the zzso complex that positions the zzso domain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso complex and perpendicular to other repeat protein zzso This alternative architecture appears favorable to present the zzso domain zzso site to the zzso while also providing spacing suitable for bulky zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso The presented zzso structure also differs from previous models and deviates from other zzso via a zzso rotation between zzso zzso This work highlights the zzso of repeat domain proteins as scaffolds in zzso recognition and lays the foundation for future zzso studies of this important zzso zzso
