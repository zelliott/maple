An zzso zzso set of proteins consisting of zzso and zzso zzso factors and a zzso domain protein is known to act in concert to control various zzso processes including zzso and root hair zzso Their function is difficult to assess because most of them belong to zzso families and appear to act in a redundant zzso In this study we identified an zzso of the two root hair and zzso patterning zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of try and zzso zzso The zzso gene shows high sequence similarity to the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso results in the suppression of zzso and overproduction of root hairs similarly as observed for TRY and zzso suggesting that zzso has similar zzso zzso The zzso single zzso shows an increase in zzso number on leaves and zzso Double and triple zzso analysis indicates that the zzso gene acts redundant with TRY and zzso in zzso zzso
