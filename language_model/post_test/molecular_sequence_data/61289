Plant species exhibit two primary forms of flowering architecture, zzso indeterminate and zzso zzso is an indeterminate species in which shoots grow indefinitely and only generate flowers from their zzso zzso is a zzso species in which shoot zzso terminate by converting to a zzso We show that tobacco is responsive to the zzso zzso zzso which is required for indeterminate growth of the shoot zzso in zzso zzso plants zzso zzso have an extended zzso phase, delaying the switch to zzso zzso zzso defines a zzso system controlling shoot zzso identity and plant architecture in diverse zzso To understand the underlying basis for differences between zzso and indeterminate zzso we isolated zzso genes from tobacco zzso zzso In zzso the zzso genes most similar to zzso are not expressed in the main shoot zzso their expression is restricted to zzso zzso zzso As zzso zzso develop into flowering zzso zzso genes are zzso as floral zzso identity genes are zzso Our results suggest a general model for zzso zzso and zzso zzso the complementary expression patterns of zzso genes and floral zzso identity genes zzso different plant zzso
