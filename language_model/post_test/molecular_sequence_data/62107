The zzso zzso zzso has over 550 zzso sequences representing all five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso database, zzso which probably reflect a wide variety of as yet unidentified functions performed by plant zzso Recent indications that the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a regulator of light and hormone responsive signal zzso highlight the potential of zzso to participate in many aspects of plant growth and zzso Recent discoveries that zzso are required for zzso distribution, zzso development and disease resistance point to wider roles for four additional zzso families that include some of the most frequently studied zzso poorly zzso plant zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the plant zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, 54 zzso 30 zzso and 59 zzso zzso from zzso are compared with zzso zzso and A1 zzso known from other plant species at the functional, zzso and gene structure zzso Examples of structural conservation between zzso zzso and A1 genes from rice, zzso tomato and soybean and those from zzso are noted, indicating that some common, essential plant zzso roles were established before the divergence of zzso and zzso Numerous examples of tandem zzso of zzso genes and evidence for a variety of restricted expression patterns suggest that a high degree of specialization exists among zzso within each zzso We propose that comprehensive analysis of the functions of these genes in zzso will firmly establish zzso zzso and zzso zzso as regulators and zzso of a wide range of plant zzso
