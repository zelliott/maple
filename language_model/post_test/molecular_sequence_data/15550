zzso zzso at numerous sites distant from the active site of human zzso virus type 1 zzso enable resistance to zzso while retaining zzso zzso As a benchmark for probing the effects of these zzso on the zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso the folding zzso surface of a zzso zzso zzso was determined by a combination of equilibrium and kinetic experiments on the zzso zzso zzso The equilibrium unfolding reaction was well described by a two-state model involving only the native zzso form and the unfolded zzso The global analysis of the kinetic folding mechanism reveals the presence of a fully folded zzso intermediate that associates to form the native zzso zzso Independent analysis of a stable zzso version of the zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso phase in zzso and zzso not included in the global analysis of the zzso zzso reflects the presence of a transient intermediate in the zzso folding zzso The partially folded and fully folded zzso are only marginally stable with respect to the unfolded state, and the zzso reaction provides a modest driving force at zzso zzso of zzso The zzso properties of this system are such that zzso can readily shift the equilibrium from the zzso native state towards zzso folded states that have a lower affinity for zzso but that could be induced to bind to their target zzso zzso Presumably, subsequent secondary zzso increase the stability of the native zzso state in these zzso and, zzso zzso the zzso properties of the resistant human zzso virus type 1 zzso
