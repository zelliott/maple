Most genes in the human zzso zzso portion of the Y zzso can be assigned to one of two groups: zzso genes or zzso gene families with no obvious zzso zzso The zzso genes have been localized to the human Y zzso and we report here that they are derivatives of a conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso located on human zzso 13 and mouse zzso zzso zzso genes retain zzso zzso sequences but lack its zzso In mice, whose evolutionary lineage zzso before the appearance of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso gene produces two zzso one is expressed zzso and the other is expressed in zzso zzso In humans, zzso zzso produces only the ubiquitous zzso the zzso transcript is the province of the zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso genes arose during zzso evolution by zzso of a zzso zzso and amplification of the zzso zzso zzso contributed to the gene content of the human Y zzso together with two other molecular evolutionary zzso persistence of a subset of genes shared with the X zzso and zzso of zzso DNA zzso intact zzso zzso
