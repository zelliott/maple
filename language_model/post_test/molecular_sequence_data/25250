The bag cells of the marine zzso zzso express a gene zzso a zzso zzso hormone zzso precursor that is processed into at least nine zzso zzso Four of the peptides have been identified in bag cell zzso and are known to act as zzso zzso in the abdominal zzso The isolation, primary structure, and proposed biological activity of a fifth zzso product zzso cell zzso zzso from the zzso precursor are zzso zzso was established to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This sequence zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and shares sequence identity with zzso zzso peptides A and zzso zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso of zzso cells in the zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that the zzso regulates the cellular release of zzso fluid by the zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso A and a shorter version of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso belongs to a family of structurally related peptides with similar pharmacological activities that center at a zzso region of sequence corresponding to zzso
