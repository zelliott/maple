The involvement of defined regions of zzso coli zzso zzso in the zzso of decoding has been examined by analyzing the effects of zzso zzso on zzso errors at the zzso A and P zzso zzso in the zzso region, the zzso loop and in the zzso region zzso 34) all caused zzso of stop zzso and zzso during zzso and zzso initiation from zzso zzso at the initiation of protein zzso These results indicate the involvement of all three regions of zzso zzso in decoding functions at both the A and P zzso The functional similarity of all three zzso classes are consistent with close physical proximity of the zzso 1500 region, the zzso loop and zzso 34 and suggest that all three regions of zzso comprise a decoding domain in the zzso
