The effect of binding of an zzso drug zzso zzso to DNA on cutting effectiveness of zzso zzso and zzso restriction zzso was zzso zzso The platinum complex zzso the zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso by zzso zzso From the present results we conclude that the yield of restriction zzso zzso is also lowered if the platinum complex is bound outside the recognition DNA sequence of these zzso We propose that the origin of platinum zzso on DNA outside the recognition sequence can decrease the yield of restriction zzso zzso via inducing a zzso zzso in the recognition DNA sequence of these zzso and also via zzso of the linear diffusion of these zzso on zzso
