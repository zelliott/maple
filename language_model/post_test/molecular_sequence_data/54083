zzso zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso Although it is expressed in zzso zzso of various zzso details of its function remain zzso In the present study, kidney zzso zzso increased the number of zzso cells per area and zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in kidney zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso expression in cultured rat kidney zzso The biological function of zzso in zzso was evaluated in zzso transgenic zzso Renal dysfunction and zzso damage after zzso zzso were ameliorated zzso zzso serum zzso nitrogen concentration after zzso injury, zzso zzso zzso in zzso rats versus zzso zzso zzso in transgenic zzso P zzso zzso in association with improvement of zzso zzso zzso cultured zzso from zzso transgenic rat kidney were resistant to zzso zzso zzso and treatment of immortalized kidney zzso with zzso interfering zzso zzso enhanced cellular zzso stress and subsequently decreased cell viability zzso count ratio after exposure to hydrogen zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells versus zzso zzso in zzso zzso P zzso zzso Further, chemical or zzso disruption of zzso in zzso impaired its zzso properties, which suggests that the zzso of zzso per zzso possesses a radical scavenging zzso These findings show for the first time, to our knowledge, that zzso serves as a defensive mechanism against zzso stress both in zzso and in zzso
