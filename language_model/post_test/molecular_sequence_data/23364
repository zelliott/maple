zzso zzso and intrinsic cues must be integrated within a developing zzso to ensure appropriate growth at the cellular and zzso zzso In zzso the insulin zzso signaling network plays a fundamental role in the control of metabolism and cell zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso two zzso genes identified as growth zzso in an zzso zzso zzso screen, act as negative regulators of zzso The simultaneous loss of both genes generates flies that are more susceptible to reduced oxygen zzso zzso and that show mild overgrowth zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduces zzso Growth zzso is associated with a reduction in zzso but not zzso zzso Together, genetic and zzso analysis places zzso downstream of zzso and upstream of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso and zzso are induced under hypoxic conditions and that zzso is a target of zzso zzso zzso zzso like its zzso counterpart zzso thus establishing a potential zzso between growth and oxygen zzso
