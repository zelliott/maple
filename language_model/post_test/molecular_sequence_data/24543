The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are components of different zzso zzso zzso expressed in the nervous zzso However, they are also present in zzso zzso We have detected zzso and zzso transcripts in mouse zzso muscle zzso Moreover, on differentiation of zzso into zzso the amount of zzso transcripts increased significantly, whereas zzso remained zzso In order to explore how the expression of these zzso genes is regulated in muscle, we have characterized their promoter zzso zzso and zzso analysis with zzso reporter genes showed that zzso activity was controlled by regulatory elements also operative in zzso zzso Thus, the activity of the zzso zzso core promoter decreased to approximately 50% on zzso of one, two, or three of the five zzso binding sites present in this region and was almost abolished when four or five sites were zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso promoter, the upstream zzso factor and the early growth response gene zzso factor were involved in regulating its zzso zzso In addition, the zzso promoter was activated during the differentiation process, in a mechanism partially dependent on the mentioned zzso
