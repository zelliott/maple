zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor specific for the gastric zzso zzso The zzso pattern is competitive with zzso Here we studied the binding sites of this inhibitor on the putative three-dimensional structure of the gastric zzso pump zzso that was constructed by zzso modeling based on the structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso located in the fifth zzso segment of the gastric zzso pump zzso retained the zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso showed zzso lower sensitivity to zzso zzso than the wild type in the zzso transport zzso The zzso activities of these zzso were not completely inhibited by zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso of the side chain at this zzso zzso the side chain of zzso is important for the interaction with this zzso In the three-dimensional structure of the zzso form zzso with high affinity for zzso of the gastric zzso zzso zzso faces a cavity surrounded by the first, fourth, zzso zzso and eighth zzso segments and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can dock in this zzso However, zzso zzso cannot dock in the same location in the zzso form zzso with high affinity for zzso of the gastric zzso pump due to the drastic zzso of the zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso These results support the idea that this cavity is the binding pocket of zzso zzso
