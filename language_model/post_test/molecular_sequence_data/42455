The changes in protein zzso during induction and zzso of zzso proliferation in rat liver by three types of zzso were studied by in zzso zzso zzso Among the variously zzso zzso an increase during induction and a decrease during zzso in zzso of zzso a zzso protein having a molecular weight of 100 zzso was most zzso The time course of enhancement of zzso by the administration of the zzso however, was not parallel with proliferation of zzso but with increase in the liver DNA zzso zzso acid sequencing of the protein indicated the identity of its zzso 17 zzso acid zzso with those of zzso factor 2 zzso zzso in the amount of zzso by zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and this was almost parallel with zzso zzso suggesting that both increase in the amount of zzso and some changes in zzso activities account for a large increase in in zzso zzso of zzso by the administration of zzso zzso
