The zzso zzso protein zzso is a central zzso of small zzso gene regulation in zzso zzso recognizes small regulatory zzso zzso specifically, despite their structural zzso This specificity could not be explained by previously described zzso modes of zzso Here we present a distinct and preferred mode of zzso interaction that involves the direct recognition of a zzso zzso 3' zzso This feature is common in bacterial zzso transcripts as a consequence of zzso zzso termination and hence likely contributes significantly to the general recognition of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso affinity between zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso We determined a crystal structure of the complex that reveals a zzso zzso backbone zzso in the zzso zzso site of zzso allowing for a direct protein contact of the 3' zzso zzso A free 3' zzso group is crucial for the zzso interaction with zzso also in the context of a full-length zzso zzso zzso The capacity of zzso to occupy and zzso the zzso 3' end has important implications for the mechanisms by which zzso is thought to affect zzso stability, zzso and zzso
