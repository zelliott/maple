The zzso light chain zzso zzso zzso a muscle member of the zzso gene zzso yields both smooth muscle and zzso cell zzso Both zzso are known to regulate zzso activity via zzso zzso light chain zzso We previously cloned from a human zzso cell zzso zzso library a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) with an open reading frame that encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso We now describe four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso and 4) that are the alternatively spliced zzso of an zzso precursor that is transcribed from a single human zzso zzso The primary structure of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 2 is identical to the previously published human zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso Garcia et zzso 1997, zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso 16, zzso except for a deletion of zzso zzso zzso The full zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and partial sequence for zzso zzso 4 revealed identity to zzso 1 except for deletions at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso double deletions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletions zzso zzso 4, zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated the extended expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso in both human adult and human fetal zzso zzso using primer pairs that were designed to detect specifically zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, and 4 deletions zzso zzso and zzso confirmed expression in both human adult and human fetal zzso zzso liver, brain, and zzso and in human zzso cells zzso vein and zzso Furthermore, relative quantitative expression studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso 2 is the dominant zzso zzso expressed in human zzso and zzso Further analysis of the human zzso gene revealed that the zzso 2 zzso represents the deletion of an independent zzso flanked by zzso and 3' neighboring zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together these studies demonstrate for the first time that the human zzso gene yields multiple zzso zzso zzso by alternative zzso of its transcribed zzso precursor with differential distribution of these zzso in various human zzso and zzso
