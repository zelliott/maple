The skin zzso of frogs and toads zzso have long been a known source of a vast abundance of zzso zzso In the past decade, zzso data of the zzso zzso of zzso skin has given new impetus to investigations of the putative constituent zzso zzso zzso was recently investigated and novel peptides with zzso activity were isolated and functionally zzso However, genetic data for the zzso ancient lineage to which zzso belongs zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Here we present the first such genetic data for zzso derived via the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso species of midwife zzso zzso zzso First, we present zzso sequences of the entire zzso precursors for four novel zzso peptides zzso The two precursors resemble those from zzso in both their structural architecture and zzso acid zzso Each precursor comprises two zzso as tandem repeats, with a member of the zzso family zzso zzso or zzso zzso followed by its corresponding member from the zzso family zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso replicates of the four zzso possessed minimal zzso zzso zzso ranging from zzso to zzso with the most potent being zzso Second, we also cloned the zzso zzso an zzso zzso with the active zzso exhibiting high sequence identity to zzso peptides from other zzso All putative mature zzso sequences were confirmed to be present in the skin zzso via zzso The close structural resemblance of the zzso genes that we isolated for zzso zzso with those of zzso provide independent molecular evidence for a close evolutionary relationship between these zzso as well as more support for the zzso evolution of the zzso system within zzso In contrast to the more zzso zzso nature of zzso (including zzso which we also zzso the more variable nature of the zzso system together with the sporadic distribution of zzso among zzso zzso fuels in part our hypothesis that the latter system was zzso zzso to zzso a function in the innate immune system, having originally evolved for zzso against potential zzso
