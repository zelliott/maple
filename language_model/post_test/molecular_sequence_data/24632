Human zzso cancer cells and zzso were examined for the presence or absence of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and for a possible functional role of this zzso zzso This specific sequence exists in zzso I, the zzso of the zzso Loss of this zzso sequence was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso in an assessment of 121 zzso cancer specimens zzso In cells in tissue culture, the absence of the zzso segment was associated with a twofold increased ability to drive zzso in a zzso reporter zzso zzso can be demonstrated in zzso cancer cells based on zzso zzso Computer analysis shows that this zzso sequence contains several binding sites, including a zzso domain for protein zzso zzso zzso These preliminary results lay the groundwork in determination of potential roles for a negative regulatory element in zzso repair zzso
