Lung zzso cells have an integral role in the maintenance of lung zzso however, the regulatory mechanism zzso has not been fully zzso Recently, zzso growth factor zzso was reported to be involved in organ development and zzso through its zzso zzso We investigated the biological role of zzso in lung zzso zzso was more highly expressed in the lungs of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, chiefly in the zzso cells, than in control zzso zzso We also confirmed the expression of zzso protein and zzso in the lungs of zzso mice, mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso cells, by zzso analysis and in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso promoted DNA synthesis in rat zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso by gene transfer was zzso into the nucleus and promoted the proliferation of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso cells without causing marked zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be involved in lung zzso after injury by promoting the proliferation of lung zzso cells, probably in an zzso zzso
