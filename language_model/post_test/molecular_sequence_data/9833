zzso binding proteins zzso are highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso however, no zzso channel function has been demonstrated for these zzso To investigate possible reasons for the apparent lack of zzso channel function we transplanted the zzso channel zzso of five zzso into zzso receptors zzso 6 and zzso In each case we obtained functional zzso receptors in which zzso zzso were able to open the zzso zzso channel with zzso values identical to those of the zzso contributing the zzso binding zzso zzso current zzso were significantly smaller than those of the parent zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso channels are highly permeable for calcium and have certain pharmacological properties that are distinct from all other zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, all five known zzso in addition to their well characterized functional zzso binding sites, have functional zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the lack of zzso channel function in zzso zzso results from a failure to translate zzso binding into channel zzso We interpret our findings to indicate the requirement for a zzso protein or an additional zzso serving to alter the structure of the zzso zzso complex such that signal zzso is enabled from the zzso binding site to the zzso functional zzso zzso
