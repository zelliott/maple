Human zzso zzso carries a cluster of imprinted genes including zzso expressed genes zzso such as zzso and zzso and zzso expressed genes zzso such as zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso region zzso and the zzso zzso with this, paternal and maternal zzso zzso for zzso 14 zzso and zzso cause distinct zzso We studied eight individuals zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and three individuals zzso zzso with a zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and identified various deletions and zzso affecting the imprinted zzso The results, together with recent mouse data, imply that the zzso has an important zzso regulatory function on the zzso inherited zzso and that excessive zzso expression and decreased zzso and zzso expression are relevant to zzso and zzso zzso zzso
