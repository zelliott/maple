zzso zzso cells and chicken eggs are usually used for isolation of human influenza zzso zzso isolated by these procedures often differ from those present in the clinical zzso since zzso changes occur during virus transmission from the human host to cells of zzso zzso 

To minimize these zzso changes, zzso cells derived from human zzso zzso were used to isolate virus from influenza zzso 

zzso A viruses of zzso zzso were primarily isolated in zzso and then zzso in parallel in zzso and zzso zzso zzso properties of zzso virus zzso were compared and analyzed for evolutionary zzso 

zzso viruses were isolated in zzso with higher efficiency than in zzso and chicken zzso The following observations were made: zzso recent zzso showed an about zzso increase in the number of zzso sites of zzso and zzso when compared to zzso from 1968 to zzso zzso during passages of clinical strains in zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso variations zzso that functioning of the zzso complex varied from strain to strain in one influenza zzso zzso there were no zzso acid exchanges in the zzso zzso binding site although the viruses acquired the ability to zzso avian zzso after passage in zzso cells, suggesting that virus zzso is regulated by several zzso zzso zzso characterized by deletion of 66 zzso zzso zzso zzso in the stalk region of the zzso gene was dominant in zzso washes of all patients whereas during zzso in zzso cells this deleted zzso in zzso from different patients was either zzso retained as prevalent zzso or rapidly replaced for that one containing full length zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein of clinical viruses was sensitive to zzso zzso the zzso segment of human zzso unlike the most of avian ones, contained an additional zzso open reading frame zzso a hypothetical zzso zzso zzso strand zzso zzso 

The data suggest that zzso clinical influenza viruses can be isolated from respiratory tract of humans more effectively in human than in canine zzso zzso zzso virus population zzso during one influenza zzso zzso increasing numbers of zzso sites on zzso and zzso and stalk zzso of zzso take place during virus evolution in zzso
