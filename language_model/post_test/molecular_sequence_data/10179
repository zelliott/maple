A solid phase zzso method is described based on the zzso of proteins to zzso hydroxide zzso followed by zzso of the zzso carrier proteins with zzso acid zzso or other zzso zzso zzso peptides were coupled to the zzso zzso zzso particles through their zzso zzso No dialysis is required since the reaction product is isolated at each step of the procedure by a simple zzso and can easily be extensively washed between individual zzso The method generates zzso particles with zzso defined presentation of the peptides at the surface of the zzso When used for zzso of mice and rabbits the zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso which reacted well with the parent protein in zzso The strongest reactions were with the zzso form of the parent zzso On zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso of zzso recognized the same M, 52,000 zzso
