zzso growth factor I zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso function, which is essential for normal reproduction in animals, especially in sexual zzso and zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso tiger zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from liver total zzso using zzso The zzso zzso of zzso tiger zzso was highly zzso to that of other animals, zzso to zzso zzso to human and zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso and many zzso acid zzso of putative mature zzso are highly zzso in zzso species, confirming the high sequence zzso observed in other zzso DNA zzso the mature zzso zzso was zzso with zzso expression zzso and highly expressed in zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso The zzso proteins expressed existed mostly in the soluble protein zzso and were zzso with metal affinity zzso Western zzso confirmed that the zzso proteins reacted with zzso against zzso The results obtained here should be useful for large-scale production of biological active zzso zzso as well as for further research on growth, development, and reproduction in the zzso zzso zzso specific expression of zzso zzso in the zzso tiger was examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The major zzso zzso expression tissue was the liver, while medium signals were found in the zzso zzso and zzso and minor signals were detected in various zzso including the heart, zzso zzso and zzso The results indicate that zzso might play an important role in the zzso system and in zzso development in the zzso zzso
