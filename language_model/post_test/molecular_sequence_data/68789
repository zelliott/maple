Type IV zzso are zzso expressed by a number of diverse zzso zzso These zzso are related through similarities in the primary zzso acid sequences of the structural zzso a zzso assembly machinery, and a similar mechanism of zzso zzso Type IV zzso assembly is preceded by zzso processing and zzso of the zzso zzso This process is carried out by a novel zzso zzso zzso first identified in zzso zzso Moreover, proteins zzso with type IV zzso have been shown to function in zzso protein zzso in zzso bacteria and in transformation competence in zzso zzso Like zzso these proteins are also processed and zzso by zzso zzso of the genes for type IV zzso is carried out by an zzso zzso with a minor zzso factor, zzso In zzso zzso two other regulatory elements zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and zzso is required for expression of a diverse set of bacterial zzso zzso regulation of synthesis and zzso modification and assembly of type IV zzso serves as a useful model for a number of diverse biological processes in the bacterial zzso
