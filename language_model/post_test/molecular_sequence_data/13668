Although the specific functions of zzso I zzso are not known, their zzso to membrane structures suggests a function in membrane zzso Different zzso I zzso in the same cell or in different cells can possess different zzso To determine if the zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso I, chicken zzso zzso brush border zzso I, was dependent on zzso of the membrane or zzso zzso specific to zzso cells, we zzso the zzso for the heavy chain of this zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the chicken brush border zzso heavy chain resulted in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso brush border zzso I localized to zzso of the plasma zzso particularly at spreading edges, and also to unknown zzso zzso Some cells expressing particularly high levels of brush border zzso I possessed a highly irregular zzso zzso brush border zzso I zzso from zzso cells bound to zzso filaments in an zzso manner and decorated zzso filaments to form a characteristic zzso The zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso activity similar to that of the native zzso Thus, any cellular factor required for the general membrane zzso or zzso activity of brush border zzso I is present in zzso cells as well as zzso zzso
