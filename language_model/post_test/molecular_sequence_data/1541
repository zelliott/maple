zzso twist, a basic zzso zzso zzso factor, is expressed in the zzso during zzso We previously established a line of zzso transgenic zzso whose zzso expression is regulated by the twist zzso therefore, we could observe the behavior of zzso cells in zzso In the transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso cells migrated zzso around the zzso and the neural tube, where at a later stage the zzso column would be zzso This finding strongly suggests that zzso zzso cells participate in zzso column formation in zzso To clarify the function of twist gene in the zzso we performed zzso analysis of twist by using two kinds of zzso zzso zzso targeted against twist zzso and zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso exhibited absence of neural zzso which are zzso zzso zzso oriented bones on the zzso aspect of the zzso In addition, zzso which blocks translation of only zzso twist zzso in the zzso transgenic zzso did not affect the migration pattern of zzso cells, revealing that the migration of zzso cells were normal in the absence of twist gene zzso These results demonstrate that zzso twist functions in zzso column formation by regulating the zzso cell zzso
