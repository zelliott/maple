zzso coli zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso protein synthesis in zzso It is a zzso containing unknown modifications at the N and C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Agents zzso 27, zzso The chemical structure of zzso has been characterized by use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso as well as mass zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso The zzso zzso is zzso at the N zzso by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of the zzso of zzso acid and zzso zzso which is linked via the zzso atom to an zzso group, thus forming a zzso The main chain zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso is connected via this zzso bond to the modified zzso zzso zzso and the zzso unit inhibit protein translation in zzso while a synthetic analog of the zzso zzso is not zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso has an effect on the growth of zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that the zzso is responsible for zzso zzso activity while the zzso zzso is needed for zzso zzso zzso of the structure determined in this work for zzso synthesis and mode of action are zzso
