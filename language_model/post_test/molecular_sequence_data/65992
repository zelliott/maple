zzso zzso is an infectious disease caused by either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The latter is also classified under three different zzso groups, referred to as subspecies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to validate and zzso a zzso zzso to discriminate the organisms at the subspecies zzso First, the reference sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso including the internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso of the most common species and subspecies of the zzso zzso were retrieved from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso primer were designed from the alignment of the zzso The zzso zzso were evaluated in three different combinations of primer pairs in order to assure complete specificity for each zzso The results of the tests had demonstrated effectiveness of the novel primer pairs zzso zzso and zzso for the amplification of the zzso target fragments of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 546 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso The original zzso amplification zzso with novel zzso reported in this paper were confirmed to be a reliable tool for the specific discrimination among zzso zzso subspecies by zzso zzso zzso
