zzso modifications zzso of proteins add to the complexity of zzso thereby complicating the task of zzso zzso An efficient strategy to identify this zzso zzso is important for determination of protein function, as well as for mass zzso protein zzso Furthermore, studies of zzso variation or single zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level, as well as zzso editing, are increasingly relevant, but validation and determination of false positive rates are zzso Here we describe an effective zzso for large scale zzso and zzso acid substitution identification based on high resolution and high mass accuracy zzso data zzso A systematic validation strategy of zzso using zzso retention time shifts was zzso and a decision tree for validation is zzso This zzso was applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso million zzso zzso were processed resulting in zzso sequence assignments, with zzso from modified sequences and matching to zzso zzso this high assignment rate is in part due to the high quality spectral zzso A zzso modified zzso library for zzso is available online at zzso We discuss confidence in zzso and zzso assignment based on the acquired data set, as well as implications for quantitative analysis of zzso induced and zzso zzso
