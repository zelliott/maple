The zzso sequence zzso of the DNA zzso containing the zzso gene cloned from zzso zzso zzso not producing zzso antibiotics was zzso The zzso gene was shown to zzso zzso zzso differing by the zzso specificity from the zzso zzso by the zzso genes from the organisms producing zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso VIII gene and its product with the zzso genes and their products from the zzso zzso and clinical microbial strains permitted to consider it as a representative of the third group genes which are likely widely distributed in soil zzso not producing zzso zzso The gene length was 777 zzso pairs at the average zzso content of 67 per zzso zzso of the zzso and protein sequences of the zzso gene with those of the genes cloned from the zzso organisms zzso and zzso zzso revealed high zzso in the zzso region of the zzso However, the zzso percentage by DNA for the zzso gene was lower than that for the genes from the other organisms on their comparison with each other: zzso and zzso per cent zzso zzso of the profiles of the protein zzso properties revealed differences in the region of the first 110 zzso acids of the gene under the zzso The zzso acid sequence contained all the highly conservative regions characteristics of zzso zzso but had several zzso acid zzso detected for the first time including those in the region responsible for the zzso zzso
