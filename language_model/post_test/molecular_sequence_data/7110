zzso of zzso A results in an increased zzso of zzso zzso under red and zzso zzso We used this approach to zzso for the function of zzso zzso of rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tobacco zzso that express the zzso rice zzso A zzso a rice zzso A lacking the first 80 zzso acids zzso or a rice zzso A with a conversion of the first 10 zzso into zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under different zzso rates showed that RW and, even more zzso zzso increased the response under both red and zzso light, whereas zzso decreased the response under zzso light but hardly altered the response under red zzso These results indicate that zzso not only lacks zzso essential for an increased response under red light but also zzso the zzso response under zzso zzso zzso rice zzso A and, even more so, zzso mediate an enhanced zzso A as well as zzso B function, whereas zzso interferes with the function of zzso tobacco zzso A as well as that of rice zzso A when zzso in a single zzso zzso with zzso of different ages and various times of zzso under zzso light demonstrated that the effect of zzso is dependent on the stage of zzso Our results suggest that the lack of the first 80 zzso acids still allows a rice zzso A to interact with the zzso zzso pathway, albeit zzso in tobacco zzso
