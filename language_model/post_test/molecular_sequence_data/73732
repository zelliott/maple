The high level of zzso found in zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso protein zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso was cloned and shown to be adjacent to and zzso transcribed relative to the putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso (in strain zzso was previously shown to result in heightened resistance to several antibiotics known to interact with zzso suggesting that the regulation of zzso is affected by zzso In this report, this hypothesis was confirmed by use of a Northern zzso zzso analysis which revealed increased zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso compared to that in the zzso strain, zzso By using zzso zzso liquid zzso to examine the structure of the zzso it was demonstrated that the increased expression of zzso resulted in an increased level of zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso fusion studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso caused approximately zzso and zzso increases in zzso and zzso promoter activities, zzso zzso extension experiments revealed that these genes have long, untranslated leader sequences that result in a zzso overlap of 80 zzso Interestingly, deletion of a zzso region containing an zzso repeat sequence resulted in the loss of expression from both the zzso and the zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso and zzso are under the control of a common regulatory mechanism that may involve the transport function of the zzso gene zzso
