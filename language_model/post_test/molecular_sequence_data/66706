zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves accumulate a zzso zzso called zzso in response to zzso zzso To check whether, and if so to what extent, the specific induction of this zzso applies to related species, a collection of 19 zzso zzso 12 zzso sections and eight zzso zzso zzso screened for their capability to zzso the zzso zzso zzso analyses by zzso zzso and western zzso confirmed that only nine out of the 19 species examined zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso species tested express the zzso after zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that all responsive species possess one or more zzso zzso whereas no zzso zzso could be traced in the zzso zzso The number of zzso present in the zzso genes varies between zero and zzso Four tobacco zzso contain both zzso zzso genes as well as zzso genes with zzso These findings provide the first firm evidence for a striking zzso difference with respect to the zzso of a zzso zzso gene that can be correlated with the zzso of zzso genes in the zzso of closely related species from a single plant zzso In addition, the differential response of closely related tobacco species illustrates that in the field of plant hormone research, care must be taken when zzso results obtained with a particular model system to zzso zzso closely zzso
