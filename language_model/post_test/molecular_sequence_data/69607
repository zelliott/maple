The major zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso is zzso a protein found exclusively at the surface of the zzso storage zzso Using zzso serum, we have isolated two related classes of full-length coding zzso designated zzso A and B, from a rat zzso zzso expression zzso The two zzso derive from two zzso species that arise by differential zzso The zzso are predicted to zzso zzso A and B, proteins of 517 zzso zzso zzso and 422 zzso zzso zzso respectively, which share a common zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso A contains peptides present in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso form of zzso from rat zzso as well as the requisite consensus zzso zzso zzso Like zzso A, the B form is expressed in zzso and is associated with zzso storage zzso Modeling of predicted secondary structures fails to reveal an underlying basis for the tenacious association of zzso with zzso zzso These proteins exhibit a significant sequence relationship zzso zzso similarity through 105 zzso with only one other known zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso Like the zzso zzso appears to be zzso which suggests that they interact in a related zzso zzso The molecular zzso for zzso A and B described here will permit detailed analyses of their functional zzso in zzso zzso
