Two fluorinated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have been shown to serve as zzso surrogates in protein synthesis in zzso coli, have been incorporated in zzso into basic zzso zzso zzso peptides derived from zzso The zzso of zzso incorporation of zzso and zzso were 90 and 88 zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso mass zzso and zzso acid zzso Both circular zzso and equilibrium zzso studies of the fluorinated zzso peptides indicated preservation of secondary and zzso protein zzso zzso experiments showed an increase of 27 degrees C in melting temperature when zzso was replaced by zzso However, the zzso of the zzso containing zzso was increased by only 4 degrees C over that of the zzso containing zzso Similar trends were observed in chemical zzso studies in which zzso in water was determined to be zzso or zzso zzso zzso upon incorporation of zzso or zzso zzso When the fluorinated peptides were tested for DNA zzso both their affinity and specificity were similar to those of the respective zzso zzso These results suggest that fluorinated zzso zzso even when introduced into the same positions, can have markedly different effects on the physical properties of zzso while having little impact on secondary and zzso zzso
