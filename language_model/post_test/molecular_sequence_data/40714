zzso zzso is a zzso zzso agent of a wide range of insects including cane zzso In this study, a two-dimensional zzso zzso was used to display zzso proteins of zzso zzso strain zzso growing on the whole zzso cane zzso and their isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso play a key role in insect zzso and initiation of the infection zzso We have identified all the 101 protein spots displayed by zzso identification zzso from the zzso zzso Among the identified proteins were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso in response to exposure to the zzso cane zzso and their isolated zzso These proteins have not been previously identified from the culture zzso of zzso zzso during zzso To our knowledge, this the first zzso map established to study the zzso proteins zzso by zzso zzso during infection of zzso cane zzso and its zzso
