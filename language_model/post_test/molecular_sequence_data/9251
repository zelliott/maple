zzso previous infecting dengue virus zzso zzso has been difficult due to highly zzso immune responses from previous zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso immune responses would be crucial in understanding dengue transmission in the community and would also help to determine the zzso of protective immune zzso zzso we set out to define highly zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso and highly zzso regions of the four zzso zzso were identified using Basic Local zzso Search zzso zzso searches and custom zzso zzso Using zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso T cell zzso within the four zzso zzso in healthy adult donors from Sri zzso We identified T cell responses to 19 regions of the four zzso zzso Six peptides were from the zzso region and four peptides were from the zzso zzso All immune donors responded to peptides of at least two zzso zzso suggesting that zzso infection is common in Sri zzso Eight of 20 individuals responded to at least two peptides of zzso despite this zzso not being implicated previously in any of the zzso in Sri zzso The use of these regions to determine past and current infecting zzso zzso will be of value to characterize further the dynamics of silent dengue transmission in the zzso In addition, these T cell responses to these regions could be used to characterize zzso zzso immune responses and thus possibly help us to understand the immune zzso of a protective immune zzso
