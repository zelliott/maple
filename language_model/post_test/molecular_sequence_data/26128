The zzso zzso carried on zzso zzso which is an analogue of the zzso zzso of zzso coli, is involved in zzso zzso and zzso induced by many zzso zzso dependent on either the zzso or zzso zzso requires the function of the zzso gene and is called zzso zzso By treating the cell with agents that damage DNA, zzso protein is activated by conversion into a form zzso that mediates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso genes including zzso Since zzso protein is zzso processed to an active form zzso in a zzso fashion, and zzso shares extensive zzso acid zzso with zzso we examined whether zzso is similarly processed in the cell, using zzso against a zzso fusion zzso Like zzso zzso protein is indeed zzso processed in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso but not zzso can mediate zzso zzso However, zzso was not processed in the zzso cells treated with zzso zzso We constructed, by zzso zzso several zzso zzso genes that zzso zzso proteins with zzso in the zzso acids zzso the putative zzso site zzso zzso was processed and was as zzso active as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso and were zzso zzso zzso was not zzso but was zzso as active as zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene that zzso the putative zzso product of zzso was as active as zzso in zzso zzso These results raise the possibility that both the nascent zzso and the processed product are active in zzso
