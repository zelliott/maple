During zzso zzso by zzso zzso the reduction of zzso results in the formation of zzso zzso zzso deposits that are ultimately zzso as zzso zzso of approximately 150 zzso in zzso We report that the zzso zzso are associated with a protein of approximately 95 zzso zzso experiments to investigate the expression and zzso profile of this protein have demonstrated that it is zzso and zzso in response to increasing zzso zzso The protein was zzso from zzso zzso and zzso fragments from a zzso digest were used to identify the gene in the draft zzso zzso zzso A matched open reading frame was located, zzso a protein with a calculated mass of zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the mature protein revealed no zzso signal zzso suggesting that the protein is exported directly from the zzso The protein has been called zzso factor A zzso and zzso of known function have not been reported zzso The zzso gene was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso forms larger zzso 300 zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli when treated with zzso and these are retained within the zzso In zzso zzso demonstrate that the formation of zzso zzso upon the reduction of zzso by zzso are stabilized by the presence of zzso The role of zzso in zzso zzso assembly has potential for exploitation in zzso zzso
