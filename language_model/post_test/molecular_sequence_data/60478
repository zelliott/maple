zzso zzso extension in the coding sequence of zzso zzso causes zzso zzso associated with the formation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We constructed an array of zzso zzso repeats, coding for a range of zzso zzso zzso which was used to generate expression zzso with minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso when zzso zzso zzso when zzso with extended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were trapped in zzso zzso zzso zzso formed in the zzso but were visible in the nucleus only when a strong nuclear zzso signal was zzso zzso interactions between zzso tracts zzso the zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso by zzso zzso Our results suggest that extended zzso can interact with cellular zzso zzso transport them to zzso cellular locations, and form zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence for a recruitment mechanism for zzso in the zzso neurodegenerative zzso In susceptible cells, extended zzso tracts in zzso might interact with and zzso or zzso certain zzso zzso cellular zzso
