Mice zzso for the retinal zzso slow zzso zzso completely lack zzso outer zzso The zzso gene encodes zzso zzso a membrane zzso in the rims of rod and cone outer segment zzso zzso is present as a complex with the related zzso zzso Here, we generated transgenic mice that express a zzso protein zzso containing the zzso zzso loop of zzso in the context of zzso zzso was zzso formed zzso zzso and zzso zzso with itself, zzso and zzso The zzso interaction was significantly more stable than the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of mice expressing zzso revealed that zzso is zzso more abundant than zzso interacts zzso with itself and zzso via the zzso loop, and forms a high order complex that may extend the entire circumference of the zzso zzso of zzso fully rescued the zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice, but it had no effect on the zzso in zzso zzso Together, these observations explain the striking differences in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
