In Parkinson disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disorder in humans, increased zzso zzso levels are zzso as evidenced by gene copy number zzso and increased zzso levels detected in some familial and sporadic zzso cases, zzso Gene expression can be regulated at the zzso level by elements in the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether the zzso of human zzso can affect gene zzso Comparative sequence analysis revealed very high conservation across the entire zzso of human zzso over millions of years, suggesting the presence of multiple functionally important zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that four different zzso events occur in the zzso of human zzso Finally, using zzso zzso we examined the effect of the minor zzso of five naturally occurring single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso on gene zzso The minor zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso expression by zzso in a transient zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the role of the zzso of human zzso and identifying functionally important naturally occurring zzso using reporter zzso can complement disease association studies in humans, uncovering potential zzso or protective zzso in Parkinson zzso Our findings demonstrate that the zzso of human zzso as a whole, and zzso in particular, are zzso of potential clinical importance for Parkinson zzso
