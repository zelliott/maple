The sex determination process is under the control of several genes of which two zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors, play a crucial zzso It is well-known that zzso at these genes may cause the development of an zzso zzso The aim of this study was to conduct a comparative analysis of the coding sequence and zzso regions of both genes in four species of the family zzso (the dog, red zzso arctic fox and Chinese raccoon zzso zzso of the coding sequence of the zzso gene among the studied species was higher zzso than in the case of the zzso gene zzso Only single zzso changes were found in the compared coding zzso whereas in the zzso region of both genes zzso zzso as well as insertions and deletions were zzso None of the changes detected in the zzso region occurred within the potential consensus sequences for zzso zzso No zzso was found for either of these genes in any of the analyzed zzso
