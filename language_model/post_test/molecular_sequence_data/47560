In the absence of food, the zzso zzso zzso like many zzso enters into dormancy and zzso into a round and walled zzso zzso When transferred back into a feeding zzso the zzso zzso into a zzso cell in a few zzso This zzso pathway, which is common to many zzso and zzso zzso is still poorly understood at the molecular zzso In order to identify potential dormant transcripts in the zzso of zzso we have constructed zzso libraries from mature zzso zzso have been isolated confirming the presence of a zzso pool in the dormant zzso The sequence analysis of two zzso indicates open reading frames which show significant similarities to known proteins involved in mechanisms of zzso 1) zzso an element of the nitrogen regulatory system in bacteria and 2) zzso a newly identified human zzso zzso The two corresponding zzso genes represent the first putative regulatory genes isolated in zzso From a differential screening of the zzso library against zzso zzso one zzso (and very zzso transcript has been isolated but the product has not yet been zzso The possible zzso of these new zzso genes in the zzso process is zzso
