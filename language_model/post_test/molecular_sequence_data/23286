Specialized zzso zzso zzso is associated with virtually every zzso system zzso zzso zzso touch zzso zzso have specialized zzso and attach to the surrounding zzso The zzso gene encodes an zzso protein with multiple zzso and zzso zzso zzso is needed for the zzso of the collagen zzso and other zzso zzso attachment, and, zzso for touch zzso zzso and zzso bind to touch processes zzso and in zzso These zzso zzso with and zzso the zzso channel complex in the touch zzso In turn, the production of the zzso and zzso zzso appears to rely on interactions with the neighboring zzso zzso These and other observations lead us to propose that zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso channel is needed for zzso zzso Additionally, our experiments demonstrate an important role of the zzso in organizing the placement of the channel zzso
