zzso zzso converts zzso to zzso the first zzso intermediate en route to zzso in plants and many zzso Presented here is the first zzso zzso gene identified from a zzso the cellular slime mold zzso zzso The zzso encodes an zzso predicted protein zzso identical to known higher plant zzso zzso and zzso identical to known zzso zzso from zzso and zzso The zzso protein expressed in transgenic zzso zzso converted synthetic zzso to zzso in zzso This product was characterized by zzso and zzso nuclear magnetic resonance and gas zzso zzso The predicted protein sequence zzso sufficiently from the known zzso zzso sequences to dramatically reduce the number of zzso that are candidates for the zzso difference between zzso and zzso zzso
