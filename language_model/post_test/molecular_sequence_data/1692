Alternative zzso is in important mechanism of modulating gene function and expression which greatly expands zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso utility that finds gene models including alternative zzso events from zzso alignment of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso sequences are aligned against the zzso map using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso connectivity is analyzed by applying zzso methods to build all possible gene models including zzso zzso The zzso essentially combines the zzso sequence zzso and transcript assembly procedures in a coherent zzso In addition to the zzso zzso zzso clusters and many well-known gene predictions such as zzso zzso and zzso may be included in gene zzso The current zzso supports human, mouse and rat zzso zzso is available at zzso
