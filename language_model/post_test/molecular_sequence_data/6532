In this report we structurally and functionally define a binding domain that is involved in protein association and that we have designated zzso (for zzso zzso zzso This domain was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the basis of regional conservation with several zzso proteins of zzso and zzso The zzso domain spans about 70 zzso acids and shows approximately zzso overall zzso acid zzso We demonstrated the ability of the zzso domain to specifically bind zzso proteins in normal and zzso cells of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These observations prompted our search for additional zzso proteins in zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso probe derived from the zzso zzso we cloned and characterized a zzso zzso an zzso protein with overall similarity to zzso we designated this protein zzso (for zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso defines a family of signal zzso possessing extensive networking abilities including zzso binding and association with zzso zzso zzso zzso
