To characterize zzso zzso in candidate populations for a zzso phase III vaccine trial in zzso specimens from prevalent and incident zzso infections from a family planning clinic population in zzso Province and a community cohort in zzso zzso Province, collected from 1998 to 2001, were zzso A new zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of distinguishing zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso C and their zzso was developed and applied to prevalent zzso Most incident and selected prevalent infections were studied by complete zzso zzso By zzso zzso of zzso prevalent infections were zzso Of these, zzso were zzso zzso were zzso B, and zzso showed zzso or dual probe zzso indicative of zzso or dual infection, zzso Among 23 incident infections, 20 were zzso zzso zzso one zzso B, and one zzso zzso strains were zzso Two zzso and one zzso zzso were identified among selected prevalent zzso These results indicate that incident and prevalent zzso infections in zzso and zzso zzso during zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso either zzso or zzso This study frames the genetic diversity of zzso in these zzso in their zzso phase for the ongoing zzso zzso prime, zzso zzso boost, phase III vaccine trial and will provide a benchmark for interpretation and zzso
