zzso zzso is an zzso that produces no functional zzso In zzso analysis, zzso zzso means that one probe can zzso to plant DNA from one variety zzso but very faintly to DNA from another variety or even has no zzso signal under experimental stringency and this may be an indication of zzso zzso or major sequence zzso in the corresponding zzso We report here about zzso zzso of zzso among 52 rice varieties uncovered with rice random zzso probe zzso The results show that this kind of zzso zzso is most likely to occur in typical zzso varieties distributed geographically in Northeast China and Japan, and this tendency is consistent with the hypothesis that rice evolved with a trend of from wild zzso zzso analysis indicates that the sequence of zzso has no zzso zzso zzso changes in this region may not influence the survival of the zzso zzso of the sequence of zzso and gypsy zzso zzso long terminal repeats zzso of zzso zzso shows zzso of zzso of 37 base pair and this leads to the consideration that the occurrence of zzso zzso in rice is related to zzso or zzso zzso
