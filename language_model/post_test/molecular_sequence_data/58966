zzso and tight junctions are thought to seal neighboring cells together and to function as barriers between zzso zzso We have characterized a novel member of the zzso family, zzso IV zzso which is localized to zzso junctions zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein with a zzso domain zzso to zzso C, a protein required for zzso protein zzso in the red blood zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso at zzso and causes zzso closure defects similar to those observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are paralyzed, and zzso studies indicate that the lack of zzso in zzso zzso causes a breakdown of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso lack the zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso These studies identify zzso as the first zzso protein of zzso and demonstrate a requirement for zzso in the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
