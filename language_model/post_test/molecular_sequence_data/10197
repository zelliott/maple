zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso mechanisms by which zzso interacts with zzso and zzso cell zzso to zzso are zzso In the present study, we showed that skin zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso identical with respect to their ability to interact with zzso Using a series of fusion proteins corresponding to the different structural zzso of zzso binding of zzso to zzso was found to be dependent of the zzso domain and, to a lesser extent, of the type 1 repeats and the zzso domain of zzso In addition, zzso zzso drastically inhibited zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso could bind to the zzso domain of zzso through interaction with zzso zzso To address this question, a series of synthetic zzso overlapping zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and tested for their ability to interact with zzso zzso zzso only with peptides zzso and zzso containing the zzso consensus sequence zzso These peptides contained zzso and zzso binding sites because zzso binding to zzso and zzso was partially reduced upon removal of the zzso chain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso poorly bound to zzso zzso and did not bind at all to zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso sequence zzso constituted a zzso binding site when flanked with peptides zzso and zzso The sequence zzso constitutes a cell adhesive active site in the zzso domain of zzso zzso et zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the attachment of zzso and zzso cells to peptides zzso and zzso by about 50 and zzso zzso Although zzso cells also attached to type 3 repeats and the zzso domain of zzso zzso only inhibited cell attachment to the zzso zzso Overall, these data indicate that zzso by zzso exclusion of cell zzso to a zzso cell adhesive site present within the zzso domain of zzso could explain the zzso properties of zzso
