In a gene chip analysis of common zzso tumor types, one of the genes with the most impressive zzso expression regulation was zzso 1 zzso which was strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso various zzso tumors were subjected to zzso zzso revealing high expression of zzso in normal zzso zzso in zzso in one zzso zzso zzso and in zzso Additionally, three zzso zzso zzso were zzso The first, lacking 204 zzso for zzso growth zzso domain 6 and parts of the zzso zzso named zzso In the other two zzso zzso (named zzso and zzso a stop zzso is introduced due to a zzso leading to truncated proteins of 204 and zzso zzso zzso
