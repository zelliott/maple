A prediction scheme has been developed for the zzso PC and zzso containing computer programs which make use of the protein secondary structure prediction zzso of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1974), zzso and zzso zzso Lim (1974) and zzso and zzso zzso The results of the individual prediction methods are combined as described by zzso et zzso zzso by the program zzso to produce joint prediction zzso for a zzso for three types of secondary zzso zzso zzso and zzso The scheme requires uniform input for the prediction programs, produced by any word processor, zzso editor or database program and produces uniform output on a printer, a graphics screen or a zzso The scheme is independent of any additional software and runs under zzso zzso or later zzso
