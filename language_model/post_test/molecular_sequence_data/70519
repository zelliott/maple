We have identified and characterized a zzso zzso a novel zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso referred to as zzso from the rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the cloned zzso has a structure of an alternatively spliced form of the zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso 6 and 7 in the message, and encodes a zzso truncated protein that comprises three unique zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that the zzso zzso is more strongly expressed in the rat amygdala, thalamus, and zzso than the intact zzso zzso Western zzso analysis also reveals that the zzso protein can be expressed in zzso zzso cells as well as zzso Furthermore, this zzso binds zzso zzso with almost the same low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso and without zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, it does not bind zzso or rat zzso These findings suggest that this truncated zzso zzso is the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts in the zzso and would mediate some functions of zzso pathways in the central nervous zzso
