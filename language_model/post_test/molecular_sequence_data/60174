An zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso region of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso and zzso Sixteen open reading frames zzso were identified in this zzso A sequencing similarity search using the zzso database found that zzso to 13 all had significant similarities to gene products of zzso zzso Three other zzso zzso of unknown function were positioned zzso of zzso instead of zzso which is found in the same region in the case of zzso zzso The zzso organization from zzso to zzso was the same as that of zzso zzso The gene organization and the location of the zzso region were also similar to those of the zzso of other bacteria, such as zzso coli and zzso zzso There were two zzso clusters zzso C and zzso with a consensus sequence zzso on both sides of the zzso gene but another zzso box cluster zzso zzso which is found in the region between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was not found in the corresponding region in the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso
