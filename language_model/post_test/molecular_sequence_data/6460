zzso zzso cell zzso injury or zzso by zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of zzso meningitis and zzso zzso zzso do not express membrane zzso but respond to zzso in a soluble zzso zzso The signal zzso mechanisms involved in zzso zzso responses are largely zzso We used bovine and human brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso to study zzso protein zzso zzso zzso rapidly induced the zzso zzso of several proteins in zzso and zzso which was zzso by 5 to 15 zzso reached a maximum by 30 zzso and declined by 60 to 90 zzso The increase in zzso zzso was apparent following stimulation with zzso at zzso zzso and was dose dependent up to 100 zzso Similar changes in zzso zzso were induced by smooth and rough zzso as well as zzso A, but not by the inactive zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso A, inhibited zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso release from zzso and zzso release from zzso in a zzso zzso Three proteins with apparent zzso of 44, 42, and 41 zzso were zzso among the zzso zzso zzso and they were identified as zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso and zzso was soluble zzso dependent, since zzso of these cells with zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso induced a mobility shift in zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which was inhibited by zzso A zzso of the zzso These findings demonstrate for the first time that increased protein zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso occur rapidly after zzso stimulation of zzso in the presence of soluble zzso Our data also suggest that a zzso step, presumably a zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso
