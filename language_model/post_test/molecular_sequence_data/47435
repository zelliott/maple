zzso of the eyes absent zzso gene in animals function at multiple stages in the development of zzso Their functional roles in the genetic network that regulates eye development in zzso have recently been extensively zzso A rice zzso of zzso was identified from a zzso library made from zzso zzso The corresponding gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso domain and a short zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso shows zzso identity and zzso similarity to the product of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show about zzso similarity to zzso zzso sequences were also found in the alfalfa zzso database zzso identity and zzso similarity to zzso and in the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in both zzso and zzso Three regions in the zzso domain are well zzso in animals and zzso Plant zzso products deduced from the zzso sequences also have short zzso zzso The zzso gene is located between the zzso gene and the zzso on the short arm of zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso shoot zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso increases during zzso until 7 days after zzso with preferential zzso in leaf zzso and the shoot zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was observed in floral zzso The functions of zzso in higher plants are discussed and compared with those of their animal zzso zzso might regulate the zzso of lateral zzso as a zzso of a zzso zzso
