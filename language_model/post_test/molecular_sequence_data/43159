The zzso protein is a zzso zzso that zzso expression of viral zzso genes in cells harboring zzso zzso virus zzso In this report it is shown that a zzso of zzso that cannot activate zzso zzso can be used to detect and characterize zzso zzso Three expression zzso that allow the fusion of putative zzso regions in any reading frame were constructed using zzso These zzso were used to demonstrate the activity of different classes of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso reporter gene construct containing seven zzso response elements zzso The zzso system effectively detected zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a variety of cell lines and cell zzso Using a zzso unique to the zzso zzso system, fusion zzso can also be tested for the ability to activate gene expression directly from a zzso structure, the zzso zzso These studies indicate that the zzso system is an alternative to zzso and can be a useful tool for identifying zzso zzso zzso
