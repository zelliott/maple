zzso zzso zzso enjoy a large degree of structural and chemical zzso Two well-studied examples of such zzso are the zzso zzso produced by a variety of zzso bacteria, and their zzso counterparts, the zzso Both groups are produced as zzso precursor peptides and undergo zzso modification to generate the active zzso zzso zzso of novel zzso and zzso has recently uncovered further novel structural and chemical features and, combined with the generation of analogue peptides by genetic zzso new insights into zzso relationships have been zzso Furthermore, study of the mode of action of the zzso zzso and zzso has revealed their use of a zzso zzso in the target cell to facilitate their biological zzso Meanwhile, in zzso studies with zzso zzso have helped to uncover the molecular mechanisms by which zzso modification results in the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso From a practical standpoint, both groups of zzso represent new lead structures for future development of zzso agents, whilst the identification of the zzso zzso represents a step forward in the search for novel targets for future zzso
