zzso cloning has already produced the sequences of more than 70 human genes associated with specific zzso In addition to their medical importance, these genes are of interest as a set of human genes isolated solely on the basis of the zzso effect of the respective zzso We analyzed the protein sequences zzso by the zzso cloned disease genes using an zzso strategy combining several sensitive computer zzso Comparisons to complete sequence databases and to separate databases of zzso zzso and bacterial proteins showed that for most of the disease gene products, statistically significant sequence similarities are zzso in each of the model zzso Only the zzso zzso encodes apparent zzso with zzso domain architecture for the majority of the disease zzso In zzso and bacterial zzso domain organization is typically not zzso and sequence similarity is limited to individual zzso Generally, human genes complement zzso only in zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso cloned genes zzso large proteins with several zzso and zzso zzso the functions of some or all of which are not zzso We detected zzso zzso and motifs not described previously in a number of proteins zzso by disease genes and predicted functions for some of zzso These predictions include an zzso domain in the product of zzso zzso colon cancer gene (a zzso zzso which is zzso in the zzso family of zzso zzso type II DNA zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso to bacterial zzso D and the zzso zzso domain of DNA zzso I in the zzso syndrome gene zzso
