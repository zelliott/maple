Despite its remarkable materials properties, the structure of zzso zzso silk has remained zzso zzso from two probe zzso techniques provide new insights into the structure of zzso zzso zzso A soluble synthetic protein from zzso silk spontaneously forms zzso as observed by atomic force zzso These zzso have a segmented zzso The segment length and zzso acid sequence are consistent with a zzso shape for individual silk protein zzso The height and zzso of zzso segments suggest a stacking pattern of zzso molecules in each zzso zzso This stacking pattern produces zzso in an zzso zzso as observed previously by zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The possible importance of zzso formation to native silk production is zzso Force zzso for single molecules of the silk protein demonstrate that this protein unfolds through a number of zzso events, indicating a modular zzso within single silk protein zzso A minimal unfolding module size is estimated to be around 14 zzso which zzso to the extended length of a single repeated zzso 38 zzso acids zzso The structure of this zzso silk protein is distinctly different from the structures of other proteins that have been analyzed by zzso force zzso and the force zzso show zzso novel zzso
