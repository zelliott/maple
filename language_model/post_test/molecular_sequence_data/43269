A zzso library constructed from zzso of the rust fungus zzso zzso was screened for clones that are zzso expressed in zzso One family of zzso (in zzso gene 2 zzso was isolated and found to zzso a protein with high zzso to zzso zzso acid zzso A zzso clone containing the complete coding region of zzso and the corresponding zzso clone were isolated and zzso revealing the presence of 17 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso appeared to be restricted to zzso With zzso raised against synthetic zzso the zzso protein was found in zzso zzso of isolated zzso but not of zzso rust zzso With zzso zzso the putative zzso acid zzso was localized to plasma zzso of the zzso bodies, but not detected in the zzso neck, zzso mother cells, or zzso zzso zzso growing within infected leaf zzso These data present for the first time molecular evidence that the rust zzso plays a special role in the zzso of nutrients from an infected host zzso
