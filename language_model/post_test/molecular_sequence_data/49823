The zzso signals found at the 3' ends of the zzso and zzso zzso are a major factor determining the level of zzso zzso replication from each zzso Using a zzso system that zzso zzso zzso synthesis from zzso zzso we show here that the zzso promoter zzso for the zzso zzso directs zzso replication approximately zzso lower than that seen from the zzso promoter zzso The goal of this study was to identify zzso signals responsible for differential levels of zzso replication from the zzso zzso and zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso contains three zzso elements zzso zzso and Region zzso that are separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso promoters were constructed to test the hypothesis that transfer of discrete zzso zzso elements to the zzso could zzso higher replication properties to the zzso zzso containing a substitution of the zzso zzso zzso or Region III elements alone in place of the corresponding zzso sequences did not show enhanced levels of zzso zzso However, transfer of both the zzso 3' terminal zzso and Region III elements into the corresponding sites of the zzso led to a zzso which zzso to approximately zzso of the levels seen with the zzso This enhanced zzso replication from the zzso was further increased up to zzso levels by also including the intervening zzso segment zzso zzso located between zzso and Region zzso zzso transfer of zzso sequences in place of zzso bases zzso also increased zzso replication to levels approaching that of the zzso but only in the context of the zzso zzso and Region III zzso These data indicate that differential levels of zzso replication from the zzso zzso and zzso are due to a combination of zzso signals in the zzso zzso and Region zzso and a zzso signal in the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions for the zzso promoter elements in determining zzso replication levels are zzso
