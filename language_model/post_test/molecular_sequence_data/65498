The zzso virus zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso 30 zzso zzso that is zzso for virus replication but affects the host response to zzso The zzso protein shares sequence similarity with another zzso protein that binds zzso zzso (called zzso or viral zzso zzso zzso zzso and strains of zzso lacking the zzso gene induced stronger zzso zzso responses than control viruses expressing zzso Using surface zzso zzso we screened 39 human and zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso with zzso of between 8 zzso and 118 zzso Nonetheless, zzso was ineffective at zzso zzso induced by these zzso indicating it did not block the interaction of these zzso with their zzso However the interaction of zzso and zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso bind to overlapping sites on these zzso To better understand the mechanism of action of zzso its crystal structure was solved to zzso A zzso The protein has a zzso beta sandwich structure similar to that of the zzso zzso family of zzso but there are notable structural differences, particularly in surface zzso and zzso charge zzso zzso zzso suggests that the binding paradigm as defined for the zzso interaction is likely to be zzso between zzso and its zzso zzso Additionally, sequence analysis of zzso binding to zzso identified a signature for zzso zzso The biological and structural data suggest that zzso functions by forming moderately strong zzso interactions with certain zzso sufficient to interfere with zzso interactions at the cell surface zzso and thereby to destroy the zzso concentration zzso but not strong enough to disrupt the zzso zzso zzso zzso
