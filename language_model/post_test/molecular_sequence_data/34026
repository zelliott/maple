The complete zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso was determined by using long zzso and zzso primer walking zzso The results showed that the entire zzso zzso of zzso zzso is 15 zzso zzso long with zzso content of zzso All 37 genes are zzso in the positions observed in those of zzso zzso All the genes are closely assembled by leaving 10 zzso zzso in zzso Those zzso zzso are 47 zzso in total zzso the zzso rich zzso with individual size ranges from 1 zzso to 20 zzso In addition, there are a total of 52 zzso overlapping sequences among 14 zzso ranging from zzso zzso All zzso genes start with a typical initiation zzso in insects, zzso Twelve zzso genes use the usual zzso and zzso termination zzso zzso the zzso genes have an incomplete termination zzso zzso Except the zzso zzso whose zzso arm is zzso all the other 21 zzso genes have typical zzso secondary zzso But in zzso zzso the secondary structures of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes can not be predicted by the conventional methods as they have only zzso rather than 5 base pairs in the zzso arm, while, the zzso and zzso have only 4 base pairs in the zzso zzso The predicted secondary structures of zzso and zzso have 6 zzso with 44 zzso and 3 zzso with 30 zzso zzso The results of the zzso secondary structure comparison showed that zzso zzso is more closely related with zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso Like most insects, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has a zzso zzso rich region containing a zzso stretch, which may be involved in the replication and/or translation initiation of other zzso
