zzso zzso 29 DNA was not zzso after restrictive infection of zzso zzso with the zzso 29 zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso 29 protein zzso is needed for the viral DNA zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso showed that a C in the zzso zzso zzso had been changed to a T at zzso position 19 of the zzso giving rise to a zzso zzso zzso indicating that this zzso zzso to gene zzso zzso was cloned in zzso zzso under the control of the zzso promoter of zzso zzso and, after zzso a protein of about 10 zzso was zzso which was absent in the corresponding cells zzso a zzso zzso with the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso protein is the product of gene zzso In addition, a protein of lower Mr was zzso after induction of the cells zzso zzso plasmids with the zzso or the zzso zzso Both proteins were zzso and characterized by zzso sequence determination and zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso named delta 1, has a size of 6 zzso and zzso to an internal zzso initiation event in zzso
