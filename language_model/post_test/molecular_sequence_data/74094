Fluorescence resonance energy transfer, zzso can be used to obtain long-range distance information for zzso and is particularly powerful when used in zzso zzso The determination of accurate distances requires knowledge of the zzso position with respect to the zzso In this study we have used zzso to determine the structure of the commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso attached to the zzso of zzso zzso We find that zzso is predominantly stacked onto the end of the duplex, in a manner similar to an additional base zzso This is very similar to the behavior of zzso terminally attached to DNA and suggests that the efficiency of energy transfer between zzso and zzso that are attached to zzso acids in this way, will exhibit significant dependence on zzso zzso
