The zzso zzso zzso zzso C promoter zzso is the origin of transcripts for six viral zzso The promoter is active in zzso zzso lines but silent in many zzso tumors and tumor cell zzso In these latter cell lines, the viral zzso is zzso in the vicinity of this zzso We show that in such a cell line zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso brings about zzso of zzso zzso activates zzso transcription, and zzso the expression of zzso Investigation of the phenomenon demonstrates the importance of the zzso status of a particular zzso site for the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso sequencing shows that this site is zzso when the zzso is inactive and is not zzso when the promoter is zzso zzso zzso or transition zzso at this site zzso complex formation with a cellular binding activity zzso as determined by zzso mobility shift zzso competition binding zzso and zzso I zzso and zzso a single C zzso T transition zzso at this site is associated with a marked reduction zzso zzso of zzso activity in a reporter zzso Thus, the zzso binding activity is shown to be zzso sensitive and crucial to zzso zzso of the zzso
