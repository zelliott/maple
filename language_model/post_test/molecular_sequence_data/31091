The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso provides the essential transport function for the zzso across the outer zzso To investigate the zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso we engineered hybrid proteins between zzso beta and the zzso 12 zzso zzso toxin B zzso zzso and examined their targeting zzso in zzso zzso We show that zzso beta hybrid proteins integrate into the outer zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso on the cell zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso added zzso like zzso but can also be specifically zzso off from zzso zzso beta by zzso zzso zzso We further demonstrate that folding of the zzso zzso at the zzso side of the outer membrane interferes with its zzso Prevention of zzso folding in zzso zzso renders the protein zzso competent for outer membrane zzso zzso beta may be of general interest as an export vehicle for even larger proteins from zzso zzso
