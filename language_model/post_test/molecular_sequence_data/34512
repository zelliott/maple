zzso factor 4 zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso factors and is indispensable for terminal maturation of zzso zzso Furthermore, it is part of a small set of proteins that are used to generate zzso embryonic stem cells from differentiated zzso zzso we describe that a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and block of zzso while zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso Moreover, we present the crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso bound to its target DNA, revealing that primarily the two zzso zzso motifs are required for site zzso Lack of those two zinc fingers leads to zzso of zzso to induce zzso zzso The first zinc finger, on the other hand, zzso the otherwise cryptic zzso and block of differentiation activity of zzso Our data show that zzso the DNA binding could potentially contribute to a zzso zzso
