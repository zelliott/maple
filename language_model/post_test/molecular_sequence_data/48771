The specificity and extent of zzso editing by zzso zzso is determined largely by local primary sequence and secondary structural imperfections in duplex zzso Here we surgically alter zzso zzso elements associated with a cluster of zzso modification sites within the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the local requirement for a central imperfect zzso duplex containing the modified zzso we demonstrate that a secondary zzso duplex containing zzso signals strongly zzso zzso zzso A subtle zzso zzso extending base pairing of this accessory zzso zzso significant zzso consequences via effects on zzso Through zzso we also uncover and functionally replace a highly zzso zzso long-range zzso zzso that is absolutely required for zzso of one particular zzso in the central zzso Our results demonstrate that complex zzso zzso structures, which may be difficult to predict zzso form in zzso and can regulate zzso zzso
