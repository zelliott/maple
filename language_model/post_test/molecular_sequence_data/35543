To increase the zzso production in zzso zzso by enhancing zzso promoter activity and fusion with upstream sequence from zzso 

The effects of joining the upstream sequence of zzso that contains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition site to the zzso promoter as well as the effects of substitution zzso of zzso sequences of its zzso promoter on zzso expression was monitored by constructing zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso zzso promoter to that of zzso enhanced zzso activity about three fold as comparing to that of the zzso promoter with its own upstream zzso In contrast, the same zzso zzso promoter linked to the above upstream sequence of zzso enhanced zzso activity up to seven fold, but was five fold lower than that of the full-length zzso zzso The zzso hybrid promoter with the zzso zzso zzso efficiently increased zzso synthesis by zzso and resulted in a zzso increase in insect zzso toxicity when comparing to the wild zzso 

The zzso promoter as well as zzso of zzso region of zzso promoter together with fusion with zzso zzso zzso recognition site efficiently enhanced zzso production in zzso 

The results provide useful information to construct an efficient zzso gene expression in zzso
