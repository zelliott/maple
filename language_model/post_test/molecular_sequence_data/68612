The promoter regions of the rat zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes contain sequences similar to the zzso response element identified for zzso an zzso gene structurally related to the steroid hormone zzso zzso Combined zzso and zzso zzso approaches were used to determine whether challenges that influence the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso result in altered expression in zzso zzso of zzso and another zzso zzso zzso which is widely used as a marker for functionally activated zzso zzso zzso was found to be expressed at zzso high levels in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso expression were zzso low throughout the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were induced with a similar time course and in similar neuroendocrine cell types in response to acute zzso zzso zzso reduction in blood zzso intravenous injection of zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic salt loading (7 d maintenance on zzso zzso and acute bilateral zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein were readily zzso in zzso pathways that have been implicated as zzso the neuroendocrine responses in the three stress zzso these include zzso zzso cell groups in response to zzso beta and zzso and cell groups lining the zzso zzso in response to salt zzso zzso induction of zzso expression was zzso in these zzso cell groups, though with a lesser sensitivity than that required to reveal zzso induction in the zzso or zzso expression in these related zzso These results establish zzso as a useful adjunct to zzso for revealing synaptic and/or zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the sensitivity of the two markers in revealing functionally related zzso in zzso regions speak to general issues concerning the use of zzso genes in mapping functional zzso in the zzso
