zzso which mimic zzso were used as a zzso phase in zzso zone zzso The decrease in the mobility of an zzso zzso to the presence of zzso reflected interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso were derived to calculate the specific capacity factor zzso (the capacity factor, zzso zzso to the zzso concentration 1 zzso from the migration times and to estimate the difference in free energy, zzso zzso of the weak zzso zzso The order of zzso values for the drugs tested was aspirin zzso salicylic acid zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso more strongly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results were similar to those obtained earlier by immobilized zzso zzso
