zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso Until now, knowledge about their molecular information, zzso and expression pattern is largely unavailable in plant zzso One zzso in zzso zzso by zzso has been identified zzso zzso of zzso caused an zzso hypersensitive zzso in transgenic zzso plants, indicating that it functions as a positive regulator of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced the expression of this gene in zzso zzso The current study extends these findings by examining the zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso functions of zzso and two other zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso by two related genes zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso investigations showed that the zzso and other two zzso zzso comprise a small zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso showed that the zzso and zzso proteins are zzso proteins predominantly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso genes are expressed in all examined zzso including roots, zzso leaves, zzso leaves, zzso flowers, and zzso with differential expression zzso Within the gene family, the base transcript abundance of zzso gene is very low with higher expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis uncovered that both zzso and zzso genes are zzso by zzso zzso and zzso treatment, with zzso showing the highest level of zzso by these zzso Heat stress resulted in zzso of the zzso gene significantly but zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso Cold and zzso stimuli led to no significant change of both zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso showed increased sensitivity to zzso but slightly decreased sensitivity to salt and zzso stresses during seed zzso 

It is concluded that the zzso family is involved in stress and zzso signaling in zzso probably through zzso the process of zzso zzso zzso Identification of these zzso proteins will help to better understand the significance of protein zzso in zzso
