zzso is a principal precursor of pancreatic zzso zzso We previously isolated a zzso clone for human zzso from a human pancreatic zzso zzso In the present study, we used this zzso sequences to isolate zzso DNA zzso Three overlapping zzso clones spanning approximately zzso zzso sequences were isolated from a human zzso zzso The zzso DNA clones were characterized by restriction zzso mapping and by zzso them to zzso of the zzso The sequence zzso sites for human zzso gene were created by designing two zzso Furthermore, the isolated zzso clones were confirmed to be localized on zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
