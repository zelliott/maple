Our understanding of the zzso mechanisms that mediate zzso in insects has been greatly improved after the discovery of zzso and taste zzso zzso However, the presence of soluble zzso in high concentration around the zzso of sensory zzso still poses unanswered zzso More than 2 decades after their discovery and despite the wealth of structural information available, the zzso function of zzso proteins is not well zzso More recently, members of a second family of soluble zzso the zzso zzso were also discovered in the zzso of zzso Here we review the structural properties of both classes of soluble zzso their affinity to small zzso and their expression in the different parts of the insect body and zzso zzso Finally, we discuss current ideas and models of the role of such proteins in insect zzso
