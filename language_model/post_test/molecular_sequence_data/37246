zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso acquisition system zzso of zzso zzso It is zzso by a specific ABC zzso apparatus composed of three zzso zzso an inner membrane ABC zzso zzso another inner membrane zzso and zzso a zzso zzso Except for zzso the structural genes of the Has system are zzso by an zzso zzso In previous studies, this zzso system has been zzso in zzso coli, where it requires the presence of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the zzso gene from zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to zzso coli zzso and zzso the zzso defects of a zzso zzso of zzso coli for both the zzso and ABC pathways of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso affects zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso is the genuine zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results also demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso is zzso as it is involved in two separate zzso zzso We investigated the effects of zzso point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by comparing the zzso of a zzso zzso in various zzso Two different patterns of zzso zzso effects were observed, suggesting that zzso functions may differ for the zzso and ABC zzso
