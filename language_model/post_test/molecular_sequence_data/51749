The protein synthesis initiation factor, zzso in zzso zzso has previously been characterized as being present in two forms, alpha and zzso of molecular mass 79 and 68 zzso respectively, on the basis of their zzso with zzso coli zzso zzso and by the DNA sequence of the gene for zzso zzso In this work we have cloned zzso in zzso coli zzso Two proteins of molecular mass identical to the zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso were zzso and zzso using a new three-step zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the two proteins was determined and the results confirmed that the two forms were zzso alpha and zzso both zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence determined for zzso beta is zzso The presence of zzso at position 94 shows that this form is, in fact, the result of a second zzso initiation in zzso zzso since the zzso at zzso acid position 94 is zzso which is the normal zzso for zzso but also known to be an zzso zzso This is a new example of the unusual tandem translation in zzso coli of an open zzso reading zzso
