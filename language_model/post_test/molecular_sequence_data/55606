A zzso region of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso was zzso and found to contain an open reading frame zzso which was capable of rescuing a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping demonstrated that an early zzso zzso zzso the zzso open reading frame and probably overlapped the zzso zzso zzso The zzso open reading frame was cloned behind the zzso promoter in a zzso transfer zzso which was then used to prepare a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was used to prepare zzso zzso zzso These zzso detected a zzso of 47 zzso in zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso is expressed as an authentic viral zzso The zzso gene product was localized to the nucleus of infected cells, supporting the hypothesis that it is involved in regulating viral zzso at late times zzso
