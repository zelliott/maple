A and B zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by zzso and zzso When compared with the zzso data, the deduced protein sequences revealed only one zzso acid substitution in the B zzso In order to investigate the zzso structure of these zzso zzso zzso their zzso regions were amplified by zzso The two genes showed the typical zzso organization found in zzso and seemed to reflect the ancestral gene structure, in accordance with the new zzso gene evolution theory proposed by Dixon and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The alternative hypothesis suggested by Go zzso zzso zzso that the central zzso was lost during evolution, is also zzso In contrast to the related clam zzso zzso zzso zzso A and B zzso genes were found to be present in multiple copies differing in zzso zzso In this study we report the complete sequences of the A zzso zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso giving a detailed analysis of their zzso zzso
