zzso zzso is an zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso The zzso zzso within zzso without being zzso and involves changes in cellular zzso Studies aiming at better understanding host response to a pathogen at the zzso levels are frequently based on the use of real time zzso zzso which require some reference zzso However, very few sequence data is available for zzso zzso in public zzso zzso zzso libraries were constructed from the zzso zzso zzso in order to identify genes involved in host reactions against the zzso and quantitative real time zzso zzso were developed to study expression of these zzso In this context, identification of reference genes and study of their relative expression stability were required for quantitative real time zzso zzso The expression of 5 potential candidate reference genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied using zzso extracted from pools of zzso in contact with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Gene expression was zzso by real time zzso and expression stability was zzso with two zzso approaches zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the most stable genes with the zzso zzso Whatever were the tested conditions, zzso was also found as the most stable gene using zzso The less stable gene was zzso although this gene is commonly used as zzso gene in many zzso Our results suggest using zzso and zzso combined as reference genes when studying expression levels in zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the complete zzso of these two genes was zzso
