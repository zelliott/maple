There are several classes of zzso zzso zzso complexes, which zzso the structure of zzso to regulate a variety of cellular zzso The budding zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso of the zzso class, zzso and zzso Previously zzso was shown to zzso with three other zzso Here we identify these associated proteins and show that zzso forms two zzso complexes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that while both have equivalent zzso zzso activities, zzso and zzso differ in their abilities to bind to DNA and zzso zzso which possibly accounts for differences in specific activities in zzso spacing and zzso In zzso the two zzso complexes have overlapping functions in zzso regulation of some genes yet distinct functions at zzso In addition, these complexes show different contributions to cell growth at elevated zzso
