The present study characterizes the zzso zzso zzso profiles of 26 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6 of the human zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso is linked zzso to zzso via zzso loop zzso zzso was identified previously as lining part of the zzso zzso path ( zzso zzso zzso zzso 2006 zzso Most zzso zzso replacements were well zzso except for five zzso with either severely hampered zzso zzso or abolished zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein synthesis or folding and stability may account for lack of activity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid replacement reveals its participation in both structural and functional aspects of the transport zzso Application of polar zzso zzso (1 zzso significantly inhibited the activity of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for which rates of modification were almost fully reversed (except zzso upon inclusion of zzso acid zzso or removal of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso assessments at zzso zzso revealed numerous zzso zzso suggesting their proximity in or around zzso interaction zzso In zzso modeling reveals the intimate and potentially cooperative orientation of zzso zzso zzso toward functionally important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso participation during the transport zzso We conclude a functional requirement for zzso flexibility imparted by zzso zzso and zzso probably forming a zzso zzso requisite for zzso zzso meanwhile, zzso zzso which line a zzso face zzso distinct from this switch, may participate during zzso zzso
