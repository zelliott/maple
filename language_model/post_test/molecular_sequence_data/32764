The degradation zzso of zzso zzso a hazardous zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso These genes are located in a genetic context, zzso which resembles a putative zzso zzso In this work, these gene sequences were individually disrupted and zzso strains were evaluated for their ability to grow on or degrade zzso The zzso and zzso zzso completely failed to degrade this zzso Although the zzso zzso was also unable to grow on zzso it still transformed this zzso to zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso grew on zzso suggesting the presence of additional zzso zzso zzso Five other open reading frames zzso zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso were found in the zzso of zzso zzso and two of them provide this function in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso regulator, was zzso and this zzso strain completely failed to grow on zzso zzso fusion studies demonstrated that zzso activates the expression of the zzso zzso responding specifically to zzso The zzso start of the zzso zzso was zzso and a putative zzso promoter was zzso
