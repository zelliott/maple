The zzso zzso zzso zzso harbors the largest known gene family in zzso disposed in clusters on numerous zzso We have carried out a comparative evolutionary analysis of the best characterized zzso OR gene zzso on human zzso zzso Fifteen zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso as well as key OR counterparts from other zzso have been identified and zzso zzso among zzso and zzso revealed a zzso of gene conversion events, which occurred exclusively within OR zzso These appear to lead to segment zzso in the zzso binding site, an evolutionary process reminiscent of zzso zzso diversification in the immune zzso We also demonstrate that the functional zzso OR repertoire has undergone a rapid decline in the past 10 million years: while for the common zzso of all great apes an intact OR cluster is zzso in zzso humans and great apes the cluster includes nearly zzso zzso
