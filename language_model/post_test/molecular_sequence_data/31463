A bacterial strain designated zzso was isolated from a freshwater spring in Taiwan and characterized using the zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rods surrounded by a thick capsule and forming zzso zzso Growth occurred at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso within the family zzso of the class zzso and its most closely related zzso was zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarity of zzso zzso zzso contained zzso as the zzso fatty zzso The major respiratory zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content of the zzso DNA was zzso zzso The polar zzso profile consisted of a mixture of zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso and several zzso zzso The zzso zzso of strain zzso with respect to recognized species of the zzso zzso was less than zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
