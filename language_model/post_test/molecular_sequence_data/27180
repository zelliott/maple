zzso crustaceans possess zzso compound eyes that contain more zzso types than any other animal zzso While the anatomy and physiology of this complexity have been studied for more than two decades, few studies have investigated the molecular aspects underlying the zzso visual zzso Based on previous studies of the structure and function of the different types of zzso zzso zzso are hypothesized to contain up to 16 different visual zzso with 6 of these having sensitivity to middle or long zzso of zzso We investigated zzso middle- and zzso zzso genes from five species with the hypothesis that each species investigated would express up to six different zzso zzso In order to understand the evolution of this class of zzso zzso we examined the complement of expressed transcripts in the zzso of species representing a broad zzso range (four families and three zzso A total of 54 unique retinal zzso were isolated, resulting in zzso different expressed transcripts in each zzso zzso these transcripts form six distinct zzso grouping with other zzso zzso and sister to insect zzso visual zzso Within these zzso zzso groups, zzso and zzso clusters of highly similar transcripts suggest that there has been rampant recent gene zzso Some of the observed molecular diversity is also due to ancient gene zzso events within the stem zzso zzso Using evolutionary trace analysis, 10 zzso acid sites were identified as functionally divergent among the six zzso zzso zzso These sites form tight clusters in two regions of the zzso protein known to be functionally zzso six in the zzso pocket and four at the zzso surface in zzso II and zzso These two clusters of sites indicate that zzso zzso have zzso with respect to both spectral tuning and signal zzso
