zzso growth factor beta 1 zzso 1) is a potent growth inhibitor for many cell types, including most zzso zzso However, the mechanism of growth zzso is zzso In skin zzso zzso 1 has been shown to inhibit growth and to rapidly reduce zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that protein synthesis is required for zzso 1 regulation of zzso in zzso Here we present evidence that treatment of mouse zzso zzso cells with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso 1 inhibited cell entry into S zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso expression may be essential for growth zzso by zzso zzso The block in zzso expression by zzso 1 occurred at the level of zzso zzso Studies with a series of zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso indicated that a zzso regulatory zzso which resides between positions zzso and zzso relative to zzso zzso start site, is responsible for the zzso 1 zzso Based on these data, it is proposed that the mechanism of zzso 1 growth zzso involves synthesis or modification of a protein that may interact with a specific zzso in the zzso regulatory region of the zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso
