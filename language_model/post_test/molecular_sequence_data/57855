Overlapping zzso zzso the entire heavy chain of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso A zzso zzso acid zzso containing four zzso consensus sequences is zzso zzso with the sea zzso zzso outer arm zzso beta heavy chain is observed within the zzso two-thirds of the zzso The zzso third of the two zzso shows no clear relationship, suggesting that this region of zzso zzso is responsible for its association with retrograde zzso and other zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals a zzso zzso band in brain and other zzso Southern zzso analysis is consistent with a single zzso zzso zzso Thus, in contrast with zzso and zzso which contain numerous forms of zzso our results are consistent with the existence of only a single zzso zzso heavy chain zzso which appears to produce only a single zzso
