zzso sequences have been obtained for zzso segments zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins of the influenza zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus and its zzso zzso zzso that has been used for preparing zzso live attenuated zzso zzso zzso differences between the ca and zzso viruses were zzso of which 11 were deduced to code for zzso acid zzso in the ca virus zzso One zzso acid substitution each was predicted for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso acid zzso were predicted for the zzso and the PA zzso Four zzso were predicted for the zzso zzso The biological significance of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of the ca virus is suggested by currently available genetic data, a comparison with other available influenza gene zzso and the nature of the predicted zzso acid zzso In addition, the sequence data confirm the close evolutionary relationship between the zzso of influenza A zzso and influenza A zzso zzso
