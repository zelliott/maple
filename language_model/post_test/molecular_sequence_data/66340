zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We report the zzso of a zzso zzso protein of an infectious form of the zzso into the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso zzso with five zzso zzso against the zzso protein demonstrated that, soon after the bacterial invasion into the host zzso the protein was detected in the infected zzso and that levels of the protein increased dramatically within one day of zzso The use of zzso for host and bacterial protein synthesis illustrated that, in early infection of zzso zzso not only the pre-existing but also a newly zzso zzso protein was zzso into the host zzso A partial zzso acid sequence of the protein was determined, and a gene zzso the zzso protein was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows that this protein is a novel zzso
