Several aspects of zzso of an in zzso modified Ds element are zzso This Ds element, designated zzso is equipped with bacterial zzso sequences and can, therefore, be rescued from the plant zzso Our results indicate that the zzso element has a zzso timing of zzso from zzso This feature of the element might be advantageous for tagging experiments because it leads to independently zzso zzso transmitted zzso Furthermore, it is shown that zzso zzso generates clusters of zzso indicating that zzso to be zzso should be located in zzso regions covered by zzso
