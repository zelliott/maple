The early region 1 zzso of human zzso zzso type 12 zzso the expression of major zzso zzso Class I genes in transformed primary zzso zzso In this paper we show that both zzso B and zzso zzso zzso binding activity to the zzso element in the Class I promoter is reduced in zzso cells compared to zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells the zzso element does not contribute to zzso activity in transient expression zzso whereas it does contribute in zzso zzso zzso the most likely explanation is that reduced binding of zzso B and zzso to the zzso element accounts for the zzso of zzso Class I expression in zzso and zzso zzso
