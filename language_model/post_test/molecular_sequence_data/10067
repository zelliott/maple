zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is a zzso zzso peripheral membrane protein that targets to the zzso region and zzso of zzso zzso Recent evidence has shown that zzso can zzso with zzso the resident coat protein of zzso suggesting a direct interaction between these two zzso To test this idea, we examined the interactions of zzso with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso resulted in the direct interaction of the two zzso zzso a series of zzso deletion zzso we identified two zzso zzso of zzso that interact with zzso the scaffolding domain zzso acids zzso and to a lesser extent the zzso tail zzso acids zzso zzso of pure zzso with peptides derived from the scaffolding zzso of zzso and zzso but not the analogous regions from zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a common mechanism and site of zzso zzso zzso zzso the site of zzso binding was localized between zzso acids 310 and zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso binding motif within zzso blocked the ability of zzso to suppress NO release in zzso zzso Thus, our data demonstrate a novel functional role for zzso in zzso cells as a potential molecular zzso that directly zzso zzso This suggests that the direct binding of zzso to zzso per se, and the functional consequences of zzso targeting to zzso are likely temporally and zzso distinct events that regulate NO production in zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso and zzso by the scaffolding domain of zzso suggests that zzso in cardiac zzso and zzso in skeletal muscle are likely subject to negative regulation by this zzso zzso zzso
