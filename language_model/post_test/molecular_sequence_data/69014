Previous studies have demonstrated zzso of zzso growth factor receptors zzso to be of zzso significance in breast, zzso zzso and other zzso However, the relatively large quantity of zzso tissue required for zzso growth factor zzso binding zzso zzso has precluded its application to zzso specimens and small biopsy zzso For this reason we evaluated reverse zzso zzso differential zzso chain reaction zzso as an zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso transitional cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and leukemia zzso cell lines were used to compare zzso and zzso zzso involved reverse zzso of zzso and amplification of zzso using zzso for zzso and zzso Good agreement was observed between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso extracted from fresh cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso sections yielded similar zzso These data suggest that zzso may be useful in evaluating gene expression by cells processed as zzso zzso
