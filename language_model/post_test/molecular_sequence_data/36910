zzso coli zzso expressing a toxin related to zzso toxin zzso was isolated from the small zzso contents of a case of zzso zzso Death zzso zzso This strain was zzso for a zzso zzso but this did not zzso the zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA revealed that the zzso gene was located on a zzso zzso zzso fragment, which was cloned into zzso coli zzso in both zzso using the zzso zzso to generate plasmids zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso produced zzso as judged by zzso for zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso gene was related to, but distinct from, previously reported zzso of zzso toxin type II, produced by zzso coli from both human and animal zzso The A zzso of the zzso gene from zzso exhibited zzso zzso (at both the DNA and derived zzso acid sequence zzso to the A zzso of the most closely related zzso zzso The B zzso was less similar, exhibiting zzso and zzso zzso to the related gene at the DNA and zzso acid level, zzso
