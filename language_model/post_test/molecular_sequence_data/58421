The zzso responsible for the degradation of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso are zzso by the linear zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso genes were cloned from zzso and the zzso sequence was zzso By means of database searches and expression of the cloned genes in zzso zzso we identified five clustered zzso zzso which zzso the three components of the zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso of the terminal zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein sequences deduced from the zzso gene cluster exhibited significant zzso with the corresponding proteins of analogous zzso pathways in zzso and zzso bacteria, but the gene order differed from most of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could both be expressed in zzso coli, but the zzso zzso activities were too low to be detected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, inhibitor studies with the zzso zzso zzso zzso are in accordance with the involvement of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
