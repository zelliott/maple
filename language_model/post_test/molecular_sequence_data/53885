The putative zzso protein zzso zzso on an zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using the zzso coli zzso system, and its zzso ability for the seven zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso was investigated in zzso In zzso zzso zzso selectively bound to the DNA fragments containing the zzso In addition, zzso I zzso analysis with zzso DNA demonstrated that zzso can specifically cover about a zzso region centered around each of the zzso although two boxes, zzso and zzso were only partially zzso Moreover, protein zzso experiments using zzso suggested that zzso most likely functions as a zzso On the other hand, the binding ability of zzso for the zzso in zzso DNA was also examined under the same conditions as in zzso unlike zzso zzso covered zzso and zzso completely sufficiently as well as the other five zzso Thus, the present and previous zzso et zzso Gene 215 zzso zzso 242 zzso zzso results indicate a possibility that the two proteins zzso and zzso selectively bind to the zzso that act as operators, and can decide between the zzso or zzso pathways through repression of the promoter activity of zzso as well as zzso
