zzso stimulation factor zzso is one of the multiple factors required for zzso of zzso zzso in zzso We have shown previously that this factor is composed of three distinct zzso of 77, 64, and 50 zzso and that the zzso zzso can be zzso to zzso in a zzso signal zzso zzso By molecular zzso the zzso zzso was shown to contain a zzso zzso binding domain and a novel repeat zzso To study the functions of the other zzso we have now isolated zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso This zzso shares extensive zzso with zzso G protein zzso and has a characteristic repeat structure zzso zzso in which an approximately zzso zzso sequence is repeated seven zzso To our knowledge, the zzso zzso is the first example of a functional zzso protein in zzso zzso roles of the zzso zzso both in zzso function specifically and in other zzso zzso more generally, are zzso
