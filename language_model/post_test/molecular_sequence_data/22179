zzso zzso c zzso contain an electron transferring zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso All but one of these zzso are isolated in an inactive oxidized state and require reduction of the E zzso by a small zzso donor protein in order to activate the P zzso Here we present the structures of the inactive oxidized and active mixed zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso flexibility in the former, as expressed by the zzso temperature factors, is zzso distributed in certain loop regions, and these coincide with the regions of zzso change that occur in forming the active mixed zzso zzso On the basis of these changes, we zzso a series of events that occur to link the trigger of the electron entering the E zzso from either zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso of a zzso zzso at the P zzso which allows zzso zzso
