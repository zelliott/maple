The ubiquitous zzso and the gastric zzso are zzso plasma membrane proteins composed of an alpha and a beta zzso The zzso beta zzso zzso zzso can partially act as a surrogate for the zzso beta zzso zzso zzso in the formation of functional zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have examined the role of the zzso and/or the zzso of beta zzso in zzso its zzso retention in the absence of zzso synthesis of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso the functional expression of zzso at the cell surface and their zzso by external zzso We have constructed zzso proteins between zzso beta zzso and rabbit beta zzso by exchanging their zzso plus zzso domain with their zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso We have expressed these zzso with or without zzso of alpha zzso in the zzso zzso In the absence of alpha zzso zzso beta zzso and all zzso that contained the zzso of beta zzso were retained in the zzso while beta zzso and all zzso with the zzso of beta zzso could leave the zzso suggesting that zzso retention of zzso zzso beta zzso is zzso by a retention signal in the zzso When zzso with alpha zzso only beta zzso and beta zzso zzso assembled efficiently with alpha zzso leading to similar high expression of functional zzso at the cell surface that zzso however, a different apparent zzso zzso beta zzso or zzso with the zzso domain of beta zzso assembled less efficiently with alpha zzso leading to lower expression of functional zzso with a different apparent zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso domain of beta zzso is important for efficient assembly with alpha zzso and that both the zzso and the zzso of beta zzso play a role in modulating the transport activity of zzso
