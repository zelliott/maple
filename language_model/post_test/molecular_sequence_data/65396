In resting zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso is zzso zzso a state maintained by the zzso family zzso zzso zzso has a role in negative regulation of zzso family zzso in zzso by recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the membrane via binding to zzso zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is essential for zzso zzso however, so far the zzso binding mode has been zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso complex formation is a dual domain zzso process, involving zzso domain binding to zzso zzso as well as an zzso domain interaction with the first zzso region of zzso This binding mode affects zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso and zzso demonstrated in zzso zzso cells after zzso stimulation of the T cell zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso domain zzso of the zzso interaction in human primary zzso Although zzso zzso domain association is shown to be crucial for efficiently initiating zzso zzso we suggest that engagement of the zzso domain on zzso renders zzso insensitive to zzso negative zzso Thus, in zzso zzso is involved in positive as well as negative regulation of zzso zzso
