zzso is a zzso zzso zzso in all zzso and functions to remove sister zzso cohesion in zzso by zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso activity is regulated by its inhibitor zzso and by an zzso zzso in zzso However, these regulations have never been directly investigated in the zzso cell cycle of zzso In this study, we cloned the full-length gene zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can cleave the human zzso zzso of zzso in zzso but cannot bind to zzso when these two proteins are zzso in zzso zzso Similar to its human counterpart, zzso zzso itself upon zzso but at a single zzso The zzso site is zzso with one of the three zzso sites in zzso Using zzso as a reporter for its zzso we demonstrated that zzso is zzso activated between the two zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso as is observed in other zzso Taking advantage of the inability of zzso to interact with zzso we demonstrated that zzso extract can zzso both full-length and zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso by zzso does occur under zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso accumulated in response to zzso zzso maturation and was zzso at both zzso I and II in an zzso zzso
