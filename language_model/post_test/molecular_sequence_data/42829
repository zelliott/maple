Type zzso von zzso disease zzso is characterized by a selective loss of high molecular weight von zzso factor zzso zzso in plasma due to their zzso enhanced zzso with zzso Several zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain of zzso were recently characterized that cause type zzso zzso The effect of type zzso zzso zzso on zzso binding to zzso zzso was studied using zzso wild type zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso In the absence of zzso 50% of zzso bound spontaneously to zzso zzso and the binding increased to zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not bind significantly under either zzso zzso binding of zzso was only slightly increased compared to zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso increases the affinity of zzso for zzso resulting in the characteristics zzso type zzso zzso zzso
