Although the induction of zzso and T cells by synthetic peptides representing defined zzso zzso is a routine laboratory zzso their use as vaccines has not yet been generally zzso There are a number of reasons for this and paramount is the limitation of zzso which affects not only zzso but also the coverage of the zzso zzso This paper is a review of our own work in which we have assembled synthetic peptides into zzso artificial proteins and then examined their zzso zzso
