A series of zzso which contain zzso zzso at zzso and span the zzso zzso have been shown to be potent zzso of human zzso zzso zzso The zzso described contain the zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso This zzso has previously been shown in the case of zzso to be a good zzso replacement for zzso Of the peptides prepared, those which contain the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are the preferred zzso at the zzso specificity zzso zzso at zzso by the corresponding zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gives inactive zzso Of the zzso described the most potent in zzso compound is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is presumed that the inhibitor zzso interacts with the zzso binding regions of zzso zzso extended binding zzso were prepared which interact with the zzso binding zzso of zzso In order to effect interaction with the zzso zzso of zzso the leaving group side of zzso zzso zzso based upon zzso and those linked via the N zzso of zzso were zzso One of the most potent extended compounds zzso in zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The described in zzso active zzso were also evaluated in zzso in an zzso pulmonary zzso zzso zzso In this model, zzso zzso administration of zzso 5 zzso prior to zzso challenge (10 zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The described zzso zzso zzso are assumed to act as zzso zzso The zzso process presumably acts via zzso formation with the active site zzso of zzso and is facilitated by the strongly electron withdrawing effect of the zzso zzso
