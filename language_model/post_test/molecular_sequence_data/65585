A number of novel infectious zzso viruses zzso were previously identified in commercial poultry in Australia, where they caused significant economic zzso Since there has been only limited characterization of these zzso we investigated the zzso and zzso differences between these novel zzso and other, classical zzso The 3' zzso zzso of the zzso of 17 Australian zzso strains were zzso and growth properties of 6 of the strains were zzso zzso of sequences of the genes coding for structural and zzso proteins revealed the existence of two zzso zzso classical and zzso The zzso organization of the classical zzso was typical of those of other group III zzso zzso region zzso However, the novel zzso zzso lacked either all or most of the genes coding for zzso proteins at the 3' end of the zzso and had a unique open reading frame, zzso The gene order was either zzso or zzso zzso novel and classical zzso also zzso novel zzso grew at a slower rate and reached lower zzso in zzso and in zzso and were markedly less zzso in zzso Although the novel zzso induced zzso zzso in the zzso of infected zzso that were comparable to those induced by classical zzso they did not induce zzso in the zzso This study has demonstrated for the first time the existence of a naturally occurring zzso zzso devoid of some of the genes coding for zzso proteins and has also indicated that all of the accessory genes are zzso for the growth of zzso and that such viruses are able to cause clinical disease and economic zzso The zzso differences between these novel zzso and other avian zzso suggest a zzso host distinct from domestic zzso
