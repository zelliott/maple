The core zzso gene family of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes are unique in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast there are two zzso zzso zzso and zzso As previously reported for the zzso gene zzso and Morris 1987) zzso also interrupt the other core zzso zzso The zzso zzso like the zzso zzso is interrupted by three zzso the zzso and zzso gene are each interrupted by two zzso and the zzso gene contains one zzso The position of the single zzso in zzso is the same as that the first zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are arranged as a gene pair separated by approximately 600 zzso and are zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are similarly arranged and are separated by approximately 800 zzso The zzso gene is not closely linked to either the zzso or zzso gene zzso Using pulse field gel zzso an zzso zzso was established for zzso zzso This zzso was used to assign the zzso gene pair and the zzso gene to linkage group VIII and the zzso gene pair to either linkage group III or zzso The abundance of each of the zzso zzso zzso was determined to be cell cycle regulated but the abundance of the zzso zzso appears to be regulated differently from the zzso
