zzso zzso is a hallmark of a large and diverse number of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso coli zzso zzso recognize zzso disease proteins and suppress the zzso of toxic protein zzso Type I zzso are very potent at suppressing protein zzso and zzso the zzso of damaged zzso Yet, the molecular mechanism for the recognition of zzso zzso by Type I zzso such as zzso zzso is not zzso Here we zzso identify a unique motif that is selectively recognized by zzso The motif is characterized by the consensus sequence zzso where zzso denotes either X or Y and zzso denotes neither X nor zzso We further verify the zzso of the motif by zzso zzso and show that zzso binding by zzso requires recognition of this zzso A zzso zzso screen revealed that many proteins contain more than one stretch of zzso that contain the motif and are separated by varying numbers of zzso zzso In light of our results, we propose a zzso zzso model and a plausible mechanism of zzso presentation by zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso Based on our results, and given that zzso and its human zzso zzso are functionally zzso we zzso that our results can be extended to understanding human zzso
