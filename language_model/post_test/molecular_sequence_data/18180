By differential zzso zzso we previously selected a class of zzso clones from a zzso zzso zzso library that was constructed from the total zzso zzso of mature zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a clone of this class, zzso with a zzso probe complementary to zzso zzso from zzso collected 1 day after the onset of zzso zzso but not with the zzso probe from zzso at zzso stage II (13 to 15 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso only in zzso at zzso stage III (17 to 19 zzso or later, and its level began to decline when seeds zzso We have suggested that zzso zzso is likely to belong to the class of zzso zzso or the zzso that is formed at the late stage of seed zzso is zzso in zzso seeds and becomes functional at the early stage of zzso We determined the zzso sequence of zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and an approximately 36 zzso zzso zzso and deduced the zzso acid sequence of its product, a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was induced just before zzso began, not only in mature seeds but also in immature seeds even at stages I (9 to 11 zzso and II (13 to 15 zzso if they were placed under conditions suitable for zzso
