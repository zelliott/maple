An zzso binding protein was zzso from bovine liver by means of zzso I zzso zzso and zzso column zzso It consisted of a single zzso chain having an apparent molecular weight of 68,000 with a zzso radius of 35 zzso zzso zzso of rotary zzso specimens showed that the 68 zzso protein is a zzso zzso This protein showed a higher affinity for zzso in the presence of zzso than in its absence, which is opposite to the zzso property shown by zzso zzso or zzso The 68 zzso protein had no zzso severing and capping zzso Interestingly, the 68 zzso protein was found to zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and partial protein sequence data identified the 68 zzso protein as an zzso VI zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the 68 zzso protein was localized along stress fibers as well as membrane ruffles, zzso and focal zzso raising the possibility that zzso VI may contribute to control zzso interaction in the zzso
