Type I zzso zzso systems are large, zzso zzso composed of three different zzso zzso and zzso form a complex in which zzso recognizes the target DNA zzso and zzso carries out zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso when associated with the zzso complex, zzso DNA in an zzso process and zzso zzso DNA at a distance of several thousand zzso from the recognition zzso The molecular mechanism by which these zzso zzso the DNA is not fully zzso in part because of the absence of crystal zzso To date, crystal structures have been determined for the individual zzso and zzso zzso and models have been built for the zzso complex with the zzso However, no structure is available for the zzso zzso In this work, the gene coding for the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso which showed that there was an error in the published zzso This changed the position of the stop zzso and altered the last 17 zzso acid zzso of the protein zzso An improved zzso procedure was developed to enable zzso to be zzso efficiently for zzso and structural zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is zzso in solution, and the zzso ratio of zzso indicates that the zzso is zzso and fairly zzso Small angle zzso of the zzso zzso indicates a radius of zzso of zzso zzso and a maximum dimension of 10 zzso We constructed a model of the zzso using protein zzso and zzso zzso to model individual zzso and zzso zzso scattering data as restraints to combine them into a single zzso The model reveals an zzso shape of the zzso core zzso the zzso and central zzso and suggests zzso zzso of the zzso region implicated in binding of zzso to the zzso zzso
