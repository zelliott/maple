Using developing rat zzso we examined the correlation between the turnover of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso incorporation into zzso changed remarkably with advancing zzso It reached a maximum value on zzso 7, and then decreased gradually until zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso changed in zzso The expression of zzso zzso was also changed zzso showing a peak on zzso 7; whereas zzso protein expression showed a peak on zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso expression is regulated by zzso turnover during the early developing stage of rat zzso
