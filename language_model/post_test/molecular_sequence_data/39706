A zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso are major DNA zzso induced by ultraviolet zzso and zzso zzso an zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso repairs the former specifically by light zzso We investigated resonance zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso having neutral zzso and oxidized forms of zzso which were selectively intensity enhanced by zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso calculations were carried out for the first time on the neutral zzso The marker band of a neutral zzso at zzso zzso in zzso whose frequency is the lowest among various zzso apparently splits into two comparable bands at zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and similarly, that at zzso zzso in zzso does into three bands at zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso This zzso effect was recognized only after being oxidized once and zzso to form a zzso again, but not by simple zzso exchange of zzso Some zzso bands of the oxidized form were observed at significantly low zzso zzso zzso zzso and with band zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso spectral characteristics indicate strong zzso interactions (at zzso zzso a fairly zzso environment, and an zzso feature in zzso ring of the zzso zzso which seems to specifically control the zzso of zzso zzso
