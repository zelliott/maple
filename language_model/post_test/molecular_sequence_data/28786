zzso a protein that functions in zzso zzso zzso as well as in signal zzso has received increasing attention in recent years due to its role as an zzso in various human zzso The primary sequence of the human zzso gene zzso has been known for some time, but that of the rat zzso gene zzso has not zzso been studied in zzso We report here the primary structure of zzso using zzso methods and direct zzso The size of the complete zzso gene was determined to be zzso zzso We found the rat zzso gene to contain 14 zzso ranging in size from 61 to zzso zzso and 13 zzso ranging in size from 76 to zzso zzso The zzso start site appears to be 157 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso located in zzso zzso The resulting transcript is zzso zzso long zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso We found the zzso zzso to consist of 157 zzso and the 3' zzso to be 147 zzso zzso The region coding for the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso is located in zzso 2 of rat zzso in contrast to human zzso in which it is found in zzso zzso Based on the newly acquired knowledge of the primary zzso more than a dozen zzso zzso rat liver tumors were screened for the presence or absence of zzso in all 14 zzso of rat zzso Surprisingly, no zzso were zzso The results are discussed in the context of the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso being highly prevalent in colon tumors, but much less common in liver zzso
