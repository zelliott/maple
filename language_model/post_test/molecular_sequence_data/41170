We have carried out a zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are closely related zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso All three strains are zzso zzso moderately zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analyses showed that the strains constituted a coherent zzso with sequence similarities between zzso and zzso The percentage similarity on the basis of zzso acid sequences deduced from partial zzso gene zzso sequences of these three type strains was zzso zzso trees based on the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso acid zzso obtained by using three different zzso were consistent and showed that these three species constituted a deeply rooted cluster separated from the zzso represented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso supporting their placement in the zzso zzso All three type strains have zzso zzso as the major respiratory zzso and showed similar fatty acid zzso The main polar lipids present in the three type strains were zzso and zzso and the three strains showed zzso type zzso with zzso as the diagnostic zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso among the three strains was zzso indicating that they are members of different species of the zzso zzso The zzso data are consistent with the placement of these three species in a single zzso and support their differentiation at the species zzso On the basis of these data, we have zzso the description of the zzso zzso and propose the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
