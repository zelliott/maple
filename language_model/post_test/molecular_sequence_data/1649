Failure of zzso zzso prophylaxis with zzso drugs is associated with zzso within the putative active site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is involved in the essential zzso of zzso zzso The most frequent zzso are two zzso leading to two zzso acid changes zzso to zzso observed as a single or double zzso in the same zzso zzso zzso In the absence of a culture method for zzso zzso we studied potential resistance to zzso drugs zzso by these zzso by using zzso zzso as a zzso Single or double zzso identical to those observed in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso gene were introduced by in zzso zzso zzso into zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were integrated at the zzso locus in zzso zzso and expressed by functional zzso in a strain with a disrupted zzso zzso The single zzso zzso to zzso zzso resistance to zzso whereas the single zzso zzso to zzso zzso resistance to both zzso and zzso Both single zzso also separately zzso hypersensitivity to zzso and zzso The resistance to zzso is consistent with zzso data on zzso zzso The double zzso zzso to zzso zzso on zzso zzso a requirement for zzso suggesting reduced affinity of zzso for this zzso This characteristic is commonly observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drug resistance from other zzso However, the double zzso zzso hypersensitivity to zzso which is not in agreement with zzso data on zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso drug resistance on this zzso
