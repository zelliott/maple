A woman with a preliminary diagnosis of zzso was later found to have a functional zzso of zzso zzso and markedly prolonged zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso release was normal but there was a gross delay in the zzso of zzso zzso Plasma protein zzso showed an absence of normal zzso and a novel zzso component which was confirmed as zzso by zzso Western blots of zzso zzso gels indicated a molecular weight of zzso zzso compared to 340 zzso for normal zzso and similar analysis of reducing gels showed that the expected 67 zzso A alpha chain was missing and replaced by a 30 zzso zzso This zzso chain was not detected by the zzso zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso formed by zzso zzso of the A alpha zzso zzso sequencing of the DNA zzso the zzso zzso revealed the zzso zzso of zzso at position zzso of the gene zzso zzso this translates as three new zzso acids zzso before termination at a new zzso stop zzso No abnormal A alpha chains could be detected in plasma from the woman's zzso zzso The zzso observed is likely to be the result of diminished assembly and/or zzso of the truncated A alpha chains rather than enhanced zzso zzso
