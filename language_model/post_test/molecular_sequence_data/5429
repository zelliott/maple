zzso a zzso zzso on zzso zzso binds the zzso to zzso and is a major target zzso of immune recognition in acquired resistance to the zzso In past studies, zzso has been zzso by zzso the protein from the zzso cell wall, which yields zzso quantities for biological zzso We report a strategy for generating and zzso the zzso form of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso strain zzso cultured in zzso medium were found to zzso 10 zzso of zzso into a zzso relatively free of other medium and zzso zzso Using a zzso method of zzso exchange and zzso interaction zzso we achieved a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso which revealed that the zzso protein exists in two different zzso In functional zzso zzso zzso also retained its zzso for human zzso and its zzso in binding zzso zzso and stimulating zzso to zzso but it lost some capacity to elicit zzso hypersensitivity in zzso These findings advance our understanding of the zzso zzso and our ability to express and purify zzso in quantity and will permit a study of the relationship between three-dimensional structure and activity of the zzso
