zzso modeling has become an essential tool for studying proteins that are targets for medical drug zzso This paper describes the approach we developed that combines sequence decomposition techniques with distance geometry zzso for zzso modeling to determine functionally important regions of zzso We show here the application of these techniques to targets of medical interest chosen from those included in the zzso zzso Assessment of zzso for zzso zzso zzso competition, including the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso III of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from saliva of the zzso zzso zzso Physical chemical property zzso zzso identified in aligned sequences with our zzso program, can be used to select among different alignments returned by fold recognition zzso They can also be used to suggest functions for hypothetical zzso as we illustrate for target zzso Once a suitable alignment has been made with the template, our modeling suite zzso generates a series of possible zzso The models can then be selected according to their match in areas known to be zzso in protein zzso zzso based on motifs can improve the structural matching of zzso in the active zzso The quality of the local structure of our zzso models near active sites or zzso makes them useful aids for drug and vaccine zzso Further, the zzso motif approach, when combined with a structural zzso can be a potent way to detect areas involved in activity and to suggest function for novel zzso zzso
