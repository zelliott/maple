zzso bone formation is a prolonged process that is carefully regulated and involves sequential expression of growth regulatory factors by zzso as they zzso and ultimately zzso Since this orderly sequence of gene expression by zzso suggests a cascade effect, and zzso is capable of initiating and maintaining this effect, we examined the effects of zzso on expression of other zzso and compared these effects with the expression pattern of bone cell differentiation marker genes in primary cultures of fetal rat zzso zzso zzso To examine the gene expression profile during bone cell differentiation and bone formation, we also examined the effects of zzso on bone formation in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso bone formation on the zzso surface of mice when 500 zzso zzso was injected zzso When zzso was added to primary cultures of zzso zzso it accelerated zzso zzso formation in a time and zzso manner zzso zzso zzso (40 zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso expression during the zzso phase of primary cultures of zzso zzso Enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso expression by zzso was associated with increased expression of bone cell differentiation marker zzso alkaline zzso zzso type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso enhances expression of other zzso genes during bone cell zzso zzso may act in a zzso fashion in concert with other zzso it zzso to stimulate bone cell differentiation and bone formation during zzso
