zzso zzso belongs to a group of four genes involved in the zzso of zzso information at a zzso level in the zzso zzso zzso at any of these four zzso also lead to a variety of other zzso including reduction in the number of stretch zzso zzso zzso zzso in the peripheral nervous system zzso We have cloned zzso with the aid of a zzso zzso inserted into the zzso zzso In the early zzso stage, a putative zzso transcript is expressed in zzso strips corresponding to the domain of activity of the zzso gene on the embryonic fate zzso Later expression of the transcript zzso with regions of the zzso that are disrupted in zzso zzso and includes a cell that may be the precursor for the missing stretch zzso zzso We zzso that zzso acts very early in differentiation pathways to specify the identities of zzso and isolated precursor zzso zzso analysis suggests that this transcript codes for a zzso zzso
