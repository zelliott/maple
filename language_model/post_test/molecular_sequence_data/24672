Human zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso zzso In this work, we report on a comprehensive characterization of gene expression profiles of zzso B zzso zzso through the generation of a large set of zzso expressed sequence tag zzso clusters zzso in total) from zzso and zzso liver samples, which then were applied to a zzso zzso system containing zzso zzso and to comparison with a public zzso The commercial zzso zzso which contains zzso known genes related to zzso was used also for profiling gene zzso Integrated data from the above approaches identified zzso zzso as candidates with differential zzso A number of genes related to zzso and zzso zzso were selected for further zzso reverse zzso analysis in 29 paired zzso liver zzso Many genes involved in cell cycle regulation such as zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle negative regulators were zzso in most patients with zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso for DNA replication also could contribute to the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso levels was noted in a large number of genes implicated in zzso whereas a profile change of others might represent a status of zzso of the zzso zzso both considered as potential markers of diagnostic zzso zzso the altered zzso profiles in zzso could be correlated to a number of zzso regions with amplification or loss of zzso providing one of the underlying causes of the zzso anomaly of zzso
