A zzso zzso containing a zzso analog was developed that was zzso by both zzso and zzso This zzso was used to zzso sense and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso site of human zzso virus type zzso At a DNA concentration of 140 zzso the zzso sense DNA inhibited zzso production by as much as zzso in human peripheral blood zzso infected with zzso zzso This treatment also reduced the number of peripheral blood zzso producing zzso viral zzso by zzso Of interest, no reduction in either zzso was observed for the zzso zzso The results demonstrate the promise of a new zzso delivery vehicle to inhibit human zzso virus replication by an zzso zzso
