Identification of three overlapping clones in a canine zzso zzso zzso library allowed us to determine a detailed restriction zzso map of the primary zzso unit of the pancreatic zzso gene zzso zzso zzso as well as 15 and 6 zzso pairs of zzso and zzso regions, zzso DNA sequence analysis provided the primary structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso sequence including zzso and zzso boxes at positions zzso and zzso respectively, and a class 2 zzso zzso binding sequence at position zzso zzso zzso out of approximately zzso zzso of the zzso unit which is organized into 13 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 encodes the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, the zzso initiation zzso and the zzso portion of the signal zzso and zzso 6, zzso which shows zzso to the active zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of human zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins 1, 2, and 3 with canine pancreatic zzso shows that the central region of highest zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the dog zzso contains four highly zzso zzso which may play a critical role in zzso and zzso binding for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences of 10 zzso from zzso and zzso identifies a zzso consensus sequence surrounding the active zzso which includes the previously identified sequence zzso The zzso nature of this sequence in the 10 zzso contrasts with the zzso nature of the corresponding sequences in zzso zzso and thus defines an active site zzso consensus sequence specific for zzso An analysis of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso sequences in transient expression studies with zzso and zzso cells was unable to reveal zzso promoter or zzso zzso
