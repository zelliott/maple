zzso zzso plaques found in the brains of Alzheimer's diseased patients are composed of the 42 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso which is processed out of the larger zzso precursor protein zzso zzso To study the regulation of the zzso gene zzso we have isolated the promoter region of this angle of this zzso gene and produced a reporter gene system to determine if the promoter is responsive to agents that may cause the overproduction of zzso leading to the abnormal zzso of plaques in zzso zzso The promoter contains sequences zzso to heat shock zzso zzso binding sites, and zzso zzso sequences as well as zzso regions found in other zzso expressed zzso zzso We show here that this promoter is zzso in cultured cells by zzso zzso in a transient zzso system and that the zzso and zzso binding site are required for this zzso zzso This induction of zzso from the zzso promoter implies that this gene is responsive to zzso and/or zzso agents which may be present in the diseased zzso
