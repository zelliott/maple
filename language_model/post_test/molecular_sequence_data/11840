zzso zzso and zzso constitute the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso Via zzso zzso constructed zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins showed a zzso reduction of zzso zzso A zzso double zzso showed a zzso reduction and was zzso for use in soaking experiments with zzso Crystal structures were determined of wild type zzso soaked at elevated pH with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, structures at zzso temperature were solved of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso after soaking with zzso zzso zzso In the zzso soaked in zzso and zzso a zzso zzso is observed to bind in the active zzso zzso 229 is at hydrogen bonding distance from the zzso zzso group of the sugar, which after zzso will contain the new reducing zzso In the zzso double zzso structure, two zzso are observed to replace two zzso at the zzso thus providing structural information on product zzso via binding to the zzso raw starch binding zzso
