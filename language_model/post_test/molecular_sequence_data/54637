zzso zzso protein zzso plays an important role in DNA zzso such as in DNA zzso repair, and zzso and is essential for cell zzso We characterized the zzso DNA zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift analysis zzso Analysis of zzso zzso by gel zzso zzso revealed a stable zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso zzso per zzso depending on salt zzso Using zzso we characterized the zzso of zzso zzso with a series of zzso zzso and the size of the binding site was determined to be 29 zzso 1 zzso Furthermore, zzso results indicated that the zzso zzso of zzso for the first zzso were less than those for the second zzso On the basis of these zzso zzso the zzso binding mode of zzso is expected to be zzso
