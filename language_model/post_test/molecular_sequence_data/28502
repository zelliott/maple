The zzso gene zzso identified as zzso is a frequent target of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso At present, more than 40 distinct zzso have been zzso zzso of which 13 have now also been characterized at the molecular zzso These studies revealed the generation of zzso fusion genes between different zzso of zzso and partner genes zzso either zzso or zzso zzso However, in a number of zzso a zzso the zzso zzso and some cases of the zzso described in this zzso significant zzso could not be identified, raising the question as to what zzso mechanism is implicated in these zzso To investigate this, we have evaluated the zzso regions at zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso and zzso The zzso gene zzso at zzso and the zzso locus at zzso were found to be located close to the respective zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were found to be zzso expressed in the zzso cells, suggesting that expression of zzso and zzso was zzso by the zzso Our results indicate that, besides the generation of fusion zzso deregulation of the expression of zzso could be a zzso zzso mechanism for zzso involving the zzso end of zzso especially for those zzso lacking functionally significant fusion zzso
