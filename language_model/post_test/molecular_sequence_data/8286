An zzso truncated zzso for human zzso zzso zzso was placed under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter in a zzso zzso strain of zzso coli lacking the zzso zzso zzso of gene expression rescued growth in media lacking zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso extracts of bacterial zzso by two zzso zzso The purity of the resulting zzso was judged to be zzso zzso based on zzso with zzso zzso The zzso displays an apparent molecular weight of zzso 40 zzso on zzso and zzso 120 zzso on native zzso zzso suggesting that the native zzso is zzso zzso zzso displayed a specific activity and zzso for zzso that were similar to those for the zzso from bovine and human liver zzso The pH dependence of the activity of the zzso zzso was likewise similar to that of the zzso from human liver and may indicate the involvement of a critical zzso zzso in zzso zzso only eight zzso zzso remain in the truncated version of zzso used zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso is inhibited in a zzso fashion by the zzso zzso agent zzso These results further suggest a potential role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso an experimental drug which has been shown to be a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso inhibited the activity of the zzso zzso zzso with a Ki value similar to that for zzso derived from human liver zzso The zzso zzso thus displays zzso behavior similar to the zzso full-length human liver zzso illustrating that the zzso essential structural features of the zzso as well as the site of zzso zzso are contained within the zzso truncated version of the zzso that was expressed zzso
