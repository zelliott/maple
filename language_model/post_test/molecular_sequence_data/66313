zzso is a novel full-length zzso isolated from developing rice zzso We have examined its zzso properties and expression zzso The protein has dual zzso zzso as it releases both zzso and zzso oxidized products in a zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected at low abundance in immature seeds and newly zzso zzso but accumulate rapidly and zzso in response to wounding or brown zzso zzso attack, reaching a peak 3 h after wounding and 6 h after insect zzso We produced transgenic rice lines carrying either sense or zzso zzso under the control of a cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter, and these rice lines showed altered zzso zzso In all of the zzso lines and more than half of the sense lines the expression levels of zzso the levels of zzso activity, and the levels of the zzso zzso products zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso at 6, 48, and 48 h after zzso feeding respectively, were below the levels found in zzso control plants; yet, the levels in the remaining sense zzso were enhanced relative to zzso zzso with a lower level of zzso expression were less able to tolerate zzso attack, while those with enhanced zzso expression were more zzso Our data suggest that the zzso product is involved in tolerance of the rice plant to wounding and zzso zzso
