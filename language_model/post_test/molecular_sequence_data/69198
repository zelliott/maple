In this paper, we report the expression of zzso alpha in the polarized cell line zzso zzso zzso canine zzso In these cells, the zzso was zzso in an inactive zzso which upon treatment with zzso was zzso The zzso isolated from cell extracts was zzso and appeared to be retained in the zzso as a zzso No zzso alpha was zzso on the surface of intact cells by zzso However, a complex zzso soluble but inactive form was present in the culture zzso suggesting that zzso removal of the zzso membrane zzso zzso leads to the zzso of zzso zzso
