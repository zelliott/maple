The zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso with other positive and negative regulatory factors through a zzso region called the zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso with a normal zzso domain as a zzso competitor in gel mobility shift zzso in conjunction with various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids were identified in the zzso domain that contribute to zzso specificity with zzso The zzso detected subtle differences in zzso activity among the zzso zzso proteins that correlated with their ability to activate zzso in zzso but this correlation was not apparent in the absence of zzso The identification of such zzso zzso enabled us to predict the differences in zzso affinity among the four zzso zzso factors with zzso The experiments confirmed the zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso analog of zzso was designed by a single substitution at one of these zzso zzso These experimental results were strengthened when they were analyzed in terms of the crystal structure for the Max zzso domain zzso This analysis has allowed us to identify those zzso that form charged zzso pairs between the two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and determine the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso
