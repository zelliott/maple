zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso involved in skeletal and zzso development, belong to the same family of DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso contain two separated clusters of zinc fingers, one zzso and one zzso These clusters show high sequence zzso and are highly zzso between zzso and zzso Each zinc finger cluster binds independently to a zzso zzso However, zzso binding sites for full-length zzso and zzso in the promoter regions of candidate target genes like zzso zzso and human zzso and zzso are zzso elements composed of one zzso and one zzso zzso the orientation and spacing of which can zzso Using transgenic zzso zzso we demonstrate that the integrity of these two sequences is necessary for correct spatial expression of a zzso zzso reporter zzso Both zinc finger clusters must be intact for the zzso binding of zzso to DNA and for its optimal zzso zzso Our results show that zzso binds as zzso and contacts one target sequence with the first zinc finger zzso and the other with the second zzso Our work zzso the optimal binding site and, consequently, candidate target genes for zzso members of the zzso zzso
