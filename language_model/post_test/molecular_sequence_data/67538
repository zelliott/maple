zzso 6 zzso is a protein zzso by T cells and zzso and plays an important role in immune zzso zzso regulates the proliferation and differentiation of T cells, and elicits zzso production in B zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso sequence of the orange spotted grouper zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso zzso protein comprised 223 zzso zzso the sequence shared approximately zzso similarity with zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso similarity with other available zzso zzso The protein comprises the signal zzso the zzso family signature, and zzso zzso acid zzso found in zzso sequences of other zzso In order to understand the zzso and influence of zzso on zzso immune response, zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was injected into orange spotted zzso and the zzso gene expression at various times in various zzso was zzso Our results revealed that the zzso specific zzso factor zzso was zzso and zzso specific zzso factors zzso and zzso were zzso in immune zzso following zzso zzso Additionally, higher levels of zzso zzso and translated protein were detected in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso in groupers regulates the differentiation of zzso T helper cells into zzso cells and elicits the production of zzso
