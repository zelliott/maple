Fidelity of zzso segregation relies on coordination of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Central to this is the zzso scaffold zzso that zzso the functions of various zzso regulators including zzso and zzso We show that zzso contains an extensive array of short linear sequence zzso that zzso zzso and zzso motifs and that can independently zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with few zzso recruit low levels of zzso to zzso but support a robust zzso zzso numbers of zzso zzso increase zzso zzso levels and progressively enhance efficiency of zzso zzso zzso normal zzso function is maintained by replacing all zzso with a short array of naturally occurring or zzso artificially designed zzso A minimal array of generic zzso recruitment zzso in zzso thus zzso for accurate zzso zzso zzso divergence in the amount and sequence of these zzso in zzso zzso may represent flexibility in adapting regulation of zzso processes to altered requirements for zzso segregation during zzso
