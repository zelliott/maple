We have investigated the conditions required for polar zzso of the zzso zzso by using a zzso fluorescent protein fusion protein that, when expressed from a single gene in the zzso restored zzso to a zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells but not in cells with zzso zzso or all zzso genes except zzso zzso zzso making only zzso zzso or zzso lacking the zzso domain also retained normal zzso whereas cells producing only zzso or zzso missing the zzso and zzso zzso did zzso We conclude that zzso zzso requires the truncated zzso portion of the zzso domain present in zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso 83 through 120 of zzso also abolished zzso Two of these zzso do not disrupt zzso indicating that they specifically prevent interaction with zzso while leaving other activities of zzso zzso
