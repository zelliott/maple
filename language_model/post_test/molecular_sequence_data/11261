zzso zzso are characteristic lipids of plant zzso The zzso of these lipids is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso Plant zzso 105 zzso zzso has been used for the cloning of a corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences derived from the zzso zzso of the zzso protein and from peptides of a zzso zzso were used to construct zzso zzso for zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso libraries with amplified labeled DNA fragments resulted in the isolation of zzso zzso zzso with insert lengths of zzso zzso zzso for both zzso These zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso with molecular masses of 66 zzso and 69 zzso zzso The first zzso acid of the zzso zzso protein zzso to the zzso acid 133 of the deduced zzso The absence of these zzso zzso acids reduces the molecular mass to 52 zzso which is similar to the apparent molecular mass of 56 zzso determined for the zzso zzso Different fragments of these zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of the transformed cells exhibited zzso zzso zzso
