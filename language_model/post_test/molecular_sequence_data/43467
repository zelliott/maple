zzso of the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso resulting in a greatly increased requirement for the zzso and the inability to grow on low pH zzso zzso for zzso that restored growth of zzso zzso cells on low pH zzso medium led to the isolation of a dominant zzso that also partially suppressed the increased zzso requirement of these zzso zzso analysis revealed the zzso to be an zzso of zzso that encodes a zzso for zzso chain zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso converts a zzso zzso highly zzso among the zzso acid zzso zzso to a zzso zzso in a region predicted to lie within the sixth zzso zzso Generation of the analogous zzso in the zzso zzso produced an zzso zzso that similarly suppressed the low pH sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso was correlated with increased zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso acids enhanced but was not essential for suppression of zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso The zzso site altered by the zzso zzso appears to be zzso zzso zzso cells show an increased requirement for zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso
