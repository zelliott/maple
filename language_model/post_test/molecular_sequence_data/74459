The prevalence and potential zzso transmission of group C zzso zzso were examined by testing zzso samples collected from children during a zzso study that was carried out in the outskirts of zzso Brazil, from December 1982 to March zzso The study involved a group of 30 children who were followed from birth to 3 zzso Of the 77 samples tested from 29 children, 5 zzso were positive for human and 3 zzso for zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso with zzso specific for zzso gene of human or zzso zzso and by Southern zzso using a probe specific for zzso gene of both human and zzso zzso In addition, a total of 59 zzso specimens from the 30th child were tested, 1 zzso and 14 zzso were positive for human and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso gene demonstrated that the six human strains detected in Brazil were zzso with other human zzso and 14 of the 17 zzso zzso strains examined showed a complete zzso among themselves but differed slightly from the zzso zzso strain, suggesting that a single zzso zzso strain was circulating in zzso This study is the first to provide evidence for transmission of zzso from zzso to zzso They also indicate that both human and zzso zzso were endemic in zzso
