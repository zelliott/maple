zzso which has three zzso is a type II zzso protein zzso zzso from the mature seeds of zzso tree zzso zzso In a previous study, an incomplete zzso that zzso the A- and zzso of zzso but lacked signal zzso sequence was zzso In the present paper, its full-length zzso was obtained by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of its zzso DNA was zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso products revealed three zzso genes with zzso sequence zzso One of them corresponded to the published zzso and was designated as zzso I, whereas the other two genes were named as zzso II and zzso III, zzso zzso amplification of the zzso of zzso II and III zzso that these two genes were zzso The three genes have no zzso Three zzso precursors that were zzso from the zzso sequence of three zzso genes exhibited relatively high sequence zzso with other type II zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso genes only expressed in zzso of zzso zzso seeds and the zzso of expression emerged at zzso zzso when seeds were close to zzso It is proposed that the three zzso genes may zzso three zzso of zzso The zzso function of zzso in zzso zzso seeds is briefly zzso
