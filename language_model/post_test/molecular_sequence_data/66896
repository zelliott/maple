Gene zzso is an important mechanism for the generation of evolutionary zzso zzso genes that are not silenced may evolve new functions zzso that will alter the zzso outcome of zzso genetic zzso partition ancestral functions zzso into divergent zzso zzso or function zzso zzso divergence can occur by changes in the zzso patterns of gene expression and/or by changes in the activities of their protein zzso We reconstructed the evolutionary history of two zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso and determined the evolution of sequence and gene expression in grass zzso zzso zzso zzso genes duplicated at the base of zzso and zzso zzso occurred under relaxed selection mostly along the branch leading to zzso Following the duplication, zzso was apparently lost from early zzso zzso a pattern consistent with major changes in grass floral zzso Overlapping gene expression patterns in leaves and zzso indicate that zzso and zzso probably share some redundant functions, but that zzso may have become temporally restricted under partial zzso to particular stages of zzso zzso These data have allowed us to reconstruct the history of zzso genes in zzso and to zzso a role for this gene zzso in the evolution of the grass zzso
