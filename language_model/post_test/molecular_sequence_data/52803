To test the hypothesis that the prevalence of zzso is increased in critically ill patients and zzso with disease severity and mortality in these zzso 

A prospective zzso 

Three medical intensive care units at the University of zzso Medical School serving both medical and surgical zzso 

All consecutive admissions zzso zzso zzso during a period of 4 zzso A total of 112 zzso and zzso healthy individuals constituted the control zzso 

zzso 

Blood samples were drawn within 24 zzso after admission for analysis of total homocysteine zzso zzso vitamin B6 levels, and vitamin B12 levels as well as to identify the zzso zzso in the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso Acute zzso and zzso Health zzso III scores at admission and 24 zzso after admission as well as 30-day survival were documented in all zzso zzso was more prevalent in critically ill patients zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso compared with zzso and zzso healthy individuals zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso plasma zzso in the first 24 zzso after admission to an intensive care unit between survivors and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso had no influence on zzso levels and survival of intensive care unit zzso 

The prevalence of zzso is increased in critically ill patients compared to zzso and zzso healthy zzso The clinical significance of this finding remains to be zzso
