The zzso negative zzso a natural zzso zzso zzso of zzso with aborted zzso expression is known to cause chronic zzso The zzso C : G zzso in the lower stem of zzso due to zzso substitution is reportedly compensated by a second zzso zzso and suggested to play an important role in enhanced selection of the zzso negative zzso We undertook to investigate presence of such zzso zzso at other positions by analyzing zzso zzso zzso as well as to look for their zzso if any, on the consensus sequence of the overlapping zzso of zzso negative zzso zzso in zzso zzso Three of the 5 zzso negative patients had classical zzso zzso having a second zzso zzso at zzso zzso One patient showed an additional zzso zzso presenting as a novel zzso stop zzso zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso at position zzso In the third patient, a zzso substitution was seen which compensated the impaired U at position zzso Other substitution and deletion zzso were also observed in the remaining zzso which however, did not produce any zzso zzso Further, all the zzso zzso showed a zzso G at position zzso important for the optimal context of their zzso which however, remained impaired with A zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the lower zzso and restoration of authentic zzso zzso maintain the structural integrity and stability of the zzso This may have a role in the enhanced selection of the zzso negative zzso and persistence of zzso infection in chronic liver disease zzso
