The zzso zzso a group that includes zzso zzso and zzso have a number of potential zzso applications, including cell specific drug delivery and as zzso for the formation of novel zzso Despite extensive sequence identity between their coat protein zzso and an almost identical three-dimensional fold, zzso and zzso zzso have dramatically different zzso zzso The increased stability of zzso has been correlated with the zzso zzso bonds present in that zzso and not present in zzso We have tested this hypothesis directly using mass zzso Analysis of the zzso coat protein zzso suggests that zzso zzso are formed at the zzso zzso but may not be at the zzso zzso This conclusion has been tested by engineering zzso zzso into either the zzso or zzso positions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso with stability properties similar to those of zzso zzso zzso results in a zzso unable to assemble T zzso 3 shells, zzso that zzso structures are on zzso to zzso assembly in these zzso The results demonstrate how it is possible to redesign the physical properties of zzso shells and may be of general relevance to future applications of viruses and zzso zzso
