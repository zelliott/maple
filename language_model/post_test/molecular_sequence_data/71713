zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso recently identified in extracts of zzso is actively zzso from vascular smooth muscle cells zzso AM production in rat zzso is zzso zzso by zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and many zzso substances have also been shown to alter AM zzso To study AM promoter function, we cloned the zzso region of the rat AM zzso and AM promoter function was assessed in rat zzso zzso zzso with a construct containing the cloned zzso This zzso zzso AM promoter region includes a number of putative zzso control zzso The promoter activity in zzso was zzso by zzso alpha and zzso and was suppressed by zzso and zzso These data indicate that zzso regulation is an important mechanism for AM production in zzso
