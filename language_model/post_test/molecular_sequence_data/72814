For bacterial expression of rat zzso zzso the zzso was amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using rat liver zzso and zzso zzso designed according to the published zzso acid sequence zzso Surprisingly, the zzso acid sequence deduced from zzso differed at positions 55 (N for zzso 63 (K for zzso 67 zzso for zzso 68 zzso for zzso and 69 zzso for zzso from the published zzso The overall zzso acid zzso however, was unchanged because these 5 zzso acids were located at different positions compared to the published zzso As a consequence, the proposed zzso site was zzso suggesting zzso of the mature zzso zzso rat zzso with a 6 zzso tag at the zzso was expressed in bacteria, zzso and zzso The zzso was as potent as zzso human zzso in zzso zzso zzso release from human zzso
