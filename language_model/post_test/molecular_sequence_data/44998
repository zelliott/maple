Most protein sequence alignment zzso give similar results on closely related zzso while manual intervention may be needed for zzso related zzso To correct the zzso it is often necessary to repeat calculations on selected parts of the alignments and edit the alignment zzso Software implementing such interactive alignment procedures is of zzso 

This paper presents a new zzso Windows application called zzso for both automatic and manual protein sequence zzso The program reads main sequence formats and has a zzso zzso zzso performs automatic zzso zzso zzso alignment zzso and editing, and it allows sequences to be aligned zzso leaving previously aligned regions zzso Manual alignment and sequence analysis are facilitated by zzso schemes reflecting zzso acid similarity of zzso and zzso zzso The interactive alignment of a zzso set of reverse zzso has located four out of six known zzso zzso 

zzso is available on request from the zzso zzso is available from zzso zzso or zzso zzso
