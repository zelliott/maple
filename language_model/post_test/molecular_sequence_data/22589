zzso and their receptors play important roles in numerous zzso and pathological zzso To develop natural zzso into zzso zzso and zzso of pathological zzso the lack of zzso selectivity must be zzso Here, we apply chemical synthesis and the concept of modular modifications to generate zzso zzso and zzso modified zzso that have high zzso selectivity and zzso and reduced zzso A proof of the concept was shown by transforming the zzso viral zzso inflammatory zzso into new zzso with enhanced selectivity and potency for zzso or zzso two principal zzso for human zzso virus zzso zzso These new zzso provided insights into zzso binding and signaling mechanisms and acted as potent zzso zzso These results support the concept of zzso for studying and controlling the function of other zzso zzso
