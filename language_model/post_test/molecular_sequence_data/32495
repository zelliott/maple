In this study, attempts have been made to identify and characterize water buffalo zzso zzso zzso derived growth inhibitor zzso zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library of zzso zzso The complete zzso zzso was of zzso zzso consisting 61 zzso in zzso zzso coding region of 402 zzso and 235 zzso representing the 3' zzso zzso of zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence data with that of zzso acid binding protein zzso of other species shows three buffalo specific zzso changes while seven zzso changes were common to cattle and zzso Buffalo and cattle zzso had zzso zzso acid sequence zzso which also shared three zzso acid zzso 34 zzso 109 zzso and 132 zzso as compared to other zzso zzso with zzso reported from other cattle zzso revealed highest zzso acid sequence similarity with zzso zzso and least with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed cattle zzso to be closest to zzso while mouse zzso was zzso placed, whereas different tissue derived zzso of cattle showed zzso closest and zzso most zzso placed from buffalo zzso This report also differs from the earlier findings that zzso is intermediate of zzso and zzso
