zzso in zzso is based on a cascade of zzso gene interactions initiated by zzso deposited zzso that define the zzso restricted zzso of gap gene expression at zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although zzso of the embryonic head is zzso zzso the repeated patterns of expression of the segment polarity genes reflect the formation of seven head zzso two of these depend on the zzso and zzso genes used in the zzso whereas the others form as a result of the activity of the zzso genes zzso zzso empty zzso zzso and zzso zzso The genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they may function as zzso zzso They are expressed in overlapping stripes in the early embryonic head of zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in overlapping zzso in the anterior central nervous system of the mouse zzso We show here that zzso is expressed in a stripe covering the head zzso of the segments affected in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso encodes a zzso zzso factor with sequence and functional similarity to the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso When expressed in the spatial pattern of zzso a zzso providing zzso activity can support development of the zzso segment in the head of zzso zzso zzso A ubiquitous zzso factor from humans can therefore replace an essential component of the genetic zzso required to specify the development of a particular head segment in the zzso
