The zzso protein zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso and zzso actions of zzso zzso As an extension of our structural characterization of the zzso organization of the mouse zzso zzso we now have isolated and characterized the mouse zzso promoter region required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using reporter zzso possessing various zzso fragments of the zzso zzso led to the identification of a functional zzso zzso A single zzso response element zzso was present in a minimal zzso zzso promoter identified by deletion zzso the zzso zzso differed from previously described zzso elements in that the zzso was a zzso instead of a zzso The sequence immediately upstream of the zzso possessed the zzso zzso element that was exactly zzso in sequence and position between the mouse and human zzso zzso A single gamma zzso sequence zzso element and multiple recognition sites for factors including zzso and zzso involved in responses to various zzso and hormone signals in inflammatory responses were also present in the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed efficient zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso in L zzso
