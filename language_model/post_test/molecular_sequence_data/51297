We have previously demonstrated that the human zzso zzso zzso of approximately 90 zzso contains zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we report our identification of the site of attachment of the zzso zzso in the zzso A 70 zzso zzso from the external domain of the zzso was generated by zzso treatment of the zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso The zzso of the intact zzso but not the 70 zzso fragment, released zzso indicating that the 70 zzso zzso lacks zzso zzso In the remaining 20 zzso zzso there are three potential sites zzso zzso and zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso To identify which of these zzso are zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso were directly treated with mild base to effect zzso and the zzso zzso acids and their derivatives were zzso zzso zzso of the total zzso zzso but no zzso zzso was converted to expected zzso products by this zzso These and other results demonstrate that only one zzso zzso is present in the zzso and that it occurs on either zzso or zzso From human serum we zzso the zzso soluble form of the zzso zzso which contains zzso but lacks zzso The zzso was sensitive to zzso and bound to zzso zzso indicating that the zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
