zzso is involved in metabolism of nearly zzso of clinically used zzso zzso region zzso zzso and zzso contribute to zzso zzso in drug dosage and clinical zzso whereas the role of a regulatory zzso remains zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in 87 human liver samples, combined with zzso sequencing, and reporter gene zzso we identified a promoter variable number tandem repeat zzso zzso that fully accounted for zzso zzso zzso expression zzso Present in three different zzso forms zzso zzso medium zzso and long zzso only the zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso level compared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is in linkage zzso with zzso with linkage zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in different zzso In patients who were taking a maintenance dose of zzso the mean zzso dose was associated with the copies of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso models that included the zzso zzso was no longer a significant predictor of the zzso dose zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that although zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso the in zzso effects of zzso on zzso metabolism cannot be separated from the effects of zzso zzso it is not necessary to consider zzso as an additional zzso for zzso zzso zzso clinical studies are needed to define whether the zzso has a minimal effect in zzso or whether the effect attributed to zzso is really a combination of effects on expression by the zzso along with effects on zzso activity from the zzso zzso zzso
