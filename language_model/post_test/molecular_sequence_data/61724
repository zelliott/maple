We have recently developed a zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso from the human zzso gene and drives a significantly higher level of gene expression than other well known zzso leukemia zzso zzso However, one downside of this zzso is that viral zzso significantly varies depending on the packaging lines zzso zzso from Northern zzso analysis indicated that in certain cell lines the zzso transcript containing the packaging signal sequence was too efficiently spliced to the zzso zzso resulting in low levels of zzso zzso and thus leading to a low viral zzso We tested the possibility of overcoming this problem by introducing zzso around the zzso zzso sequence in such a way that a delicate balance was maintained between the zzso efficiency (which determines the level of gene zzso and the amount of zzso transcript (which influences viral zzso After zzso analysis, one such zzso was found to meet this zzso The newly constructed zzso containing the engineered zzso zzso could indeed drive higher levels of expression in many therapeutic genes than other control zzso without significantly compromising viral zzso
