C2 zzso are widespread zzso zzso The active zone protein zzso (also known as zzso contains an unusual zzso domain that exhibits a low affinity for zzso a zzso zzso change and zzso zzso We show here that removal of a zzso sequence by alternative zzso increases the zzso zzso zzso the zzso change and abrogates zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso long zzso provides a structural basis for these different properties of the two zzso forms, showing that the zzso sequence forms a zzso otherwise occupied by a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the long zzso zzso domain requires a marked zzso of secondary structure that cannot occur for the short zzso These results reveal a novel mechanism of action of C2 zzso and uncover a structural principle that may zzso the zzso of protein function by short alternatively spliced zzso
