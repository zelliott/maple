In an attempt to produce zzso specific zzso which could distinguish two closely associated zzso zzso zzso we zzso 20 rabbits with synthetic peptides representing sequences from the first domain of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso differing only by one zzso acid in position zzso Several of the zzso in zzso specifically recognized either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso as previously zzso The fine specificity of the zzso was tested in zzso using synthetic peptides of varying length as solid phase zzso Two out of the 20 zzso specifically recognized zzso beta peptides and two zzso bound only to zzso beta peptides from the region containing the zzso acid in position zzso To analyze whether the zzso bound to native zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried zzso Seven of the 20 zzso bound to intact zzso zzso and one zzso bound zzso to zzso positive zzso
