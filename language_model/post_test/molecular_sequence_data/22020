A major zzso cluster was detected in the strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cluster consisted of 11 genes arranged within a 10 zzso region in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso position of zzso zzso was the same in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a cluster with zzso zzso the closest zzso of zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso and two species of the zzso zzso belonging to the zzso Two zzso zzso known to occur in the zzso clusters of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were found upstream of the zzso gene of zzso zzso The organization of the zzso zzso and the zzso of individual and zzso gene products showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso genes upstream of the zzso gene was an intermediate between the zzso zzso with zzso downstream of zzso zzso II and III of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso position of zzso zzso zzso may reflect an evolutionary stage of a divergence of the two zzso groups, with group I consisting of the zzso zzso and group II consisting of strictly zzso zzso
