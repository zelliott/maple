A procedure for amplifying and detecting zzso acid sequences in zzso using cells in suspension and flow zzso has been zzso The process involves the use of the zzso chain reaction zzso and a fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso protocol developed in our laboratory to detect the amplified zzso zzso For these studies, a zzso specific repeat DNA sequence was zzso zzso cells, a zzso zzso culture line established from a male, was used as a positive control and zzso a zzso leukemia culture line established from a female, was used as a negative zzso During the in zzso zzso process cellular zzso zzso increases causing markedly reduced detection sensitivity of the probe zzso bound to the amplified product within the positive zzso An zzso reduction circuit was applied which was integrated into as standard bench top flow zzso to reduce this noise, thereby producing a zzso increase in detection sensitivity of the zzso Without the application of the zzso reduction circuit, the positive control zzso distribution was virtually indistinguishable from the negative control sample zzso After zzso reduction, the data showed that the zzso DNA was only amplified in the zzso cells subjected to the complete in zzso zzso zzso This increased sensitivity also provided direct detection of the zzso repeat zzso albeit exhibiting less signal compared to the amplified target after the in zzso zzso
