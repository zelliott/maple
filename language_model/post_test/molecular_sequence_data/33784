While adult zzso zzso zzso possess zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a number of zzso they are most heavily concentrated within the zzso zzso has a diffuse expression pattern within zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso proteins form a network similar to the arrangement seen in zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso expression appeared to be limited to the pillar cells lining the blood spaces of the zzso while zzso was localized to the outer layer of both the zzso and the filament, upon the pavement zzso Exposure to high external zzso zzso or zzso increased tissue levels of zzso and zzso respectively, in adult and juvenile zzso however, the responses to these zzso were age zzso zzso increased zzso levels for a number of zzso proteins in zzso and larvae but did not elicit similar effects in adult zzso which appear to compensate for the zzso zzso zzso zzso by increasing expression of zzso zzso zzso exposure increased zzso zzso levels in zzso and larvae but was without effect in adult zzso zzso Surprisingly, in both adults and zzso zzso increased the zzso expression of zzso and zzso increased the zzso expression of zzso zzso These results imply that, in zzso there may be a tighter link between zzso and zzso zzso than is thought to occur in most zzso
