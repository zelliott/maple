zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that is an important opportunistic pathogen in zzso To provide additional tools for molecular genetic analysis, we have developed a set of zzso for DNA transformation in zzso based on selection with the zzso zzso zzso These new zzso rely on the zzso sequences from the zzso genes zzso zzso or zzso to drive expression of the zzso zzso gene zzso resistance to the DNA zzso drug Ph zzso Treatment of zzso zzso was used to select stable zzso zzso by plaque formation on host cell zzso zzso of linear or circular forms of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso resulted in stable transformation with an efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso copies of zzso that were integrated at zzso sites in the zzso nuclear zzso zzso provides a new dominant zzso marker for safe, efficient and rapid isolation of stable DNA zzso in zzso
