zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors depends on a zzso type I zzso binding motif in zzso zzso protein 97 zzso is the only zzso domain protein known to associate with zzso We have used zzso zzso and a zzso zzso binding zzso to characterize the interaction between synthetic zzso zzso peptides and the zzso domain of zzso zzso previously determined to be the dominant factor responsible for the zzso The binding mode appeared to be strongly influenced by zzso zzso Chemical shift changes observed in zzso zzso indicate that under reducing conditions, the last four zzso of zzso peptides bind to zzso in a fashion typical of class I zzso zzso The binding is weak and relatively zzso as it occurs similarly with a zzso domain derived from zzso a related protein not believed to directly interact with zzso In the absence of reducing agents, zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso gave rise to an anomalous behavior in a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso complex between zzso and the zzso zzso was seen in the binding zzso and in the zzso experiments performed under zzso zzso The results are consistent with a zzso binding mechanism consisting of an initial zzso interaction followed by stabilization of the complex by a zzso zzso The possible zzso relevance of zzso regulation of zzso interaction remains to be zzso
