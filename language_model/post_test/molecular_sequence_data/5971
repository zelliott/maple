zzso zzso zzso have recently been identified in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and familial zzso In the present study, we evaluated the frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a large series of autonomously functioning zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso solitary zzso zzso zzso and 7 toxic zzso zzso were zzso zzso DNA was extracted from zzso tissue zzso from which DNA fragments zzso the zzso hot spots of the zzso (the third zzso loop and the sixth zzso zzso were amplified by zzso chain zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, only one zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a migration zzso In sequence analysis, an unusual zzso of alternate zzso deletions at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso resulting in one zzso acid deletion zzso at zzso and one conservative zzso acid substitution zzso to zzso at zzso was identified in tumor DNA but not in zzso DNA of zzso zzso Further, the normal sequence in these regions was confirmed in 10 randomly selected samples with normal zzso patterns in zzso zzso The functional property of the zzso with delta 619 and zzso zzso zzso delta zzso was then evaluated with in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso however, there were no significant differences in zzso binding zzso and zzso and zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso between the zzso delta 619 and the zzso In conclusion, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso appears to be low in zzso The zzso potential of a novel zzso zzso zzso delta 619 identified in a zzso zzso in this study is at present uncertain because of its intact zzso
