zzso becomes unstable under zzso stress and is able to adopt a wide range of alternative zzso including zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso structural transitions are important for the regulation of biological processes such as DNA replication and zzso To directly probe the effect of sequence on structural transitions driven by torque, we have measured the zzso response of a panel of DNA sequences using single zzso zzso that employ zzso zzso zzso to achieve high zzso zzso The responses of zzso zzso sequences match our predictions based on a theoretical treatment of cooperative transitions in zzso zzso zzso templates containing zzso zzso mismatch regions show cooperative structural transitions similar to zzso although less zzso is required to disrupt zzso zzso Our mechanical zzso including direct characterization of the zzso rigidity of zzso DNA, establish a framework for quantitative predictions of the complex zzso response of arbitrary sequences in their biological zzso
