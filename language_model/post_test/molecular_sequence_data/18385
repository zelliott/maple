The zzso zzso gene zzso is the most zzso member of the zzso complex on zzso 15 isolated to zzso Conceptual translation of the longest zzso gives a protein of 260 zzso acids lacking the zzso zzso found in most zzso zzso Northern analysis detects three transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in day 9 to 15 zzso zzso As early as day zzso zzso transcripts can be detected in the zzso part of the zzso by in zzso zzso At this zzso stage no or only very weak expression is visible in the neural zzso At day zzso zzso is detected in the zzso part of the neural tube with a sharp anterior boundary at the level of the third zzso zzso This anterior boundary remains at day zzso and day zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is not expressed in the zzso horns containing the sensory zzso at day zzso zzso zzso transcripts are also detected in the zzso zzso the zzso buds and the zzso of the developing zzso Unlike zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show zzso different anterior boundaries of expression in the zzso and zzso
