zzso zzso zzso is regulated by feedback control providing a mechanism for zzso zzso in zzso However, regulatory elements involved in the feedback control are not zzso In this report, we show that a rice zzso zzso zzso zzso gene had a similar expression pattern as key rice zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic rice resulted in a zzso zzso that could be fully rescued by applied zzso zzso of the zzso zzso content revealed increases of zzso and decreases of zzso levels in the zzso plants, in which the transcripts of the zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic plants induced expression of zzso The repression of zzso could be obtained upon treatment by zzso of transgenic plants expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso bound to a zzso element within the zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and signaling zzso and could be either zzso induced by zzso or zzso by a zzso zzso Finally, either zzso or zzso of zzso impaired zzso repression of zzso These data together suggest that zzso is involved in the feedback regulation of zzso zzso in zzso
