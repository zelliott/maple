Human zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso adult T cell zzso zzso and a chronic neurological disease named either tropical zzso zzso zzso or zzso associated zzso zzso We report here the establishment and characterization of eight zzso zzso cell lines derived either from patients with zzso zzso or from zzso carriers zzso Southern zzso analysis of T cell beta chain gene zzso indicates that all cell lines are composed of zzso zzso The same type of analysis performed with zzso zzso showed that they harbor 1 to 5 copies of full length zzso often associated with deleted zzso with a restriction map for zzso zzso zzso and zzso restriction zzso resembling those of zzso previously isolated from Japan and Caribbean zzso One of the cell lines, zzso derived from a zzso patient was shown to express a relative large amount of virus easily zzso to fresh peripheral and zzso blood zzso The full length zzso zzso contained in this cell line was cloned and used in transient expression zzso We showed that the cloned zzso was able to direct the synthesis of the major structural viral zzso the zzso and the tax and zzso regulatory zzso The structural viral proteins could be assembled into free particles detected in the culture medium of zzso zzso Although the zzso of these viral particles remains to be determined, this new clone can be employed to examine the cell types in which this zzso zzso directs viral protein synthesis and eventually zzso It should also prove of value in studies on the early cellular events induced by viral zzso
