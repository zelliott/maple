zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant skin disorder characterized by zzso cell separation zzso of the zzso Previous genetic linkage studies localized the gene to a 5 zzso zzso on human zzso zzso After reducing the disease critical region to zzso zzso we used a zzso cloning strategy to identify the gene zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso encodes a new class of zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso for the rat zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is related to the zzso calcium zzso zzso and plasma membrane calcium zzso zzso families of zzso The predicted protein has the same apparent zzso organization and contains all of the zzso zzso present in other zzso zzso zzso produces two alternative zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso predicted proteins of 903 and zzso zzso zzso We identified 13 different zzso including nonsense, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates that defects in zzso cause zzso and together with the recent identification of zzso as the defective gene in zzso disease, provide further evidence of the critical role of zzso in maintaining zzso zzso
