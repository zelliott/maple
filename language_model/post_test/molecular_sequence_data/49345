A regulatory zzso zzso involved in zzso formation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified and characterized in zzso Based on the zzso of cells expressing the zzso gene in extra copy and on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso it was concluded that zzso activates zzso production and zzso zzso expression under zzso zzso This is in contrast to the function of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso which acts as a zzso under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Bauer, zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene increases zzso in response to a decrease in oxygen tension, suggesting that the zzso protein is active under conditions of low or no zzso However, no discernible zzso of a zzso zzso zzso was observed under zzso conditions tested thus zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso mediates repression of zzso gene expression under zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso from several zzso zzso bacteria revealed a putative zzso zzso It is suggested that zzso binds a zzso zzso and the availability or structure of this zzso affects zzso zzso
