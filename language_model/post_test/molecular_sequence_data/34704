The zzso zzso is a zzso protein complex that plays an important role in zzso protein degradation from zzso to zzso This complex is made up of two copies each of seven different alpha zzso and seven different beta zzso zzso arranged into four stacked rings zzso Although the zzso zzso structure is zzso the zzso composition of the zzso protein complex varies during the evolution, and the number of zzso increases from zzso to zzso To fully characterize the zzso zzso zzso composition and understand the zzso functions, we, the authors of this chapter, have developed and employed various mass zzso zzso approaches to generate a comprehensive profile of the zzso zzso from rat liver and zzso zzso We have identified 7 alpha and 10 beta zzso including 7 essential and 3 zzso beta zzso from rat zzso zzso complex using two-dimensional zzso gel zzso and tandem zzso zzso In addition, multiple zzso of most of the zzso were zzso indicating the composition of rat zzso zzso complex was much more complicated than zzso Further analysis of the intact protein molecular weight of each zzso using zzso confirmed the zzso population of the zzso zzso and revealed that many of the experimental measured molecular weights do not zzso well with the theoretical values deduced from the sequences in protein zzso This finding is mostly due to the sequence errors in the protein databases and possible zzso zzso Although the protein sequences of rat zzso zzso are present in the databases, the sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso were not available at the time when the analysis was carried zzso To determine the zzso composition of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso we developed a zzso database searching tool to identify unknown proteins based on the novel sequences determined by de zzso sequencing using zzso As a result, 14 zzso (7 alpha and 7 zzso were identified on the zzso zzso which was later confirmed by the full-length zzso Using the same approach, we also identified and characterized an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso into a zzso ring, which can bind and activate the zzso zzso from zzso zzso as well as zzso Compared to the human zzso complex, zzso may be the zzso zzso protein involved in zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso strategy developed here for identification of the known and unknown protein complexes can be generalized for the study of other protein zzso
