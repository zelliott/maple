zzso binding experiments using zzso and zzso techniques have been performed throughout a wide concentration range (1 zzso to 30 zzso of the dye zzso zzso and several zzso The most stable complexes found with calf zzso DNA, zzso zzso and zzso all have zzso zzso in the range zzso X zzso zzso Such complexes on calf zzso DNA occur with a frequency of about 1 binding site per 100 base pairs, and evidence is presented indicating a spectrum of zzso affinities with zzso zzso extending into the zzso zzso In addition to these zzso binding sites on the DNA, the zzso method of Job reveals distinct zzso of zzso complexes corresponding to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 zzso per 5 zzso base pairs and even up to 1 and 2 (and possibly more) zzso per backbone zzso Models are suggested to account for these zzso With zzso the zzso are 1-2 zzso per 5 zzso pairs in addition to 1 and 2 zzso per backbone zzso zzso parameters for formation of the tightest binding complex between zzso zzso and zzso or zzso are zzso zzso zzso binding to calf zzso DNA, chicken zzso DNA, and zzso exhibits an zzso strength dependence similar to that expected for a zzso positive zzso This zzso strength dependence remains unchanged in the presence of zzso ethanol, which decreases the affinity by 2 orders of zzso In addition, due to its strong zzso zzso zzso easily zzso several zzso from zzso
