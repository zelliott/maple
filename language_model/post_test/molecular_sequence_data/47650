In rice, limited efforts have been made to identify genes by the use of zzso zzso especially zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso We constructed zzso and gene trap Ds zzso and introduced them into the rice zzso by zzso zzso In this report, rice plants that contained single and simple insertions of zzso were zzso in order to evaluate the zzso zzso The 3' end of Ds was examined for putative zzso donor zzso As observed in zzso three zzso donor sites were identified at the 3' end of the Ds in zzso Nearly zzso of Ds elements were excised from the original zzso sites, when zzso zzso was expressed under a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to induce new zzso of Ds in new plants derived from zzso About zzso of the plants carried at least one Ds which underwent secondary zzso in the later zzso Eight per cent of zzso Ds elements expressed zzso in various zzso of rice zzso With cloned DNA adjacent to zzso the zzso complexities of the zzso sites were examined by Southern zzso Half of the Ds zzso sites showed simple zzso patterns which could be easily zzso to locate the zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso gene trap system could prove an excellent tool for the analysis of functions of genes in zzso We discuss genetic strategies that could be employed in a large scale zzso using a zzso zzso family in zzso
