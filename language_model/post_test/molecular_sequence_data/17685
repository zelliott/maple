The ability of zzso to interact with zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso and human biological zzso obtained from different geographic areas, was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as a new zzso zzso of zzso zzso of undefined zzso were zzso Most of the zzso zzso strains did not zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso suspensions of all the zzso strains zzso Fifteen of the 19 strains tested positive for zzso using zzso zzso zzso It is believed this is the first report of zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso A similar zzso pattern was obtained for zzso with specificity for zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso which did bind to the affinity zzso zzso a zzso of zzso The use of bacterial strains and commercial zzso of defined specificity may be an approach to providing evidence about the zzso binding sites of undefined zzso zzso
