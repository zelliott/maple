The structure of human pancreatic zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution using X-ray zzso zzso This zzso is found to be composed of three structural zzso The largest is zzso A zzso zzso zzso which forms a central zzso parallel zzso to one end of which are located the active site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also found in this vicinity is a bound zzso zzso that forms zzso interactions to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso B is the smallest zzso zzso and serves to form a calcium binding site against the wall of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso groups making zzso interactions to this calcium include zzso 100, zzso zzso zzso zzso and His zzso zzso C zzso zzso is made up of zzso zzso and is only loosely associated with zzso A and zzso It is notable that the zzso zzso zzso of human pancreatic zzso zzso a zzso modification to form a stable zzso zzso that may provide protection against other zzso zzso zzso comparisons of human pancreatic zzso with functionally related zzso serve to emphasize three zzso zzso despite this approach zzso primary sequence alignments with respect to the numerous insertions and deletions present, overall there is only approximately zzso sequence zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in contrast, these same studies indicate that significant structural zzso is present and of the order of approximately zzso zzso the positioning of zzso C can vary considerably between zzso In terms of the more closely related zzso zzso there are four regions of zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with significantly different zzso from those in human pancreatic zzso At least two of these could play a role in observed differential zzso and zzso pattern zzso between these zzso Similarly, zzso acid differences between human pancreatic and zzso zzso have been localized and a number of these occur in the vicinity of the active zzso
