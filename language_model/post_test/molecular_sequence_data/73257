The primary structures of two zzso of an zzso inhibitor zzso zzso from a wild common bean zzso zzso were revealed by a comparison of the zzso acid sequence previously deduced from the zzso sequence with the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences determined by conventional zzso The zzso molecular weight of alpha zzso obtained by the zzso technique, considered together with the sequence molecular weights revealed for the zzso indicated that alpha zzso has the zzso zzso of an alpha 2 beta 2 zzso These structural features were closely similar to those recently zzso for a white kidney bean zzso zzso zzso zzso which is quite different in the zzso specificity from alpha zzso The zzso processing of the precursor zzso to form the zzso structure appeared to require an zzso zzso close to the processing zzso Further, the proper associations of the zzso into the zzso structures seemed to be strictly controlled by a few zzso acids on the zzso zzso
