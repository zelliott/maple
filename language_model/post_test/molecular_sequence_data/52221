The zzso zzso zzso zzso is very susceptible to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso follows zzso zzso zzso and exhibits a zzso rate constant of zzso zzso zzso An equilibrium mixture of zzso and product substantially protects against zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso within the active site are being zzso Complete zzso of the zzso zzso with the modification of 6 zzso zzso as determined by difference zzso at 240 zzso zzso activity can be restored by zzso treatment, which is also consistent with the modification occurring at zzso zzso Using the kinetic method of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11, zzso it was shown that modification of a single zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso protection experiments also indicated that 1 zzso zzso was protected from zzso zzso pH studies show that the zzso for this zzso is zzso which is identical to the single zzso determined from the zzso zzso profile for the zzso A single active site zzso was identified by differential zzso mapping in the presence and absence of zzso This zzso was found to comprise zzso zzso of the 2 zzso in this zzso zzso and zzso only one, zzso is zzso among all type I zzso We propose that zzso is the active site zzso responsible for zzso zzso of zzso and is a good candidate for the general base that has been zzso to participate in the mechanism of this zzso
