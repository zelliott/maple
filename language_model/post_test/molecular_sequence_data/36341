zzso acid regulates gene expression by binding to receptors that are zzso zzso zzso The different types of zzso may mediate the diverse effects of zzso on different zzso at different stages of zzso This implies zzso expression will be zzso and temporally regulated during normal zzso To examine this point, zzso clones zzso zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso Two different classes of zzso alpha have been zzso they both show most similarity to the zzso alpha 2 zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 transcripts accumulate whilst the level of zzso gamma zzso In addition, transcripts from the two zzso alpha 2 genes are zzso distributed in the zzso of zzso treated zzso zzso of zzso transcript levels by zzso may provide one level of control of zzso gene expression during zzso
