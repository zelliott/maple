To study the recognition by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso base, zzso were introduced into the zzso base of zzso zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso representing the three biological zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso were used to zzso these zzso two distinct preference profiles regarding the zzso base of different zzso zzso were zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and human zzso The preference for zzso in zzso by bacterial zzso is much stronger than the modest preferences for zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso from the three zzso were in accordance with the view that the evolutionary position of zzso is intermediate between those of zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso to zzso in bovine zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso base zzso zzso of zzso to zzso or disruption of the zzso base pair also caused reduction of zzso zzso These observations identify a zzso structural region near the end of zzso stem zzso zzso and zzso as a crucial domain required for effective recognition by human zzso
