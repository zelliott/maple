F1 zzso is an attractive candidate for the development of a zzso vaccine against zzso In previous study, the extraction of this zzso from zzso zzso is characterized by using organic zzso In this work, a new zzso strategy that produced zzso F1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso was developed by the substitution of physical disruption for organic zzso one, followed by a combination of ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso column zzso zzso As revealed in this study, this zzso procedure is simple and effective, and avoids potential adverse effect on the zzso by organic zzso zzso zzso F1 that zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso saline (PBS) induced very high zzso of zzso to F1 in zzso mice and protected them zzso zzso against subcutaneous challenge with zzso zzso of zzso zzso virulent strain zzso
