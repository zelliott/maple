zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso is an essential step in viral zzso As is the case for all zzso zzso zzso zzso requires the formation of zzso zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms by which zzso zzso become active within their zzso Using an in zzso expression system, we have examined the zzso of zzso efficiency and the order of zzso site processing for the zzso of zzso within the full-length zzso zzso Following zzso initial zzso occurs between the viral zzso and zzso zzso This is followed by zzso of a novel site located in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso interface of the zzso produced differential effects on zzso and zzso A subset of zzso produced enhanced zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso suggesting that, in the zzso zzso zzso that liberate the zzso are a relatively late zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso at position 1 of the zzso zzso interface resulted in altered zzso of zzso sites and suggests that this zzso functions as a zzso specificity zzso In zzso our studies indicate that interactions within the zzso zzso interface help determine the order of precursor zzso and contribute to the formation of zzso zzso Assembly zzso within zzso outside the zzso domain also influence zzso zzso
