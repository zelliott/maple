A series of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso that express zzso zzso the zzso proteins of Japanese encephalitis virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso part of zzso and zzso were constructed and analyzed for their ability to zzso protective immunity in mice against lethal challenge with zzso zzso The zzso were introduced into both zzso zzso zzso promoter of the zzso precedes the zzso structural open reading frame zzso and 3' (the promoter follows the zzso zzso zzso The longest cassette zzso was zzso zzso in zzso which is remarkable for such a small zzso virus as zzso zzso zzso is roughly zzso zzso in zzso The level of expression of zzso proteins appeared similar for both zzso and 3' zzso In general, the stability of the zzso obtained was found to be low zzso was lost following one to five passages at low zzso of infection, depending on the zzso However, zzso zzso containing longer zzso zzso zzso zzso were more stable than the corresponding 3' zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced zzso against zzso proteins and low zzso of zzso zzso were produced by mice zzso with zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso A single zzso of mice with the zzso or zzso zzso provided zzso protection against peripheral lethal challenge with zzso zzso of zzso zzso The results demonstrate that genetically engineered zzso can be successfully used as vaccine zzso
