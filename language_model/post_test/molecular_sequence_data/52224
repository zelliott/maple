One of the peptides previously discovered in zzso is the zzso zzso As zzso has also indicated the presence of zzso zzso in man, we extracted in the present investigation zzso material from human gastric zzso and zzso it to zzso with several high performance liquid zzso zzso reverse phase and zzso exchange zzso zzso The zzso were monitored with a zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence revealed a zzso acid zzso having 6 zzso zzso acids in common with zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso termed zzso 25, is zzso The zzso was zzso Mass zzso of the synthetic and the extracted zzso revealed identical molecular zzso zzso of 250 zzso of human zzso plasma with zzso zzso zzso reverse phase zzso and zzso exchange zzso demonstrated circulating zzso zzso at a retention time identical to zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso at the position of zzso 25 on zzso increased significantly after a zzso A zzso utilizing zzso to zzso 25 and a zzso analogue of zzso 25 was used to measure zzso zzso in the plasma of 10 zzso There was a significant rise of zzso zzso in the plasma after a zzso zzso infusion of the synthetic zzso in dogs zzso zzso pancreatic zzso beginning at a dose of 4 zzso The zzso effect was seen with 64 zzso We have zzso therefore, a new zzso zzso 25, in human gastric zzso we have provided evidence for the presence of this zzso in the human zzso and have shown a rise of plasma zzso zzso after a zzso This zzso stimulates zzso pancreatic zzso Its zzso role deserves further zzso
