We previously zzso the isolation of zzso zzso by in zzso selection that are zzso active in highly zzso zzso DNA, despite its chemical zzso could perform zzso under challenging chemical conditions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One remarkable DNA zzso zzso is zzso a zzso zzso that exhibits a zzso of approximately 1 zzso at pH zzso In this study, we carried out a series of experiments to examine the sequence and zzso properties of this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso was a considerably large zzso requiring approximately 80 out of the original 123 zzso for the optimal zzso zzso A zzso experiment identified ten absolutely zzso zzso that are distributed in three zzso crucial sequence zzso In addition, a trans zzso was successfully zzso zzso of the observed rate constant of zzso with zzso determined rate constant for the zzso reaction revealed that zzso achieved a rate enhancement of approximately zzso This study provides valuable information about this zzso zzso and zzso way for further structural and zzso characterization of this unique zzso zzso
