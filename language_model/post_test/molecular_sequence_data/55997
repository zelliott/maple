We analyzed the nature of the zzso zzso proteins in zzso plasma using zzso as an affinity labeling zzso zzso gel zzso under zzso conditions of the zzso zzso plasma proteins revealed two proteins with specific binding to zzso A labeled protein that migrated faster than zzso zzso was detected only in plasma obtained from zzso at stages earlier than, but not at the end of, zzso zzso Another protein that migrated more slowly than zzso appeared in the plasma at the late climax stage and was present in the adult zzso To study the function of zzso during zzso it was zzso from zzso plasma to the single zzso The molecular mass of this protein was estimated to be 56 zzso by gel zzso but only 16 zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso which indicates that the zzso comprised four identical zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso and the zzso acid sequence of its zzso portion were highly zzso with those of zzso zzso These molecular features indicate that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso the affinity of zzso zzso for zzso was 360 times higher than that for zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso possessed a single class of zzso site, with a zzso of zzso zzso at 0 zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may play an important role in transporting zzso in the blood during zzso
