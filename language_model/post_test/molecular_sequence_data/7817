A zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso an zzso producer, zzso resistance to zzso was zzso and found to contain an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso Its deduced gene product zzso showed a high degree of similarity with other proteins belonging to the zzso zzso including the gene product of another zzso gene zzso The zzso protein contains two zzso zzso each of approximately 200 zzso acids in zzso and no zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene was carried out by deleting specific regions of the gene and zzso for zzso zzso These experiments showed that either the first or the second half of the gene containing only one zzso domain was sufficient to zzso resistance to zzso The gene zzso was expressed in zzso coli fused to a zzso protein zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso hybrid protein was zzso by affinity zzso on an zzso zzso and zzso zzso were raised against the fusion zzso These were used to monitor the zzso and physical location of zzso during zzso By Western analysis, the zzso protein was detected both in the soluble and in the membrane fraction and its synthesis paralleled zzso zzso It was also shown that a zzso zzso strain, containing both a zzso zzso able to zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was capable of zzso zzso and zzso the inactive zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso constitutes the zzso system by which zzso or its inactive zzso form could be zzso by zzso zzso
