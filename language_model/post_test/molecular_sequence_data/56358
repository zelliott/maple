All human zzso B viruses characterized so far express three envelope zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are believed to function as binding proteins for the cellular zzso as targets for zzso virus zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the characterization of infectious zzso zzso zzso that are unable to express a zzso protein and which were derived from serum of a highly zzso chronic zzso zzso sequencing of the amplified zzso region and sequencing of 50 cloned amplified zzso DNA fragments revealed that in all zzso in addition to numerous zzso changes, there were deletions of the zzso translation initiation zzso and three zzso 54 zzso downstream zzso No zzso protein and altered zzso proteins were found in the serum of the zzso zzso infectious zzso DNA zzso having the zzso region zzso by the zzso zzso region were replication competent in cultured zzso zzso zzso normal zzso were efficiently zzso and were infectious for primary human zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso devoid of zzso protein can occur in zzso as a dominant or exclusive virus population and that expression of the zzso protein is not essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or in zzso zzso
