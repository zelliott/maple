The zzso zzso one of the two zzso of the avian zzso virus, efficiently blocks zzso differentiation and suppresses zzso gene zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso differentiation and zzso gene expression in a zzso fashion, when introduced into zzso cells via a zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso hormone zzso does not zzso affect zzso zzso The analysis of a series of zzso zzso proteins suggests that the zzso zzso has lost one type of zzso hormone zzso function zzso zzso gene zzso in response to zzso but zzso displays another zzso it zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The region responsible for the loss of zzso regulator activity of zzso has been mapped to the very zzso of zzso encompassing a cluster of highly zzso zzso acid zzso with the potential to form an zzso zzso
