Gene conversion mediates the variation of zzso surface structures on zzso zzso which prevents host zzso immune responses from being zzso One of the zzso gene conversion systems is zzso variation zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso type IV zzso To identify zzso DNA sequences that facilitate zzso the zzso region upstream of the zzso gene zzso was targeted for zzso zzso Four classes of zzso zzso were isolated, distinguishable by their zzso zzso zzso insertions that did not alter zzso or zzso zzso insertions that blocked zzso zzso insertions that zzso with zzso and zzso insertions that zzso with zzso expression and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter did not affect the frequency of zzso directly demonstrating that zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso Two stretches of sequence upstream of zzso were devoid of zzso zzso and some deletions in these regions were not zzso suggesting that they are essential for zzso zzso zzso that blocked zzso zzso were located downstream of the zzso repeat zzso and deletion of the region surrounding these insertions completely zzso zzso zzso confirming that specific sequences zzso to zzso are essential for the zzso events underlying zzso zzso
