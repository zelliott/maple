Among zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is unique in its ability to catalyze the difficult, but desirable, reaction of selective zzso zzso The zzso structures that we present here for the zzso variable zzso of the zzso zzso both with and without the bound product p zzso strongly support and extend the structural and zzso information previously provided by a three-dimensional zzso model, together with extensive zzso zzso and zzso zzso The structures reveal an unexpected extended zzso zzso of the third zzso determining region of the heavy chain, which may be coupled to the novel zzso ring orientation of the adjacent zzso zzso This unusual zzso creates an zzso site that is significantly deeper than predicted in the zzso model, with a zzso pocket that encloses the p zzso zzso Despite these differences, the previously proposed roles for zzso zzso in zzso stabilization and for His zzso as the zzso that forms a zzso zzso intermediate are fully supported by the zzso zzso His zzso is now centered at the bottom of the zzso site with the zzso ring poised for zzso zzso His zzso zzso zzso and the bound p zzso are linked into a zzso network by two zzso water zzso These water molecules may mimic the positions of the zzso oxygen atoms of the zzso which in turn mimic the transition state of the zzso This network also contains His zzso suggesting that this zzso may also stabilize the zzso A possible zzso zzso from His zzso through two zzso zzso may assist zzso zzso Although zzso stabilization is commonly observed in zzso zzso zzso attack appears to be unique to zzso and accounts for the unusually high zzso activity of this zzso
