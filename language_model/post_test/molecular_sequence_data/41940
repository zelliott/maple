The accuracy of models for DNA substitution used in zzso analyses is becoming more important with the increasing availability and analysis of molecular sequence zzso It is natural to look for ways of improving these models, and to do this in a planned manner it is useful to be able to identify features of sequences that may not be described zzso In this paper, I describe three statistics which may give useful diagnostic information on departures from zzso zzso The statistical zzso of these statistics are discussed and simple significance tests are zzso These tests are based on the zzso zzso of the sequences and so have the advantage of using the information contained in this zzso Examples are given of the application of the new tests to zzso chain models describing the evolution of zzso zzso sequences and zzso zzso zzso
