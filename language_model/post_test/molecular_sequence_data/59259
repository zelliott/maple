An enrichment cloning method was evaluated for the isolation of zzso zzso from eastern white pine and the resulting markers were examined for zzso A zzso enrichment was achieved for highly abundant zzso repeats, but for much less abundant zzso repeats an enrichment of only zzso was zzso Using a single set of zzso conditions, 19 zzso zzso were identified from 77 primer pairs zzso zzso of 16 zzso zzso in 16 unrelated white zzso from the north-central United States revealed an average of zzso zzso per locus and an average observed zzso of zzso Five zzso were scored among zzso from a single pine to obtain a zzso zzso of the segregating female zzso zzso All zzso zzso according to zzso expectations and linkage was established for two of the zzso It was concluded that zzso zzso are highly variable in this species and that zzso zzso sequence zzso markers can be efficiently developed for zzso mapping and population zzso zzso
