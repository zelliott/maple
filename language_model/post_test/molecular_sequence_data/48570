This paper describes an improved method for the sequence analysis of zzso zzso by zzso mass zzso zzso The method uses zzso group zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and removal zzso zzso or modification zzso zzso 4) of the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso onto the zzso and the zzso treatment removes or zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the resulting zzso under low-energy zzso zzso yielded a simplified zzso series of both the zzso and the zzso that can facilitate their zzso The feasibility of the method was studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in each zzso were successfully zzso by zzso tandem zzso zzso
