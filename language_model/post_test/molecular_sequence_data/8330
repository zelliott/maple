To increase the possibilities of obtaining zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso we zzso mice with cloned and expressed zzso gene as a zzso protein displayed on the zzso zzso zzso The fusion protein zzso mouse zzso reacting with the zzso protein F at a limit dilution of zzso zzso clones expressing zzso fragments were constructed from the genes of selected B cells of zzso mouse after a first round of panning against the protein zzso zzso of single chain zzso zzso zzso fragments to the protein of zzso zzso was detected by zzso in 20 of zzso clones obtained after the first panning zzso The 20 positive clones recognizing different protein F zzso as demonstrated by zzso were zzso by flow zzso to identify zzso fragments reacting only with zzso zzso of the protein F on whole zzso one of the 20 clones tested showed a level of zzso compatible with zzso zzso that can lead to zzso developments in targeting zzso
