A database search for genes zzso zzso proteins revealed sequences that were designated as human but presented strong evidence of being of viral zzso The two zzso sequences designated zzso and zzso were originally described as human gene products that were zzso by zzso II in primary zzso kidney zzso However, their high degree of sequence zzso to known viral proteins suggests that they represent the zzso M, and F genes of a putative new member of family zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences and zzso motifs suggests that this putative virus is a divergent relative of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso we suggest zzso virus or zzso as a provisional zzso Compared to zzso virus, the percentage of identical zzso zzso acids varied from zzso zzso for the C protein to 51% zzso for the M zzso The presence and conservation of zzso viral zzso start and stop signals and an apparent P editing motif also indicate a relationship of this putative virus to the zzso Given the highly zzso nature of the zzso the origin of these sequences is enigmatic, and attempts to identify and isolate zzso are zzso
