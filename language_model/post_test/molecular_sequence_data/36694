To determine whether a correlation exists between the zzso zzso class II zzso DNA zzso and cell surface expression and to detect the zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso clones were generated against new zzso blank zzso zzso and zzso zzso The clones were tested on the 10th zzso zzso and on local panel zzso zzso of the tested cells made it possible to zzso correlate the zzso specificity with the zzso specificity and zzso split zzso into zzso and zzso By comparing DNA sequences of the second zzso to panel zzso the zzso responsible for zzso and zzso were defined and attributed to zzso zzso contributing to zzso selection inside the zzso zzso However, DNA sequences could not explain zzso zzso indicating that another structure not yet zzso may be zzso
