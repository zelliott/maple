The zzso and zzso of zzso are much more complex than was ever zzso To understand the underlying mechanisms, research must focus on evolutionary processes occurring at a population level and employ sufficiently zzso molecular zzso Using ten zzso and ITS zzso sequence data, we investigated the genetic structure of populations of the zzso freshwater zzso zzso zzso (until 2004 a cryptic entity within the zzso zzso zzso species zzso This is the first time that zzso have been used to investigate the genetic structure of any freshwater or zzso zzso Using an integrated approach zzso DNA zzso and specificity of the zzso zzso we verified the identity of 70 zzso zzso zzso obtained from lakes in the zzso Belgium and zzso zzso zzso values were very high zzso and in zzso zzso zzso clustered according to their country of origin, with limited evidence of zzso However, selected zzso from all countries were sexually zzso a result consistent with limited ITS zzso Considering the apparent absence of zzso resting stages in most zzso we conclude that such levels of differentiation are likely to be a consequence of limited zzso With restricted zzso previously unacknowledged opportunities for zzso zzso exist, which may help to explain the huge extant diversity of zzso
