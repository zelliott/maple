zzso 2 is thought to be active as a zzso zzso As the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso is located in the zzso interface of the zzso F domain it was successfully used to stabilize zzso zzso acid contacts between two zzso zzso yielding biologically active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso revealed almost identical median effective zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative binding and zzso zzso suggest that one zzso zzso or two zzso zzso molecules bind to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso revealed four zzso zzso with apparent molecular weights of about 70 zzso 85 zzso 95 zzso and 100 zzso respectively, showing that both zzso zzso chains may be zzso to a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso of zzso zzso 2 occurring either in solution at zzso above the zzso zzso constant or at the zzso zzso is important for regulation of zzso complex formation and signal zzso
