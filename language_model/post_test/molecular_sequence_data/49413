The zzso zzso region zzso recognized by zzso directed against the zzso zzso zzso a major zzso in zzso zzso diseases, has not yet been completely zzso By using zzso zzso technology, we identified three critical zzso zzso zzso and zzso within selected zzso which zzso with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from an zzso zzso library obtained from zzso zzso B cells of zzso disease zzso zzso sequence alignment on the zzso zzso together with the binding analysis of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso expressed by Chinese zzso zzso cells, demonstrated that regions zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso domain and region zzso from the complement control zzso domain are a part of the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that these regions were involved in the binding to zzso of zzso containing zzso zzso from patients suffering from zzso and zzso zzso zzso Identification of the zzso could lead to improved diagnosis of zzso zzso diseases by engineering zzso as a target zzso or designing therapeutic peptides able to block zzso zzso zzso
