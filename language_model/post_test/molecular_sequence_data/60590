The gene zzso zzso a second zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso The isolated gene consists of zzso with the coding region interrupted by ten zzso and flanked by an upstream region in which putative zzso and zzso boxes were zzso The zzso of zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso The deduced mature zzso protein consisted of zzso zzso acids and was preceded by a signal zzso of 23 zzso zzso The sequence of zzso reveals zzso similarity on the protein level to the previously characterized zzso The new zzso gene shares highest similarity to zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculated zzso point zzso of zzso for the gene product zzso was in good agreement with the zzso determined zzso of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso grown on zzso zzso analysis using competitive reverse zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed in zzso and cellulose containing zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso was not increased in response to zzso
