The zzso zzso are generally more susceptible to cadmium zzso toxicity than the zzso To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying tissue and cell differences in zzso sensitivity, we compared zzso zzso gene zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso retention under different times in freshly isolated zzso zzso and zzso cells and liver of rats treated with zzso Adult male zzso rats received a zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso and 1, 3, 6, or zzso later and zzso animals zzso tissue were sampled and zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso zzso analysis followed by zzso zzso and zzso was estimated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso content was determined by atomic zzso zzso zzso zzso were not zzso or zzso observed in rats treated with zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that the rat zzso indeed expressed zzso and zzso the major zzso We also found that zzso animals contained relatively high zzso levels of both zzso zzso which were increased after zzso treatment in liver and peaked at zzso followed by a decline, in contrast, the zzso levels in zzso cells peaked at zzso Interestingly, the induction of zzso zzso was lower than zzso zzso in zzso cells and liver of rats treated with zzso However, the zzso zzso levels of zzso cells decreased zzso after zzso treatment, followed by an zzso in contrast, zzso zzso levels increased zzso after zzso treatment, followed by a reduction, but induced zzso of them are lower than those of zzso cells and zzso zzso exposure substantially increased zzso zzso but did not increase zzso translation in zzso and zzso zzso These results zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso and zzso zzso that the inability to induce the zzso zzso protein in response to zzso might account for higher zzso of zzso to zzso toxicity and zzso relative to zzso
