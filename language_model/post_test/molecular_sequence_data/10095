Human zzso zzso cells present a simple and zzso system to directly test the hypothesis that the G protein gamma zzso contribute to the specificity of zzso signaling pathways in zzso To begin to zzso the functions of the individual gamma zzso in these cells, a zzso strategy was used to specifically zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and analyzed for specificity toward the targeted zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of this zzso revealed a highly efficient zzso activity directed exclusively toward the zzso zzso zzso In particular, this zzso did not result in zzso of the zzso zzso transcript, which is zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso Using a transient zzso zzso in zzso analysis of this zzso showed a specific reduction in both the zzso and protein expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with this loss in zzso zzso there was a specific reduction in the protein expression of the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso and zzso zzso may functionally interact to form a zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of the consequences of zzso suppression of the zzso zzso expression indicated that it was associated with significant zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expression had no effect on zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso zzso Taken together, these results not only indicate the feasibility of using the zzso technology to determine the roles of individual gamma zzso in zzso zzso pathways in zzso but they point to a specific role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso activity in response to zzso
