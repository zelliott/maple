The ability of zzso zzso to temporarily restore an zzso zzso behavioral zzso of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the zzso acid side chain that is present at zzso 101, even when there is extensive variation in the rest of the zzso acid zzso Analysis of conservation of zzso in zzso suggests that the ability of zzso to regulate this zzso zzso cell function may be a biological role of zzso that is widely distributed zzso A series of zzso zzso that differ only at zzso were produced by in zzso zzso zzso and expression in zzso coli, zzso to chemical zzso and tested for their ability to temporarily restore a zzso behavioral zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso had minimal zzso zzso with zzso or zzso had no zzso zzso However, as a standard of comparison, all of the zzso were able to activate a zzso zzso zzso light chain zzso that is sensitive to point zzso elsewhere in the zzso zzso Overall, these results support the hypothesis that the structural features of zzso required for the zzso of calcium signals varies with the particular zzso that is being regulated and provide insight into why inherited zzso of zzso at zzso 101 are zzso and selective in their zzso zzso
