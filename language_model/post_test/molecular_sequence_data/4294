The zzso gene cluster from the virulent zzso zzso zzso 1 strain zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso activity was associated with a zzso region which contains eight long open reading frames zzso The structural zzso zzso are separated from the accessory zzso zzso by a zzso zzso of unknown function, zzso zzso were found with the structural and accessory zzso gene products of zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, with those of other zzso The zzso zzso zzso had predicted molecular masses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the size of the zzso was estimated to be 337 zzso 13 zzso by gel zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso but unstable at 65 degrees zzso In cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso was stable over a broad pH range zzso to zzso and the optimal pH for activity was zzso The zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when it was zzso at pH zzso The low zzso suggests that this zzso would be active in the respiratory tract environment, where zzso levels should be similar to those normally found in pig serum (2 to 7 zzso
