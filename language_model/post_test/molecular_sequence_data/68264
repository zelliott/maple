The possible zzso value of the position of the zzso within the zzso in patients with zzso zzso is still being zzso We analyzed the DNA zzso and the transcript types of zzso patients and tried to correlate the data obtained with zzso features, defined according to zzso risk index, and with chronic phase and/or survival zzso The exact location of the zzso either zzso or 3' to the zzso III restriction site within the zzso was zzso Moreover, the exact zzso zzso was also zzso As a whole, 150 zzso were rearranged in the zzso part and 94 in the 3' part of the zzso No correlation was observed between the site of zzso on the one hand and the zzso zzso index and survival, on the zzso zzso analysis was performed in 130 zzso 59 carried an zzso and 69 an zzso zzso Two patients carried both zzso Of the patients rearranged in the zzso area, according to Southern zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis allowed a better definition of the zzso However, also the type of transcript did not show any correlation either with risk categories or zzso No difference in response to therapy, either chemotherapy or alpha zzso was observed between zzso and 3' rearranged zzso
