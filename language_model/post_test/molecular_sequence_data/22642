DNA zzso insert zzso opposite the zzso damage product zzso zzso instead of zzso to the extent of zzso with some zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso IV zzso showed zzso higher incorporation efficiency of zzso zzso zzso opposite zzso and zzso higher efficiency of extension beyond an zzso pair than an zzso zzso The zzso efficiency for these events (with zzso or zzso was similar for G and zzso zzso Mass spectral analysis of extended DNA zzso showed zzso incorporation of zzso zzso zzso opposite zzso zzso zzso showed faster rates of zzso incorporation opposite zzso than zzso The measured zzso was zzso lower for an zzso containing zzso than with zzso Extension beyond an zzso pair was similar to zzso and faster than for an zzso pair, in contrast to other zzso The zzso for zzso zzso opposite zzso was lower than for opposite zzso Crystal structures of zzso complexes with zzso were solved with C, A, and G zzso zzso placed opposite zzso With zzso zzso and zzso the zzso bonds were formed even in the presence of zzso The zzso pair showed classic zzso zzso the zzso pair was in the zzso zzso with the A zzso in a zzso pair with zzso With zzso placed opposite zzso pairing was not to the zzso but to the zzso C (and in classic zzso zzso consistent with the low frequency of this zzso event observed in the zzso zzso
