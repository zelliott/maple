zzso zzso proteins are important for zzso structure, cell growth, DNA zzso zzso and gene zzso In this study, we focused on the role of zzso (the zzso zzso a newly identified member of the zzso protein family in zzso zzso The survival fraction of zzso zzso decreased by tenfold after treatment with 50 zzso zzso nearly zzso at a 10 zzso dose of gamma ray and nearly zzso at a zzso exposure of 1000 J zzso compared with zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso protein localized in the zzso area of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA protection zzso suggested that zzso shields DNA from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of relaxed zzso DNA in the presence of zzso I revealed that zzso zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso is a protein with zzso properties and zzso features that are involved in protecting zzso zzso DNA from zzso
