In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by coating zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso The newly prepared zzso zzso zzso possess unique properties of extended zzso zzso good water zzso highly open pore structure, uniform pore size zzso zzso high surface area zzso zzso and zzso pore zzso The unique structure of the zzso zzso composite zzso not only provide extended planes with zzso surface that prevents zzso in solution, but also offer a huge number of zzso zzso with high surface area that can ensure an efficient zzso of peptides through zzso interaction between zzso pore walls and target zzso The obtained zzso zzso materials were zzso for size selectively and specifically enriching peptides in standard zzso zzso and zzso peptides in real biological samples zzso brain zzso
