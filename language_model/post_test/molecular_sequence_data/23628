zzso resumption is generally under the control of an zzso zzso zzso It is equivalent to the zzso phase transition in zzso cell zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso zzso However, the complete signaling zzso from the hormone to zzso zzso is yet unclear in any zzso A model system to analyze zzso resumption is the zzso zzso in which zzso zzso B zzso plays a key zzso in hormonal signaling that leads to zzso zzso zzso Here we show in zzso zzso that when zzso activity is inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso hormone fails to induce zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso phase transition, even though zzso activity becomes zzso These observations assign a novel role to zzso for a hormonal signaling intermediate toward zzso zzso They further support that zzso is a zzso distinct from zzso and zzso and that zzso activity is not sufficient for the full zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso
