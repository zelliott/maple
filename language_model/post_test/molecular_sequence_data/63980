zzso are zzso zzso of zzso involved in many cellular zzso Their dynamic instability is controlled by numerous compounds and zzso including zzso and zzso family zzso The way in which zzso instability is regulated at the molecular level has remained zzso mainly because of the lack of appropriate structural zzso Here, we present the structure, at zzso A resolution, of zzso in complex with zzso and with the zzso domain zzso of zzso It shows the interaction of zzso with two zzso zzso in a curved complex capped by the zzso zzso domain, which prevents the incorporation of the zzso zzso into zzso A comparison with the structure of zzso in zzso shows changes in the zzso of zzso as it switches from its straight zzso to a curved zzso These changes correlate with the loss of lateral contacts and provide a rationale for the rapid zzso zzso characteristic of dynamic zzso Moreover, the zzso complex sheds light on the mechanism of zzso activity: we show that zzso binds at a location where it prevents curved zzso from adopting a straight structure, which zzso zzso
