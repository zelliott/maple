zzso have one of the best known fossil records among the zzso zzso However, the origin and zzso relationships of the extant zzso lineages are poorly zzso To test the current zzso hypotheses on evolution of zzso we zzso about 1,000 base pairs from the 3' end of the small zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in 22 species representing all major zzso zzso zzso were derived using zzso zzso and zzso zzso All analyses confirm the zzso origin of zzso zzso relationships within zzso zzso from zzso zzso however, depend on the method of tree building and on the choice of analyzed zzso In particular, the position of zzso zzso shows important zzso We have shown that these changes result from the extremely high rate of zzso evolution in this zzso By comparing the number of zzso with the divergence times zzso from the fossil record, we have estimated that the rate of zzso evolution in zzso zzso is 50 to 100 times faster than in some zzso zzso The use of the zzso method and limitation of analyzed sites to the most zzso parts of the zzso zzso zzso render molecular and zzso data generally zzso
