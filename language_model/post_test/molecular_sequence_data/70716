In zzso birds and zzso the zzso development of the zzso appear to be zzso This conservation is evident despite the different sex determining switches employed by these zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso sex determination zzso where the key sex determining switch is the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is the trigger for zzso determination in zzso it is not zzso in other zzso zzso However, a gene closely related to zzso the highly zzso zzso factor, zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast to the zzso mechanism evident in zzso and birds, many zzso exhibit temperature dependent sex determination zzso where the egg incubation temperature triggers sex zzso Here we examine the expression of zzso during zzso in the American zzso zzso zzso a zzso that exhibits zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the embryonic zzso but not in the zzso However, the timing of zzso zzso in the developing zzso is not consistent with a role for this gene in the early stages of zzso sex zzso Since zzso zzso in male zzso zzso with the structural zzso of the zzso zzso may operate farther downstream in the zzso sex differentiation zzso than previously zzso
