The zzso zzso zzso which recognizes one human zzso zzso zzso with the counterpart protein from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with a zzso column was a complex of 88 zzso and 72 zzso zzso The role of zzso protein in nuclear structure formation was studied using a zzso nuclear assembly extract derived from zzso zzso zzso The protein was distributed on the surface of zzso zzso zzso and in the membrane zzso fraction of the nuclear assembly zzso zzso of zzso to the assembly extracts prevented the completion of zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso although partial zzso zzso by zzso was not zzso As a result, the zzso zzso remained in partially swollen structures or formed round but small anomalous zzso Nuclear zzso were formed on the zzso in zzso extract systems, but DNA synthesis was largely zzso suggesting the incomplete zzso of zzso The incorporation of zzso to the zzso was inhibited by zzso It is suggested that the zzso zzso protein has a role in the formation of the zzso layer after nuclear membrane zzso
