A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a water sample collected at a depth of zzso m from zzso Lake in zzso district, zzso zzso The cell suspension was zzso orange due to the presence of zzso The fatty acids were dominated by large amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained zzso and zzso as the major respiratory zzso and zzso and zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that zzso zzso a member of family zzso zzso zzso is the closest related species, with a sequence similarity of zzso to the type zzso Other members of the family zzso had sequence similarities of zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso is proposed as a representative of a new zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso of strain zzso is zzso
