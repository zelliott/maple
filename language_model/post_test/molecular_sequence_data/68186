We have analyzed the zzso locus in a series of 24 zzso tumors and cell lines with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using Southern zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso we have not only confirmed the scattering of the zzso between the zzso locus and the zzso D1 gene zzso but also shown that some of the zzso could be as far as 500 zzso on either side of the zzso zzso of zzso was not restricted to cases with zzso but was also associated with other zzso zzso such as a zzso Whatever the zzso at zzso a correlation was observed between the expression of zzso and the presence of a zzso within 150 zzso upstream of the zzso On the contrary, three samples, including a bona fide zzso zzso and two cases with zzso located outside the zzso area, did not exhibit zzso levels of zzso zzso Our results raise the possibility that several discrete molecular events can take place at zzso in zzso zzso
