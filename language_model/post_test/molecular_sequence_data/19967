The gene zzso which encodes a predicted zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated by the screening of a gene library of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso possesses a typical zzso organization that consists of a signal zzso an zzso zzso region, and a mature zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was expressed in zzso coli and consequently zzso The zzso zzso fraction with zzso activity separated by gel zzso zzso indicated that the mature zzso of zzso was formed by zzso of the zzso after its zzso The zzso zzso is active under a broad range of pH and zzso zzso has pH and temperature zzso of pH zzso and 65 degrees C for its zzso activity and pH 9 and 62 degrees C for its zzso zzso zzso was sharply inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and exhibited a good stability to zzso detergents, and zzso zzso of the zzso activity of zzso with other commercial zzso indicates that zzso has a considerable zzso and zzso activity as does zzso zzso
