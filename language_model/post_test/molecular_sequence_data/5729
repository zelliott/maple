zzso are part of the outer membrane of zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso Upon entering the blood zzso they cause a violent, sometimes zzso response of the immune zzso zzso are zzso zzso lacking zzso active groups, and their detection in the zzso state can be zzso In this paper the potential of zzso zzso zzso for zzso analysis is zzso By using a standard zzso buffer method, zzso down to 100 zzso can be detected within 6 zzso The detection limit can be lowered by one order of magnitude by using a sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso pH zzso In this zzso the zzso serves to zzso the size of the zzso zzso while the zzso forms complexes with the zzso groups of the zzso thereby enhancing its optical zzso The formation of zzso complexes with the zzso zzso B or labeling of the zzso with a zzso zzso zzso was zzso Best results, in terms of detection limit and speed, were obtained with an indirect zzso zzso zzso By using a strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso could be detected as zzso zzso In this case, a detection limit of 3 zzso (35 zzso was zzso zzso and other zzso substances did not disturb the zzso since they generated no zzso zzso The indirect zzso detection was used to zzso the residual zzso content of a DNA preparation from zzso zzso
