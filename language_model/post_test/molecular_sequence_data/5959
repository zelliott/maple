We have raised mouse zzso zzso to eight synthetic peptides corresponding to different regions of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso and rabbit zzso zzso to zzso fusion proteins which zzso three different regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments demonstrate that, in addition to zzso zzso these zzso zzso one or more zzso related proteins with a similar molecular mass, calcium responsiveness and tissue distribution to zzso
