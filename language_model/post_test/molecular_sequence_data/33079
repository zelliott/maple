zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso definitive zzso type zzso 104 has become a widespread cause of human and other animal infections zzso The severity of clinical illness in zzso zzso zzso outbreaks suggests that this strain possesses enhanced zzso zzso and zzso - zzso by a zzso in zzso zzso zzso - are zzso of components of zzso toxin zzso including its zzso zzso Here, we show that exposing zzso to zzso C, a zzso agent, induced production of zzso zzso zzso G proteins were zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso and the label was released by zzso which is known to cleave zzso zzso zzso modification of G proteins was markedly reduced in in zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso was zzso for the zzso zzso at position 6 zzso for zzso zzso and the predicted zzso zzso at position zzso zzso A cellular zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso showed that zzso and zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells occur with the same type of G zzso Furthermore, exposing zzso cells to the zzso culture zzso of zzso resulted in a clustered growth pattern, as is observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso also induced zzso production, suggesting that these agents induce in zzso synthesis of zzso These results, taken together, suggest that zzso is an active toxin similar to zzso
