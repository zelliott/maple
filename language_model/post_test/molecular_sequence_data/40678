Small heat shock proteins zzso zzso a widespread and diverse class of proteins with molecular zzso zzso In the present study, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso by Rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression profiles of these two genes under zzso zzso challenge and cadmium exposure were investigated by quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso The bacterial challenge could significantly zzso the zzso expression of both zzso and zzso with the increase of zzso expression occurred earlier than that of zzso During the cadmium exposure experiment, the expression level of both zzso and zzso decreased significantly with larger zzso in zzso As time zzso the expression levels of both genes were zzso with more zzso in the zzso exposure zzso The differences in the response to pathogen stimulation and cadmium exposure indicated that there were functional diversity between the two structurally different zzso zzso and zzso and they probably played distinct roles in zzso the environmental stress and immune responses in zzso
