The zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to be involved in cell differentiation and zzso To zzso the involvement of zzso zzso genes in normal and pathological conditions, we zzso the expression patterns of zzso zzso in the normal and zzso zzso heart in zzso 

zzso and normal rat hearts were obtained from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso clip zzso and their zzso rats, zzso A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was performed using zzso zzso which were designed from highly zzso regions in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso products were zzso into a sequence zzso and zzso by transforming zzso To compare the expression level of these zzso zzso in the normal and zzso heart, we performed zzso zzso and zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing of approximately 80 clones of zzso revealed 10 zzso five zzso and two unknown types in the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso were abundantly expressed in the rat heart as members of zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso in both normal and zzso zzso We also confirmed the presence of zzso zzso and their zzso vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso The zzso of cardiac zzso and zzso in zzso hearts, especially in zzso C rats, was induced more zzso than that in zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso interactions may play an important role in cardiac zzso and zzso probably as a result of the zzso of the local zzso zzso
