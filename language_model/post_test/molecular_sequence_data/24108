Random zzso constitutes an important approach for identifying critical regions of zzso studying zzso relations and developing novel proteins with desired zzso Perhaps, the most popular method is the zzso zzso in which mistakes are introduced into a zzso and hence a zzso during DNA zzso amplification zzso Unfortunately, the relatively high zzso of the zzso DNA zzso commonly used for zzso result in too few mistakes in the amplified DNA for efficient zzso In this paper, we describe zzso of the family B DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso with superb performance in zzso zzso The key zzso acid changes occur in a short loop linking two long zzso that comprise the zzso zzso of the zzso This region is responsible for binding the incoming zzso and ensuring that only correct bases are inserted opposite the complementary base in the template zzso zzso in the short loop, when combined with an additional zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity, convert the extremely accurate zzso zzso into a zzso with low zzso The zzso zzso can be applied in zzso zzso under exactly the same conditions used for standard, zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Large quantities of amplified product, with a high frequency of nearly indiscriminate zzso are zzso It is anticipated that the zzso zzso will be extremely useful for the zzso of zzso and hence zzso zzso
