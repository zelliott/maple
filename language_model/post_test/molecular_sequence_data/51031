We report here that zzso 2 zzso acts on human blood zzso by enhancing binding activity of the zzso factor zzso B to its consensus sequence in the zzso regulatory zzso region of the zzso zzso alpha chain zzso Similarly, zzso activates zzso B in the human zzso cell line U zzso but not in resting human zzso This effect is zzso within 15 zzso and zzso 1 h after exposure to zzso zzso zzso B binding activity is followed by functional zzso in that zzso of the zzso zzso alpha chain is zzso by enhanced zzso B binding and that a zzso promoter containing the zzso B consensus sequence zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso alpha chain gene is zzso In addition, zzso is capable of increasing transcript levels of the zzso gene coding for the zzso zzso of the zzso B zzso factor, whereas zzso levels of the zzso zzso B gene remained zzso
