zzso organic compounds in root zzso play a key role in zzso interactions by influencing the structure and function of soil microbial zzso Model zzso solutions, based on organic acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso previously identified in the zzso of zzso zzso were applied to soil zzso Root zzso compound solutions zzso soil zzso activity and the addition of zzso increased soil zzso The structure of active bacterial communities, based on zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was assessed by zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso richness was greater in all treatments than that in control soil, with a wide range of zzso zzso responding positively to zzso solutions and fewer zzso responding zzso zzso caused significantly greater increases than zzso in the zzso richness of the soil bacterial community and larger shifts of dominant zzso The greater response of bacteria to zzso may be due to the higher amounts of added zzso zzso of soil organic matter or shifts in soil zzso Our results indicate that zzso play a significant role in shaping soil bacterial communities and this may therefore have a significant impact on plant zzso
