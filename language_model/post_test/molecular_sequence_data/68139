The zzso acid sequence of zzso a zzso protein of 125 zzso isolated from wheat kernel zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso to zzso a protein from barley seed, which was shown to be related to the zzso domain of two proteins zzso by the zzso genes zzso and zzso in potato and to a protein zzso by the same domain of the zzso gene zzso in rubber zzso zzso to zzso zzso contains six zzso zzso all linked in zzso bridges and the zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, structural studies performed on zzso and zzso protein by zzso methods demonstrated that these proteins and zzso are closely related in the secondary structure zzso The high level of zzso found with the product of zzso zzso and zzso genes strongly suggests that zzso and zzso play a common role in the mechanism of plant zzso
