The zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso has been expressed at high level in an active form and zzso with zzso and zzso Most of the backbone and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been assigned using zzso double- and zzso methods, together with a semiautomatic assignment zzso The secondary structure as estimated from the chemical shift index and zzso zzso consists of six zzso and five zzso The global fold was deduced from the long-range zzso zzso assigned in a zzso zzso zzso zzso The fold is of the alternating zzso type, with the five zzso arranged into a parallel zzso The secondary structure and global fold are very similar to those of the bacterial zzso but the zzso domain has an extra short zzso in place of a loop, and an extra zzso at the zzso (leading to the membrane anchor domain in the intact zzso zzso The experimental constraints were combined with zzso zzso to obtain a structure of the zzso domain satisfying the observed zzso zzso Chemical shift comparisons showed that the effects of zzso binding and of zzso reduction are largely zzso at the binding zzso
