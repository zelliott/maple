zzso is an zzso fusion protein expressed in approximately 50% of zzso large cell zzso zzso It derives from the zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain leads to its zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates downstream survival and proliferation signaling pathways leading to zzso zzso zzso we investigated the molecular mechanisms of zzso of the zzso domain of zzso Because zzso are typically regulated by zzso of their zzso zzso we systematically zzso zzso zzso zzso three potential zzso sites contained in the zzso motif of the zzso zzso loop, and determined the effect of these zzso on the zzso activity and biological function of zzso We observed that zzso of both the second and third zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activity or transforming ability of zzso In contrast, zzso of the first and second zzso first and third zzso or all three zzso zzso zzso impaired both zzso activity and transforming ability of zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso introduces a negative charge similar to a zzso zzso possessed zzso activity similar to the zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso of the first zzso of the zzso motif is necessary for the zzso of the zzso zzso domain and the transforming activity of zzso
