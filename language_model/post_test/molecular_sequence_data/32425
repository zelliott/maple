zzso response factors zzso are zzso factors that bind with specificity to zzso zzso response elements zzso found in promoters of zzso zzso response genes and mediate responses to the plant hormone zzso The zzso genes are represented by a large zzso family in zzso A comprehensive zzso analysis was carried out in this study to find all zzso in zzso zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso zzso 23 and 25 zzso zzso named as zzso and zzso were identified, zzso zzso locations of all zzso were presented and it was found that the zzso of zzso was associated with only the zzso block zzso but not local tandem zzso A zzso tree was generated from alignments of the full-length protein sequences of 25 zzso and 23 zzso to examine the zzso relationships of rice and zzso zzso zzso All 48 members of zzso gene families fell into three major classes, a total of 13 sister pairs, including 9 zzso 2 zzso and 2 zzso sister pairs were formed, showing different zzso relationships between zzso and zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso demonstrated that 24 of all 25 zzso genes were active and the transcript abundance of some zzso genes was affected by zzso treatment or zzso and zzso zzso The outcome of the present study provides basic zzso information for the rice zzso gene family and will pave the way for zzso the precise role of zzso in plant growth and development in the zzso
