While much is known about the microbial diversity in some zzso zzso little is known about those of salt mine tunnel zzso The objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive zzso comparison of the zzso and bacterial communities present in zzso salt mine zzso and zzso salt mine zzso tunnels differing in zzso and salt composition using zzso zzso gene clone zzso Two hundred zzso sequences for zzso and 182 sequences for zzso were analyzed by amplified zzso zzso zzso Libraries revealed 44 bacterial and 57 zzso different operational zzso units belonging to at least 8 bacterial and 3 zzso zzso but not all divisions were observed in both salt zzso The bacterial community affiliated with the zzso was the most abundant zzso of zzso in zzso while the community in zzso was dominated by zzso zzso of zzso All zzso clones from zzso were affiliated with zzso In contrast, in the zzso library, zzso of clones belonged to zzso zzso of clones related to zzso zzso and zzso of clones belonged to zzso zzso analysis and comparisons showed that the clone libraries were significantly different between two salt zzso
