Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and characterized from zzso zzso zzso zzso using the rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso They are the first two zzso family members isolated from the insect order of zzso The full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso consist of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and an open reading frame of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso Both genes have typical features of zzso family members, though they share only zzso identity in zzso acid zzso The zzso generated by the zzso zzso program shows that the protein deduced by zzso had the closest zzso relationship to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso shares the highest identity with zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis showed that zzso was expressed zzso higher than zzso at the different zzso stages of zzso zzso The highest expression levels of zzso and zzso were both detected at adult stage and the lowest were at the third and fourth zzso zzso zzso There was a stable and relatively low expression level for zzso whereas there was a descending expression pattern for zzso in the 1st through the 4th zzso zzso
