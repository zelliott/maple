Human zzso zzso is an important cause of acute respiratory illness in zzso We examined the diversity and molecular evolution of zzso using 85 full-length F zzso gene sequences collected over a 20-year zzso 

The F gene sequences fell into two major groups, each with two subgroups, which exhibited a mean of zzso identity by predicted zzso acid zzso zzso acid identity within and between zzso was higher than zzso identity, suggesting structural or functional constraints on F protein zzso There was minimal progressive drift over time, and the genetic lineages were stable over the 20-year zzso Several zzso zzso acid differences zzso between major subgroups, and zzso variations tended to cluster in discrete zzso The estimated rate of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the estimated time to most recent common zzso zzso was 97 years zzso likelihood range zzso zzso Analysis suggested that zzso zzso from avian zzso type C zzso zzso years ago zzso likelihood range zzso zzso 

zzso F protein remains zzso over zzso zzso appears to have zzso from zzso fairly zzso
