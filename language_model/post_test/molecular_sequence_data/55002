The zzso zzso mobile element zzso is a novel zzso genetic zzso zzso is located downstream of the zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso forming the zzso composite zzso Recently, zzso II zzso upstream of zzso zzso was described from a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso in Denmark zzso and 15 zzso zzso in Ireland zzso We report the novel genetic characteristics of the zzso composite islands found in Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso composite islands from two zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were characterized using long-range zzso and zzso zzso 

Both zzso zzso a 12 zzso DNA region primarily identified in zzso II in zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of each zzso The zzso and its zzso regions in zzso and zzso showed high sequence identity zzso at the zzso to those in zzso zzso and zzso (the representative of 15 Irish zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso of these four zzso originated from the same ancestral zzso The zzso zzso element in zzso included an zzso sequence zzso at a position close to zzso resulting in a new zzso zzso contained zzso zzso of the zzso region of type I zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike the zzso region in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first report of the zzso zzso element inserted upstream of zzso in zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso
