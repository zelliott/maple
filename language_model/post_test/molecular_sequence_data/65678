zzso zzso zzso including electron capture zzso zzso and electron detachment zzso zzso are advantageous for characterization of protein zzso modifications zzso because zzso modifications are not lost during the fragmentation zzso However, at least two positive charges and relatively abundant precursor zzso are required for zzso due to charge reduction and lower fragmentation efficiency compared to conventional zzso fragmentation zzso Both these criteria are difficult to fulfill for zzso due to their zzso zzso The negative zzso mode operation of zzso is more compatible with zzso zzso but zzso suffers from a fragmentation efficiency even lower than that of zzso Recently, metal zzso such as zzso 2 and zzso 2 have been shown to provide selective enrichment of zzso from zzso zzso Here, we zzso this enrichment strategy to improve zzso and zzso of zzso This approach allowed determination of the locations of zzso sites in highly zzso multiply zzso peptides from complex zzso zzso by zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso provided complementary sequence information compared to zzso
