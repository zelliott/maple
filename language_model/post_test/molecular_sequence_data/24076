zzso bacteria have developed complex and diverse zzso mechanisms that weaken or zzso the host immune defense zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso from the human pathogen zzso zzso with an extraordinarily high degree of zzso zzso catalyzing a single zzso zzso at the lower hinge of human zzso This zzso degradation promotes zzso of zzso and interferes with the killing of group A zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso inactive zzso zzso by zzso zzso at zzso zzso Despite negligible sequence zzso to known zzso the core of the structure resembles the zzso zzso fold although with major insertions and a distinct zzso zzso Therefore zzso belongs to a unique family within the CA clan of zzso zzso Based on zzso with inhibitor complexes of zzso zzso we propose a model for zzso binding by zzso
