zzso zzso functions as the switch gene for zzso in zzso zzso by engaging a regulatory zzso Thus far the origin and evolution of both the regulatory system and zzso zzso zzso function have remained largely zzso In this study, we explore systematically the zzso zzso in a wide range of insects, including the 12 zzso zzso species, zzso zzso housefly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We find that both the zzso and zzso zzso exist in all zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is also present in zzso zzso but it does not have zzso stop zzso suggesting the zzso functional divergence between zzso and zzso after acquiring it in their common zzso Two motifs closely related to the zzso functions, the zzso binding site zzso and the zzso motif zzso surprisingly exhibit broader zzso zzso than the zzso Some previously unknown motifs that are restricted to or more abundant in zzso and zzso zzso than in other insects are also zzso Finally, zzso analysis suggests that the zzso novel zzso function in zzso is more likely attributed to the changes in the zzso and zzso rather than in the zzso zzso Thus, our results provide a clearer picture of the zzso of the zzso zzso elements and protein sequence changes, and so lead to a better understanding of the origin of zzso in zzso and also raise some new questions regarding the evolution of zzso
