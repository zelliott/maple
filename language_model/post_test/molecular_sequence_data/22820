The functions of many proteins are zzso by specific zzso changes, and therefore the ability to design primary sequences capable of secondary and zzso changes is an important step toward the creation of novel functional zzso To this end, we have developed an zzso that can zzso a single zzso acid sequence for multiple target zzso The zzso consists of an outer loop, in which sequence space is sampled by a zzso Carlo search with simulated zzso and an inner loop, in which the effect of a given zzso is evaluated on the various target structures by using the zzso packing routine and composite energy function of the protein design software, zzso We have zzso tested the method by designing a zzso zzso which can be switched from a zzso zinc zzso fold to a zzso zzso fold, depending upon the pH or the presence of transition zzso Physical characterization of zzso confirms that it is able to zzso adopt each intended target zzso
