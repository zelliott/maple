We determined the complete zzso sequence of a mild strain of Japanese yam mosaic zzso zzso and compared it with the published sequence of severe strain of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso zzso in zzso excluding the zzso zzso tail, and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Among nine potential zzso sites, only the zzso and zzso recognition sites (between zzso and zzso had different sequences from those of zzso The data confirm the strain status of these two viruses with zzso sequence identity for the zzso and approximately zzso identities for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The most divergent products zzso and zzso had zzso and zzso sequence identities zzso
