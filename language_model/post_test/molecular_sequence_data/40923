Plants express many zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins that sense and zzso different zzso zzso Previously, we reported divergent soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with differential abilities to activate zzso zzso To zzso biological functions of divergent zzso zzso we isolated a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso shows highest identity with zzso at the protein sequence zzso zzso of zzso was high in roots, leaves, and flowers but low in zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was induced by exposure to salicylic acid or zzso zzso showed typical characteristics of zzso such as zzso zzso mobility shift and zzso binding zzso In zzso zzso zzso was recognized only by zzso against zzso but not by zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was able to activate zzso zzso but did not activate zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as a zzso protein in zzso with characteristics similar to soybean divergent zzso at the zzso zzso
