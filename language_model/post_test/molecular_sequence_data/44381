zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso with numerous zzso zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and alcohol zzso E zzso The goal of this study was to determine whether the genes zzso these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might derive from a zzso by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for zzso zzso genes zzso heat shock protein 60, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso zzso gene and the zzso gene of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso positions were estimated in relation to zzso zzso and zzso cloned from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso that contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso showed fewer zzso identities to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso than to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which targets its zzso to zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses also suggested as less likely zzso zzso zzso sharing more recent common ancestry with zzso zzso zzso than with zzso of bacteria and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes an zzso fusion zzso with an zzso zzso at its zzso half and an zzso zzso 3) zzso at its zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso zzso showed extensive zzso identities to zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and lesser identities to the class 3 zzso of zzso and zzso (19 to zzso zzso analyses zzso a closer relationship of the zzso zzso zzso to bacterial zzso than to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were most similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, while the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was most similar to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes (and probably zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these zzso genes zzso These are the first zzso zzso zzso of zzso implicated to have derived from zzso
