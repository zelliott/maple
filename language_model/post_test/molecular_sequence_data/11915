To evaluate the patterns of expression of beta zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso in the human eye and to determine the zzso distribution of the beta 2 zzso in the human zzso zzso 

Total zzso extracted from human zzso zzso was screened by Northern zzso analysis with zzso zzso for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and beta 2) or the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were raised to the zzso and zzso terminal regions of the human beta 2 zzso zzso chain reaction was used to verify the expression of beta 2 zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso for the zzso beta 1 and beta 2 zzso zzso were present at different levels in all the zzso zzso except the zzso which expressed only beta zzso No transcripts for the alpha or beta zzso of the zzso were detected in the zzso zzso beta 2 specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso recognized a zzso to zzso protein in the zzso zzso and the core protein of 32 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso indicates that the zzso beta 2 zzso is expressed zzso in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso beta 2 zzso in the human zzso cell line, zzso was confirmed by zzso chain reaction amplification and Southern zzso zzso 

The zzso beta 2 zzso zzso but not zzso was expressed widely in zzso zzso of the human zzso The restricted cellular distribution of beta 2 zzso within the zzso cells represents an important differential gene marker associated with the multiple alpha zzso zzso of zzso
