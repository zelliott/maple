The gene zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso isolated from Antarctic soil, was zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso which is a member of zzso zzso zzso group of the zzso family, is a zzso zzso zzso with high zzso activity at low temperatures zzso degrees zzso low zzso energy zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso value of 16 zzso for zzso zzso during incubation at 40 degrees C and pH zzso A three-dimensional structural model of zzso predicted that zzso was located in the loop near the active site of zzso and that substitution of this zzso zzso by zzso should potentially zzso the zzso environment of the zzso Thus, we introduced the zzso substitution into the zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso value for zzso zzso of the zzso during incubation at 40 degrees C and pH zzso was zzso zzso which was significantly greater than that of the zzso zzso The zzso value of the zzso was lower for all zzso examined than the value of the wild zzso Moreover, this zzso substitution caused a shift of the zzso length specificity of the zzso toward higher preference for zzso fatty acid zzso All of these observations could be explained in terms of a decrease in zzso flexibility brought about by the zzso and were consistent with the hypothesis that cold activity and zzso arise from local flexibility around the active site of the zzso
