zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso commonly known as zzso zzso is a zzso herb medicine and zzso In this study, a large number of plants were zzso via zzso from immature zzso zzso in zzso zzso by a simple and efficient zzso Compared with the mother donor plant, the zzso plants did not exhibit visible zzso variations in six major zzso traits examined at the stage of zzso under field zzso To gain insight into the zzso stability of these zzso plants, 63 individuals were randomly zzso among a population of more than 2,000 zzso and were compared with the single mother donor plant by two molecular zzso the zzso sequence repeats zzso and randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso variation was detected in the 63 zzso whereas zzso zzso in the donor plant was deemed minimal by testing 30 zzso zzso from zzso seeds of the same donor zzso The percentages of zzso bands zzso in the zzso and zzso analysis were respectively zzso and zzso for the 63 zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the genetic similarity values calculated on the basis of zzso and zzso data among the 64 plants zzso zzso and one zzso were respectively zzso and zzso which allow zzso of the plants into distinct zzso zzso randomly isolated bands underlying the changed zzso or zzso patterns were zzso and three of them showed significant zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison at one locus between the donor plant and a zzso revealed that zzso of two short (24 and 19 zzso stretches of zzso in the zzso plant relative to the donor plant occurred in an apparently zzso zzso
