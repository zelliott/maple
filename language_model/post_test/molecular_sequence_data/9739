A novel human zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso was isolated from an activated zzso zzso zzso The zzso has four zzso positioned in a manner that identifies zzso as a member of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence shows zzso identity with zzso The gene consists of 3 zzso and 2 zzso with the position of zzso boundaries similar to that of zzso The gene is expressed as a zzso transcript on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a small percentage of primary activated T zzso but on repeated stimulation the percentage of T zzso that respond to zzso zzso The zzso zzso does not induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso B zzso and freshly isolated resting T zzso Similarly, zzso while acting as a mild zzso for primary activated T zzso is a potent zzso for chronically activated T zzso but has no zzso activity for zzso zzso zzso and resting T zzso As zzso acts specifically on activated T zzso it may play a role in the trafficking of zzso T zzso to inflammatory sites and other aspects of activated T zzso zzso
