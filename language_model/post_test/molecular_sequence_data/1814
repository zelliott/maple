zzso is an zzso zzso recently identified as an zzso zzso for the growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is involved in a novel system for regulating zzso zzso To study the biological activities of zzso using zzso zzso administration, we constructed zzso expression zzso containing the full length zzso of zzso zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso consisting of the first seven zzso of zzso (including zzso zzso with zzso with addition of a basic zzso acid, zzso zzso at the zzso After intramuscular injection of zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso expressions of zzso and its zzso were observed 30 days zzso The level of zzso increased in rat serum, and was significantly higher than that of the control group 20 days zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Administration of 150 zzso of zzso and zzso enhanced growth in rats over 30 days and great zzso responses were observed at day 10 and 20 zzso respectively, whose body weight gains were on average zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso significantly heavier than zzso These results suggested that skeletal muscle might have the potential to perform zzso zzso for zzso and short zzso zzso might have the biological effects as wild type zzso
