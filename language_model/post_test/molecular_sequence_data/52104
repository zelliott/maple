We have identified a second baby with the fetal zzso zzso zzso It was observed in a Caucasian infant from zzso at least zzso additional members of that family were known to have had a zzso zzso similar to that seen in the zzso and in a previously described baby zzso zzso of amplified DNA that included zzso zzso the G gamma gene greatly facilitated the zzso The G gamma X chain was readily isolated by reversed phase high performance liquid zzso its quantity was approximately zzso of total zzso Interestingly, the baby also carried the A gamma T zzso on one zzso either in zzso or in trans to the G gamma X zzso zzso zzso Ripley could be isolated in reasonably pure form by zzso zzso The isolated zzso FX was zzso had spectral changes characteristic for the zzso while its zzso zzso reacted rapidly with zzso zzso affinity data could not be zzso It is suggested that the formation of a rather large amount zzso zzso of mixed hybrids zzso zzso gamma zzso with low oxygen affinity is the main cause for the occurrence of the zzso zzso
