zzso are key components of the zzso immune system and are well-established protein therapeutic zzso Typically zzso zzso are obtained by zzso of zzso species that need to be humanized to reduce their zzso The zzso regions zzso contain the zzso in a defined loop structure that zzso zzso zzso which must be retained in the humanized zzso To design a humanized zzso we graft the mature zzso zzso onto a zzso human zzso zzso zzso defects due to zzso at the graft interface can be fixed by mutating some framework zzso to zzso or by mutating some zzso on the zzso zzso to human or to a de zzso designed zzso The first approach, framework redesign, can yield an zzso with binding better than the zzso graft and one equivalent to the mature zzso and reduced zzso The second approach, zzso redesign, is presented here as a new approach, yielding an zzso with binding better than the zzso zzso and zzso potentially less than that from framework zzso Application of both approaches to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is presented and the concept of the hybrid zzso approach that retains zzso to zzso zzso framework zzso acids and uses de zzso zzso design to minimize zzso zzso acid content and reduce zzso zzso liabilities is zzso
