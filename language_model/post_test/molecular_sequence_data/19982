The aim of this study was to determine the structural relationships of zzso and other resistance genes in four zzso contained in four clinical zzso of zzso zzso In the four zzso the sequences surrounding zzso were similar to those described for zzso zzso zzso zzso The four zzso carried a class 1 zzso gene belonging to the complex class 1 zzso Three of the strains contained an identical zzso coding for resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso The fourth strain contained a different zzso coding for resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the last zzso copies of zzso and zzso were zzso We describe two new and different zzso containing zzso These zzso code for resistance to different groups of zzso agents from zzso zzso clinical strains isolated in the zzso
