During our investigation of the zzso of human wound infections and zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was frequently zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso criteria, the strains were tentatively identified as belonging to the family zzso but they did not appear to zzso to any recognized species of this zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing showed that the 14 novel strains were zzso homogeneous and confirmed their placement in the zzso zzso zzso divergence values zzso % with respect to reference zzso species demonstrated that the strains isolated represent a novel zzso On the basis of zzso criteria and zzso considerations, it is proposed that these strains isolated from human sources should be assigned to a novel species of the zzso zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
