zzso zzso synthetic analog of zzso II that contains a zzso hinge between the two zzso and a model zzso sequence at the zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso To develop novel zzso peptides with enhanced activities and zzso index, we designed several zzso zzso III zzso by zzso of zzso acids in the zzso hinge region and two zzso of zzso zzso and examined their zzso activity and mechanism of zzso The substitution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso hinge region with other zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect zzso activity, while the substitution of the first four zzso acids zzso with a model zzso sequence increased the zzso activity up to zzso Like zzso zzso zzso III zzso penetrated the bacterial cell zzso without significantly zzso them and were accumulated inside zzso zzso zzso III zzso were shown to bind DNA in zzso and the DNA binding affinity of the peptides correlated zzso with their zzso zzso Among the zzso III zzso the therapeutic index of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were improved zzso compared to that of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso III zzso appear to be promising candidates for future development as novel zzso zzso
