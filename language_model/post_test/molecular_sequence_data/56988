zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso zzso was cloned into zzso zzso zzso and zzso colonies were isolated on minimal plates containing zzso as the only carbon and energy zzso In these zzso zzso located zzso was zzso upstream from the coding sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis together with mapping of the zzso start point of the zzso zzso in the zzso plasmids revealed that zzso of the zzso sequences present in the zzso zzso and zzso sequence located in the terminal zzso repeats of zzso had generated functional promoters under selective pressure in zzso zzso zzso These promoter sequences show similarity to the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso 70 promoter consensus zzso In three of the six fusion promoters zzso the generation combined two distinct events: zzso of zzso into DNA containing potential zzso sequences and point zzso in these zzso These zzso made the zzso sequences more like the zzso 70 promoter consensus zzso
