To investigate the importance of a zzso region spanning zzso 137 to zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso we used zzso zzso to change zzso that are highly zzso in this zzso Chicken zzso zzso infected with a zzso zzso containing zzso instead of zzso at zzso 148 zzso appeared more rounded than cells zzso a normal zzso zzso and they formed colonies in soft zzso zzso zzso containing zzso instead of zzso at zzso 155 zzso or zzso instead of zzso at zzso 170 zzso also appeared transformed and were zzso independent, but to a lesser extent than zzso zzso of zzso 201 from zzso to zzso zzso had no zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activity of cells infected with zzso or zzso was elevated zzso zzso of zzso (or, to a lesser extent, of zzso increased the number of proteins zzso on zzso in infected zzso All of the zzso were zzso in zzso on zzso instead of zzso as observed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be associated with a zzso zzso activity, a factor which appears to be necessary for transformation by zzso protein zzso These results show that a single point zzso in the zzso region of the cellular zzso gene can activate its transforming zzso This type of zzso is in a new category of zzso at the zzso zzso that activate but do not cause a shift in zzso at the zzso zzso
