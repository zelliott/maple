The regulatory DNA sequence elements that control the expression of the zzso B virus zzso and zzso genes in the differentiated human zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso human zzso cell line, zzso and the human cervical zzso cell line, zzso zzso were analyzed using transient zzso zzso In this system, the zzso B virus zzso I located between coordinates 1071 zzso and zzso zzso increases zzso from the zzso promoter located between coordinates zzso zzso and zzso zzso more than zzso in the differentiated zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso In the zzso zzso cell line, zzso the zzso I sequence increases the level of zzso from the zzso promoter approximately zzso The zzso I zzso between coordinates zzso zzso and zzso zzso appears to be important for zzso function only in the differentiated zzso cell lines, whereas the zzso I zzso between coordinates zzso zzso and zzso zzso is required for zzso activity in each of the cell lines zzso In all of the cell lines, the zzso minimal promoter element was within a zzso sequence located between coordinates zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso I sequence increases zzso from the zzso promoter approximately 3- to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, whereas it had little influence on the level of zzso from this promoter in zzso and zzso zzso The minimal zzso promoter element was within a 105 zzso sequence located between coordinates zzso zzso and zzso zzso This indicates that the levels of zzso from the zzso and zzso gene promoters are determined in a zzso manner, in part, by the zzso B virus zzso I and the corresponding minimal promoter zzso
