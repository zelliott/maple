Signaling through the zzso zzso zzso is required for development and maintenance of the immune zzso The zzso for zzso is zzso consisting of a common gamma chain zzso zzso by zzso and an alpha zzso zzso zzso by zzso The zzso gene is expressed specifically in the immune system in a zzso zzso zzso It is not known how the zzso gene is zzso regulated during B cell zzso The goal of this study is to zzso the function of the zzso promoter region in developing B zzso Using a combination of zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends analysis, transient zzso zzso and zzso I hypersensitivity zzso we identified the location of the zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso mobility shift analysis, zzso zzso experiments, and zzso interference experiments, we found that the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso protein zzso activate the zzso promoter by interacting with a highly zzso zzso binding zzso In committed B lineage cells, zzso can promote zzso zzso in the absence of zzso However, the results of zzso gene transfer experiments suggest that zzso is uniquely required to initiate zzso of the zzso locus at the earliest stages of zzso B cell zzso In zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso is regulated by both zzso and zzso in developing B zzso
