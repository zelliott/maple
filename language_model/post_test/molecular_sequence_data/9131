zzso bacteria use the type 3 zzso system zzso to colonize host zzso zzso are zzso zzso complexes specific for the transport of zzso molecules into host zzso It was recently suggested that a zzso zzso protein complex delivers zzso molecules to the zzso However, how transport of zzso proteins is regulated is not zzso Here, we report the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the whole zzso domain of zzso zzso a major component of the inner zzso rings in zzso zzso zzso folds as an zzso domain, which specifically binds zzso zzso Indeed, zzso binds to zzso a zzso component of zzso as revealed in zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis showed specific interaction of zzso with a zzso zzso only if zzso In total, 24 copies of the zzso crystal structure were fitted into the zzso map of the zzso zzso The zzso binding site of each zzso zzso faces the channel of the zzso allowing interaction with zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and host cell invasion studies of zzso zzso knockout cells indicated that the zzso binding of zzso is essential for bacterial zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is involved in zzso zzso
