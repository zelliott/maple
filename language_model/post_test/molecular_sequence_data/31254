The zzso gene encodes zzso zzso zzso protein zzso an zzso protein expressed primarily in zzso zzso We have used in zzso zzso studies to show that the zzso level of zzso of the human gene zzso zzso is controlled by two distinct zzso promoter elements that direct zzso from a specific start zzso One zzso is located about 25 base pairs upstream from the zzso start site, contains a zzso box, and apparently acts together with a sequence found around the zzso start zzso The other zzso is located between zzso and zzso zzso downstream from the zzso start zzso Most of this second region zzso with the zzso zzso which starts at zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso to zzso indicates that both initiators are used by zzso zzso zzso
