In order to get a comprehensive repertoire of zzso zzso within whole zzso including orphan zzso we developed a novel zzso called zzso From only the information of a single zzso acid zzso zzso automatically zzso segments possessing high zzso in zzso zzso as defined by zzso zzso Analysis zzso These zzso clusters mainly zzso to regular secondary structures, which together form structured or zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso is opposite of disorder zzso both addressing distinct structural zzso Interestingly, there is however an overlap between the two predictions, including small segments of zzso zzso which undergo coupled folding and zzso zzso thus gives access to these specific zzso which are generally poorly represented in domain zzso zzso of the whole set of zzso predictions with the zzso zzso Database zzso also highlighted a wide proportion of predicted large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso These orphan sequences may either zzso to highly divergent members of already known families or belong to new families of zzso Their comprehensive description thus opens new avenues to investigate new functional and/or structural features, which remained so far zzso Altogether, the data described here provide new insights into the protein architecture and organization throughout the three zzso of zzso
