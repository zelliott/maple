Human zzso of the highly prevalent zzso virus zzso have been classified into five major zzso groups zzso The geographical distribution of the groups throughout the world is not well zzso Five different zzso zzso were developed in an attempt to amplify specifically zzso zzso of each zzso zzso zzso samples collected from 72 Brazilian adults (24 voluntary blood donors, 24 zzso B virus zzso carriers, and 24 human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso were zzso zzso DNA from at least one zzso group was detected in 11 zzso blood donors, 13 zzso zzso carriers, and 24 zzso zzso zzso All five zzso groups were detected in the three zzso with the exception of group 2 in blood zzso Some samples, negative with all five specific zzso were positive with the commonly used untranslated region zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso DNA was detected in some samples by using specific zzso but not with the zzso zzso Mixed infections with zzso zzso zzso from different groups were detected in zzso blood donors, zzso zzso carriers, and zzso zzso zzso Fifteen zzso products (three obtained with each zzso were zzso Most sequences showed high zzso zzso with those of zzso zzso belonging to their presumed zzso However, three sequences had low zzso with all zzso sequences available from the DNA zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso belonging to all five known zzso groups circulate in Brazil, and the results suggest the existence of new and as yet zzso major zzso zzso
