zzso zzso zzso is an zzso type zzso zzso specifically associated with a contagious lung cancer of sheep zzso pulmonary zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso cells in the lungs of zzso sheep were identified as major sites of zzso replication by zzso techniques and zzso amplification of part of zzso zzso zzso was not detected outside the lungs and their draining zzso zzso However, low levels of zzso expression in zzso zzso could have been masked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso which were differentiated from zzso by the lack of a zzso restriction site in the zzso zzso To further investigate the zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed utilizing zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso where major differences between zzso and zzso sequences zzso This technique was shown to be zzso or zzso zzso more sensitive than the previous gag zzso zzso zzso Using this new zzso the tissue distribution of zzso in sheep with natural and zzso induced zzso was zzso zzso DNA and zzso transcripts were found in all zzso and lung zzso of zzso sheep zzso zzso zzso and in several zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso draining the lungs were consistently demonstrated to be infected by zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso DNA was also detected in these zzso although in a much lower proportion of zzso zzso was not detected in 27 samples from unaffected control animals zzso zzso zzso
