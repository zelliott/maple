The zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been investigated in zzso cell lines zzso with zzso zzso either zzso or zzso human insulin zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso zzso insulin receptors resulted in the rapid and substantial zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso which zzso zzso basic zzso zzso and two zzso zzso based on sites zzso on zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso Further zzso of zzso extracts by zzso zzso revealed two zzso of zzso zzso basic protein zzso activity which were highly related to the previously described zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, at least two major zzso of zzso zzso activity were zzso which exhibited properties similar to the 70 zzso and 90 zzso zzso zzso described by zzso the zzso effect of insulin was on the activity of the 90 zzso zzso and was in excess of zzso zzso zzso zzso of extracts from parental zzso cells, or cells expressing zzso zzso showed all zzso zzso of activity to be almost completely zzso zzso Further studies demonstrated that substitution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso with zzso led to a substantial reduction in the ability of insulin to stimulate these protein zzso activities when zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, deletion of 69 zzso acids from the zzso of the insulin zzso zzso caused a zzso shift in the insulin zzso curve of the zzso zzso activity, but apparently not in that of the 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso
