zzso the satellite DNA in the zzso species zzso zzso we found two unrelated families of satellite zzso Because these satellite DNA families were isolated using the two zzso zzso and zzso we called the two families zzso and zzso family, zzso The zzso family proved to be organized in a zzso basic unit zzso the zzso family in a zzso basic unit zzso The latter represents perhaps the longest satellite DNA isolated up to now in zzso The zzso family apparently comprises about zzso of the total zzso DNA whereas the zzso family represents only about zzso A comparative analysis of the two satellite DNA sequences showed no zzso between the two families although both sequences possessed long A and T zzso Eight of the 34 zzso showed zzso with the zzso family and zzso signals are visible in six zzso with the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso mobility of satellite DNA on zzso zzso showed that the zzso family is only slightly zzso However, the unit of the zzso satellite DNA family has zzso especially the first 1000 zzso of the zzso zzso in which this DNA is AT rich and has numerous A and T zzso There are also internal zzso zzso in each zzso The sequences of satellite DNA families found in zzso zzso are different from the sequences of other satellite zzso cloned in insects, including other species of zzso
