The zzso reduction of zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso consumption of oxygen and the reduction of zzso by zzso in zzso were zzso zzso reduced zzso with a zzso rate of up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 20 degrees zzso Rates of 220 zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso consumption of oxygen and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso at 20 C were zzso The reactions were sensitive towards zzso but insensitive towards zzso Both reduction of zzso and consumption of oxygen by zzso rapidly increased with increasing zzso For the zzso respiratory activity, a zzso ratio of zzso was zzso This indicates that zzso was oxidized to the level of zzso zzso Reduction of zzso by zzso was monitored with an zzso zzso Reduction of zzso b was zzso by zzso in the presence of excess zzso under zzso zzso This zzso zzso of zzso b suggests that electron transport from zzso to oxygen in zzso zzso employs the zzso zzso complex via the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequence with the sequence of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and of the zzso c from zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso from zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family of zzso
