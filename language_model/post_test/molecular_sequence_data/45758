The zzso regulators for zzso zzso include members of proteins containing an zzso domain, a zzso zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso and zzso expression of the structural genes zzso the zzso for zzso zzso is thought to be determined by combinations of the zzso zzso and zzso factors and their zzso While the zzso Japanese morning glory zzso zzso exhibits blue flowers with colored stems and zzso seeds, the c zzso display white flowers with red stems and colored seeds, and the ca zzso exhibit white flowers with green stems and ivory zzso Here, we characterize the zzso expression of three zzso zzso three zzso genes and two zzso genes in zzso zzso We also show that the zzso zzso and ca zzso are zzso zzso caused by a 2 zzso deletion and 7 zzso insertions in the genes for the zzso and zzso zzso regulators designated as zzso and zzso zzso In addition to defects in zzso stem and seed zzso the ca zzso were found to show reduced zzso formation in seeds but to produce leaf and stem zzso and root hairs zzso Except for the gene for zzso zzso E in the ca zzso all structural genes tested were zzso reduced in both zzso and ca zzso flower zzso However, slight but significant expression of the genes for zzso zzso D, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso for zzso zzso was zzso in zzso and ca zzso whereas no such residual expression could be observed in other genes involved in the later zzso zzso zzso The biological roles of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso traits and their evolutionary implications are also zzso
