We zzso that indirect recognition of zzso peptides might zzso the zzso to donor zzso In this study, we looked at the potential of two class I peptides derived from the alpha 1 and alpha 2 regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso by varying zzso of two zzso peptides covering zzso zzso and zzso The injections were under the zzso and were repeated on day zzso The thickness of the zzso was measured to control zzso hypersensitivity zzso The animals were sacrificed on day 16 and the zzso were tested in mixed zzso culture as zzso against zzso zzso cells and zzso third-party zzso In addition, the zzso of the cells was measured using flow zzso with zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso class II, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced strong zzso of the zzso recipient animals at zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The stimulation index was 2-3 times higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to induce zzso at the zzso used, but surprisingly induced a zzso zzso that was highest at 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso In proliferation experiments zzso zzso rats proliferated only to zzso zzso in zzso
