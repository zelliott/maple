zzso modification of proteins is a universal form of cellular zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso by protein zzso is the most widespread and versatile form of zzso zzso zzso changes in activity, zzso or stability of zzso drives cellular zzso zzso and zzso analyses estimate that zzso of zzso proteins are zzso at any given zzso Multiple approaches have been developed to systematically define targets of protein zzso however, it is likely that we have yet to zzso the full complement of the zzso The zzso acids that surround a zzso site are zzso zzso for protein zzso For example, zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C and zzso zzso recognize basic side chains preceding the target zzso or zzso zzso In the present paper we describe a strategy using zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify and characterize previously zzso zzso sequences for protein zzso zzso We found that the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can both be zzso by zzso Furthermore, we show that the adapter protein zzso zzso product of zzso zzso and zzso domain protein zzso is a zzso zzso that is zzso on zzso inside cells and that this mode of regulation may control its ability to affect cell zzso
