While the zzso zzso is a key zzso complex, little is known about how zzso levels are maintained in higher zzso zzso Here we describe an zzso interference zzso screen of zzso zzso that was used to identify zzso factors that may play a role in maintaining levels of the zzso zzso We used an zzso library against zzso zzso zzso factor genes to identify genes whose suppression in Schneider 2 cells stabilized a zzso fluorescent protein reporter zzso This screen identified zzso zzso 'n' zzso zzso basic region zzso zzso as a candidate zzso regulator of zzso component zzso In fact, zzso zzso activity was reduced in cells depleted of zzso zzso zzso against zzso components revealed a general decline in both zzso regulatory complex and zzso zzso zzso after zzso depletion of this zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the longest of the seven transcripts for the zzso zzso zzso was needed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso confirmed the role of zzso in zzso of zzso of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso form of zzso revealed that the zzso factor is itself a zzso zzso that is stabilized when the zzso is zzso We propose that this single zzso gene in zzso resembles the ancestral gene family of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso factors, which are essential in regulating zzso stress and zzso
