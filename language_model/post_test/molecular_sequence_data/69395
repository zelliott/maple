In various animal models of tissue injury, zzso factor zzso and related peptides inhibit zzso zzso and loss of protein from the vascular zzso To search for smaller zzso segments of zzso that might retain zzso activity, the authors tested peptides similar to the zzso terminals of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Also, because zzso zzso resembles zzso a sequence found in many intermediate filament zzso analogous peptides were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso and the fragments, zzso and zzso were inactive when zzso at 5 zzso zzso on zzso induced in the zzso zzso zzso after immersion in 58 degrees C water for 1 zzso Crude zzso zzso and zzso were found to have activity in this zzso zzso of the structures within the crude mixture revealed that substitution of the zzso acid zzso with an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso increased the overall zzso The zzso zzso was a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso reaction that occurs during hydrogen zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
