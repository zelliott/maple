zzso forms of the zzso zzso were reported infecting several fish species from the North African coasts of central Mediterranean zzso zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso analysis was used to investigate the occurrence of zzso forms of different zzso species in zzso zzso and zzso from North African coasts of the Mediterranean Sea and to establish the geographical and host range of these zzso in this zzso A total of 282 zzso larvae were identified by zzso from 13 zzso fish species and one zzso species captured at different sites off the zzso zzso and Libyan zzso The type I larvae were found with a frequency of zzso and were identified as belonging to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrids and zzso zzso The type II larvae were found to belong to zzso zzso with the frequency of zzso The record of zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrids, previously recorded from the Spanish and Portuguese Atlantic coasts and the zzso Sea, extends their geographic distribution to the zzso zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso zzso and hybrids away from their known area of distribution may predict the successful use of zzso larvae for tagging zzso zzso fish stocks for fisheries management zzso Moreover, the results reported provide valuable information regarding the diversity of zzso species in the study area, indicating that several zzso sibling and zzso coexist in the North African coasts of the Mediterranean zzso
