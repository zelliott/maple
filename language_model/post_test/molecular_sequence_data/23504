Here we provide evidence that the zzso and zzso proteins of budding zzso act together with zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso reduce zzso spore zzso and crossing over to the same extent as zzso In all three zzso these defects are largely suppressed by overproduction of zzso In addition, zzso and zzso like zzso suppress the zzso arrest zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso to zzso on zzso zzso and their zzso is mutually zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso is not affected in either zzso or zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that the zzso and zzso proteins are accessory factors specific to zzso We speculate that zzso and zzso are necessary for efficient formation of zzso zzso filaments in zzso
