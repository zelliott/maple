The two zzso DNA initiation signals, zzso and zzso of the broad zzso zzso zzso contain proposed zzso zzso Nine single zzso zzso in the stem of the zzso structure, each of which destroyed a relevant base zzso damaged the zzso zzso A second zzso change was introduced into each of the nine zzso zzso in such a way that the base pairing was zzso Only three out of nine second base changes that restored the base pairing restored the zzso activity up to the zzso zzso Thus, the three are zzso zzso The results strongly suggested that, in the area of the stem of zzso where the zzso zzso fell, base pairing was the most important structural zzso for the zzso zzso By contrast, it is most probable that, in the other part of the stem of zzso both zzso and the intrinsic base sequence were the major zzso of the zzso zzso
