Four zzso zzso zzso are expressed in zzso zzso In adult plants, two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso reactions of zzso and zzso were expressed in roots, zzso and zzso A gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso the same reaction as zzso was expressed specifically in leaves, while a gene zzso an zzso involved in zzso chain zzso acid metabolism was expressed in stems and zzso In young zzso only zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso In hypoxic zzso zzso the amounts of transcript and putative protein of zzso zzso zzso increased while those of zzso zzso zzso decreased and in zzso zzso activities changed as revealed by zzso and zzso zzso Under zzso zzso zzso only zzso synthesis while zzso synthesis using zzso as zzso donor was zzso As a result, zzso accumulated as the major zzso acid in hypoxic zzso instead of zzso in agreement with the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso at both the zzso and zzso levels allowed for an increase in gene expression and orientation of the activity of the product of its zzso towards zzso synthesis under zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso synthesis occurred at the expense of either zzso or zzso as zzso zzso indicating that a zzso zzso was operating together with zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both zzso seemed to be inhibited by zzso resulting in a very low amount of zzso in hypoxic zzso
