The hairpin zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined the roles of zzso zzso in zzso using an zzso zzso rescue zzso Loss of the active site zzso zzso reduced the zzso rate constant by zzso while loss of A9 and A10 zzso reduced activity less than zzso Certain zzso zzso restored partial activity when provided in solution to the zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso that were capable of rescue shared the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in common with the zzso hydrogen bonding face of zzso In contrast to the shallow pH dependence of unmodified zzso activity, rescue activity increased sharply with decreasing zzso These results support a novel model for zzso zzso in which a zzso zzso contributes zzso stabilization to negative charge developing in the transition zzso
