Multiple factors, including members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso family of zzso are important zzso in the regulation of zzso pattern formation during zzso zzso By using an expression cloning approach to identify novel factors that could regulate zzso patterning in the zzso zzso we isolated the zzso zzso of the human zzso gene by virtue of its ability to induce a secondary zzso zzso While zzso zzso have been identified in a variety of species, and human zzso is zzso in human tumors, the biological function of zzso is zzso To explore the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso a secondary zzso zzso we used zzso zzso and zzso zzso The secondary axis induced by zzso is distinct from that induced by zzso of zzso or zzso pathways but similar to that induced by zzso of zzso signaling or zzso of an zzso zzso However, zzso did not inhibit zzso signaling in zzso animal cap zzso indicating that zzso does not inhibit zzso zzso Similar to zzso of an zzso pathway, expression of zzso zzso molecular markers for zzso in animal cap zzso although expression of zzso zzso markers was very weak and substantially zzso Yet, zzso does not require activity of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso induction as zzso components of the zzso zzso did not prevent zzso induction of zzso zzso Finally, like zzso zzso zzso requires zzso signaling for expression of zzso zzso zzso presented in this study demonstrate that zzso can induce zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso axis formation, suggesting a role for this large zzso zzso gene family in early zzso
