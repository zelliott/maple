Mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiate into zzso zzso cells upon expression of the zzso factor zzso but commit to the zzso zzso lineage in its zzso We report the redirected differentiation of class zzso zzso into zzso zzso T cells upon loss of zzso zzso factor zzso A zzso sequence within the zzso locus acts as a zzso zzso that is essential for zzso repression and for development of zzso T zzso Thus, zzso expression and genetic programming for T helper cell development are actively inhibited by zzso zzso activity, allowing for zzso T cell zzso Identification of the zzso factors network in zzso and zzso lineage choice provides insight into how distinct T cell zzso are developed for regulating the zzso immune zzso
