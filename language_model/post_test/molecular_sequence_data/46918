zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso using native signal zzso or the zzso zzso zzso to direct proteins into the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present as zzso functional proteins in culture zzso when expressed from zzso containing the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by affinity zzso zzso rabbit zzso at zzso similar to the respective native zzso However, incomplete processing of the signal sequence resulted in zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso with the majority of the protein containing zzso extensions derived from the zzso zzso zzso in which most of the zzso zzso was present were also zzso zzso of zzso repeats at the zzso end of the zzso zzso led to efficient processing zzso to the zzso zzso but inefficient removal of the repeats themselves, resulting in zzso with zzso zzso still containing zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expressed with the native signal zzso was zzso correctly zzso and also fully zzso No expression of zzso from a construct containing the native zzso signal zzso was zzso The zzso signal zzso directed correct processing and zzso of both zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso when used in expression zzso and is suggested to have general utility for synthesis of correctly processed proteins in zzso
