zzso culture has been exploited to understand molecular aspects of zzso potential of the plants in normal and in stressed zzso The present study describes zzso radiation from zzso source as the stress zzso to assess in zzso development of zzso zzso of zzso zzso a protein-rich zzso 

zzso culture was established, using leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by manipulating plant zzso zzso were exposed to gamma zzso zzso DNA isolated from zzso callus samples were subjected to random amplified zzso DNA zzso A band of molecular weight zzso zzso was used as a probe and Southern zzso was carried zzso To determine zzso in DNA following zzso zzso bands were cloned and zzso from control and zzso zzso zzso zzso were exposed to gamma zzso and the effects were assessed immediately and after seven days of zzso zzso zzso were observed using scanning electron zzso 

zzso zzso revealed altered frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso molecular weight probe zzso with bands of low molecular zzso DNA sequences from zzso samples showed zzso when compared to zzso zzso electron zzso illustrated presence of transient pores on the exposed zzso zzso search of the DNA sequences showed partial zzso with some sequences from zzso zzso 

The present report might help in designing a breeding program, where both radiation coupled with zzso zzso could be employed to build up the desired zzso
