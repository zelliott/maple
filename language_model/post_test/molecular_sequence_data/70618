In zzso the zzso calcium concentration is maintained within a narrow range despite large variations in daily dietary input and body zzso The small zzso and kidney constitute the influx pathways into the zzso zzso pool and, therefore, play a primary role in zzso zzso We identified an zzso zzso influx channel, which is expressed in zzso small zzso the zzso part of the zzso and zzso This novel zzso zzso channel zzso of 730 zzso acids contains six putative zzso zzso with an additional zzso stretch predicted to be the pore zzso zzso resembles the recently cloned zzso zzso and the transient zzso zzso zzso channels with respect to its predicted zzso but shares less than zzso sequence zzso with these zzso In zzso zzso is abundantly present in the zzso membrane of zzso transporting cells and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso influx with properties identical to those observed in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso has the expected properties for being the gatekeeper of zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso
