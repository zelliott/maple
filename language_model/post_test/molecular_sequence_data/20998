We investigated the expression pattern of zzso responsive zzso zzso in tomato under different zzso zzso Full length zzso zzso was isolated from tomato plant, followed by zzso analysis based on deduced zzso acid sequences that revealed significant sequence similarity to zzso proteins belonging to diverse families of plant zzso Southern zzso analysis showed duplicate copies of zzso in the tomato zzso while zzso expression profiling indicated zzso expression of zzso in all tested zzso which was particularly strong in zzso zzso expression was significantly induced by zzso drought, low temperature and zzso Moreover, zzso was slightly regulated by treatment with zzso and zzso These observations suggest that the zzso gene may be involved in the response of the tomato plant to zzso zzso reports zzso zzso zzso
