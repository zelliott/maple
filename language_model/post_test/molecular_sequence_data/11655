A set of three zzso zzso of sequence zzso containing zzso zzso either as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso primer zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are good zzso for zzso We zzso that a single zzso zzso linkage (which has a zzso equivalent to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso is formed in the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso transitions were monitored for the zzso duplexes using zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso The CD zzso of the two types of zzso hybrids closely resemble the unmodified parent duplex, forming zzso zzso in 150 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso melting results indicate that both hybrids have zzso comparable with the parent duplex as measured by zzso or delta G degree zzso These studies indicate that zzso modified zzso or zzso DNA are good zzso of normal zzso
