Adult workers of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from colonies heavily infected with zzso zzso were selected for molecular analyses of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and compared to zzso zzso The zzso products corresponded to zzso zzso We then infected zzso zzso with zzso zzso spores isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso emerged bees from healthy colonies were fed zzso 20,000 and 40,000 zzso There were significant dosage dependent differences in bee infection and survival zzso The ratio of infected cells to zzso cells increased at 6, 10 and 14 d post zzso In addition, zzso zzso of bees from the control group had significantly higher protein zzso than infected zzso zzso infected with 40,000 zzso had the lowest protein zzso Thus, zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso is capable of infecting another bee species, zzso zzso zzso protein production and reducing bee survival in zzso zzso
