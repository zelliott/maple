zzso family members are newly identified essential zzso zzso components of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are structurally highly similar and mediate zzso zzso zzso is zzso related to zzso 2 and 3, and forms a zzso complex with zzso after zzso or zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso type I zzso zzso after it was zzso by zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso mink lung zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso in zzso cells, the zzso level remaining unchanged upon zzso zzso Similar results were obtained using zzso cells, which are also zzso by zzso zzso 2 and 3 zzso with zzso after zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, we observed zzso interaction between zzso and zzso zzso 2, 3 and 4 accumulated in the nucleus upon zzso treatment in zzso cells, and showed a synergistic effect in a zzso reporter zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso synergistic response by zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso complexes of zzso 2, 3 and 4, and their zzso zzso to the nucleus, which is required for efficient zzso signal zzso
