zzso of many flowers zzso a sequence of precisely regulated zzso events that include zzso of the zzso and development of the zzso The plant hormone zzso is known to play a key role in regulating the zzso and anatomical changes that constitute the zzso zzso For this reason, we have studied the zzso syndrome in zzso zzso by examining the spatial and zzso location of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso and how this zzso is regulated by factors that influence expression of genes that zzso key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso In particular, we examined the role in the zzso syndrome of the expression of the gene for zzso zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso In zzso incubation of zzso with the zzso precursor zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso activity increases after zzso in the zzso contrary to the observation that activity is zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of floral zzso indicates that the increase in zzso zzso activity is due to de zzso synthesis of zzso and presumably zzso which is induced after zzso Furthermore, the pattern of induction is consistent with a model of coordinate regulation of gene expression in which the zzso signal travels to other zzso of the flower to induce their zzso zzso We have also used in zzso zzso to define further the zzso and spatial expression of zzso zzso within the floral zzso showing that zzso zzso zzso the capability to zzso zzso to zzso is induced in all living cells of the zzso examined after zzso These findings contrast with work in zzso that suggests that zzso zzso is localized to the zzso zzso
