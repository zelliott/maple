The highly zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is a central controller of cell growth in all zzso zzso exists in two functionally and structurally distinct complexes, termed zzso complex 1 zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is present in both zzso and zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of zzso and zzso in large protein complexes in the model zzso green zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is part of a zzso zzso complex in this green zzso zzso zzso and indirect zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso and zzso exist in zzso complexes that associate with zzso zzso and are particularly abundant in the zzso body region in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso zzso is able to functionally and structurally replace zzso zzso zzso and allows us to propose that binding of zzso to zzso is essential for cell zzso
