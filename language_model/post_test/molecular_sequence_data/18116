We have characterized a new tomato zzso zzso zzso by salt stress and zzso acid zzso Its zzso sequence predicts an open reading frame coding for a highly zzso and zzso zzso protein of 130 zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of tomato DNA suggests that there is one zzso structural gene per zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates in tomato zzso upon treatment with zzso zzso or zzso It is also induced in roots, stems and leaves of zzso grown tomato plants treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso is not induced by other stress conditions such as cold and zzso The sequence of the predicted zzso protein shows four structural zzso similar to the rice zzso cotton zzso zzso and barley and zzso zzso zzso
