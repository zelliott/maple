The functional effects of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso on pig coronary arteries were characterized in zzso by using the ETA zzso zzso zzso and the zzso oxide synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 42 zzso evoked zzso zzso with zzso responses that were 151 zzso 21, 85 zzso 12 and 11 zzso zzso respectively, of zzso evoked by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso rightward shift of the response to zzso The response to the highest concentration of zzso was reduced by zzso in the presence of 10 zzso zzso Application of zzso to vessels zzso with zzso caused relaxation by zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso effect of zzso whereas the zzso responses to zzso zzso or zzso Y zzso zzso were zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso the responses to zzso and low zzso of zzso were significantly zzso The present results show that zzso zzso of zzso coronary arteries are efficiently prevented and reversed by zzso indicating that the responses are evoked by ETA zzso A portion of the contraction seems to be zzso by zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso stimulation is in part zzso by release of zzso zzso
