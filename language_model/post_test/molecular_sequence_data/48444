zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso cycle that maintains reduced pools of zzso acid and serves as an important zzso In this study, to investigate functional divergence of plant zzso family and zzso characteristics of the zzso binding site zzso zzso of zzso zzso we cloned three zzso genes zzso from zzso zzso and predicted the zzso zzso zzso protein was localized in zzso while zzso proteins showed zzso zzso Three zzso proteins showed different zzso activities, apparent kinetic zzso optimum T m and pH profiles, indicating their functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were predicted as zzso zzso based on their zzso zzso acid sequence identity and the available crystal structures of zzso zzso The zzso functions of these zzso are examined in this study through zzso zzso The aforementioned five zzso are critical components of active sites that contribute to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are also responsible for maintaining proper protein zzso This study provides new insights into the functional divergence of the plant zzso family and zzso properties of the zzso zzso in plant zzso zzso
