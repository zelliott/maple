zzso toxin zzso zzso coli zzso strains of zzso zzso are the most common human zzso zzso zzso zzso To facilitate diagnosis and zzso of these zzso we zzso and zzso characterized 100 clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso strains expressed zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso or were H zzso zzso (10 zzso 15 strains were zzso All zzso and zzso strains possessed the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso strains possessed zzso zzso coli zzso and expressed an zzso zzso Among seven zzso zzso identified, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was present solely in zzso zzso whereas most strains of the other zzso possessed zzso Moreover, only zzso zzso possessed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso the toxin was regularly expressed and was lethal to human zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was associated with zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso whereas strains of the other zzso originated mostly in patients with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso clinical zzso belong to at least four lineages that differ by H zzso types, zzso zzso and zzso putative zzso factors, with zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Isolation of zzso zzso from patients' stools on zzso zzso and the rapid initial zzso of these zzso using zzso zzso facilitate the identification of these emerging pathogens in clinical and zzso studies and enable prediction of the risk of a severe clinical zzso
