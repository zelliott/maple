A zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso consortium obtained from zzso biomass of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expanded zzso sludge bed zzso zzso fed with a mixture of volatile fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso The strain was strictly zzso and cells were curved zzso zzso zzso that sometimes formed zzso filaments from 25 to several hundred zzso in zzso zzso stained zzso and were zzso They were gently zzso by means of zzso zzso The strain grew at zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso and with zzso M zzso zzso 0 M zzso Growth and methane production was found with zzso and very weak growth with zzso zzso and zzso extract zzso growth, but were not zzso The zzso content of the DNA of strain zzso was 40 zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso was a member of the zzso zzso and showed zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso with zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso On the basis of its zzso characteristics and zzso position, strain zzso is a representative of a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
