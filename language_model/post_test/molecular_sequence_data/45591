zzso zzso virus zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in zzso regulation of both viral and cellular zzso In the present study, we chose functionally important regions within zzso zzso and zzso genes with putative zzso potential to investigate natural sequence variations among zzso Type I strains circulating in zzso Based on the identification of linked zzso zzso and zzso sequence patterns, we defined five zzso zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso 5, the most zzso from the zzso zzso showed an evolutionary history of zzso zzso events occurring upstream and downstream of the zzso of zzso The frequency of occurrence of the five newly defined zzso zzso was similar for strains causing zzso primary infection or zzso and was also similar within two of the European areas zzso In addition, preferential linkages of certain zzso zzso to distinct zzso membrane protein 1 zzso groups were found to zzso Thus, a combination of more than one zzso site in the zzso zzso might be involved in determining disease zzso
