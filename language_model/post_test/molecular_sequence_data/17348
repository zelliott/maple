zzso zzso can cause serious illness in humans, and subsequent zzso investigation requires molecular characterization to allow the identification of specific zzso zzso zzso is usually characterized by zzso and is zzso by using zzso gel zzso zzso or zzso DNA zzso provide an alternative means to resolve genetic differences among zzso and unlike zzso and zzso zzso can be used to identify specific genes associated with strains of zzso Twenty strains of zzso zzso representing six zzso were used to generate a shotgun library, and subsequently a zzso zzso was constructed by using features that included only potentially zzso gene probe zzso zzso strains of zzso zzso were zzso by using the condensed zzso including strains associated with five major zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso data grouped strains according to zzso lineage and zzso Most zzso linked strains were grouped together, and zzso resolution was the same as that with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and better than that with zzso sequence typing zzso six zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, a majority of epidemic strains were grouped together within zzso Division zzso This epidemic cluster was clearly distinct from the two other Division I zzso which zzso primarily sporadic and environmental zzso zzso function analysis allowed identification of 22 zzso from the zzso array that distinguish zzso and zzso including several potential markers that were distinct for the epidemic zzso Many of the zzso genes zzso proteins that likely zzso survival advantages in the environment and/or zzso
