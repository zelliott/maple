Chemical signaling by zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso is terminated by zzso via specialized zzso transport proteins zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In some zzso zzso particularly the sympathetic zzso of zzso zzso is converted to zzso zzso zzso and released as the primary zzso Although evidence exists for a zzso distinct zzso zzso zzso in the zzso brain and peripheral nervous system, a zzso specialized for zzso zzso clearance has yet to be zzso To pursue this issue, we cloned zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso sympathetic zzso and characterized functional properties via zzso expression in zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso was identified for which the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly enriched in zzso sympathetic zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso reveals an open reading frame coding for a protein of 630 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein sequence bears 75, 66, and zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is inhibited by catecholamines in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso more zzso than they inhibit zzso zzso by human zzso zzso whereas zzso exhibits equivalent potency between the two zzso Moreover, zzso exhibits a greater zzso zzso zzso for the terminal products of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso in which a zzso rank order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso transport of catecholamines is sensitive to cocaine and zzso zzso with zzso zzso significantly correlated with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso acid conservation and divergence of zzso with zzso zzso zzso help define zzso likely to be involved in zzso recognition and zzso as well as blockade by selective zzso zzso
