zzso data from extant donkeys zzso zzso have revealed two distinct zzso DNA zzso suggestive of two separate zzso events in northeast Africa about zzso years zzso Without distinct zzso structure in domestic donkey zzso and with little information on the genetic makeup of the ancestral African wild zzso however, it has been difficult to identify wild ancestors and geographical origins for the domestic zzso zzso Our analysis of ancient archaeological and historic museum samples provides the first genetic information on the historic zzso wild zzso zzso zzso zzso Somali wild zzso zzso zzso zzso and ancient zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso wild zzso was an zzso of the first donkey zzso In contrast, the Somali wild zzso has considerable zzso divergence from the zzso wild zzso and domestic zzso These findings resolve the long-standing issue of the role of the zzso wild zzso in the zzso of the donkey, but raise new questions regarding the second zzso for the zzso Our results illustrate the complexity of animal zzso and have conservation implications for critically endangered zzso and Somali wild zzso
