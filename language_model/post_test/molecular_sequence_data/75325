The zzso sugar chains of human zzso produced by zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells and naturally occurring human urinary zzso were liberated by zzso and zzso by paper zzso zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso column zzso Both zzso had three zzso sugar chains in one zzso all of which were zzso complex zzso zzso analysis of them revealed that the sugar chains from both zzso are quite similar except for zzso zzso All sugar chains of zzso produced by zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells contain only the zzso alpha zzso linkage, while those of human urinary zzso contain the zzso alpha zzso linkage together with the zzso alpha zzso zzso The major sugar chains were of zzso zzso complex type with and without zzso repeating units in their outer chain zzso in common, and small amounts of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso sugar chains were zzso This paper proved, for the first time, that zzso technique can produce zzso hormone whose zzso structures are common to the major sugar chains of the native zzso
