We previously detected zzso zzso zzso T cells recognizing reference strain viral zzso in subjects with progressive, chronic zzso To test whether these zzso T cells persist in zzso by failing to recognize zzso zzso zzso we compared zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso sequences with targeted zzso strain zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso in nine chronically zzso zzso zzso In five responding subjects, 10 of 26 zzso strain zzso peptides targeted by zzso T cells exactly matched zzso plasma viral zzso Four subjects with plasma viral loads zzso zzso had no measurable zzso zzso T cell responses despite carrying zzso strains that matched zzso sequences at predicted zzso These results show that zzso zzso T cells can persist in chronic zzso infection despite recognition of zzso present in zzso However, with high-level in zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells targeting zzso zzso may be zzso or zzso
