The zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is known to be expressed in most cell types of zzso zzso In the zzso we have detected a novel zzso designated zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso does not contain zzso and appears to represent a zzso zzso This gene is uniquely transcribed in zzso zzso cells in which the zzso zzso gene is not zzso zzso of the zzso sequence in a bacterial system showed that the zzso product is an active zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso (the zzso zzso formed zzso under reducing zzso Under the same conditions, zzso zzso were also found in extracts of zzso and zzso indicating the presence of zzso zzso in these cell zzso zzso is one of the very few known expressed zzso zzso a functional zzso and the presence of this gene is probably related to X zzso zzso during zzso
