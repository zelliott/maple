The evidence for the role of zzso acid in gene expression or protein synthesis in zzso is zzso To investigate this role of zzso acid, we surveyed proteins whose tissue levels are changed by zzso acid zzso by using zzso rats with a zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso Male zzso rats (7 zzso old, body weight approximately 130 zzso were fed a zzso diet containing zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso diet for 14 zzso zzso acid zzso decreased a zzso protein with an apparent molecular mass of 17 zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of 16 zzso of this zzso protein was identical to a kidney fatty zzso protein known to be generated by zzso degradation of zzso a major urinary protein of adult male zzso zzso is zzso in liver, zzso into blood and zzso into zzso but partially zzso by zzso zzso zzso It exists in kidney in a zzso modified zzso zzso acid zzso lowered the zzso level of kidney fatty zzso protein to zzso zzso zzso zzso and lowered the serum level of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the level of the control group, but did not affect the amount of zzso zzso into zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso rats was significantly lower zzso than that of the control zzso These results suggest that in male zzso rats, zzso acid zzso decreases the zzso level of kidney fatty zzso protein by lowering zzso gene expression in zzso
