Several examinations have been performed to identify the genes involved in chronic zzso failure using zzso zzso zzso Recently, many systematic techniques for examining molecular expression have been zzso They might also be effective in zzso the molecular mechanism of progressive zzso zzso In this study, digital expression profiling was carried out to construct a zzso zzso expression database for the zzso zzso zzso 

One thousand clones were randomly zzso from zzso zzso and zzso rat kidney zzso libraries, respectively, and defined by zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis was performed to search for genes zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

The growth zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso or membrane proteins were zzso but the zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso kidney zzso In zzso zzso revealed that 63 zzso were increased and 59 were decreased in the zzso zzso zzso To confirm whether the in zzso zzso database reflected the actual expression of zzso or zzso 12 known genes were examined by Northern zzso or zzso zzso The actual expression of the 12 genes was comparable with the results of in zzso zzso In addition, we successfully isolated five unknown zzso two zzso and three zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

We constructed a zzso zzso expression database for zzso zzso zzso which reflects the actual zzso in zzso expression after zzso zzso This database may be useful for zzso of the molecular mechanism of progressive zzso zzso
