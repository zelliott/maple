zzso DNA zzso sequences from eight species of zzso flies, stored for up to 50 years, were amplified zzso Universal zzso were used to amplify six specific regions from total zzso DNA, including five zzso zzso The comparison of zzso zzso and zzso techniques for DNA extraction showed that the zzso zzso was the most efficient in retrieving DNA from museum zzso although the zzso extraction procedure is currently the most frequently reported zzso zzso of the universal primer sequences with the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso that could contribute to the low recovery of a short sequence from zzso II of zzso zzso The ability to characterize zzso markers from museum specimens should be useful in comparative studies of contemporary samples and should help in zzso species introduction, colonization and zzso
