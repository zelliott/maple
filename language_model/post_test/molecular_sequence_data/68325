The zzso forms zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso that are released from zzso of various plant species upon treatment with a zzso zzso were isolated and structurally zzso A mixture of zzso that is released from zzso seed zzso by the zzso zzso was zzso with a commercially available zzso zzso zzso The zzso selectively zzso the zzso zzso of one of the two zzso zzso present in the zzso A homogeneous preparation of the zzso zzso was prepared by high-resolution zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso prepared by reduction of this zzso confirmed the previously proposed structure that had been based on analysis of the mixture of zzso zzso The availability of large amounts of the zzso reduced zzso and of a zzso reduced zzso zzso made it possible to completely assign their zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by high pH zzso zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso (no zzso zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso Additional correlations between specific structural features of zzso zzso zzso and the positions of specific zzso in their zzso zzso were deduced and added to the extensive list that we have zzso The effects of recording the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso which could lead to incorrect structural assignments, are also zzso
