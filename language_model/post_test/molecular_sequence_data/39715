zzso contain tandem repeat blocks that are at risk of expansion or zzso The mechanisms of zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso were investigated in a previously developed model system, in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were inserted into the zzso of zzso zzso As in human cells, zzso is stable in zzso growing zzso cells but is frequently rearranged in the absence of the zzso protein involved in Okazaki fragments zzso To gain insight into this mode of zzso the zzso and zzso human zzso and 47 zzso derived from a zzso zzso in zzso cells were zzso A high degree of zzso of zzso internal repeats was observed, zzso to a large variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso and highly complex events were zzso zzso analysis showed that all zzso even the most complex, occurred in a single generation and were inherited equally by mother and daughter zzso Finally, the zzso frequency was found to increase with array size, and partial zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso demonstrated that the production of novel zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be explained by an zzso of unresolved zzso structures during zzso leading to the formation of zzso zzso and faulty repair, best understood by zzso zzso displacement and zzso
