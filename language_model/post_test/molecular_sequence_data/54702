Fragrance in soybean is due to the presence of zzso zzso zzso gene coding for zzso zzso zzso has been identified as the candidate gene responsible for fragrance in rice zzso zzso zzso In this study, using the zzso population derived from fragrant soybean zzso zzso and zzso soybean zzso zzso Mai zzso zzso zzso markers designed from zzso zzso were found zzso with zzso zzso zzso mapping demonstrated that zzso position of fragrance and zzso production zzso with the position of zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso between zzso and zzso soybeans revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso substitution of G to A in the zzso results in an zzso acid change of zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso The zzso acid substitution changes the zzso zzso motif of zzso which is essential for functional activity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso in zzso is responsible for the fragrance in zzso Five single zzso zzso zzso markers which are zzso zzso specific zzso markers were developed for fragrance based on the zzso in zzso Two markers specific to A zzso produced a band in only zzso while three markers specific to G zzso produced a band in only zzso The simple zzso zzso specific zzso markers developed in the present study are useful in zzso breeding of fragrant zzso
