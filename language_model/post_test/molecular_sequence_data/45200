Upon depletion of zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso were replaced by zzso relatively zzso zzso and the amount of the two zzso decreased zzso Full zzso of the zzso deletion in zzso were not zzso zzso that this gene is essential for survival, most likely to allow normal cell zzso The zzso half of zzso has limited similarity to the family of lycopene zzso has an additional zzso motif near the N zzso and is followed by a zzso zzso center sequence zzso To test whether zzso serves as a lycopene zzso in zzso the corresponding gene was expressed in zzso coli strains that can produce lycopene or zzso In the presence of zzso these linear zzso were converted into zzso relatively zzso zzso with masses consistent with the introduction of two zzso groups and with zzso indicative of only small changes in the number of zzso double zzso This suggests that zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso We interpret the appearance of the zzso groups in the zzso to be due to zzso activity involving the zzso zzso center and the additional zzso zzso This zzso activity is required in the zzso zzso pathway, after or zzso with zzso on the other end of the zzso We interpret zzso to be a zzso zzso with both lycopene zzso and zzso activity and have named it zzso
