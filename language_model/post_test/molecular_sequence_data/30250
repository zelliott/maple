In zzso zzso expression of the zzso structural zzso zzso is under the control of at least four regulatory genes including the zzso zzso regulatory zzso A zzso zzso zzso consisting of an 18 zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene results in very high levels of zzso activity but only in strains carrying zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In selecting for increased zzso expression in an zzso and zzso strain, an zzso zzso strain with a zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene was zzso The zzso sequence was determined of the region containing the zzso designated zzso The zzso strain carries three tandem copies of the 18 zzso sequence that is duplicated in the zzso zzso Thus, from a strain carrying a zzso of an apparent regulatory protein binding site with little effect on gene zzso a strain has been derived that carries a zzso of the site with zzso major effects on zzso The multiple copies of regulatory sites present in many genes may have been generated by a similar zzso
