Type IX collagen functions in zzso zzso to type II collagen in cartilage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Walsh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To understand this molecular relationship better, an analysis of all zzso sites labeled by zzso was undertaken using the protein prepared from fetal bovine zzso zzso analysis of zzso peptides containing the zzso zzso showed that each of the chains of type IX zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso contained a site of zzso at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to which the alpha zzso could zzso The alpha zzso domain alone also had an attachment site for the alpha zzso The distance between the alpha zzso and alpha zzso interaction sites, 137 zzso is equal to the length of the hole zone zzso in a type II collagen zzso This implies an zzso type II to type IX zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed an unknown zzso acid sequence linked to the zzso zzso zzso in both the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso Using zzso to this novel zzso its origin in the collagen alpha zzso domain was zzso In zzso the results confirm extensive zzso zzso between type IX and type II collagen molecules and reveal the existence of type zzso IX zzso These data provide a molecular basis for the proposed function of type IX collagen as a critical contributor to the mechanical stability and resistance to swelling of the collagen type II zzso framework of zzso
