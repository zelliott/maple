To analyze in detail the zzso family zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso five new zzso genes zzso zzso were zzso Three of these zzso 6, 8, 9) were fully characterized and classified into new and independent zzso Their zzso expression was followed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso While the zzso zzso was not expressed in transgenic zzso expression of the two other zzso zzso and zzso was found to be restricted to particular cell zzso In the zzso zzso zzso expression was limited to the head cells of the leaf short zzso involved in zzso and to the cortical zzso of the young zzso where the developing leaves and zzso flowering stalks join the zzso In the latter zzso gene expression was enhanced by mechanical stress, suggesting that zzso might be involved in the strength of the zzso and their resistance to mechanical zzso The zzso zzso was mainly expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso roots and zzso buds as well as in the zzso zzso of the zzso in which expression depended on the zzso zzso In flowers, zzso expression was limited to the mature zzso grains and the young zzso zzso while that of zzso was identified in most of the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction of leaf and stem zzso confirmed the expression of zzso 6 and 9, while zzso was found to be expressed in both zzso at a lower zzso In conclusion, although zzso 6 and 9 had a more restricted expression pattern than the previously characterized zzso zzso they were nevertheless expressed in cell types in which zzso had not been previously zzso
