The genetic basis for the evolution of development includes genes that zzso proteins expressed on the surfaces of zzso and zzso Previous studies of the zzso zzso protein zzso have helped to characterize the zzso evolution of zzso zzso and zzso in sea zzso The absence of evidence for zzso expression in zzso other than the zzso has limited such studies to sea zzso and led to the suggestion that zzso might be a sea zzso zzso Here we characterize the gene that encodes zzso in a zzso zzso sea star zzso zzso We describe the sequence and domain structure of a full-length zzso zzso and its single zzso In comparison with sea zzso zzso zzso zzso is larger but the two molecules share several general features of their domain structure and some sequence features of two zzso Our results extend the known evolutionary history of zzso from the zzso (among the crown group sea zzso into the early zzso (and the common zzso of zzso and present new opportunities for understanding the role of zzso molecular evolution in sexual selection, life history evolution, and zzso among sea zzso
