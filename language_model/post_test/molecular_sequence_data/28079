We have applied the principle of complementary zzso to the prediction of the binding site for zzso zzso and for the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso Since both zzso bind to it through their respective zzso zzso zzso and since both have been zzso we were able to deduce the zzso acid sequence of the binding site from the zzso sequence coding for zzso in both zzso The deduced peptides were very zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso zzso zzso deduced from the cloned rat zzso zzso domain block zzso zzso zzso this block can be overcome by additional zzso In Western blots of whole cell zzso extracts run under reducing conditions, this zzso binds to a zzso zzso It also binds to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it zzso strongly with zzso zzso zzso by a commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complex to zzso is inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso Similar inhibitions can be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicted from the rat and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso related to the human zzso but with zzso zzso are zzso
