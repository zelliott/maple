zzso zzso are the zzso oldest still extant zzso zzso Recently elements of their immune system have been cloned and zzso primarily from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By differential display, two genes were identified in zzso zzso whose translation products are involved in graft zzso the zzso inflammatory factor zzso and the zzso zzso factor zzso Since the zzso and zzso genes are zzso in zzso after tissue zzso especially in zzso we investigated whether this reaction can be monitored in zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso mixed sponge cell reaction zzso system was applied for the first time to identify distinct factors in sponges in zzso The results confirm that the two zzso and zzso genes are induced during zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso sponge zzso causes an zzso of the expression of the zzso We conclude that the zzso and zzso genes are zzso in sponges during zzso zzso the data support the view that sponges have immune systems composed of highly complex elements related to those found in zzso zzso
