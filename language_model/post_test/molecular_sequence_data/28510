Members of the zzso zzso family zzso zzso molecules that act as potent organizers during zzso and zzso zzso zzso modification regulates both the range and efficacy of zzso zzso One such modification is the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso In a screen for zzso lethal zzso associated with maternal effects, we have identified rasp, a novel zzso segment polarity zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso and wing zzso disc demonstrates that zzso does not disrupt zzso signaling but is specifically required for zzso zzso The requirement of zzso is restricted only to those cells that produce zzso zzso transcription, protein levels and distribution are not affected by the loss of zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein that has zzso to a family of membrane bound zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso is necessary to generate a fully active zzso zzso
