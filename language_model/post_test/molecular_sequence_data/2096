The zzso sequence of a new zzso sequence zzso in zzso coli, zzso was zzso It is zzso zzso long and contains zzso repeats of 22 zzso at its zzso It is flanked by 13 zzso direct repeats apparently generated upon zzso There are two zzso longer than 200 zzso in zzso One can zzso a zzso of 371 zzso acids zzso and the other, which is on the other zzso can zzso a zzso of 102 zzso The zzso part of the 371 zzso zzso shows some zzso to that of zzso zzso in some other known IS zzso The copy number of zzso in zzso DNA was 4 for zzso coli K-12 and B, and 5 for zzso coli C, as determined by the Southern zzso of restriction zzso
