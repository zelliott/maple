We studied the genetic and epidemic characteristics of influenza A zzso viruses circulated in human in zzso Province, south of China from 1996 to zzso zzso analysis was carried out for genes zzso zzso zzso of influenza A virus zzso new and 11 previously reported reference zzso Our studies revealed that in the 8 flu seasons, the zzso of zzso genes occurred from time to time, which were responsible for about four times of zzso drift of influenza zzso viruses in zzso zzso The data demonstrated that zzso acid changes were limited to some key zzso at or near zzso binding sites A through E on the zzso zzso The changes at the zzso binding site B or A or zzso acid zzso binding site 226 were critical for zzso zzso But the zzso sites might change and the key zzso for zzso drift might change as influenza viruses zzso It seems important to monitor new zzso zzso for zzso in the positively selected zzso of zzso gene in south of zzso
