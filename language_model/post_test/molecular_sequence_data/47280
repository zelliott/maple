zzso C virus zzso contains an internal zzso entry site zzso located in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso that drives zzso initiation of translation of the viral zzso The approximate secondary structure and minimum functional length of the zzso zzso are known, and extensive zzso has established that nearly all secondary structural zzso are critical for zzso However, the presence of an zzso zzso zzso fold and its functional relevance have not been zzso Using chemical and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in solution, we show that the zzso adopts a unique three-dimensional structure at zzso salt zzso in the absence of additional zzso or the translation zzso zzso of the zzso involves cooperative zzso of zzso and is driven primarily by charge zzso This zzso structure contains at least two independently folded regions which closely zzso to putative binding sites for the 40 S zzso zzso and initiation factor 3 zzso Point zzso that inhibit zzso folding also inhibit its function, suggesting that the zzso zzso structure is essential for translation initiation zzso Chemical and zzso probing data and zzso X-ray scattering zzso experiments in solution show that upon zzso the zzso forms an extended structure in which functionally important zzso are zzso These results suggest that the 40 S zzso zzso and zzso bind an zzso zzso that is zzso to zzso organize recognition zzso
