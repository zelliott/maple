zzso zzso are biological compounds implicated in zzso disease, a zzso storage disease due to the deficient activity of zzso A, which results in an zzso of zzso in many zzso The naturally occurring samples are composed of zzso of several molecular species differing by the structure of the zzso chains and the nature of the zzso zzso Atmospheric pressure zzso mass zzso zzso proved to be an efficient method for the analysis of zzso molecular species, both in direct injection and by zzso with liquid zzso zzso In the positive zzso mode, zzso zzso yield very precious information that can be used to determine the structure of the zzso zzso In the negative zzso mode, the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso by forming an zzso with zzso zzso generated in zzso Combination of zzso on a zzso zzso zzso stationary phase and zzso allowed the detection of a great number of species from biological samples isolated from zzso zzso This method could be an interesting zzso tool for the zzso investigation of zzso zzso zzso
