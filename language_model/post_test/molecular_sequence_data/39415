zzso the type III zzso zzso zzso from the medically important, zzso opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso that share only zzso sequence identity with the type I zzso zzso zzso the only family for which a structure is zzso Active zzso was found predominantly in a single peak that zzso from a zzso zzso zzso column at a position zzso to zzso zzso zzso electron zzso enabled the identification of zzso particles and single zzso rings zzso resulting from partial zzso A zzso average of these zzso showed marked similarity to the corresponding structures found in preparations of zzso except that the arms of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso from particles embedded in zzso ice showed that zzso has a zzso zzso structure with a zzso zzso space group zzso symmetry and dimensions of zzso zzso parallel with the zzso axis and zzso zzso parallel with the zzso zzso The structures, combined with a sequence alignment based on structural principles, showed how many aspects of the structure of zzso and most notably the zzso barrel fold active site were zzso There was evidence for the presence of this structure in the reconstructed volume, thus, identifying the zzso between the pinwheel zzso as putative active sites and suggesting conservation of the overall molecular geometry found in zzso despite their low level of global zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso into the reconstruction left sufficient zzso located unoccupied density to account for the additional zzso in zzso thus zzso the zzso
