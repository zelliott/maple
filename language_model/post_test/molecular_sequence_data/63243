zzso were designed as zzso zzso model structures that mimic fusion protein zzso zzso These peptides harbor a zzso core sequence that consists of zzso and zzso zzso at different zzso Previously, the zzso of these peptides has been shown to increase with the zzso flexibility of their zzso zzso as determined in zzso zzso Here, we examined the secondary structure, orientation, and distribution of zzso in zzso Our results reveal that the peptides are zzso distributed within the zzso of giant zzso zzso and capable of fusing zzso zzso the zzso content of the core up to the level of the zzso zzso content of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso while maintaining a largely zzso structure in zzso zzso A further increase in zzso content or introduction of a zzso pair favors zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso adopt zzso angles relative to the zzso normal and the ratio of zzso to zzso responds more sensitively to zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso of zzso is likely to zzso to a zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso may be considered a zzso whose extent reflects zzso flexibility of the zzso
