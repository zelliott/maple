A survey of the three zzso zzso projects revealed the presence of three putative front-end zzso genes in zzso major, one in zzso zzso and two highly identical ones zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene products were tentatively zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso major, and zzso zzso for both zzso After zzso and structural analysis of the deduced zzso we predicted that the putative zzso zzso could have zzso zzso activity, based mainly on the zzso zzso motif for the second zzso box, when compared with zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which are more than zzso identical to the zzso zzso After cloning and expression in zzso zzso it was possible to functionally characterize each of the front-end zzso present in zzso major and zzso zzso Our prediction about the presence of zzso zzso activity in the three zzso was zzso In the same way, zzso zzso activity was confirmed to be present in zzso zzso Interestingly, the putative zzso zzso turned out to be a functional zzso zzso being zzso and zzso identical to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that no conclusive predictions can be made about the function of this class of zzso merely on the basis of sequence zzso Moreover, they indicate that a complete zzso for zzso zzso fatty acid zzso is functional in zzso major using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso only zzso zzso are zzso The putative zzso origin of the zzso in zzso is zzso
