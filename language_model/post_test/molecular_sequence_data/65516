zzso in the zzso channel gene zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso dominant progressive, zzso hearing zzso Based on a zzso zzso screening we have identified a novel zzso zzso leading to the zzso substitution in the pore region of zzso zzso The possible impact of this zzso on total zzso protein zzso relative surface expression and channel function was zzso When the zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso zzso recordings did not show zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso impaired zzso channel activity in two zzso It greatly reduced surface expression and, zzso abolished channel zzso The deficient expression at the cell surface membrane was further confirmed in zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and wild type zzso in zzso was performed to mimic the zzso condition of the zzso zzso in the zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso exerts a strong zzso effect on zzso currents by reducing the wild type zzso channel expression at the cell zzso This is the first study to identify a zzso dominant mechanism for the loss of zzso channel function in zzso
