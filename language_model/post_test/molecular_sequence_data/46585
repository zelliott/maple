In translation, separate zzso zzso attach the 20 different zzso acids to their zzso zzso with the exception of zzso zzso and some bacteria employ a specific zzso zzso zzso which other zzso the zzso zzso and zzso apparently zzso Instead, zzso is initially zzso with zzso by zzso zzso zzso then the zzso zzso is zzso to zzso Lamour et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso suggested that an early zzso of the zzso gene in zzso gave rise to the gene for zzso copy of which was subsequently transferred to zzso However, questions remain about the occurrence of zzso genes among the zzso zzso outside of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the distribution of zzso genes in the zzso and their evolutionary relationships to genes from the zzso Here, we show that zzso occurs in the most deeply branching zzso and that putative zzso genes from the zzso are more closely related to zzso and zzso genes of the zzso than to those of zzso There is still no evidence for the existence of zzso in the zzso We propose that the last common zzso to contemporary cells, or zzso used zzso to zzso zzso and that both the zzso and the zzso retained this pathway, while zzso developed a specific zzso gene through the zzso of an existing zzso zzso In the zzso zzso genes have been identified in a total of 10 species from three highly diverse zzso groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although all bacterial zzso form a zzso group, the broad zzso distribution of this zzso zzso suggests that multiple gene transfers from zzso to bacteria occurred shortly after the zzso zzso
