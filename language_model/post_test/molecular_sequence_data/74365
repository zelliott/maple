zzso group zzso proteins are required for maintaining cell identity and stem cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two components of a zzso complex called zzso repression complex 1 zzso that is essential for establishing and maintaining long-term zzso gene zzso Here we characterize the interaction between the zzso region of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction displays a zzso zzso with zzso zzso ranging from zzso to 180 zzso for the different zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso alone reveals line zzso However, when it is in complex with the zzso domain, there is a striking change to the zzso spectrum indicative of zzso zzso This zzso change may arise from the organization of the zzso zzso The zzso regions of all zzso zzso proteins are composed of two stretches of zzso sequences separated by a variable zzso zzso While the entire zzso region is required for zzso zzso the zzso and zzso halves of zzso can be separated and are able to zzso suggesting the presence of an zzso interaction within zzso The flexibility within the zzso structure allowing transitions between the zzso bound and zzso states may cause the broadened zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso broadening is zzso The presence of flexible regions could allow zzso to bind a variety of different factors, ultimately recruiting zzso and its associated zzso proteins to different zzso zzso
