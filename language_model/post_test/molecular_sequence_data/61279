zzso zzso which zzso readily with exposed zzso groups, has been shown to inhibit the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Currently, the mechanism of zzso is not known for any of these zzso To investigate the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1) was treated with varying zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were used to assess the effects of modification on zzso interactions with zzso In the zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso binding to zzso in the presence of zzso but had no effect on zzso binding to zzso in the presence of zzso In comparison, treatment with zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and resulted in zzso of the motor in the absence of zzso zzso modification had no effect on the zzso zzso rate but produced a decrease in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso indicated that enhanced zzso binding was associated with an average labeling of 1 zzso zzso per zzso zzso while zzso was associated with an average labeling of 2 zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso structural analysis, and mass zzso indicate that modification of zzso or zzso in the stalk domain is correlated with enhanced binding of zzso to zzso These results suggest that zzso enhances zzso binding to zzso by disruption of neck and/or stalk function and demonstrate the importance of this region in motor zzso
