The zzso protein zzso is essential for viral DNA replication in zzso likely as a DNA zzso We have demonstrated that another viral zzso zzso first described as a zzso DNA binding zzso is required for transporting zzso into the zzso of insect zzso Both of these zzso along with several other early viral zzso are also essential for DNA replication in transient zzso We now describe the zzso zzso zzso and zzso patterns of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and demonstrate that zzso zzso is also responsible for zzso zzso to the zzso We predicted that the interaction between zzso and zzso might be critical for zzso zzso of DNA zzso Support for this hypothesis was generated by substitution of zzso zzso and zzso between two different zzso species, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in transient DNA replication zzso The results suggest that the zzso complex is an important zzso replication zzso
