We studied the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso from the zzso monkey virus in solution by means of chemical zzso and zzso zzso By analyzing zzso products and using zzso zzso chemical shift zzso we have proven that the zzso zzso MA forms zzso in zzso zzso no zzso was observed for the zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso explained their different behaviors in solution, concluding that the key zzso involved in zzso interaction are exposed in the zzso MA but buried in the zzso preventing the zzso of zzso The final model of zzso of the zzso MA was derived by concerted use of chemical shift mapping and zzso zzso measured on a set of protein samples with varying zzso We found that the zzso monkey virus zzso MA exists in a zzso equilibrium in solution, with the corresponding zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso calculated with zzso software are closely related to the structures of other zzso MA zzso
