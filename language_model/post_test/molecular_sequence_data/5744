zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso result in a discrete set of defects in zzso pattern zzso In the developing zzso system of zzso zzso zzso the identity of four zzso cells is disrupted and they adopt the fate of their neighbor zzso Likewise, the identity of two zzso zzso cells in the male tail is disrupted and one of these cells adopts the fate of its neighbor zzso zzso analysis suggests that the zzso functions in the tail and the zzso system are partially zzso as different zzso zzso can zzso disrupt the different zzso We have cloned zzso and shown that it is a member of the zzso family of zzso which zzso zzso factors implicated in a variety of zzso patterning zzso The predicted zzso protein is most similar to the zzso class of proteins that includes zzso zzso and zzso The sequence of zzso zzso DNA indicates that the zzso defects of zzso zzso result from zzso in the zzso paired domain of the zzso zzso zzso thus provides the first molecular genetic insight into two specific patterning events that occur during zzso zzso development and also provides the opportunity to investigate the in zzso functions of this class of zzso proteins with single cell zzso
