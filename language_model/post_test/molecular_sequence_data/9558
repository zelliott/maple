Use of atomic force zzso zzso has recently led to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the unfolding process by mechanical forces; however, the rational design of novel proteins with specific mechanical strength remains zzso We have approached this problem from a new perspective that generates linear zzso properties zzso motifs from a limited zzso data zzso zzso by our linear sequence analysis, we designed and analyzed four new zzso of the zzso zzso domain with the goal of increasing the zzso mechanical zzso All four zzso could be cloned and expressed as soluble zzso zzso data indicate that at least two of the zzso have increased molecular mechanical zzso This observation suggests that the zzso method is useful to graft sequences specific for high mechanical stability to weak proteins to increase their mechanical stability, and represents an additional tool in the design of novel proteins besides steered molecular dynamics calculations, coarse zzso simulations, and zzso analysis of the transition zzso
