zzso ribbons are zzso specialized zzso zzso structures found in zzso sensory cells of the zzso nervous zzso zzso the function of these structures is an active area of research zzso in Matthews G, Fuchs zzso Nat Rev zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous work had shown that ribbons could be effectively labeled and zzso using peptides that bind to the synaptic ribbon protein zzso via a zzso motif zzso D, zzso zzso zzso C, Sterling zzso Matthews zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we expand on the previous work to develop new tools and strategies for 1) better visualizing synaptic zzso and 2) monitoring and manipulating calcium on the synaptic zzso Specifically, we developed a new zzso zzso label for visualizing ribbons in live cells and two strategies for zzso calcium indicators to the synaptic zzso
