In most zzso zzso zzso are depicted as an zzso zzso forming the likely sister group of all the other zzso Other zzso proposals see them either as the sister group of most of the zzso or as a group derived from zzso zzso ancestors by zzso The main difficulty in their correct zzso placing is the lack of convincing zzso for all zzso which may indicate that they are zzso Moreover, their internal zzso relationships are still zzso To test these zzso new complete zzso zzso sequences from 13 species of zzso have been obtained and compared to published sequences of 2 other zzso 3 species of zzso zzso and several zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods were used to zzso their zzso The results show the order zzso to form an independent zzso zzso and emerge as a potential sister group of the rest of the zzso while the rest of zzso zzso which includes the zzso form a clear zzso group closely related to the zzso The order zzso zzso considered as candidates to be zzso are shown to be zzso organisms for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and insufficient sampling of zzso and zzso leave their position still unresolved and call for further zzso Within the zzso our analyses suggest zzso a close relationship between orders zzso and zzso forming a clear sister group to the rest of zzso zzso that zzso zzso appeared early in the evolution of the group and form a sister group to a zzso zzso made by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso that zzso is zzso
