zzso zzso mass zzso utilizing a single zzso on line with zzso zzso zzso enables the characterization of zzso in a relatively short period of zzso In this approach the protein is zzso with a suitable zzso and the peptides are separated by zzso zzso and detected by zzso zzso mass zzso The zzso are initially observed as a cluster of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso plot of data from the zzso run zzso vs retention zzso or as a characteristics series of masses at different zzso zzso The search for a particular zzso is based on previously known zzso structures and on consensus zzso zzso Further structural information is zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mass shifts following zzso zzso allow further confirmation of the zzso This approach identifies the site of attachment of two hybrid zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso map of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso Use of selected zzso extraction of the zzso data files allows one to zzso describe the zzso order of closely related zzso The potential of zzso for the characterization of small amounts of unknown zzso is shown by the study of an zzso zzso A new potential site for zzso is created by site directed zzso of wild type zzso with replacement of a zzso zzso with zzso at zzso zzso An examination of a zzso map shows that the zzso contains two new complex zzso zzso The introduction of the new zzso zzso to zzso 117 changes this native zzso site in zzso to a zzso zzso This method allows rapid identification of zzso containing peptides and yields useful structural information on zzso amounts of zzso
