The zzso and zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a pattern recognition protein which is fundamental for the innate immune response of zzso A partial zzso produced by the random sequencing of zzso clones from a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso showed similarity to the zzso gene of the Chinese shrimp zzso zzso The full-length zzso was subsequently cloned and zzso by the technique of rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso as zzso was zzso bases long and was capable of zzso a zzso of 362 zzso acids showing significant similarity to zzso genes in zzso The crab zzso deduced zzso acid sequence carrying zzso features of this gene family including a potential recognition motif for zzso 3 linkages of zzso and putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso gene expresses in zzso zzso muscles, zzso zzso and zzso with the highest level in zzso and the lowest in the zzso The zzso gene expression is zzso upon bacterial infection and the binding of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso could induce a series of immune zzso The zzso expression of the zzso gene after bacterial challenge was measured by real-time quantitative zzso The result demonstrated that the zzso gene expression in crab was zzso at zzso h zzso of bacteria followed by a step by step recovery at 12 and 24 zzso Our data suggest that the crab zzso is an zzso zzso protein that could be critical in crab zzso
