An zzso zzso zzso a member of the mouse type II integral zzso protein zzso was cloned from a mouse zzso days' zzso zzso embryonic head zzso zzso The zzso sequence and protein prediction analyses indicate that the membrane zzso of the mouse zzso is a type II integral zzso protein with the zzso being zzso and zzso which is considered as either an zzso or a zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein consists of zzso zzso acids with a calculated Mr of zzso and a theoretical zzso of zzso A putative zzso site was identified at zzso acid zzso zzso The single zzso site is zzso in the three members of the family in both mice and zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is 41 and zzso identical to those of mouse zzso and zzso zzso A single approximately zzso zzso transcript was detected with different levels in all of the zzso examined by Northern zzso zzso The zzso was highly expressed in both adult and zzso embryonic zzso although weak or moderate signals were also detected in other adult zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso analyses in various adult tissue shows that the zzso expression is highest in the adult zzso The results from this study suggest that the cloned zzso is a member of the zzso family that is specifically expressed in adult zzso unlike other zzso
