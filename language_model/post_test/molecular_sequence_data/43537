zzso zzso transport systems have not yet been characterized at the molecular zzso We have used zzso zzso to identify genes controlling zzso transport in zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain was transformed with a zzso zzso and zzso library, and positive clones were selected for growth resistance to zzso zzso zzso a toxic zzso zzso A zzso DNA zzso adjacent to the zzso fusion gene rescued from one zzso clone mapped to zzso X within the coding region of a putative zzso protein zzso gene of previously unknown function zzso or zzso A zzso stretch zzso 11 of the 12 zzso zzso of zzso is approximately zzso zzso to the putative zzso zzso protein zzso a recently described zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso had an approximately zzso affinity and zzso zzso than in the parental zzso Transformation of zzso cells with the zzso gene cloned into a zzso expression zzso restored zzso transport to zzso zzso Single zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso of zzso exhibited normal parameters for the initial rate of zzso transport but showed a zzso decrease in total zzso zzso and a low-level resistance to toxic zzso zzso zzso transport was zzso by prior incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso deprivation also zzso residual zzso transport in zzso zzso but simultaneous disruption of zzso and zzso virtually abolished zzso zzso transport under both zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was also deficient in zzso zzso but was not zzso by zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso showed increased growth resistance to zzso and zzso suggesting a regulatory relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the putative zzso zzso zzso gene is an essential zzso of zzso zzso transport in zzso whereas its close zzso zzso mostly affects a zzso zzso zzso transport zzso
