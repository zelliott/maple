During the zzso cycle, the zzso zzso characteristic changes in response to circulating sex zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso occurs in the zzso zzso phase, and zzso zzso and zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso growth factors zzso and zzso promote cellular growth and differentiation and have been proposed to participate in these zzso zzso events, acting as zzso of steroid zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso peptides and the type I and type II zzso receptors are zzso expressed in human zzso during the zzso cycle and in early zzso A solution zzso zzso protection zzso using zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso gene expression primarily in zzso and early zzso zzso and abundant zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso and early pregnancy zzso Northern analysis, using zzso and zzso complementary DNA zzso revealed multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed primarily in zzso and early zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed primarily in zzso zzso and in early pregnancy zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were most abundantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in a ratio of about zzso zzso Type I and type II zzso zzso gene expression in zzso was investigated using specific zzso and the zzso protection zzso zzso zzso zzso both receptors were more abundantly expressed in the zzso phase and during early pregnancy, compared to the zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso the zzso peptides and their receptors are zzso expressed in human zzso depending on the steroid hormone zzso The preferential expression of zzso zzso in the zzso phase supports the hypothesis that zzso is an zzso in human zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso in the mid to late zzso phase and in early pregnancy supports a role for zzso in zzso functions of the zzso perhaps including zzso tissue shedding in the zzso cycle or zzso during early zzso
