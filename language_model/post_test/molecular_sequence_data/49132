A novel zzso zzso was identified for the first time in fish from common carp zzso zzso zzso The gene was obtained from the head kidney zzso zzso with zzso and Con zzso The zzso consists of 619 zzso with a 37 zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 3' zzso An open reading frame of 368 zzso encodes a 97 zzso acid zzso with a putative signal zzso of 20 zzso The gene has four zzso zzso which are zzso with first two zzso separated with zzso By zzso and zzso analysis, the zzso was found to be closer to human zzso zzso were significantly low to the zzso zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rainbow trout zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The carp zzso zzso contains three zzso interrupted by two zzso The gene was transcribed from an early time point by stimulation with zzso and Con zzso zzso in resting phase as well as zzso expressed the zzso
