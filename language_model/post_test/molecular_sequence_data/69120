Previous studies using cloned lines of zzso and zzso zzso zzso leukemia cells have suggested that a reduction in DNA zzso II alpha zzso II zzso zzso activity and protein levels in drug-resistant cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso may be due to an zzso zzso in the zzso II alpha gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso The drug-resistant cell lines zzso and zzso express a shortened zzso II alpha zzso transcript in addition to the native transcript present in the zzso zzso cell zzso Using complementary DNA zzso derived from the coding sequence and 3' untranslated region of the native mouse zzso II alpha transcript, we have determined that the shorter zzso zzso II alpha transcript expressed in the drug-resistant cell lines contains only zzso of zzso II sequence from the zzso zzso Using a zzso amplification of zzso ends strategy, we have cloned zzso representing the zzso of both the native and zzso transcripts from both zzso and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the shorter zzso transcript: zzso encodes zzso II alpha until zzso position zzso at which point the sequence zzso for the remaining 956 zzso zzso contains a zzso signal distinct from the native zzso and zzso contains an open reading frame predicting a truncated zzso II alpha fusion zzso Of great interest was the finding that the zzso II alpha zzso sequence in the shorter transcript encodes the promoter, zzso I, and part of the first zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso alpha gene locus in the zzso orientation, suggesting that a zzso on zzso 11 in the drug-resistant cells led to a gene fusion event between the zzso zzso zzso II alpha and zzso acid zzso zzso
