The contribution made by the zzso component of signal recognition particle zzso to its function in protein targeting is poorly zzso We have generated a complete secondary structure for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure zzso to that of other zzso zzso zzso It is zzso with, at opposite ends, binding sites for proteins required for the zzso functions of signal sequence recognition zzso and zzso zzso arrest zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso separated the zzso of the zzso from the zzso as a discrete zzso The zzso resolved into several stable fragments indicating a compact zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso of five zzso species related to zzso zzso revealed the zzso to be the most zzso region of the zzso zzso data from zzso zzso with zzso comparison, we built the secondary structure model for zzso The zzso contains large zzso including a sequence with hallmarks of an expansion zzso zzso zzso bases are placed in the zzso and zzso as in other zzso zzso the exception being an unusual zzso loop closing the zzso onto which the signal sequence binding zzso assembles zzso zzso Surprisingly, several zzso within the predicted zzso binding site failed to disrupt zzso function in zzso However, the strength of the zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso interaction was decreased in these zzso zzso The availability of a secondary structure for zzso will facilitate interpretation of data from genetic analysis of the zzso
