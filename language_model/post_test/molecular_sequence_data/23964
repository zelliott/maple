A novel zzso zzso has been identified from cotton zzso zzso zzso zzso has a centrally located zzso zzso core, a signature neck zzso of minus zzso zzso and a unique zzso zzso zzso domain at its N zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to a distinct branch of the minus zzso zzso zzso To date the zzso zzso have been found only in higher zzso Because the zzso domain is often found in zzso zzso we proposed that zzso might play a role in zzso dynamic interaction between zzso and zzso zzso in cotton zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region including the zzso domain zzso directly with zzso zzso In cotton zzso zzso decorated cortical zzso in a zzso zzso Occasionally zzso was found to be associated with zzso zzso zzso but never with zzso zzso cables in cotton zzso zzso of zzso on cortical zzso was independent of the integrity of zzso zzso Thus, zzso may play a role in organizing the zzso network in coordination with the cortical zzso zzso These data also suggest that flowering plants may employ unique zzso to coordinate zzso zzso and zzso during cell zzso
