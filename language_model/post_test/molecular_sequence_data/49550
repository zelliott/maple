zzso zzso proteins have been shown to specifically target and kill zzso both in zzso and in zzso The purpose of this study is to construct a new zzso zzso protein for the treatment of zzso in zzso 

In this study, we constructed and characterized a new zzso zzso zzso composed of a new human killing zzso the zzso zzso zzso fragmentation zzso known also as zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso activity in zzso We found that this zzso protein can target and kill zzso zzso Such death occurs via zzso zzso resulting in an increase in the zzso population, DNA zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso cells, and zzso typical of zzso zzso These zzso events involve the zzso because we found zzso c depletion and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso results showed that treatment of colon zzso zzso in nude mice with the new zzso protein caused a reduction in tumor zzso 

Because zzso is a whole zzso zzso protein when applied to humans, the zzso toxicity and zzso seen with zzso zzso proteins should be zzso Thus, zzso is a promising candidate for the treatment of zzso in zzso
