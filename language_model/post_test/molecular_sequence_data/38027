Two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from the coastal waters of the Indonesian island of zzso zzso zzso was isolated from marine water near a shrimp farm in North zzso while zzso was from pristine seawater in South zzso In this study, novel zzso genes from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned and their zzso sequences were zzso An open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso a deduced protein of 290 zzso acids zzso was revealed for the zzso gene of strain zzso while an zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso was deduced for zzso At the DNA level, genes for zzso and zzso have a zzso zzso while at the protein level they have a zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso Neither gene sequence showed zzso to any other zzso in the zzso The deduced proteins were found to be class A zzso bearing low levels of zzso zzso to other zzso of the same zzso The highest level of identity was obtained with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our study showed that both strains zzso and zzso possess an zzso zzso of approximately 60 zzso in zzso However, Southern zzso analysis employing zzso as a gene probe demonstrated that the zzso gene was not located in the zzso A total of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso were examined by zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso zzso Despite a high level of zzso genetic diversity, the zzso probe zzso only to an zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in different zzso
