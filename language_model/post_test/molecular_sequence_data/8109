The zzso molecules consisting of a double zzso stretch followed by a zzso zzso zzso of nine zzso sequence repeats exhibited a gel zzso band in a zzso manner, suggestive of the zzso complex zzso The position of the shifted band in a gel was almost identical to that of the zzso zzso marker of the same molecular weight that had the two zzso at one zzso This suggests that zzso zzso in a parallel orientation without the formation of zzso hairpin zzso Since the zzso zzso was zzso formed at pH 4, 7 and 9, the formation does not require zzso or zzso of the zzso position of zzso Neither does it require the zzso group of zzso responsible for zzso base pairing from the zzso interference and modification zzso zzso of the zzso group of zzso with zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the association and also the zzso group in the zzso was not protected from zzso On the other hand, the zzso having the G to A base substitution did not show such an association with either zzso or zzso These results suggest that the zzso formation may be due to zzso base pairing through zzso hydrogen zzso
