zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso membrane protein zzso zzso zzso with a large zzso consisting of multiple zzso type III repeats, a single zzso segment, and a single zzso zzso active site zzso In adult human and rabbit zzso zzso is found exclusively on zzso zzso of zzso and especially on surfaces of foot zzso Although neither zzso nor function for this protein is known, other zzso with similar zzso have been implicated in zzso adherence behavior of zzso 

To evaluate potential roles of zzso further, we cloned the full-length mouse zzso zzso and examined its expression patterns in developing kidney by Northern zzso analysis, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing showed that mouse zzso was approximately zzso identical to rabbit and human zzso and approximately zzso identical at the zzso acid zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis identified a single zzso transcript of approximately zzso zzso in fetal kidney that became approximately zzso more abundant in zzso In zzso zzso of newborn mouse kidney revealed zzso zzso in visceral zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso figures, and expression increased in zzso loop and maturing stage zzso Beginning on embryonic day 14, zzso protein was first observed on zzso zzso of zzso loop stage zzso but nascent zzso of earlier zzso and zzso zzso figures were zzso At later stages of zzso zzso where foot process zzso and zzso occurs, zzso zzso intensified on zzso and then persisted at high levels in fully developed zzso 

Our findings are consistent with a role for zzso in zzso and maintaining zzso differentiation zzso
