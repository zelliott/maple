A zzso zzso protein has been designed for zzso zzso DNA delivery and gene expression in zzso zzso This hybrid construct comprises a viral zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso domain, and a complete, functional zzso protein that serves simultaneously as zzso tag and zzso zzso This zzso protein is zzso it has been produced successfully in zzso coli and can be zzso in a single step by affinity zzso At optimal zzso ratios, zzso of this zzso and a zzso zzso form stable complexes that zzso cultured zzso After exposure to these zzso complexes, steady levels of gene expression are observed for more than 3 days after zzso representing between 20 and zzso of those achieved with zzso zzso zzso zzso The principle to include viral motifs for cell infection in single zzso zzso proteins represents a promising approach towards the design of zzso modular DNA transfer zzso that conserve the zzso zzso specificity of native viruses and that do not need further processing after zzso in a zzso zzso
