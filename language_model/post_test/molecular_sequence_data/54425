We have determined the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso at 7 zzso resolution by electron zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso in the zzso with 13 zzso zzso per zzso whereas the zzso related bacterial zzso has zzso zzso contacts in the two zzso are very different, but the structure of a zzso bundle at the tip of the zzso is zzso The zzso bundle of zzso contains two partially zzso zzso thought to zzso the zzso site, which is thus similar in zzso A model of zzso based on detailed sequence comparison and the zzso structure was fitted to the 7 zzso zzso The additional zzso zzso 1 of zzso which appears to be an zzso signal zzso is located near the zzso zzso Similar sequences are present in many zzso zzso of zzso including zzso Although fully folded and able to zzso zzso zzso without zzso 1 are zzso zzso reasons are investigated and zzso
