zzso of zzso 247 within the zzso channel domain of the alpha 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological properties, which allow one of the zzso states to become zzso Here we show that, in zzso zzso the effects of the zzso were preserved when zzso zzso acid zzso was injected in the zzso to block zzso zzso zzso and that in agreement with the proposed zzso the zzso currents do not zzso and rise slowly, in the zzso of seconds, upon zzso zzso Interestingly, similar effects were observed when the two rings zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso but not the more distant ones zzso zzso were zzso thus supporting the proposal of a functional zzso of the channel zzso
