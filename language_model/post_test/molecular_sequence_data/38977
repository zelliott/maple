In a screen for zzso zzso genes capable of zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso gene zzso was zzso The zzso gene codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of 124 zzso and zzso point of zzso zzso from zzso zzso displays significant zzso acid sequence zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identity, 57% zzso and Homo sapiens zzso identity, 59% zzso Interestingly, zzso encodes a zzso rather than a zzso at position zzso in the zzso central region, suggesting that zzso is zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso on a high copy zzso can complement a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso showing that zzso and zzso zzso zzso are functionally zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that zzso is present at a single locus within the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene has been deposited at zzso under zzso zzso zzso
