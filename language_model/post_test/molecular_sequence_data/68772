zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso bonds of peptides in the process of zzso laser zzso were observed using a zzso mass zzso equipped with both linear and zzso mass zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso digest yielded one peak in the molecular zzso region in the linear mode and two equally abundant zzso in the zzso mode zzso mass zzso The lower molecular masses in the zzso mode mass zzso could be eliminated by removing the zzso zzso or zzso its zzso zzso zzso The observed mass differences did not zzso to any zzso zzso however, by lowering the potential of the zzso to correct for the energy loss the mass difference was determined to be 115 zzso zzso zzso The extent and rate of this decomposition was compared with that obtained using a zzso tandem mass zzso in the zzso mode of operation without and with a collision gas at collision cell zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest the zzso zzso bond is more zzso than other zzso bonds in the gas zzso zzso zzso decomposition of internal zzso bonds was also observed in larger peptides and zzso Based on these latter data, a mechanism for this zzso zzso is zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
