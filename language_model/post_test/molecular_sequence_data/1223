To produce a zzso zzso zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso gene zzso was spliced with the full-length zzso of zzso B1 gene zzso by overlap extension zzso The fused gene zzso was zzso into zzso zzso transformed into zzso coli zzso and then induced to express under the control of zzso zzso The zzso protein expressed amounted to zzso of the total bacterial zzso The product was zzso and then zzso by using zzso zzso fast flow zzso column and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the final purity is about zzso The specific activity of zzso measured as zzso activity, reached 100,000 zzso It had a similar zzso zzso efficiency zzso to zzso and also showed high zzso zzso activity and zzso activity, indicating that the zzso fully retained the components of zzso and zzso activities of the parent zzso In zzso test revealed that, the dogs administered with zzso had less zzso time, higher zzso ratio, and less bleeding effects than those with zzso These findings indicated that zzso might have advantages over current available zzso zzso
