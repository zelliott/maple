Genome sequence analysis of zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso suggests that this zzso has a limited iron requirement with few, if any, proteins that require zzso Instead, zzso zzso may use zzso zzso for zzso zzso This strategy apparently zzso the necessity of zzso zzso to acquire iron from the host, thus overcoming iron zzso which is a primary host zzso Interestingly, a putative zzso regulatory zzso zzso which has zzso with the diphtheria toxin regulatory zzso zzso from zzso zzso was identified from zzso zzso We describe here the characterization of zzso a regulatory zzso zzso DNA binding and zzso I footprint zzso indicated that zzso zzso bound to a zzso region of zzso symmetry that zzso the zzso region of the promoter of the zzso zzso which contains the genes for a putative metal transport system, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Unlike other zzso regulatory proteins like diphtheria toxin regulatory protein and the zzso zzso zzso regulator, zzso which can be activated by zzso metals such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is activated only by zzso The zzso complex binds its target sequence and blocks zzso of the zzso fusion, suggesting that zzso acts as a zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso exists as a zzso in both its inactive zzso free) and active states as indicated by chemical zzso zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso represents a unique regulatory system for controlling gene expression in zzso zzso in response to zzso
