We have used synthetic peptides to study the location of the zzso acid sequences in the human zzso zzso transport protein zzso 3) which are recognized by four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 154 and zzso These zzso are known to react with zzso in the protein which are on the zzso side of the zzso The results suggest that the zzso acid zzso important for the reaction of zzso 130 and zzso zzso are located within zzso acids zzso and zzso respectively in the zzso tail of the zzso The zzso 132 zzso is located within zzso acid zzso zzso This is part of a surface loop in the protein which probably extends from zzso zzso to zzso 832 and is located on the zzso side of the zzso These results provide direct evidence for the topographical location of a sequence in a poorly understood region of the zzso
