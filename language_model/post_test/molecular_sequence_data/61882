zzso strains of zzso zzso display a zzso zzso resistance pattern suggesting the presence of a zzso zzso zzso From zzso DNA of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso genes were cloned and expressed into zzso zzso Each gene zzso an zzso class A zzso named zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso value of zzso had a shared zzso acid identity of zzso 37 to zzso identity with the majority of the zzso class A zzso previously described for zzso and 66 to zzso identity with the two zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso However, the highest identity percentage zzso to zzso was found with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which displayed very strong zzso activity against zzso also displayed significant zzso activity against zzso and, to a lesser extent, against zzso and zzso but there was no zzso activity against zzso Such a zzso profile suggests that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso should be classified into the group zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso Bush, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Agents zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso regions upstream of the zzso and zzso genes comprised a zzso sequence identical to the zzso region and another one very close to the zzso region of the zzso zzso From now on, as the zzso gene sequences of the most frequent zzso and zzso species are available, the zzso gene amplification method can be used to differentiate these species from each other, which the zzso tests currently carried out in the clinical laboratory are unable to zzso
