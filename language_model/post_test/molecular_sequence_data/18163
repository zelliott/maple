The zzso resistance gene from zzso zzso encodes for a zzso zzso zzso insensitive to zzso by zzso Its coding sequence was fused to the pea zzso zzso zzso transit zzso zzso zzso of isolated zzso with the fusion protein zzso in zzso showed that the bacterial zzso was transported to the zzso zzso and processed into a mature zzso zzso of the gene fusion in transgenic plants resulted in a high level of resistance to zzso zzso selection of transformed shoots on leaf zzso was efficient using zzso as sole selective zzso zzso shoots rooted normally on zzso at zzso toxic for zzso zzso zzso resistance was transmitted to the progeny of transformed plants as a single zzso dominant zzso These results demonstrate that this zzso gene can be used as an efficient and versatile zzso marker for plant zzso
