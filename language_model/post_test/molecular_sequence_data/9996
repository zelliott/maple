Two zzso clones zzso distinct members of the zzso factor zzso zzso family have been isolated from zzso zzso with zzso zzso The first full-length zzso amplified from zzso brain zzso a zzso acid protein with approximately zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso The second full-length zzso isolated from zzso brain and heart zzso a zzso acid protein with approximately zzso identity to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso No evidence could be obtained that the zzso of zzso existed in zzso zzso zzso studies using human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso were bound with higher affinities than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to human zzso zzso zzso zzso was very selective for different zzso zzso zzso I, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were bound with significantly zzso higher affinities than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In agreement with these binding data, zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso were found for zzso and for zzso zzso or zzso zzso respectively, when the zzso zzso production in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso was zzso
