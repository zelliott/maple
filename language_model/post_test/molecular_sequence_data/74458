zzso B virus zzso is known to show significant genetic zzso There are eight zzso zzso zzso characterized by distinct geographical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso and zzso core promoter zzso zzso may be important factors in the zzso of zzso In this study genetic zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso from 32 zzso patients with acute zzso infection was zzso Eleven patients presented with severe infection, while the remaining 21 had zzso zzso Only four zzso from patients with severe zzso infection zzso the zzso stop zzso zzso One isolate zzso collected from a patient with acute zzso infection, had a zzso zzso and a 243 zzso deletion of the zzso zzso A triple zzso zzso was identified in only one isolate zzso associated with severe zzso The latter also had a zzso zzso in the core zzso not previously reported in severe acute infection caused by zzso zzso Variations within the S gene were identified in 6 zzso including zzso associated with vaccine immune escape, zzso zzso and zzso each associated with failure to detect zzso zzso analysis was determined using zzso of the S gene zzso zzso and zzso region zzso zzso zzso A was the most common zzso followed by zzso D zzso and equal proportions of C, zzso zzso and zzso A novel zzso of zzso D and E was identified in an isolate originating from West zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso from patients with acute infection needs further study of its zzso
