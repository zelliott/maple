Human specific zzso elements were investigated by comparative analysis between human zzso 21 and zzso zzso zzso Human specific zzso element was identified on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and then that was a new member of zzso zzso From the zzso analysis, zzso zzso was investigated in human whole zzso using zzso consensus sequence zzso zzso zzso Thirteen members of the zzso elements (4 diagnostic zzso and eight members of the zzso elements (3 diagnostic zzso were identified with distinct diagnostic zzso from zzso consensus zzso The results of the molecular clock calculation of zzso region substitution indicated that, zzso elements zzso million years old) may be proliferated more recent time than zzso elements zzso million years zzso For the zzso of recent zzso time, four of zzso elements zzso zzso zzso and zzso from human zzso 2, 10, 12, 21 were analyzed by zzso amplification using various human and zzso DNA zzso zzso no zzso was detected in human population, we identified the new zzso zzso as the human specific zzso
