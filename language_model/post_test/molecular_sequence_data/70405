A competitive zzso zzso zzso gel zzso protocol zzso has been established for the zzso of human zzso zzso target zzso The measurement was achieved by zzso of a defined copy number of an internal standard zzso and separation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by temperature zzso gel zzso zzso The number of zzso target sequences could be precisely determined within zzso ratios of zzso to zzso With 50 copies of the zzso sequence the detection limit of zzso was found to be five to 10 copies of the target zzso zzso of sample preparation on quantitative zzso zzso were minimized by the additional zzso of zzso target sequences and calculation of the ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso specimens of 17 zzso zzso recipients positive in a qualitative zzso zzso zzso were tested using zzso Thirty healthy blood donors served as negative zzso Positive results were obtained by zzso in nine zzso zzso recipients but in none of the healthy blood zzso Five of five patients with an zzso zzso zzso and positive for zzso zzso were positive in zzso The highest zzso ratios zzso to 8000 copies zzso copies zzso were found in transplant recipients experiencing acute clinically symptomatic zzso zzso zzso DNA levels in zzso patients ranged from 900 to 200 copies zzso zzso
