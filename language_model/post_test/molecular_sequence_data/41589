The zzso gene families of zzso species are composed of members who share a remarkable level of sequence zzso Here, we investigated the gene zzso occurring within the zzso gene family in five zzso zzso A total of 36 conversion events, with an average length zzso zzso of zzso zzso were detected using two zzso Such extensive gene zzso are likely both the cause and the consequence of the high sequence similarity between zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso by these zzso both the overall zzso acid sequences and critical zzso acid zzso are zzso zzso the numerous long gene zzso we detected between zzso genes did not alter any of their functionally important zzso acid zzso This suggest that, in the zzso genes of the five zzso species studied here, strong zzso selection against gene zzso is occurring in regions containing functionally important zzso
