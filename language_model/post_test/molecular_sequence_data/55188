zzso is a protein found in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the anatomical region of the eye involved in regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been associated with zzso glaucoma, and zzso of zzso have been linked to zzso inherited zzso zzso levels and zzso of zzso zzso increased zzso pressure and zzso vision loss due to irreversible damage to the zzso zzso In spite of reports on the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cell culture, and model organisms, these zzso have not been structurally zzso In this work, we provide zzso evidence for the hallmarks of zzso zzso in zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are grown under a variety of conditions in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and mature zzso zzso are observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells forms zzso zzso zzso as zzso Taken together, this work provides new insights into and raises new questions about the molecular properties of the highly zzso zzso domain, and suggests a novel zzso hypothesis for glaucoma zzso for further testing in a clinical zzso
