zzso protein zzso and its associated binding site on zzso zzso together comprise one of the principle components that mediate interactions of translation factors with the zzso This site is also the target of the zzso zzso which has been proposed to act by preventing important structural transitions that occur in this region of the zzso during protein zzso Here, we describe the isolation and characterization of spontaneous zzso zzso of the extreme zzso zzso zzso All zzso were found at zzso positions in the flexible zzso domain of zzso or at zzso positions in the zzso site of zzso zzso A number of the zzso zzso were affected in in zzso zzso zzso zzso but all showed resistance to zzso at levels ranging from high to zzso zzso probing revealed that some of the zzso in zzso result in enhanced zzso of adjacent zzso bases to chemical zzso suggesting a more open zzso of this zzso These data suggest that increased flexibility of the factor binding site results in resistance to zzso by zzso the zzso effect of the zzso
