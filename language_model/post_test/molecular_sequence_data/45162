zzso or group 2 late zzso abundant proteins zzso are zzso zzso proteins that are induced in zzso zzso in response to dehydration, elevated salt, and low temperature, in addition to being expressed during the late stages of seed zzso With the aim of characterizing and studying genes involved in zzso stress tolerance in coffee, several full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso 

The protein sequences deduced from the full-length zzso were zzso to zzso each zzso gene product and zzso was used to determine the expression pattern of all four genes during zzso and grain development, and in several other zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso walking was used to isolate the promoter region of the grain specific zzso gene zzso 

The zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene encodes an zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed during the final stages of zzso and zzso grain development, but only the zzso transcripts are clearly detected in other zzso such as zzso leaves and zzso zzso transcripts are also found in developing zzso and zzso zzso in addition to being detected in zzso zzso leaves and zzso zzso transcripts were only detected during a brief period of grain zzso Finally, over 1 zzso of zzso sequence potentially zzso the entire zzso promoter region of the zzso gene was isolated and zzso 

zzso sequences for three zzso and one zzso protein have been obtained and the expression of the associated genes has been determined in various zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Because induction of zzso gene expression is associated with zzso stress in other plants, the zzso sequences presented here will facilitate future studies on the induction and control of the zzso stress response in zzso The unique expression pattern observed for zzso and the expression of a related gene in other plants, suggests that this gene may play an important role in the development of grain zzso zzso zzso DNA containing the zzso zzso promoter region has been zzso zzso analysis indicates that this promoter contains several putative regulatory sites implicated in the control of both zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso Thus, the zzso promoter is likely to be a useful tool for basic studies on the control of gene expression during both grain maturation and zzso stress in zzso
