zzso in the sequences of two related zinc zzso the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso and the recently cloned neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been demonstrated by a zzso cluster analysis method derived from the Lim zzso Two sequence alignments are proposed for the entire primary structure of zzso and the zzso part of zzso zzso Except for an zzso zzso all the zzso acids involved in the active site of zzso have been retrieved in both models of zzso zzso within zzso clustered zzso The first model is characterized by a deletion of the zzso zzso present in zzso and the second by replacement of this zzso by two zzso In both models an zzso zzso can be located in the active site of the neutral zzso
