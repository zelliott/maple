The effects of zzso zzso in human long-term bone zzso cultures zzso were assessed by measuring the number of zzso and the development of zzso cells over a zzso zzso In a first set of experiments, zzso was added weekly at each medium zzso Under these conditions, no significant effect of the zzso was zzso In contrast, by adding zzso daily at zzso M, the growth of the zzso of the zzso zzso compartment was inhibited by about zzso This zzso was entirely zzso after stopping the addition of the zzso at the fourth week, the number of zzso returned to control level within 2 zzso zzso zzso did not significantly change the number of the zzso present in the adherent zzso In addition, zzso did not affect the formation of the zzso layer nor induce the zzso of zzso such as tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso 1 beta zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso 3 zzso or zzso 6 zzso Our results indicate that zzso has zzso but zzso effects on zzso zzso and does not induce long-term modifications of the zzso both of particular interest for its clinical zzso
