This study addresses the capacity of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from zzso monkeys zzso zzso to present zzso basic protein zzso a candidate zzso for multiple zzso to zzso human zzso T cell zzso zzso of the human T cell clones was determined with zzso L cells, and zzso specificity was established with a panel of overlapping zzso zzso The zzso region of the zzso monkeys zzso was characterized zzso and by sequence zzso We identified one zzso zzso zzso human T cell clone zzso that was activated to proliferation with human or zzso monkey zzso or zzso zzso zzso presented by zzso from six different zzso monkeys expressing the zzso or zzso zzso After transformation to continuous growth with zzso zzso the T cell clone could still be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso from zzso Two other T cell clones with the same zzso and the same zzso did not respond to zzso presented by these zzso zzso The zzso 2 sequences zzso zzso and zzso differ at positions 32, 47, 67, 73 and zzso These zzso acid differences are not critical for the binding of zzso zzso and do not abrogate recognition by the clone zzso but interfere with the recognition of the two other zzso T cell zzso In conclusion, studying zzso from zzso monkey may provide further insight into the interaction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
