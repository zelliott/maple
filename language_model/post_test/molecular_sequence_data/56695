Different sets of genes for photosynthesis are expressed in zzso cells zzso and bundle sheath cells zzso two adjacent but zzso and functionally distinct types of zzso cells in leaves of zzso and other C4 zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso II, which are zzso by a family of cab zzso are 3- to zzso more abundant in zzso zzso than in zzso Each zzso cab gene is different from the others in its relative expression in zzso zzso zzso and in its degree of zzso The gene zzso is positively zzso and is highly zzso expressed in zzso A zzso sequence in the zzso zzso region of this gene zzso to zzso relative to the translation start zzso is required for zzso expression of a reporter gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso experiments have now shown that all of the sequence information required for zzso expression resides within this zzso region and that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso because of the presence of two types of sequence zzso one is required for suppressing expression in zzso and the other for promoting expression in zzso One of the four zzso regions mapped within the zzso region resembles the zzso box of some plant gene negative regulatory zzso Various combinations of such zzso enhancing and zzso zzso regions could make zzso cab gene family members different from one another in their relative expression in zzso zzso zzso
