We have isolated a novel zzso designated zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of 22 zzso and spans approximately 80 zzso in a direction from zzso to zzso Two major transcripts produced by alternative zzso have been zzso These transcripts contain open reading frames of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected only in 14 human zzso zzso zzso zzso and fetal zzso at low zzso Interestingly, two gene products zzso and zzso contain multiple zzso including zzso zzso zzso sea zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain, and so zzso Both proteins seemed to zzso in zzso but zzso is likely to be zzso and rapidly zzso in zzso zzso This gene may be a potent candidate for Down syndrome or bipolar affective zzso
