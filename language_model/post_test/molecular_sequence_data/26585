Many zzso proteins zzso use complex zzso zzso to integrate and coordinate multiple signals and interactions with the dynamic zzso of zzso zzso In these zzso small segments that are zzso zzso in their zzso native state can be functionally as important as identifiable folded zzso These functional zzso zzso regions zzso are however difficult to identify and characterize in zzso Here, we try to zzso the state of the art in understanding the structural features and zzso properties of zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Recent structural and functional insights into the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of other zzso such as those associated with zzso zzso or capping proteins are zzso zzso the functional versatility of zzso in zzso assembly requires apprehending by multiple structural and functional approaches their large zzso plasticity and dynamics in their zzso In many modular zzso zzso relay zzso interactions with multiple partners and act as interaction hubs in zzso and zzso zzso They thus control multiple zzso transitions between the inactive and active states or between various active states of zzso zzso and play an important role to coordinate the high turnover of interactions in zzso zzso zzso
