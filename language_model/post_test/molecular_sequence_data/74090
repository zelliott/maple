zzso zzso peptides are good candidates for new zzso and zzso zzso They can rapidly kill a broad range of microbes and have additional activities that have impact on the quality and effectiveness of innate responses and zzso Furthermore, the challenge of bacterial resistance to conventional antibiotics and the unique mode of action of zzso peptides have made such peptides promising candidates for the development of a new class of zzso This review focuses on zzso peptides as a topic for molecular imaging, infection zzso treatment monitoring and zzso displaying zzso zzso A zzso approach to studying the zzso of zzso peptides in laboratory animals has been zzso The peptides were labeled with zzso and, after intravenous injection into laboratory animals, zzso allowed zzso whole body imaging and quantitative zzso studies of delivery of the peptides to the various body zzso zzso peptides rapidly accumulated at sites of infection but not at sites of sterile zzso indicating that zzso zzso zzso peptides could be used for the detection of infected zzso As the number of viable zzso determines the rate of zzso of these zzso zzso zzso peptides enabled to determine the efficacy of zzso therapy in animals to be monitored as well to zzso the delivery of zzso peptides to the site of zzso The zzso approach provides to be a reliable method for investigating the zzso of small zzso zzso peptides in animals and offers perspective for diagnosis of infections, monitoring zzso therapy, and most important, alternative zzso treatment infections with zzso resistant zzso in zzso
