We examined changes in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a stable zzso of zzso in the zzso corpus zzso zzso during its development and subsequent zzso We also looked at the effects of a potent zzso zzso zzso which is known to suppress the release of zzso hormone zzso on the zzso zzso zzso level and the zzso content during zzso zzso zzso were divided into a control group zzso and a zzso group zzso They were treated with saline or zzso zzso zzso zzso on days 0 zzso of zzso 4, and 8 zzso zzso and the zzso were collected from a subset of zzso zzso for each day) on days 0 (no zzso 4, 8, or 14 zzso zzso zzso protection zzso was performed to zzso the zzso in the zzso using specific zzso zzso generated by zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso content in the zzso was measured by zzso The level of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso content in the zzso in the control group decreased from day 0 to day 4 zzso and did not change thereafter from day 4 to day zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso content in the zzso on days 4 and 8 were not affected by treatment with zzso These results suggest that zzso synthesis is regulated upward at the beginning of zzso zzso zzso this may play a role in initiating zzso zzso This study also suggests that changes of zzso synthesis during zzso development are probably not regulated by zzso
