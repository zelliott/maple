zzso binding protein zzso 5, a zzso that removes the terminal zzso from zzso side chains of zzso plays an important role in creating and maintaining the uniform cell shape of zzso zzso zzso 6, a highly similar zzso cannot substitute for zzso 5 in this zzso Previously, we localized the zzso characteristics of zzso 5 to the zzso domain that contains the active site zzso zzso where zzso 5 and 6 share substantial zzso To identify the specific segment of domain I responsible for shape control, we created a set of hybrids and determined which ones zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso Fusion proteins were constructed in which 47, 199 and zzso zzso zzso acids of one zzso were fused to the corresponding zzso zzso acids of the zzso The zzso zzso was reversed only by hybrid proteins containing zzso 5 zzso 200 to zzso which are located next to the zzso motif of the active zzso Because zzso 220 to zzso were identical in these zzso the zzso effect was determined by zzso in zzso acids 200 to zzso To confirm the importance of this segment, we constructed mosaic proteins in which these 20 zzso acids were grafted from zzso 5 into zzso 6 and vice zzso The zzso zzso mosaic zzso the zzso zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso did zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso were important for shape maintenance by these mosaic zzso but the same zzso in zzso zzso 5 did not eliminate its zzso zzso zzso zzso from five other bacteria also zzso the zzso of zzso The overall conclusion is that creation of a bacterial cell of regular diameter and uniform zzso apparently depends primarily on a slight zzso of the zzso activity or zzso accessibility at the active site of zzso coli zzso zzso
