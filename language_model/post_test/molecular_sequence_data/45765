As a novel member of the zzso family, zzso was observed to express in the most common human zzso zzso therapy targeting zzso has drawn considerable zzso This report presented zzso construction of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso from breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso after zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was expressed highly in zzso coli zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso induction and its yield could reach 650 zzso in zzso zzso The fusion protein in a form of inclusion body was then zzso zzso and zzso to a purity of zzso by zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso Four hundred and zzso milligrams protein of interest was obtained in per liter zzso zzso The protein of interest was identified by zzso and Western zzso analysis, and great zzso of target protein to two cancer cell lines was confirmed by zzso changes and evaluated by zzso The findings suggested that zzso protein zzso zzso has a bright future in cancer therapy targeting towards zzso and the efficient procedure of expression and zzso may be useful for the mass production of this zzso important zzso
