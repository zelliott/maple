Previous work has shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly resistant to zzso stress caused by exposure to hydrogen zzso zzso and gamma zzso Dynamic zzso of the gene regulatory network zzso has been implicated in such zzso However, the molecular functions of zzso regulatory proteins involved in this response remain zzso 

Here we have zzso several existing zzso and systems biology zzso for zzso zzso to identify and characterize a novel winged zzso zzso factor, zzso as a regulator required for zzso oxygen species resistance in this zzso This protein appears to be unique to the zzso at the primary sequence zzso High zzso quantitative growth zzso in a deletion zzso strain zzso zzso in extreme zzso stress zzso According to time course gene expression zzso this zzso factor is required for the appropriate dynamic response of nearly 300 genes to zzso oxygen species damage from zzso and hydrogen zzso These genes are predicted to function in repair of zzso damage to proteins and zzso In zzso DNA binding zzso demonstrate that zzso binds DNA to mediate gene zzso 

Together these results suggest that zzso is a novel zzso zzso factor that regulates gene expression to enable adaptation to the extremely zzso zzso niche of zzso zzso We have therefore renamed zzso as zzso for zzso oxygen species zzso
