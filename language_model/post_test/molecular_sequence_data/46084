zzso in the zzso domain of human zzso zzso a potential therapeutic zzso was identified as a target for molecular zzso Two zzso coli strains of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with a reducing and an zzso zzso were used as the expression host to produce the zzso zzso It was observed that zzso was involved in the in zzso formation of zzso zzso bonds when zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The zzso protein products had a higher tendency than the zzso counterparts for zzso via the in zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso Various analyses were conducted to identify the structural differences among these zzso zzso Most importantly, molecular stability was enhanced by the zzso zzso since the zzso zzso derived from either zzso or zzso were much less susceptible to degradation compared to zzso zzso This study highlights the implications of zzso zzso bond formation on the production of therapeutic zzso
