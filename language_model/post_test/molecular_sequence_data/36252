Brown zzso are zzso cells which play an important role in energy zzso Their zzso activity is due to the presence of a zzso zzso protein zzso Until recently, it was admitted that in zzso brown zzso were mainly located in classical brown zzso tissue zzso In the present study, we have investigated the presence of zzso protein or zzso in white zzso tissue zzso of zzso Using zzso chain reaction or Northern zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso and particularly in zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was detected by Western zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso When rats were submitted to cold or to treatment with a zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in this tissue as in typical brown zzso Moreover, the expression was decreased in obese zzso rats compared to lean zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso tissue of rats kept at 24 degrees C contained cells with numerous typical BAT zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso cells expressed zzso zzso Furthermore, the number of brown zzso and the density of zzso zzso increased in parallel with exposure to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso expressing zzso are present in zzso deposits considered as white zzso They suggest the existence of a zzso in zzso between BAT and zzso and a great plasticity between zzso tissue zzso The zzso importance of brown zzso in zzso and the regulation of zzso expression remain open zzso
