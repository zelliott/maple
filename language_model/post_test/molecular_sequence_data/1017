zzso are a highly zzso group of cell zzso proteins that appear to mediate changes in cell wall plasticity during cell expansion or zzso The zzso of zzso protein or the zzso for specific zzso gene family members has been correlated with the growth of various plant zzso Because zzso proteins are closely associated with plant cell wall expansion, and as part of a larger study to determine the role of different gene products in the zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is expressed during zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso an zzso gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso root zzso by zzso zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso and a full-length zzso zzso sequence zzso was obtained using zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso end zzso The predicted zzso acid of the zzso zzso is highly zzso with the various zzso in the zzso zzso zzso contains a series of eight zzso and four zzso that are zzso in the zzso protein zzso Northern analysis and zzso in zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso zzso expression is enhanced in roots within hours after zzso with zzso zzso and in zzso Western and zzso studies using a cucumber zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso protein accumulated in the expanding cells of the zzso
