zzso have been developed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso to DNA minor and major zzso zzso motifs by solid phase zzso zzso Side chain zzso and zzso zzso steps were accomplished under zzso conditions to maintain the structural integrity of the zzso zzso When zzso was zzso to the DNA minor zzso zzso zzso zzso a strong preference for binding with zzso sequences was observed by circular zzso studies, consistent with the construct making zzso interactions within the minor zzso This zzso showed a zzso zzso DNA zzso activity compared with the free zzso as measured by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns of all zzso were nearly identical to those zzso by the major groove interactive agents zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso modification was restricted to zzso sites in the major groove of DNA irrespective of the targeting property of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso intermediate formed in the breakdown of the zzso ring of zzso zzso zzso from zzso must be liberated from the zzso zzso prior to the zzso event, and must diffuse to and react with more zzso sites in the major zzso
