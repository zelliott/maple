Type 4 zzso produced by the zzso zzso species constitute primary zzso for the adherence to host zzso In addition to the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain the variable zzso proteins represented by two zzso gene copies in most zzso zzso zzso Based upon structural differences in the zzso regions of zzso two zzso classes can be distinguished in zzso zzso For class I zzso found in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins have been implicated in zzso zzso natural transformation competence and adherence to zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso specific for the zzso gene of zzso strain zzso to amplify, by the zzso chain reaction, and clone a zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso strain zzso which produces class II zzso This gene was zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso and zzso identity with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These values match the identity value of zzso calculated for the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating a horizontal relationship between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso functions in zzso class II zzso assembly and zzso Furthermore, expression of the cloned zzso zzso zzso gene in a zzso zzso zzso restores zzso zzso adherence to zzso zzso cells, and transformation competence to the zzso zzso Thus, zzso proteins exhibit indistinguishable functions in the context of class I and class II zzso
