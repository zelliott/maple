zzso is required for maintenance of the corpus zzso during pregnancy in higher zzso As zzso is a zzso zzso some form of coordinated control must be maintained over the zzso of its two zzso zzso We recently found that expression of human zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cells was almost completely silenced by the embryonic zzso factor zzso which bound to a unique zzso zzso sequence in the zzso gene zzso Here we report that zzso is also a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso reduced human zzso reporter expression from the zzso zzso promoter in either the presence or absence of zzso by about zzso in transient zzso zzso but had no effect on expression from either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso no zzso zzso site was identified within the zzso to zzso region of the zzso promoter, although one was found around position zzso by both zzso interference zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso of this binding site destroyed the affinity of the promoter for zzso but did not affect repression of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso by zzso appears not to involve direct binding of this factor to the site responsible for zzso When zzso zzso into zzso cells, zzso reduced the amounts of both zzso zzso zzso and protein by zzso zzso is therefore capable of zzso both zzso and zzso gene zzso We suggest that as the zzso begins to form, reduction of zzso expression permits the coordinated onset of zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso
