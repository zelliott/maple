A method has been developed for measurement of zzso affinity and zzso by surface zzso resonance zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso capture zzso This system allows for zzso capture of synthetic zzso zzso on a zzso chip surface, with the advantage that multiple zzso interactions can be analyzed using a single zzso zzso This method has proven useful in the development of a synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso binding zzso of zzso from four strains of PA were zzso to the zzso strand of the zzso zzso domain and individually captured on the zzso chip through zzso with the immobilized zzso zzso zzso rabbit zzso raised against zzso zzso was injected over the sensor chip surface for kinetic analysis of the zzso zzso The kinetic rate constants, zzso and zzso and equilibrium association and zzso constants, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso affinities ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that the carrier protein and zzso used during zzso make a dramatic difference in zzso affinity and zzso zzso raised against the PA strain K zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso system were more broadly zzso than zzso raised against the same zzso zzso to zzso zzso using zzso zzso The method described here is useful for detailed characterization of the interaction of zzso zzso with a panel of synthetic zzso zzso with the objective of obtaining high affinity and zzso zzso in vaccine zzso
