The zzso hormone zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso skin zzso and may be involved in the control of the zzso adrenal axis in zzso zzso We have recently cloned and characterized the salmon and rat zzso zzso and we report in the present paper the cloning and sequencing of the human zzso The deduced human zzso zzso precursor is 165 zzso acids long and as for rat and zzso encodes the zzso zzso at the zzso The human and rat zzso precursors are very similar to one another but differ extensively from the salmon zzso Strong sequence conservation was found in the regions of zzso zzso zzso the novel putative zzso named zzso and zzso which we had originally identified in the rat zzso zzso Furthermore, sequence zzso with perhaps functional zzso were found among the zzso human zzso and zzso zzso A hormone zzso
