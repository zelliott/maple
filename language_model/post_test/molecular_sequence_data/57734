The DNA sequence of the wild type zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso The predicted protein has zzso zzso acid identity with the zzso protein of zzso but is 29 zzso acids longer, due to an additional zzso in the 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene localized the sites of four heat sensitive zzso within zzso The zzso and zzso zzso are identical zzso and lie in a highly zzso region corresponding to the zzso binding pocket of zzso Two additional heat sensitive zzso were zzso and predict the following zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of the heat sensitive zzso lie in regions with strong zzso acid zzso to zzso
