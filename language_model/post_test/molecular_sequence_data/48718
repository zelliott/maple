The group I members of the zzso zzso gene family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have been implicated in the regulation of cell migration, proliferation and zzso Despite their zzso and medical significance, the molecular functions of these zzso remain ill zzso To minimize zzso effects of functional compensation between closely related zzso family members, we studied zzso the sole zzso zzso zzso of group I zzso and focused on its role in zzso protein zzso zzso signaling events during zzso zzso zzso leads to a protruding zzso zzso and affects zzso cell fate zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso worms show severe reduction of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso indicative of compromised zzso zzso A genetic zzso analysis using the zzso induction system revealed that zzso acts downstream of zzso but upstream of zzso at the level of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins act as scaffolds zzso Ras signaling events by zzso signaling zzso and we suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity through direct physical zzso Our study reveals that zzso zzso zzso influences differentiation by enhancing the level of zzso zzso These results might help to better understand how zzso zzso in humans contributes to zzso
