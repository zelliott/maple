zzso zzso zzso are zzso designer zzso with inverse temperature transition behavior in zzso They have a wide variety of possible applications and a potential medical zzso Currently, production of zzso is done at lab scale in zzso coli shake flask zzso With a view to future large scale production, we demonstrate zzso production of zzso in zzso zzso cultures of zzso zzso and zzso directly from the culture zzso The production of zzso by zzso zzso proved to be pH dependent within the experimental pH range of pH 3 to 7, as an increasing yield was found in cultures grown at higher zzso Because zzso produced at pH 7 was partly zzso a pH optimum for production of zzso was found at pH 6 with a yield of 255 zzso of zzso intact zzso per liter of zzso zzso
