From the systematic replacements of zzso acid zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso with those of its zzso counterpart, the basic zzso domain including region 6 zzso from zzso 91 to 95 was found to increase the structural stability of the zzso protein zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further zzso concentrating in the zzso region has revealed that replacements of zzso at the left-handed structure with zzso or zzso essentially enhances the protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso stabilize the protein up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the free energy changes of zzso zzso We propose that the zzso acid substitution of left-handed zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso can be used as one of the general strategies to enhance protein stability, when such a zzso zzso itself does not seriously contribute to protein zzso
