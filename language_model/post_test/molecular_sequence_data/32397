zzso anemia zzso is a zzso and zzso syndrome caused by zzso in genes controlling DNA zzso zzso zzso Several zzso proteins form a zzso zzso that controls zzso of the zzso protein in an zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso protein zzso identified as an zzso zzso zzso required for resistance to zzso zzso zzso shares sequence similarity with zzso likely evolving from a common ancestral zzso The zzso protein associates with zzso and, together, as the zzso zzso complex, zzso to zzso in response to DNA zzso Like zzso zzso is zzso and unexpectedly, zzso of each protein is important for the maintenance of zzso on the other, indicating the existence of a dual zzso mechanism required for ID complex zzso zzso in zzso is responsible for loss of a functional zzso zzso in a patient with zzso anemia zzso group zzso
