From the antennae of the zzso zzso zzso we have identified a zzso G protein alpha zzso belonging to the zzso family, through zzso detection in crude zzso extract and zzso primary cell cultures, followed by molecular zzso The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso contains an open reading frame zzso a protein of 353 zzso zzso This deduced sequence possesses all of the characteristics of the zzso family and shares a very high degree of zzso sequence identity with zzso zzso with mouse or human zzso and zzso zzso zzso between 60 and zzso for zzso from organisms as diverse as sponge and zzso The expression pattern of the zzso zzso in adult antennae was associated with the zzso zzso suggesting a specific role in zzso These data provide molecular evidence for a component of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso this G protein alpha zzso may be involved in the zzso zzso process through interaction with zzso zzso stimulating the zzso C zzso second zzso zzso
