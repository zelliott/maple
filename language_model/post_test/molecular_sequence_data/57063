A zzso zzso binding protein zzso which is an zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso was shown to be functionally active as a zzso zzso or zzso of a single zzso chain of 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In various zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain has been identified as an zzso signal zzso zzso & Robinson, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso deduced from its zzso sequence was found to contain the zzso zzso in its zzso zzso This was confirmed by the fact that the zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells was found to have the zzso zzso zzso The role of this zzso zzso signal in the zzso tail was studied by measuring the zzso activity of the zzso and zzso zzso expressed on zzso cells through zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso prepared by zzso zzso zzso On the deletion of zzso or replacement of it with zzso the zzso of zzso zzso decreased to approximately zzso that in the case of the zzso zzso On replacement of zzso with zzso the zzso proceeded at a rate similar to that in the case of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
