zzso zzso zzso are rare, benign zzso tumors associated with intractable zzso Most cases are sporadic and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cases are associated with zzso syndrome zzso which is caused by zzso of zzso We have investigated the possibility that zzso zzso in sporadic cases is due to a zzso zzso zzso in zzso We isolated zzso DNA from peripheral blood and surgically zzso zzso tissue in 55 patients with sporadic zzso and intractable zzso A zzso screen for loss of zzso zzso and zzso abnormalities was performed with parallel analysis of blood and zzso tissue with zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and fine mapping with zzso zzso were completed for the zzso gene with comparisons between peripheral blood and zzso tissue zzso By analyzing zzso zzso data for paired samples on the zzso zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso in one zzso tissue zzso zzso of zzso did not identify zzso zzso zzso but did identify zzso within the zzso gene in the zzso tissue samples of three zzso Further zzso of 28 zzso within and surrounding zzso identified five additional patients exhibiting zzso Together, these data provide evidence that the development of zzso abnormalities within zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso patients with zzso and intractable zzso zzso abnormalities including the zzso locus were seen in 8 of 55 zzso of the zzso zzso tissue zzso These zzso zzso appear to be highly zzso
