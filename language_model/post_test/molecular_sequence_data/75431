zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two structurally similar zzso alpha and zzso that are the products of different zzso zzso in either gene causing zzso zzso result in the zzso storage disease zzso To enable the investigation of the molecular zzso in this disorder and to study the evolutionary relationship between the alpha and beta zzso the zzso gene was isolated, and its organization was zzso The zzso coding region is divided into 14 zzso distributed over approximately 40 zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso gene revealed that 12 of the 13 zzso interrupt the coding regions at zzso zzso This extensive sharing of zzso placement demonstrates that the alpha and beta chains evolved by way of the zzso of a common zzso
