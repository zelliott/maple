The use of zzso gene therapy for the treatment of breast cancer has many potential zzso Because zzso protocols for breast cancer are commonly limited by bone zzso zzso zzso of genes into zzso stem cells may allow the generation and maintenance of immune responses in the presence of zzso zzso The practical utility of stem cell isolation and zzso would be enhanced if stem cells circulating in the peripheral blood could be isolated in patients, however this approach has been limited by the small numbers of such cells in the zzso In these studies, zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso was administered to patients with zzso breast cancer to increase the number of circulating stem zzso Stem cells in the peripheral blood were then isolated and a zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso gene into these zzso Gene zzso was demonstrated by resistance to the toxic effects of a zzso analog zzso and the detection of zzso DNA from zzso zzso A practical method of transfer of zzso genes into the circulating zzso stem cells of patients with zzso breast cancer is documented by these zzso Application of these findings may allow the generation of cells resistant to zzso agents or unique zzso zzso cells with potent immune functions for the treatment of patients with zzso breast zzso
