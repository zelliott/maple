zzso zzso synthesis was zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso was transcribed in zzso from full-length zzso type 1 zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso specific for the 3' end of zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that all zzso zzso zzso a linking zzso in position 3 or 4 of zzso were zzso even though no virus was zzso zzso but no zzso zzso was found to be linked to the zzso end of the newly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were not found in zzso zzso After extended maintenance of zzso zzso cells, a viable zzso of one of the zzso zzso was zzso the zzso lost the lethal zzso in zzso by restoring the zzso zzso acid, but it retained all other zzso changes introduced during construction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso rather than zzso the linking zzso acid in zzso was not zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso region of zzso within the zzso zzso was viable but displayed impaired zzso A zzso zzso lacking a linking zzso in zzso was zzso and zzso The results indicate that a zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso synthesis to occur but that a step in zzso replication other than initiation of zzso synthesis can be interrupted by lethal zzso in zzso
