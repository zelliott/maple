A zzso zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso genes zzso was linked to the reporter gene zzso in the stress probe zzso zzso On the basis of green zzso zzso after application of different types of stress to zzso zzso coli, the DNA sequence was characterized as a zzso promoter zzso In zzso coli, zzso stress resulted in an increasing zzso intensity, whereas the effects of heat or cold were zzso suggesting that zzso and/or translation is controlled mainly by an zzso zzso stress zzso Additionally, the zzso effects of the compatible zzso zzso and zzso were zzso
