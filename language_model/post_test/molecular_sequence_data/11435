The promoter region driving the gene for the zzso heavy zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by transient zzso using the zzso zzso gene as zzso zzso mapping confirmed our previous notion that the promoter is located within a zzso zzso sequence preceding the structural zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso were found to be zzso and the zzso start mapped to a position similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso By deletion analysis the entire promoter was restricted to a zzso covering about 550 zzso upstream from the start of zzso On the other hand, residual promoter activity required a sequence of about 140 zzso only, encompassing a newly identified zzso like element around position zzso as well as the zzso specific zzso This zzso zzso as well as a stretch of 15 zzso which is located some 100 zzso further upstream, were found to be zzso within the zzso zzso region of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the zzso fragment, the likely zzso as well as the zzso are required for full promoter zzso
