To study the role of the signal sequences in the zzso of outer membrane zzso we have constructed two hybrid zzso a zzso hybrid zzso which encodes the signal sequence of outer membrane zzso protein and the structural sequence of outer membrane zzso zzso and a zzso hybrid gene which encodes the signal sequence as well as 158 zzso acids of the structural sequence of the zzso zzso zzso and the complete structural sequence of zzso zzso The products of these genes are normally transported to and assembled into the outer membrane These results show: zzso that signal sequences of exported proteins are export signals which function independently of the structural zzso and zzso that the information which determines the ultimate location of an outer membrane protein is located in the structural sequence of this zzso and not in the signal zzso
