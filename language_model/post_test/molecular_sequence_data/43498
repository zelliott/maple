Both the zzso and zzso boxes are widespread promoter elements and their binding zzso zzso and zzso are extremely zzso in zzso zzso is composed of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso all necessary for DNA zzso zzso and zzso contain a putative zzso zzso a domain also present in zzso factors zzso and in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso indicates that a fraction of zzso associates with zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirm that two pools of zzso and most likely zzso zzso one associated with zzso and binding to the zzso zzso another involved in high molecular weight zzso We started to dissect zzso interactions by showing that: zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso in solution, both separately and once bound to each zzso zzso short stretches of both zzso and zzso located within the evolutionary zzso zzso adjacent to the putative zzso fold zzso are necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso previously shown to be defective in zzso zzso are also unable to bind zzso and zzso
