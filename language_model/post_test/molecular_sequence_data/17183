We have investigated the zzso zzso the domain zzso and the zzso acid zzso that are critical for the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso influx carrier zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso studies using an zzso yellow fluorescent protein zzso fusion observed that zzso zzso with plasma membrane zzso zzso Because of its PM zzso we were able to take advantage of the steep pH zzso that exists across the plant cell PM to investigate zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso The zzso sequence was inserted in selected zzso zzso zzso to orient surface zzso on either zzso or zzso faces of the PM based on the absence or presence of zzso fluorescence, zzso We were able to demonstrate in conjunction with zzso prediction programs that zzso represents a zzso membrane protein composed of 11 zzso spanning zzso In zzso a large zzso zzso series containing zzso zzso and conditional zzso was characterized to identify the functionally important zzso and zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso Whereas almost all zzso and zzso zzso cluster in the core zzso region, the sole conditional zzso zzso zzso the function of the external zzso zzso
