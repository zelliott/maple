Using zzso zzso as new method, several zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso without formation of zzso zzso side zzso zzso sequences of these fragments in comparison with zzso from other zzso zzso show a very high degree of structural zzso Four zzso zzso from zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show identical zzso sequences compared to fragments isolated after treatment with zzso zzso However, in some cases zzso zzso zzso chains at different positions if compared to the zzso zzso To analyze the zzso composition of two zzso from the first structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso several techniques were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso On basis of these results and the determined zzso acid sequence two zzso sites were identified in the zzso zzso but only one in the zzso zzso
