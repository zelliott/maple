zzso was first described in human as a zzso zzso protein that regulates cell cycle and cell zzso Mice zzso zzso displays no obvious zzso other than zzso failure from an absence of zzso In this study, we characterize rice zzso by zzso cloning and explore its function during zzso zzso In the rice zzso zzso zzso frequency is markedly reduced, and those remaining zzso exhibit a random distribution among cells, suggesting possible involvement of zzso in the formation of zzso crossovers zzso However, zzso of zzso does not affect early zzso events and zzso complex zzso zzso zzso protein displays a highly dynamic zzso on the zzso zzso It initially appears as distinct zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso signals zzso along the zzso and finally restrict to prominent zzso that specially zzso to zzso zzso The linear zzso signals always zzso on zzso signals, indicating that zzso extends along the zzso in the wake of zzso Together our results suggest that zzso is the zzso of budding zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and may specifically promote class I CO formation through modification of various zzso zzso
