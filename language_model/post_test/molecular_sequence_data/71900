zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulates zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso It contains four zzso zzso zzso three of which are capable of binding zzso zzso activates zzso in low zzso and zzso it in high zzso In this study we used deletion and substitution analysis to identify regions of zzso sequence that are specifically required for zzso and zzso A zzso sequence within zzso to zzso is required for zzso but not for zzso of zzso We localized one essential stretch to 5 zzso from zzso to zzso Another sequence essential for zzso is within the zzso zzso zzso to zzso The region between zzso 1 and 3 of zzso also contains elements needed for zzso of zzso Finally, we found that zzso of zzso requires the first 9 zzso zzso of zzso but none of the zzso from zzso to the zzso zzso are specifically required for zzso The ability of zzso zzso to regulate zzso was tested on total zzso zzso activity present in rod outer zzso In addition, the key zzso were also shown to produce similar effects on zzso bovine outer segment zzso zzso and zzso
