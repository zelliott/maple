The zzso surface zzso zzso of zzso is a neutral zzso zinc zzso The zzso has no zzso activity and does not cleave a large selection of zzso with zzso and zzso leaving groups at the zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso was studied by using natural and synthetic peptides of known zzso acid zzso The identification of 11 zzso sites indicates that the zzso zzso zzso peptides at the zzso side when zzso zzso are in the zzso site and basic zzso acid zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso are commonly found at the zzso zzso zzso is not, however, restricted to these zzso These results have allowed the synthesis of a model zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso ratio of zzso X zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a synthetic zzso overlapping the last four zzso acids of the zzso and the first five zzso of mature zzso was found to be zzso by the zzso at the expected site to release the mature zzso This result suggests a possible zzso mechanism for the zzso of the zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso was shown to inhibit zzso competitively with a zzso of 17 zzso
