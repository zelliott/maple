The zzso B virus core promoter regulates the expression of the core zzso the zzso zzso and the viral DNA zzso This promoter is zzso by zzso a zzso zzso factor, through an zzso binding site located upstream of the core zzso The zzso activity of zzso on the core promoter is antagonized by a negative regulatory element zzso located upstream of the zzso binding zzso While the zzso can effectively antagonize zzso to suppress the core promoter in zzso cervical zzso cells, it has only a marginal suppressing activity on the core promoter in zzso zzso zzso By performing zzso experiments, we have found that the zzso contains at least three independent zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of these three zzso possesses a weak suppressing activity, but together they generate a strong synergistic suppressing effect on the core zzso The zzso gamma zzso is active in both zzso and zzso cells and is bound by a protein factor slightly less than 130 zzso in molecular zzso The zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso are active in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Thus, the marginal suppressing effect of the zzso observed in zzso cells was mostly due to the activity of the zzso gamma zzso No clear protein factor binding sites could be identified in the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso when the zzso nuclear extract was used for the zzso analysis, indicating weak or no protein association with these two zzso in this cell zzso However, extensive protein factor binding sites could be identified throughout the sequences of these two zzso when the zzso nuclear extract was used for the zzso These results indicate that a different set of protein factors binds to the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso in zzso cells and may account for the zzso of these two zzso in this cell zzso Thus, our results indicate that the cell zzso activity of the zzso is due to differential regulation of the activities of the zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso by the cell zzso This regulation is most likely zzso by cell zzso protein zzso
