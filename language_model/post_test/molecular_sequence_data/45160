zzso genes were cloned from six breeds of three species of two zzso (three Chinese native cattle breeds of yellow zzso wild zzso and zzso domestic zzso one European breed of zzso zzso and two water buffalo breeds of zzso water buffalo and zzso water zzso by direct zzso The zzso products were directly inserted into the expression zzso to be zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso genes of six clones were composed of zzso zzso zzso a mature zzso with 166 zzso zzso Compared with the published zzso zzso the zzso gene of zzso cow had only one point zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso gene of yellow cattle was similar to the zzso zzso with zzso acid identity of zzso and may be considered as a new zzso zzso zzso The other four zzso zzso cloned from wild zzso and zzso domestic zzso zzso water zzso and zzso water zzso represented four new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Each of the six clones was expressed in zzso coli with molecular weight of approximately 20 zzso by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso activity zzso showed that the six zzso zzso zzso all exhibited 1,000 times higher zzso activity in the zzso cell line than in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso could inhibit infectious bovine zzso virus replication in the zzso cell line using zzso zzso zzso The results suggested that zzso a potential agent for clinical application against virus diseases in cattle zzso
