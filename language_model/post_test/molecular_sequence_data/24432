The zzso zzso system zzso is widespread among bacteria where it mediates zzso zzso and often serves in carbon zzso Here we present cloning and analysis of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso the first reaction of zzso and the reported zzso was shown to complement the corresponding zzso in zzso zzso The deduced zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids shares more than 50% zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated that zzso plays an indispensable role in zzso of zzso zzso R and this system represents a dominant sugar zzso zzso zzso was only transported and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso transport was also found to be zzso and zzso by zzso sugar zzso
