Target based virtual screening zzso combined with zzso zzso is an extremely useful tool to identify small zzso hits for proteins and in particular for zzso coupled receptors zzso However, this is a quite difficult process for zzso due to the paucity of zzso structural information on these zzso zzso the only possibility for target based VS is to build a structural model of the zzso to be used for zzso However, zzso model building is a very time consuming process, if the model should be able to explain all experimental findings and this investment is not always zzso if the model is only used for zzso Thus, a fully automated zzso is presented here, where a large number of zzso models is built, and the best model is identified to be used for zzso The zzso leads to moderate zzso with a very low zzso The zzso required are the sequence of the targeted zzso a reference zzso with experimental information and a database of small molecules to be used for zzso Manual intervention is recommended at various points, but it is strictly speaking not zzso
