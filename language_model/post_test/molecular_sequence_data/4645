We have designed and constructed a bacterial expression zzso to produce a fusion protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene was assembled using genes zzso the heavy and light chain variable zzso of zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso The zzso gene was then fused to the zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso coding zzso The expressed fusion protein zzso was zzso using an zzso affinity column, and zzso zzso of the fusion protein was then zzso The estimated molecular weight by gel zzso was approximately 151 zzso suggesting the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were calculated and compared with those of zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso were 103 zzso and zzso zzso respectively, showing that zzso activity was somewhat increased by zzso the zzso The equilibrium binding constant of zzso was determined using two different zzso zzso and zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso The obtained binding zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso No apparent difference in binding zzso was seen between zzso and zzso showing that sufficient specificity and binding affinity were retained when zzso was zzso to alkaline zzso zzso can be used to detect zzso zzso of zzso in zzso without the use of chemically zzso secondary zzso
