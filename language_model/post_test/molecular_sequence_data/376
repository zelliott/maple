zzso receptors 3, 7, and 8 zzso zzso and zzso were studied in the zzso of the domestic horse and several other zzso The zzso zzso sequences and zzso structures of these zzso genes were zzso An zzso bacterial artificial zzso clone containing the zzso gene was assigned by fluorescent in zzso zzso to the horse zzso location zzso and this map location was confirmed using an zzso radiation hybrid zzso zzso sequencing revealed 13 zzso zzso in the coding regions of the zzso zzso 3, 7, and 8 zzso Of these zzso 12 were not previously zzso The zzso frequency was estimated for each zzso zzso from zzso data obtained for 154 animals from five horse zzso Some of these zzso varied significantly among different horse zzso zzso architecture predictions for the three zzso zzso protein sequences revealed several zzso regions within the variable zzso repeats between the corresponding horse and cattle zzso zzso A zzso analysis did not indicate that any significant exchanges had occurred between zzso zzso and zzso genes in 20 zzso species zzso
