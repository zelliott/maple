zzso antibiotics are zzso by zzso under control of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes comprise the sequences of functional zzso each being responsible for incorporation of a certain zzso acid to the zzso zzso zzso frequency profiles calculated for DNA zzso covering the functional zzso of zzso zzso were often observed to be significantly distant from those determined for the complete zzso of the zzso that suggests a possibility of horizontal transferring of the zzso zzso between zzso A comparative analysis of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and statistical analysis of zzso usage zzso allows following the zzso of evolution of genes controlling zzso of antibiotics in zzso A set of zzso has been developed for zzso of zzso strains with the purpose to identify producers of new zzso antibiotics among environmental zzso
