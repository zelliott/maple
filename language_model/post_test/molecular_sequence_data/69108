The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and giant swamp zzso zzso zzso have been determined and are compared with the protein sequence of the zzso inhibitor from giant zzso zzso zzso Both zzso display zzso and there is evidence of two components in the giant swamp zzso The zzso identity between the proteins is highest at zzso for the comparison of the giant zzso zzso with the zzso forms of the zzso zzso zzso and lowest at zzso for the pairs of zzso and giant swamp zzso zzso zzso The comparisons show that the zzso from T and zzso are more related to each other than to zzso which supports their zzso zzso into different zzso zzso of the zzso site for the zzso zzso of zzso is different from that of other zzso zzso and could be at zzso
