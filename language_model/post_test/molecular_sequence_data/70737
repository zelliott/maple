The compound zzso acid zzso functions as an affinity label of the zzso pig lung zzso class zzso zzso yielding a completely inactive zzso Protection against zzso is provided by zzso zzso suggesting that the reaction target is near or part of the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso is incorporated to the extent of 1 zzso per mole of zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that zzso zzso with two zzso zzso in the ratio zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ratio is not changed by the addition of zzso The results suggest that only one of the zzso zzso can be labeled in the active site of a given zzso zzso reactions with zzso and zzso are mutually zzso We propose that the difference in labeling of these zzso zzso is related to their zzso values, with zzso exhibiting the lower zzso The modified zzso no longer binds to a zzso affinity column, even when only one of the active sites contains zzso these results may reflect interaction between the zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso of the pig lung class zzso zzso zzso are important for function and are located at or close to the zzso binding site of the zzso
