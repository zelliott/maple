Small beta zzso have many distinct biological functions, including their involvement in zzso and viral zzso zzso The relevance of structural similarities between different hairpin zzso with near zzso sequences is not yet zzso calling for the development of methods for de zzso hairpin structure prediction and zzso De zzso folding of beta strands is more difficult than that of zzso proteins because of zzso hydrogen bonding patterns that connect zzso acids that are distant in the zzso acid sequence and there is a large variety of possible hydrogen bond zzso Here we use a greedy version of the basin hopping technique with our zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso fold the hairpin structure of a zzso zzso We performed 20 independent basin hopping runs for 500 cycles corresponding to zzso zzso zzso energy evaluations zzso The lowest energy structure found in the simulation has a backbone root mean square zzso zzso of only zzso A to the native zzso The lowest 9 out of the 20 simulations zzso to zzso zzso less than zzso A zzso from zzso
