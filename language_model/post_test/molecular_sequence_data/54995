Drug zzso pumps such as zzso from zzso zzso zzso resistance to a wide range of chemically different zzso Within the zzso zzso the inner membrane protein zzso is mainly responsible for zzso zzso Recently, considerable advances have been made in zzso the drug zzso zzso through the large zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso acids in other parts of the zzso We have investigated the role of two zzso zzso zzso that are aligned around the zzso side of the central cavity of zzso The two zzso zzso zzso have been zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction of the zzso and zzso proteins with a variety of drugs from different classes was investigated by zzso of zzso and drug zzso The zzso zzso affected the zzso of compounds that have targets inside the cell, but antibiotics that act on cell wall synthesis and membrane zzso were zzso zzso our results indicate the presence of a zzso unidentified zzso site in zzso drug zzso and enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern drug resistance in zzso zzso
