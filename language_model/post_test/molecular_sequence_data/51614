We previously reported that 1 zzso D3 zzso zzso specifically stimulates production of the third component of complement zzso by zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso In the present study we examined zzso production of zzso in zzso in vitamin zzso mice, some of which received supplemental 1 zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso protein band in bone was zzso in vitamin zzso mice, but became distinct 48 h after 1 zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in bone was also zzso in vitamin zzso mice and appeared as early as 24 h after 1 zzso zzso zzso expression apparently preceded the appearance of zzso zzso In contrast, there was no significant difference in the expression of zzso zzso zzso among normal mice fed laboratory zzso and vitamin zzso mice with and without 1 zzso zzso The serum concentration of zzso in vitamin zzso mice was almost identical to that in normal mice and was unchanged after 1 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in the kidney and zzso whereas no appreciable zzso expression of zzso occurred in the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in response to 1 zzso in the zzso but not in the zzso zzso studies showed that in normal mice, the zzso protein was located mainly in the zzso regions of zzso and on the surfaces of bone zzso in the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that 1 zzso zzso regulates in zzso production of zzso in zzso The production of bone zzso cannot be attributed to the presence of zzso alone, and we speculate that other zzso factors are zzso
