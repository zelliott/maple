The zzso zzso gene has been mapped and linked zzso to a position 18 zzso 3' of its most zzso locus zzso zzso on zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso together with the position of the gene within the zzso show it to be a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The patterns of embryonic expression for the zzso gene are examined in terms of three rules, proposed to relate a zzso zzso expression pattern to its position within the zzso The anterior boundaries of zzso expression in the zzso and zzso column lie anterior to those of zzso and all other, more zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso the zzso boundary is seen to lie zzso to that of its zzso zzso by a distance equal to about the length of one zzso zzso of zzso expression within the zzso and spinal cord, but not the zzso are similar to those of other zzso zzso zzso and zzso
