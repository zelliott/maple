We have studied the evolution of zzso C virus zzso from a common source following serial transmission from contaminated batches of zzso zzso Six secondary recipients were each infected with virus from identifiable primary recipients of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of virus zzso gene sequences zzso the zzso region zzso and part of zzso confirmed their common origin, but failed to reproduce the known zzso relationships between pairs of zzso probably because of the frequent occurrence of zzso zzso at both synonymous and zzso zzso There was no evidence that the rate at which the zzso zzso zzso is affected by transmission zzso Three different mechanisms appear to have been involved in generating variation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso triplets at the zzso boundary and zzso of a duplicated segment replacing almost the entire zzso These observations have important implications for the zzso analysis of zzso sequences from zzso linked zzso
