A full-length zzso gene zzso (also referred to as the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was cloned from zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transcript is zzso zzso in zzso and the predicted zzso is 263 zzso acids in zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso The zzso gene contains the typical and predicted zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene is very similar to that of other insect zzso zzso but not to other insect zzso zzso In particular, the protein sequence of the zzso gene shows high identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis using an zzso against zzso verified the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso and adult zzso The zzso expression patterns in all the different tissue types were examined in the fourth zzso zzso zzso was detected in every tissue zzso including the body fat, zzso brain, gut, and zzso
