To determine whether the zzso zzso zzso has a role in the modification of zzso structure, we developed cell lines to model discrete stages in the zzso zzso Each cell line carries a population of zzso expressed zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso region of the rat zzso zzso We examined zzso effects at the zzso zzso domain of the rat zzso promoter, using zzso to probe for zzso of the zzso zzso Within 1 h after the start of zzso treatment, modifications in the zzso state of the zzso zzso region were detected in a zzso zzso cell line zzso In zzso zzso cell lines that maintain the same zzso expressed zzso zzso in the absence of zzso or zzso zzso factors zzso zzso no zzso modifications in the zzso state were detected at 1 or 24 zzso In zzso zzso cell lines that also contained zzso zzso functional zzso zzso + zzso no zzso modifications in the zzso state were detected at 1 zzso but a 24 h a specific modification in the local structure was zzso These data support a model in which the zzso interacts with zzso to modify local structure in such a way as to induce a zzso state for interactions of zzso factors necessary for zzso zzso of gene zzso
