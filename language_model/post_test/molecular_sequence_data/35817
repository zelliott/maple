zzso cluster analysis zzso is a protein sequence comparison method based on zzso representations of the sequences where the size, shape and orientation of the clusters of zzso zzso are primarily zzso The effectiveness of zzso has been suggested to originate from its potential ability to focus on the zzso forming the zzso core of zzso zzso We have addressed the zzso of the zzso representation used for zzso in its ability to detect the regular secondary structure elements of zzso Various parameters have been studied such as those governing cluster size and limits, the zzso zzso zzso the clusters as well as the potential shift of the cluster positions with respect to the position of the regular secondary structure zzso The following results have been found to support the zzso zzso representation used in zzso zzso there is a positive correlation zzso above background zzso between the zzso clusters and the regular secondary structure elements in zzso zzso the zzso clusters are zzso on the regular secondary structure zzso zzso the pitch of the zzso representation which gives the best correspondence is that of an zzso The correspondence between zzso clusters and regular secondary structure elements suggests a way to implement variable gap penalties during the automatic alignment of protein zzso
