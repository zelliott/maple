The zzso complex zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that is responsible for the zzso to zzso transition and the exit from zzso One of the zzso of the zzso that is required for its zzso activity is zzso a protein composed of a zzso zzso domain that has been identified in a number of diverse putative zzso zzso zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain forms a zzso structure that is related in architecture to the zzso domain of zzso zzso the zzso factor C2 domain and a domain of zzso zzso that are zzso amongst zzso zzso including a zzso zzso arrest zzso map to a zzso region of the zzso whose counterpart in zzso zzso the zzso factor C2 zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso This finding suggests the identification of the functionally important and zzso region of zzso and, since zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of other zzso zzso zzso we propose that the zzso zzso zzso perform common zzso functions in the zzso and other zzso zzso zzso
