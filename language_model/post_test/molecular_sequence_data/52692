zzso division in plant cells occurs by zzso zzso yielding two daughter zzso of equal zzso Previously, we reported that two zzso zzso of zzso a bacterial protein that forms a zzso ring during cell division, are essential for zzso division in plants, and may be involved in the formation of zzso rings on both the zzso and zzso surfaces of the zzso envelope zzso In bacteria, positioning of the zzso ring at the center of the cell is zzso in part by the protein zzso Here, we identified zzso an zzso zzso of zzso and investigated whether positioning of the zzso apparatus at the zzso zzso might involve a mechanism similar to that in zzso 

zzso analysis and in zzso zzso import experiments indicated that zzso contains a transit zzso that targets it to the zzso zzso zzso plants with reduced zzso expression exhibited zzso in zzso size and number and zzso zzso zzso strongly suggesting that the zzso machinery is zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso These zzso resemble those of bacterial zzso with altered zzso zzso 

Placement of the zzso machinery at the zzso zzso requires a zzso form of zzso The results are consistent with a model zzso assembly of the division apparatus is initiated inside the zzso by the zzso form of zzso and suggest that positioning of the zzso components of the apparatus is specified by the position of the zzso zzso
