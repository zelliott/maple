We have recently zzso a series of compounds based on the simplest functional unit of zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These compounds zzso zzso of zzso in a similar fashion to zzso as well as zzso of zzso to a limited zzso In this work we compared the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the published zzso compound zzso in terms of stability, DNA zzso and pH dependence using gel zzso zzso The results show that 2 has a shorter lifetime and is at least zzso times more zzso with DNA than zzso It is completely zzso between 30 and 60 zzso in buffer and its reaction with DNA is complete within 5 zzso In contrast, only a fraction of 1 is zzso after 60 zzso and retains zzso towards DNA even after 3 zzso The zzso of both 1 and 2 with DNA are pH dependent and reaction rates rapidly decrease in the range pH zzso zzso molecular zzso studies suggest that the zzso group on 2 enables the drug to bind to the zzso minor groove more zzso thus zzso the orientation of the zzso in the groove such that the zzso zzso ring is located close to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso A possible mechanism of action of these drugs is presented based on these zzso
