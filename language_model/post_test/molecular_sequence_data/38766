The assembly of an zzso library has been achieved in a practical and efficient manner employing zzso zzso sequential zzso With the help of the zzso zzso values of zzso using a zzso zzso or zzso with one free zzso group as zzso and donor coupled with another fully protected zzso a zzso or zzso is selectively formed without zzso and subsequently reacted in zzso with an zzso inactive zzso zzso or zzso to form a zzso or zzso in high overall zzso The approach enables the rapid assembly of 33 linear or zzso fully protected zzso using designed building zzso These fully protected zzso have been partially or completely zzso to create 29 more structures to further increase the diversity of the zzso
