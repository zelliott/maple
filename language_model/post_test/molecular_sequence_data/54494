Gene therapy for zzso A would be facilitated by development of smaller expression zzso zzso factor VIII zzso which demonstrate improved zzso and/or enhanced zzso zzso B domain deleted zzso zzso retains full zzso function and is expressed at higher levels than zzso zzso However, a partial zzso zzso leaving an zzso 226 zzso acid stretch zzso increases in zzso zzso of zzso tenfold compared with zzso In this study, we tested various zzso zzso in the context of either zzso or zzso zzso sequences expressed under control of the strong, ubiquitous zzso Focus zzso zzso promoter within a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso zzso showed expression of zzso activity and zzso correction sustained over 250 zzso zzso zzso zzso achieved an unprecedented zzso to zzso increase in zzso yielding more than zzso normal human zzso zzso zzso of B domain sequences to zzso did not significantly increase in zzso zzso These significant findings demonstrate that shorter zzso zzso that can be more easily zzso in viral zzso can result in increased therapeutic efficacy and may deliver effective gene therapy for zzso zzso
