The inhibitor protein zzso of the zzso protein zzso was first characterized from rabbit skeletal zzso More recently a form of zzso was isolated and cloned from rat zzso which shares relatively limited zzso acid sequence with the rabbit skeletal muscle zzso We have now isolated a zzso from rat brain which encodes a protein corresponding to the rabbit skeletal muscle zzso This establishes the presence of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the same species and therefore that they clearly represent distinct zzso We have also demonstrated that the zzso from zzso like the skeletal muscle zzso is specific for the zzso protein zzso and that it is able to inhibit this zzso when expressed in cultured zzso zzso Both forms contain the five specific zzso acid recognition zzso which have been shown to be required for high affinity binding to the protein zzso zzso site, although there is some noted lack of conservation of zzso used for these zzso Overall, the two rat zzso are only zzso identical at the zzso acid level and zzso at the level of coding zzso We propose that the rabbit skeletal muscle and rat zzso forms be designated zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, we have examined the tissue distribution of the two forms in the rat and their relative expression during zzso In the adult zzso zzso of the zzso alpha species is highest in muscle (both skeletal and zzso and brain zzso and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
