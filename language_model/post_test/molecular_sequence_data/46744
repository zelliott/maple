In order to address the recognition mechanism of the fragments of zzso variable regions, termed zzso toward their target zzso an zzso crystal structure of an zzso egg white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with its zzso zzso zzso egg white zzso zzso was solved at zzso zzso The overall structure of the complex is similar to that reported in a previous article dealing with the zzso zzso complex zzso ID zzso However, the areas of zzso covered by zzso upon complex formation increased by about 100 zzso in comparison with the zzso complex, and two local structural differences were observed in the heavy chain of the variable region zzso In addition, small but significant local structural changes were observed in the zzso zzso The zzso data permitted the identification of two water molecules between the zzso and zzso and six water molecules retained in the interface between the zzso and the light chain zzso determining regions zzso 2 and 3 zzso and zzso These water molecules bridge the zzso interface through hydrogen bond formation in the zzso zzso Eleven water molecules were found to complete the imperfect zzso zzso suggesting that zzso molecules mediate the stabilization of interaction between variable zzso These results suggest that the zzso effect of deletion of constant regions on the zzso interaction is compensated by an increase in favorable zzso including structural changes in the zzso interface and zzso hydrogen bond formation upon complex formation, which may lead to a minimum decreased affinity of the zzso zzso zzso toward its zzso
