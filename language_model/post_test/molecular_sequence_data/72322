The zzso of the von zzso zzso gene zzso affected individuals to zzso syndrome and is an early genetic event associated with sporadic zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso has been shown to form a stable complex with zzso B and zzso C, two factors that stabilize and activate the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso Here, zzso a member of the recently identified zzso family, the zzso is shown to specifically associate with the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex in zzso and in zzso Nearly zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso of zzso disrupt this zzso The zzso association is strictly dependent on the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show zzso to be a zzso protein that can be zzso to the nucleus by zzso Recently it has been shown that a zzso zzso zzso zzso is part of a zzso protein zzso complex that targets cell cycle proteins for degradation by the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a zzso zzso of another zzso zzso zzso results in zzso in all zzso and is required for cell cycle zzso zzso zzso may be required for zzso function and, therefore, may be a candidate human zzso zzso
