The refined solution structure of an zzso zzso zzso zzso in complex with the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso reveals an unexpected type VI zzso zzso zzso zzso at the center of a zzso The central zzso and zzso of this turn are linked by a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the turn interact extensively with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the backbone of the zzso including the central zzso loop, is well ordered in the zzso The solution structure is significantly different from the X-ray structures of zzso zzso peptides bound to zzso zzso These differences could be due to a zzso zzso zzso preceding the zzso sequence in the zzso strain, and the much longer zzso zzso immobilized by the zzso zzso
