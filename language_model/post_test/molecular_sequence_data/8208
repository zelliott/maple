A zzso repetitive sequence of zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso repeats were zzso The zzso between them was zzso the differences being due only to base zzso The sequence was found 60 times repeated in the zzso and was detected in 11 of 14 zzso When used as a probe, the cloned zzso detected the zzso with the same sensitivity the zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso amplification detected zzso zzso of DNA, equivalent to a single zzso in strains from America, Asia, and zzso The restriction patterns were zzso and different among the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso clones that contain the repetitive sequence confirms that it is present in various zzso contexts and is located zzso
