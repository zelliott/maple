zzso zzso from the domestic zzso were examined for genetic zzso by the random amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso Nine different zzso zzso with arbitrary DNA sequences were tested as zzso to amplify DNA from six zzso species infecting zzso Two strains each of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Depending on the zzso zzso between 1 and 12 DNA segments ranging in size from zzso to zzso zzso were zzso The two strains of zzso zzso showed minor and major differences in their amplified DNA patterns, giving a similarity zzso of zzso The two strains of zzso zzso seemed to be more closely zzso yielding a similarity zzso of zzso The differences observed between species were greater than those found between strains with every primer used, indicating that the zzso zzso could be a useful tool for the study of relationships among these zzso The results obtained in this study also indicate the presence of unique, zzso amplified DNA segments that could be exploited to identify zzso species of the zzso
