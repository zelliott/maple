A previously unknown zzso zzso is essential for the conversion of starch to zzso in zzso leaves at zzso The zzso was identified by zzso two zzso zzso with high starch levels and very high zzso an intermediate of starch zzso The zzso affect a gene of previously unknown function, zzso We show that zzso a zzso zzso that is unrelated to other sugar zzso The severe zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso the zzso route of zzso export from zzso at zzso zzso genes in plants including rice and potato indicate that zzso export is of widespread zzso
