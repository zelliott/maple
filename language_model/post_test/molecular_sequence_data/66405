zzso zzso zzso often lack zzso and zzso modifications that are found in zzso zzso These structural and chemical elements normally stabilize the folding of zzso zzso into zzso structures that are competent for zzso and zzso For example, the zzso zzso stem and loop domain is involved in the zzso structure of zzso zzso through hydrogen bonds and a zzso bridge to the zzso zzso stem and loop zzso These interactions are often absent in zzso because the zzso is truncated or zzso Using gel mobility shift zzso zzso circular zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have investigated the functional folding interactions of chemically zzso and zzso modified zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso is critical for folding of the truncated zzso of bovine zzso with the zzso zzso zzso to the expectation that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso structure was unfolded and relaxed, rather than stabilized in the presence of zzso Because the zzso is transcribed prior to the zzso we conclude that zzso prevents zzso of the zzso of bovine zzso zzso its correct interaction with the zzso The interaction of the zzso zzso with the zzso was enhanced by a zzso located in either the D or zzso compared to that of the unmodified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also affected the folding interaction of a zzso zzso but had minimal effect on the folding of an zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso facilitated zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso modifications assist and stabilize the formation of the functional zzso zzso zzso
