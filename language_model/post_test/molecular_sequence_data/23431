About 130 zzso of sequence information was obtained from the zzso zzso isolated from the stool of a pediatric zzso patient in zzso The DNA shared up to zzso base pair identity with zzso zzso The most zzso regions between zzso and T4 were the structural zzso but their degree of conservation was not zzso The head genes showed the highest sequence zzso followed by the tail, zzso and tail fiber zzso Many tail fiber genes shared only protein sequence zzso Except for the zzso of zzso genes in T4 and gene 24 zzso in zzso the structural gene maps of the two zzso were zzso The zzso tail fiber proteins zzso and zzso were only zzso related to zzso but shared up to zzso zzso acid identity to other zzso zzso suggesting lateral gene zzso A greater degree of zzso was seen between zzso and T4 over DNA replication and DNA transaction zzso While most of these genes came in the same order and shared up to zzso protein sequence identity, a few zzso zzso and replacements of genes were zzso Many putative gene insertions in the DNA replication module of T4 were flanked by zzso zzso zzso suggesting mobile DNA zzso A hotspot of zzso diversification was located downstream of the DNA zzso gene 43 and the DNA binding gene zzso Comparative zzso of zzso zzso sequence revealed that zzso zzso diversify more by the zzso of point zzso and occasional gene zzso events than by modular zzso
