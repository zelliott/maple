zzso acid zzso plays an important role in signaling the zzso of plant defense responses against pathogen attack including induction of zzso zzso zzso To gain further insight into the zzso signal zzso pathway, we have isolated and characterized a tobacco mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso The zzso gene was induced upon zzso infection during both the hypersensitive response and development of systemic acquired resistance in the resistant tobacco zzso following the rise of zzso zzso but was not activated in the susceptible zzso that fails to accumulate zzso The zzso gene was also induced by incompatible bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso during the hypersensitive zzso zzso zzso treatment rapidly zzso 15 zzso activated the expression of zzso in both resistant and susceptible tobacco zzso with the subsequent induction of zzso genes occurring several hours zzso zzso active zzso of zzso and zzso acid (a synthetic functional analog of zzso which induce zzso genes and enhanced resistance, also activated the zzso zzso In contrast, biologically inactive zzso were poor zzso of zzso gene zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso protein was shown to specifically bind to a zzso consensus sequence found in the promoter of the zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the tobacco zzso gene encodes a signaling component zzso of zzso that may participate in zzso zzso of zzso genes and plant disease zzso
