The zzso zzso virus zzso host zzso zzso protein zzso gene zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso that triggers zzso of host protein synthesis and accelerated zzso degradation during the early stages of zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that extracts from zzso cells and partially zzso zzso zzso display zzso zzso activity and that zzso is sufficient to trigger accelerated zzso degradation when expressed as the only zzso protein in an in zzso translation system derived from rabbit zzso We have used the rabbit zzso translation system to characterize the mode of zzso zzso zzso in more zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso proceeds through zzso zzso is not affected by the presence of a zzso cap or a 3' zzso tail in the zzso zzso requires zzso and occurs in the absence of zzso zzso sites of preferential initial zzso were clustered over the zzso zzso of one zzso zzso that was characterized in zzso The zzso zzso of zzso virus also induced accelerated zzso zzso in this in zzso zzso
