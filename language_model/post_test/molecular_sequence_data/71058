Here we report the characterization of an zzso coli gene zzso which encodes the principal zzso outer membrane protein termed zzso 43 zzso The zzso gene encodes a precursor protein of 107 zzso containing a zzso signal zzso zzso processing generates an zzso zzso zzso Mr of zzso and a zzso domain zzso with features typical of a bacterial integral outer membrane protein zzso Mr of 51, zzso Secondary structure analysis predicts that zzso exists as an zzso beta barrel and that zzso shows structural organization closely resembling that of zzso A1 zzso type of zzso produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The correct processing of the zzso to zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coli strains points to an zzso zzso zzso a hypothesis supported by the occurrence of an zzso zzso active site within zzso zzso a zzso zzso possesses two zzso motifs of the type implicated in binding to human zzso The mechanism of zzso phase variation was studied by zzso analysis of a panel of zzso regulatory zzso and by analysis of DNA sequences upstream of zzso Evidence strongly suggests that phase variation is regulated by both zzso zzso zzso and by zzso Thus, zzso zzso are locked on for zzso zzso whereas dam zzso are locked off for zzso zzso We propose a novel mechanism for the regulation of phase switching in which zzso competes with Dam for zzso zzso sites in the regulatory region of the zzso zzso
