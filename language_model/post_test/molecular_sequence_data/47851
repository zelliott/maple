The pharmacological properties of zzso activity described in the kidney were not necessarily consistent with the properties of the zzso gastric zzso Recent molecular biology experiments suggest that zzso zzso activity may be the product of several closely related zzso zzso At least 3 different pumps containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been detected in rabbit zzso The current view is that these zzso zzso arose through gene zzso early in evolution and the proteins evolved their differing activities over zzso The zzso protein associates with zzso in gastric zzso and is the likely mate for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Three distinct beta zzso have been implicated as possible partners for the zzso zzso but it remains to be determined which beta zzso predominantly associates with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis suggests the beta zzso was constrained by size and shape of the protein rather than specific zzso acid content during the course of zzso Multiple zzso in the kidney may be an important adaptation providing zzso for the essential zzso function of maintaining zzso zzso
