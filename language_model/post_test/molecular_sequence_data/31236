Based on protein sequence zzso zzso the zzso zzso bank, zzso pairs of zzso zzso containing one or more strongly differing sites of primary structures, was zzso The bank includes 465 zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso The zzso acid composition of zzso zzso was examined and zzso of potential zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso An analysis of the zzso of zzso acid fragments depending on the substitution site zzso or zzso or middle part of a zzso the zzso length differences and zzso properties of zzso such as volume, zzso polarity and zzso point, was carried zzso Based on this analysis some general empirical rules of zzso insertions in carrier proteins were zzso The rules are directed at performing modifications leaving the general structure and function of the carrier protein zzso zzso The selection scheme for the regions suitable for modification and the criteria for determination of the range of acceptable variations in these regions were zzso The use of the potential zzso profile for detecting regions suitable for zzso zzso was considered using surface protein of zzso B virus as an zzso
