Recently, we reported evidence for linkage between zzso Y zzso and both obesity and several zzso quantitative measures in a sample of Mexican Americans from zzso County, zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate putative variation within the coding and promoter regions of zzso 

Five young, obese individuals zzso mass index zzso 33 to 45 zzso age 14 to 30 zzso five adult, lean individuals zzso 20 to 26 zzso age 39 to 65 zzso and five sibling pairs sharing no zzso that were identical by descent at a marker locus zzso to zzso were selected for zzso sequencing of approximately zzso base pairs zzso immediately zzso from the start site and all four zzso of zzso We identified a total of eight zzso sites, including a zzso zzso zzso within a putative negative regulatory region zzso and a zzso deletion at the zzso zzso 1 junction zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were typed in a separate random sample of Mexican Americans (N zzso zzso from zzso County, zzso 

zzso of zzso resulted in a significant association between zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso in the entire sample and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso abdominal circumference zzso zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso in a non-obese zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was observed in only one pedigree and does not appear to segregate with obesity within this zzso 

This study reports newly identified common human sequence variation within the regulatory and coding sequence of zzso Several zzso were observed, and of those tested, the zzso promoter region zzso may influence body fat patterning in non-obese individuals but does not appear to play a major role in the zzso of common forms of obesity in this zzso
