The zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso and a pair of zzso regulatory particles zzso plays important roles in degradation of the zzso protein in zzso zzso The zzso consists of six different zzso zzso and, at least, 11 zzso zzso In rice, we previously identified duplicated genes zzso four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, the zzso sequences of all rice zzso zzso were identified from the rice zzso database and the zzso structure of zzso zzso genes was zzso The rice zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso by three pairs of duplicated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified in zzso by using zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso The relative amounts and the expression patterns of these zzso zzso zzso in the zzso were found to be different from those of the zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso regulatory particles engaged in the zzso protein zzso
