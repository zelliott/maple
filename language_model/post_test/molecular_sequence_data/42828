zzso of the adhesive zzso von zzso factor zzso by zzso cells results in zzso zzso of small zzso and storage of the largest zzso in zzso zzso called zzso zzso This pattern is reproduced by expression of zzso in zzso cells with a regulated zzso of zzso that store the zzso protein in similar zzso zzso In these cells, deletion of the zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso The zzso composed of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso actively zzso in zzso zzso formation as zzso We expressed deletion zzso lacking either the D1 domain zzso or the zzso domain zzso in various cell lines to analyze the relative importance of each domain in zzso zzso and zzso Both proteins were zzso efficiently without being retained in the zzso zzso Despite this, neither zzso past the zzso stage and they were not zzso We conclude that several segments of the zzso are jointly involved in zzso zzso and zzso
