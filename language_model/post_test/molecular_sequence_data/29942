Two zzso of zzso virus have been isolated which grow zzso at zzso degrees C in zzso cells yet replicate normally in chicken zzso zzso cells at the same zzso In addition, these zzso exhibit zzso growth in both cell types and are zzso at the zzso temperatures zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify the basis of this host zzso we have mapped the zzso zzso for these zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping and sequence analysis of the zzso zzso revealed several zzso which mapped to the zzso zzso of zzso the putative zzso zzso of the viral zzso zzso These zzso resulted in the following zzso acid changes in zzso zzso to zzso at zzso 48, zzso to zzso at zzso zzso and zzso to zzso at zzso zzso zzso containing any of these zzso was restricted in its ability to replicate in zzso but not chicken zzso zzso cells at zzso degrees zzso In addition to its zzso zzso zzso virus derived from one zzso clone also exhibited decreased levels of zzso and zzso yet contained only a silent change in its zzso This zzso zzso occurred at zzso zzso the first zzso after the zzso termination zzso separating zzso and zzso Our results suggest that this substitution decreases zzso of the zzso zzso and diminishes production of zzso and zzso Such a decrease in synthesis rates might lead to levels of these products which are insufficient for viral zzso replication in zzso cells at the higher zzso This work provides the first evidence that zzso function can be strongly influenced by the host zzso
