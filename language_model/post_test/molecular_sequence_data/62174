The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes the alternative zzso factor zzso which bears strong zzso to many bacterial zzso factors, including zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recently, a zzso promoter was identified upstream of the zzso gene zzso which encodes the zzso protein 2 zzso & zzso zzso In this study it is shown that the product of zzso zzso is an zzso coli zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso coli core zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso from the zzso coli zzso promoter of zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso does not recognize major zzso factor zzso sequences in zzso In zzso zzso cells, two zzso transcripts were detected with zzso ends located 18 zzso I) and 54 zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso at 16 and 30 h zzso When the temperature of cultures infected with zzso zzso was shifted from 35 to 42 degrees C, the zzso transcript I increased zzso The levels of zzso zzso relative to zzso were greater throughout the exponential growth phase of the zzso body, but lower late in the zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso plays a role in the regulatory network that allows zzso to survive changes in its environment, enabling it to complete its unique zzso zzso
