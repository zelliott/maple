A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso of zzso showed reduced production of the zzso zzso The zzso gene product shows similarity of the zzso regulatory protein from zzso zzso described as the major zzso of the zzso zzso zzso genes in the latter zzso In zzso zzso interaction experiments demonstrated that the synthesis of the zzso protein is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis also revealed the presence of a second zzso zzso zzso from zzso which, like zzso was present in all species of the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso proteins from both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso share a high level of sequence identity with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory region displayed specific interactions with both the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the partially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that the cellular level of zzso protein was unaffected by the presence of zzso zzso This study shows that the complex regulatory network governing zzso in the zzso involves two totally zzso but highly zzso members of the zzso class of DNA binding zzso zzso and zzso
