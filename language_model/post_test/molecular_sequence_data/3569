One way of controlling disease transmission by zzso mosquitoes is to reduce the frequency of zzso interaction, thus reducing the probability of zzso transmission and zzso A better understanding of the zzso processes responsible for allowing mosquitoes to identify human hosts is required in order to develop methods that will interfere with host zzso We have therefore initiated a molecular approach to isolate and characterize the genes and their products that are involved in the zzso recognition zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is the main malaria zzso in sub-Saharan zzso We report here the isolation and preliminary characterization of several zzso from male and female zzso zzso zzso libraries that zzso putative zzso binding zzso Their conceptual translation products show extensive sequence similarity to known insect zzso binding proteins zzso binding proteins zzso especially to those of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso described here are expressed in the antennae of both zzso and some of the zzso zzso zzso genes are well zzso in other zzso zzso species, such as Aedes aegypti and zzso zzso
