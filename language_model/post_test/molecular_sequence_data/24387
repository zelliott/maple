The human zzso gene encodes a 202 zzso acid zzso factor characterized by a highly zzso zzso motif in the zzso half, and a less zzso zzso half that has binding activity toward the zzso zzso zzso Between these zzso is a repeat region of unknown function that encodes the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso of zzso were previously described in zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso et zzso zzso Howard et zzso zzso During a search for zzso zzso in patients with zzso we identified, in addition to 11 novel and one previously described bona fide zzso several individuals with zzso of the zzso region, involving either deletion of 18 zzso or zzso of three, 15, or 21 zzso None of these zzso was consistently associated with clinical disease and we conclude that they are at most zzso zzso The zzso stretch may serve as a flexible zzso between the functional zzso of the zzso zzso and as such may be subject to reduced evolutionary zzso
