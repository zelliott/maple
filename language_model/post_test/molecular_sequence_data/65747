The smallest known DNA zzso are those from the zzso zzso Here we show how the interplay of protein and DNA activates zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso First, zzso end binding causes a zzso change that zzso zzso important protein zzso within the active zzso zzso precise zzso at the left and right ends, the steps that liberate the zzso from its donor site, does not involve a zzso zzso zzso Rather, zzso site recognition occurs by complementary base pairing with a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso Thus, the zzso active site is constructed from elements of both protein and DNA, reminiscent of the zzso of protein and zzso in the zzso Our structural results explain why the zzso ends are zzso and how the zzso selects a target site for integration, and they allow us to propose a molecular model for the entire zzso zzso
