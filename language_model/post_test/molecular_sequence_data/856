In green algae, zzso fiber zzso zzso is the major protein of the zzso zzso fibers that are structural elements in the zzso zzso zzso Using Basic Local zzso Search zzso zzso searches of recently established databases, zzso sequences were detected in the zzso not only of green zzso species but also of a range of other zzso These included species in two zzso subgroups, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and two zzso subgroups, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together with earlier identification of zzso sequences in the zzso these results indicate that zzso of zzso are present across the zzso and zzso zzso raised against zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso react in zzso zzso with the two zzso bodies and an zzso directed zzso fiber in the zzso apparatus of zzso zzso zzso
