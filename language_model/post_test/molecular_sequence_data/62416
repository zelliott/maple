zzso chain reaction zzso was applied to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso Two sequences of the internal transcribed zzso zzso regions of zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso were amplified and compared with those of zzso registered in a DNA database zzso The ITS sequences of the zzso products obtained from the zzso zzso zzso in our laboratory were compatible with those of registered adult zzso and zzso zzso zzso amplification of the ITS regions was sensitive enough to detect a single zzso of zzso zzso mixed with zzso liver zzso Using this method, zzso larvae embedded in the liver of a naturally infected turkey were identified as zzso zzso These results suggest that even a single zzso embedded in zzso from patients with zzso zzso could be identified by sequencing the ITS zzso
