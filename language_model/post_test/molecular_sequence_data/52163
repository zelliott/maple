Two zzso were zzso from zzso zzso a zzso fungus belonging to the class zzso and designated zzso I and zzso zzso Their zzso zzso acid sequences were determined, and two synthetic zzso zzso corresponding to these zzso acid sequences were zzso Southern zzso analyses of the total zzso DNA from zzso zzso with these zzso as zzso indicated that one of the two genes zzso these two zzso was contained in a zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso and that the other one was contained in a zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso zzso Two DNA fragments were isolated from the zzso bank of zzso zzso zzso DNA with the synthetic zzso as zzso The restriction zzso analyses of these fragments coincided with the Southern zzso analyses described above and the zzso acid sequences deduced from their zzso sequences contained those identical to the determined zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso indicating that each of these fragments contained a gene zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, zzso zzso I and II, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these two genes had domain structures similar to that of the published sequence of zzso of zzso zzso except that they had an additional zzso zzso Furthermore, there were significant differences between the molecular weights zzso determined with the two zzso zzso and those deduced from the zzso sequences for both zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences of both zzso and comparison of them with the zzso acid sequences deduced from the zzso sequences revealed zzso processing not only at the zzso signal sequences but also at the zzso zzso It is concluded that these zzso are zzso with zzso and zzso in addition to the mature zzso sequences and that the zzso are located at the C zzso
