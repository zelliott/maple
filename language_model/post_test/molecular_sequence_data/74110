The zzso zzso factor is a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that is essential for the expression of a zzso regulated group of genes involved in the acquisition and zzso of sulfur in zzso zzso An approach of using zzso selection from zzso zzso was used to define zzso zzso The derived zzso site of zzso defines a symmetrical sequence zzso A T zzso zzso zzso that resembles that of other zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso By comparison, zzso shows a greater range of binding to a central core of varied zzso sequences than zzso as determined by gel shift zzso The derived zzso consensus binding sequence was further validated by demonstrating in zzso sulfur regulation using a zzso promoter zzso The zzso site data will be useful for the zzso study of zzso genes in zzso zzso which has served as a model zzso sulfur control zzso
