zzso zzso has the ability to obtain iron from human zzso via two bacterial cell surface zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso Although a wide array of strains have been shown to express these zzso zzso two studies have recently identified a series of zzso which appeared to lack the ability to bind zzso Included in this group were the members of a cryptic zzso of zzso zzso IV strains which appear to possess a zzso for female zzso zzso and are major zzso agents of zzso and zzso zzso due to zzso zzso The present study employed zzso zzso specific for genes zzso the zzso proteins of a type b zzso I strain of zzso zzso to probe the zzso zzso of zzso from the previous zzso The zzso and zzso genes which zzso zzso and zzso respectively, were detected in all of the strains tested either by zzso amplification directly or by Southern zzso zzso All of the strains displayed a zzso binding zzso and affinity isolation of zzso proteins with zzso zzso recovered zzso and/or zzso from 11 of 14 zzso including 2 of the zzso zzso IV zzso In addition, all of the strains were capable of growing on human zzso specifically, indicating that the mechanism of iron zzso from zzso is functional and is not zzso zzso These results confirm the presence of zzso genes in all of the invasive zzso zzso zzso characterized to date, suggesting that zzso iron acquisition is important in disease which zzso from either the respiratory or zzso zzso
