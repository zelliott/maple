The zzso gene clusters of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and 11, 10, and 11 open reading frames zzso were identified, zzso Genes required for zzso sugar zzso sugar transfer, and sugar processing were zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were developed targeting the zzso and zzso genes present in the zzso gene cluster of these zzso The zzso were highly zzso specific when tested against strains belonging to zzso that were isolated from food, humans, animals, and environmental sources, as well as against representative strains belonging to zzso 165 different zzso coli O zzso and a number of zzso coli zzso Thus, the results demonstrate that the zzso and zzso gene sequences were specific to zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso and can be used as diagnostic markers for rapid identification and detection of these zzso
