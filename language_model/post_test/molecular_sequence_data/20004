zzso resistance is a widely spread zzso One major mechanism that zzso zzso resistance in bacteria is the active zzso of toxic compounds through the zzso zzso pumps that are often regulated at the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso a key zzso pump in zzso zzso which is highly resistant to zzso zzso and toxic plant secondary zzso Previously we showed that zzso is the only reported zzso that binds to different classes of natural zzso compounds, which are also zzso by the zzso zzso We report here five high-resolution crystal structures of zzso from the zzso strain zzso including zzso in complex with common antibiotics and plant secondary zzso We provide structural basis for the unique zzso binding properties of zzso We identify two distinct and overlapping zzso binding zzso the first one is broader and consists of mainly zzso zzso whereas the second one is deeper and contains more polar zzso including zzso a unique zzso present in the zzso strain but not in other zzso zzso zzso a plant zzso can bind to both binding sites with distinct binding affinities and zzso zzso on zzso binding properties of native and zzso zzso proteins using zzso zzso zzso confirm the binding affinities and zzso and suggest a potential positive zzso between the two binding zzso The importance of zzso in zzso binding was further confirmed by the reduced ability of zzso in releasing the zzso zzso from bound DNA compared to the native zzso The results presented here highlight the importance and versatility of regulatory systems in bacterial zzso resistance and open up new avenues for novel zzso zzso
