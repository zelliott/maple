We demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are capable of inducing zzso clump zzso We also zzso by zzso affinity zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso which we believe could play an important role in the development of zzso zzso in the zzso of the insect zzso This zzso markedly enhanced the zzso of clump formation by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with an increase in clump size and zzso zzso The zzso zzso also significantly affected the zzso and survival of zzso zzso culture short forms, but not the long forms, when they were incubated in zzso This zzso is also one of the few described in insects with zzso activity independent of calcium zzso The partial zzso zzso acid sequence of this zzso demonstrated similarity to a bacterial zzso zzso and in preliminary experiments the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The possible role of this zzso zzso in the life cycle of zzso zzso is zzso
