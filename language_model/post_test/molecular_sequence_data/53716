zzso of zzso has been detected frequently in a variety of cancer cells and is known to repress the level of zzso zzso In human gastric zzso zzso cells, zzso protein loss has often been zzso but genetic zzso of zzso are zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso gene zzso in gastric zzso we examined the zzso status of zzso in zzso using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso analysis of 41 cases of zzso showed a complete loss of zzso zzso in 19 of 22 zzso zzso cases, but in only 2 of 19 zzso zzso zzso Of 88 zzso 21 cases were previously identified as having zzso instability zzso Interestingly, 13 of 21 zzso zzso tumors and 24 of 67 zzso zzso tumors had zzso on zzso The relatively high frequency of zzso on zzso and the strong correlation between the zzso and zzso patterns suggest that zzso is an important mechanism for zzso gene zzso in zzso
