A model flow cell system was designed to investigate pitting zzso in pipelines associated with microbial zzso A microbial zzso producing copious amounts of zzso was enriched from an oil pipeline zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso solution and the microbial zzso were pumped continuously through six flow cells containing mild steel zzso zzso Two cells received zzso inhibitor zzso two received zzso inhibitor zzso and two zzso received no additional zzso zzso were removed after 1 month and analyzed for zzso profiles and zzso microbial zzso zzso from replicate cells showed a high degree of similarity in pitting parameters and in microbial community profiles, as determined by zzso zzso gene sequence libraries but differed with treatment regimen, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso affected microbial zzso zzso microbial biomass values were more than zzso higher for coupons from flow cells treated with zzso zzso than for coupons from zzso flow zzso The total number of pits zzso zzso diameter and maximum pitting rate were significantly correlated with each other and the total number of pits with the estimated abundance of sequences classified as zzso The maximum pitting rate was significantly correlated with the sum of the estimated abundance of zzso plus zzso and with the sum of the estimated abundance of zzso plus zzso The lack of significant correlation with the estimated abundance of zzso suggests not all zzso species contribute equally to zzso influenced zzso zzso and that it is not sufficient to target one bacterial group when monitoring for zzso
