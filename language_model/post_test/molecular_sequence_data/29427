The zzso and zzso zzso proteins of animal and human zzso zzso can zzso into zzso particles zzso that closely resemble native zzso The use of different animal models shows that zzso can be very efficient at inducing a protective immune zzso However, studies with infectious zzso zzso and zzso of different zzso types indicate that the immune response is predominantly zzso We have generated a zzso zzso strain that zzso the zzso and zzso zzso proteins of both zzso and zzso and we have zzso fully assembled zzso zzso in a cesium zzso zzso at the expected density of zzso zzso Experimental evidence strongly indicated that the four proteins zzso into zzso Western zzso analysis, using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that all four proteins zzso Most importantly, zzso experiments, carried out using zzso zzso zzso and either total zzso cell extracts or zzso zzso confirmed the interaction and the formation of zzso zzso bonds between the two zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso administered to mice induced zzso zzso against both zzso protein zzso These results suggest that zzso of different zzso proteins may provide new tools for the induction of zzso directed against multiple zzso zzso
