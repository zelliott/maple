zzso reductive zzso of zzso zzso in groundwater often results in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are the only known bacteria capable of zzso beyond zzso to zzso zzso In this study, two newly isolated zzso strains zzso and zzso with dissimilar functional abilities are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vinyl zzso zzso to zzso while strain zzso zzso zzso and all three zzso zzso only to zzso Each of these zzso reactions are coupled to growth by these zzso The VC zzso rate of strain zzso occurs at a rate of zzso per zzso per zzso of zzso about two times faster than previously reported zzso zzso zzso possesses the zzso gene while strain zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share zzso zzso zzso gene sequence identity with previously zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso placing it within the zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of all genes present in the zzso and zzso zzso were detected in strains zzso and zzso respectively, using a zzso zzso targeting four zzso zzso zzso Genes that were not detected in strains zzso and zzso are mostly within the high plasticity regions or integrated elements of the zzso zzso This study reports the functional description and comparative zzso of two additional zzso zzso and provides evidence that the observed functional zzso between the activity and core zzso zzso of zzso strains is likely driven by the horizontal transfer of key reductive zzso zzso
