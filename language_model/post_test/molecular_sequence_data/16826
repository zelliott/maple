zzso of small zzso zzso zzso T cells is a critical event in zzso zzso Such cells predominantly zzso zzso peptides in which specific zzso are zzso zzso may be zzso by zzso tissue zzso zzso a protein which is also the main zzso in zzso zzso Our aim was to study how the two main zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso influenced by the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and thereby contribute to further zzso of the zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso We prepared zzso zzso reacting specifically with the zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso zzso A solid phase zzso combined with gel zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso of these peptides to zzso Our results show that zzso was zzso when incubated with zzso zzso with fresh zzso sheets and with zzso zzso Of other zzso tested, only zzso zzso was able to generate the zzso zzso A fraction of the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso including zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso is responsible for generation of the active zzso zzso As the zzso often occurs in a repeat structure, the result may be zzso of a zzso zzso activated cell zzso zzso the zzso may occur by reversal of the zzso zzso The results provide a basis for the suggestion that binding of a zzso to a zzso in connection to its modification to a T cell zzso might be a general explanation for the role of zzso in zzso disease and a possible mechanism for the generation of zzso
