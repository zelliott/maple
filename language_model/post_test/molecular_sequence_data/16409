The zzso zzso form of zzso steroid receptors exists as a zzso complex that includes heat shock protein zzso one of the zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso or zzso and an additional zzso protein zzso Assembly of this zzso is zzso by zzso in association with accessory zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso structural element incorporating a zzso repeat zzso domain mediates the interaction of the zzso with zzso by accommodating the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso through a network of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize the zzso structural motif common to both zzso and zzso through a highly zzso clamp zzso In the present study, we investigated in zzso the molecular interactions between zzso and zzso and other stress-related components involved in steroid zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso Using a binding zzso zzso with zzso fused to zzso zzso immobilized on zzso we have identified the zzso expressed form of zzso heat shock zzso zzso as an additional target for zzso zzso mapping studies showed the binding zzso to be similar to those for zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso analysis of zzso clamp domain zzso confirmed the importance of this motif in zzso zzso Additional zzso thought to mediate binding specificity through zzso interactions were also important for zzso zzso zzso was shown to have a preference for zzso over zzso Surprisingly, zzso was unable to compete with zzso for zzso zzso suggesting that zzso discriminates between the zzso zzso sites in zzso and zzso zzso which contains multiple units of the zzso zzso was shown to be a direct competitor with zzso for zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso was shown not to influence the zzso zzso activity of zzso Our results suggest that zzso may have a modulating role in zzso as well as zzso cellular zzso
