The zzso zzso binding protein La recognizes zzso on its small nuclear zzso zzso and zzso them against zzso zzso We report that newly described zzso protein 4 zzso is a factor that can bind zzso zzso and interact with zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells revealed that zzso interacts with zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and its zzso decreases zzso zzso of the zzso binding or zzso interaction motifs decrease zzso association with zzso Several translation and zzso zzso proteins use a zzso sequence containing a critical zzso zzso to make direct contact with the zzso domain of zzso and their competition for the zzso is thought to regulate zzso zzso Unlike all zzso previously analyzed zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso with zzso in place of the zzso zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso studies have shown that a zzso representing zzso zzso interacts with the zzso of zzso within the affinity range measured for other zzso motif zzso A zzso of zzso bound to zzso zzso shows zzso in the pocket in zzso otherwise occupied by zzso We present evidence that zzso expression stimulates zzso reporter activity by promoting zzso stability, as shown by zzso zzso analysis of zzso and cellular zzso We propose that zzso activity is integrated with other zzso protein activities by zzso as part of zzso zzso
