The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been assigned of the zzso complex of an analogue 2 of zzso zzso 1 bound to the zzso zzso by a combination of zzso difference, zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso which recognizes zzso sequences exclusively, analogue 2 possesses structural features designed to permit the recognition of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso experiments place the drug in the minor groove and it is located on the zzso zzso The orientation of the drug in the groove is such as to place the zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso experiment show that the DNA duplex retains its right-handed B form, similar to that in the free zzso zzso zzso locate the zzso zzso on the zzso and are consistent with the zzso nitrogen forming a new hydrogen bond to zzso at zzso The drug appears to undergo rotation around the zzso bond, at a rate comparable with zzso time scale, even after zzso zzso temperature zzso studies established that the DNA is zzso stabilized as a result of the drug zzso The drug binding is a dynamic process involving exchange between the equivalent zzso sites at approximately zzso with delta G degree of 65 zzso zzso at zzso The experimental evidence is in zzso with a zzso mechanism for this zzso
