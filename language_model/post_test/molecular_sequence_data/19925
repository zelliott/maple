zzso mud volcanoes are formed by zzso of zzso zzso and gases from deeply buried subsurface zzso They are highly reduced zzso zzso and often associated with intensive methane zzso In this study, the microbial diversity and community structure in methane-rich sediments of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated by comparative sequence analysis of zzso zzso genes and zzso in zzso zzso In the active zzso center, which has a diameter of about 500 zzso the main zzso process was bacterial zzso zzso In this zone, zzso zzso belonging to three bacterial zzso closely affiliated with zzso and zzso species accounted for zzso of total zzso In sediments below zzso mats zzso the center of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso dominated the zone of zzso methane zzso zzso zzso form cell zzso mostly associated with zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were highly abundant and accounted for up to zzso of total microbial biomass at 2 to 3 zzso below the zzso zzso zzso could be further enriched by flow zzso to identify their zzso zzso At the outer rim of the mud volcano, the zzso was zzso by zzso zzso formerly known as zzso Here, both zzso and zzso methane zzso were found, however, in lower zzso The level of microbial diversity at this site was higher than that at the central and zzso zzso part of the zzso Analysis of zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso genes showed a strong dominance of a novel zzso zzso group zzso which could be assigned to zzso zzso Our results further support the hypothesis of zzso et zzso (54), that high methane availability and different fluid flow regimens at the zzso provide distinct niches for zzso and zzso zzso
