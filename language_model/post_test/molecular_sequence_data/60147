Only changes in the DNA sequence zzso deleterious effects at a functional level provide zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques applied on a protein level would be most zzso However, because of a lack of functional knowledge and powerful methods, most currently applied techniques try to resolve zzso at the DNA zzso The protein zzso test zzso provides a rare exception, targeting zzso that generate shortened zzso mainly premature translation zzso zzso has several attractive zzso including zzso the site of a zzso good sensitivity, a low zzso rate, and, more importantly, the near-exclusive highlighting of zzso zzso In addition, zzso facilitated the detection of a new zzso type, zzso a sequence change generating a zzso region surfacing in the zzso The main technical problems are related to the fact that zzso generally uses an zzso target, including the difficulties that arise from the potential differential expression and stability of the transcripts derived from the two zzso zzso The zzso has hardly evolved from the method originally zzso with zzso and zzso protein tagging forming the only innovating zzso To implement zzso screens using zzso major improvements of the basic procedure will be zzso
