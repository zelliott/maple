The zzso are a recently discovered family of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We report a zzso showing zzso to the six first reported zzso with the closest relationship to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso portion has two zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso domain including zzso acid zzso known to be involved in zzso acid recognition by other zzso The zzso domain has putative sites of zzso zzso shared with some zzso including an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to human zzso A zzso zzso form containing the zzso zzso zzso selectively recognizes the sequence zzso and binding requires the side chain of zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso predicted to be critical for zzso acid binding zzso both zzso Taken together, our findings justify designation of the zzso as zzso Analysis of bacterial artificial zzso zzso clones spanning the known human zzso location of zzso indicates that the zzso gene is also located on zzso zzso Human zzso show strong expression of zzso zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso and zzso The combination of an zzso zzso acid binding site and an zzso zzso motif suggests that this zzso is involved in zzso regulatory signaling zzso
