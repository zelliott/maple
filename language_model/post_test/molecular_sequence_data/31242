The zzso chain reaction zzso technique has been adapted to identify the sex of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso was used to amplify a specific repeated DNA sequence on the Y zzso from a single isolated zzso in under 12 zzso The remainder of the zzso zzso was then transferred to a zzso female and carried to zzso Using this technique, zzso of zzso can be zzso as potentially either male or zzso zzso of such zzso have produced zzso with zzso fetuses zzso being of the predicted zzso Variations of the technique have demonstrated certain limitations to the present procedure as well as indicated possible strategies for improvement of the zzso The zzso technique may have wide application in the genetic analysis of zzso zzso
