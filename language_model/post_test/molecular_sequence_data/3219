To investigate the distribution of zzso sites in two human zzso zzso related to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso 

The zzso acid sequences of two zzso zzso a region containing 151 zzso acid zzso preceding the first zzso domain of the human zzso and zzso with 144 zzso following the third zzso domain, were obtained from protein database by zzso software zzso zzso Four parameters including zzso and zzso zzso zzso accessibility, zzso flexibility, and Welling zzso were used to determine the zzso sites, and zzso zzso and zzso method were employed to analyze their related sequence motifs and the secondary zzso Finally, comparison of the comprehensive predictions with some of the available experimental information was zzso 

There were about six and seven zzso sites containing 8 approximately 15 zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso sites in zzso were mainly located in the zzso zzso but the ones in zzso were dispersed rather zzso Many sites in zzso zzso including some zzso in its initial part, the zzso zzso showed higher zzso accessibility, and zzso than those in zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were also different in the primary and secondary zzso zzso contained more zzso zzso and was rich in random zzso while zzso contained more aromatic zzso and exhibited mainly zzso zzso 

Both human zzso zzso related to zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a certain amount of zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso may be of higher zzso and may be more easily used as a molecular target in zzso intervention to control the zzso of zzso
