We have identified a zzso zzso factor that binds a sequence element found in the zzso promoters of all known alcohol zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of zzso clones zzso this zzso box zzso factor zzso reveals that it is a member of the zzso family of zzso regulatory zzso zzso sites within the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters function as positive regulatory elements and in zzso experiments, zzso functions as a zzso zzso In further support of a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the embryonic fat body, a tissue that contains high levels of zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that the fat body develops from zzso repeated clusters of zzso cells, which later expand and coalesce to form the mature fat zzso These observations establish zzso as the earliest known fat body precursor marker in the zzso zzso Together with the established role of zzso factors during zzso development, these results suggest that zzso may play a key role in the zzso of the fat zzso
