zzso cells from the zzso of zzso newborn rats were immortalized by zzso with the zzso virus 40 zzso zzso zzso and a cell line zzso was zzso The cells were positive for the zzso zzso and zzso to a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed the presence of zzso on the cell surface and zzso between the adjacent zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso cells were zzso Cloning efficiency of the cells was zzso in soft zzso However, the cells were not zzso in the zzso newborn zzso The cells were further transformed by zzso with the cloned activated zzso zzso containing a point zzso within zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cells zzso were different in some respects from those of the parent cells zzso zzso cells demonstrated more zzso zzso elevated cloning efficiency in soft zzso and zzso This is the first report on the zzso and zzso transformation of zzso zzso cells by zzso with a combination of zzso zzso gene and cloned activated zzso zzso
