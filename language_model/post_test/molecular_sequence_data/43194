zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened for the presence of zzso zzso Total DNA from zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and the resulting DNA fragments were separated by zzso homogeneous electric field zzso gel zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a probe, two DNA fragments of 40 and 170 zzso were identified as zzso These fragments were zzso and zzso containing zzso sequences were completely zzso The physical mapping of DNA fragments was achieved by zzso with zzso derived from adjacent fragments, and a total of zzso zzso was zzso Within the zzso region spanning zzso zzso zzso was as high as zzso zzso were identified within zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso alone zzso zzso An zzso of zzso zzso was identified within the zzso region of zzso zzso A search for putative coding regions identified a total of 17 open reading frames zzso Compared to zzso zzso 6 zzso were zzso 5 zzso were different in size, 6 zzso were newly generated, and 25 zzso were zzso It was found that zzso sequences in zzso zzso were of zzso zzso
