The zzso zzso specific zzso zzso interacts with the zzso protein zzso to form a signaling scaffold complex in zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso of the unique zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso were used to define a domain zzso interaction with the signaling scaffold zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso approaches showed that the zzso domain on zzso comprised a cluster of zzso provided by zzso together with a series of zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso This was done by zzso analyses and then confirmed in zzso pull down analyses using zzso and zzso zzso forms expressed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso attenuated its interaction with zzso both in zzso screens and in pull down zzso A zzso zzso whose sequence reflected zzso 12 through 49 of zzso bound to zzso with similar affinity to native zzso itself zzso circa 6 zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso on zzso that we here call zzso is proposed to form an zzso zzso structure that we suggest may interact with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a manner akin to the interaction of the zzso zzso signal zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso
