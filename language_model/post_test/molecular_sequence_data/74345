zzso zzso factors have been shown to play a major role in zzso both positively and zzso the plant defense zzso Nearly all studied zzso factors appear to have a zzso binding preference to one DNA element termed the zzso How specificity for certain promoters is accomplished therefore remains completely zzso In this study, we tested five distinct zzso zzso zzso factor zzso members for their DNA binding selectivity towards zzso of the zzso embedded in neighboring DNA zzso These studies revealed for the first time differences in their binding site preferences, which are partly dependent on additional adjacent DNA sequences outside of the zzso zzso A consensus zzso binding site derived from these studies was used for in zzso analysis to identify potential target genes within the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that even subtle zzso acid zzso within the DNA binding region of zzso strongly impinge on its binding zzso Additionally, all five factors were found localized exclusively to the plant cell nucleus and to be capable of zzso expression of a reporter gene construct in zzso
