Identification of zzso as a potential zzso gene zzso a protein zzso to zzso zzso in zzso which may regulate zzso function zzso powdery zzso zzso Some plant genes that are required for zzso to certain pathogens are known as zzso genes or zzso factors, whose zzso zzso can zzso the plants zzso To identify potential zzso genes to powdery zzso in zzso zzso expressed genes in compatible and incompatible interactions between wheat and powdery zzso were examined by the zzso chip zzso The genes exclusively expressed in the susceptible zzso were zzso using zzso transient transformation in wheat zzso zzso The suppression of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the pathogen penetration by zzso and its zzso increased the disease zzso The deduced protein from zzso belongs to the putative zzso zzso 1 zzso domain zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that its protein was accumulated in the zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction analysis revealed that zzso transcript was significantly induced in the compatible zzso This suggests that zzso is a potential susceptible gene and its function may be related to regulate zzso zzso
