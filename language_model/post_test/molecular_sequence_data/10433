zzso the zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso with zzso zzso of putative zzso receptors produced zzso receptors which were able to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso A multiple replacement zzso containing the second, third and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso and suppressed production of zzso zzso zzso of G alpha zzso did not alter the strength of response of this zzso A novel rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso or zzso fusion to green fluorescent protein occurred in an zzso network but not in the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso treated beta zzso receptors were functional and were observed in the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the putative zzso zzso of zzso receptors are capable of functional interaction with zzso zzso of the G alpha s zzso Instead, the absence of these receptors from the plasma membrane of zzso cells appears to explain our inability to determine if zzso can activate the zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the zzso receptors have requirements for maturation and targeting to the plasma membrane that are different from most other zzso zzso
