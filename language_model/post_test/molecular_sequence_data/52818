A defined medium with ethanol as sole carbon source was devised for growth of the colorless, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell density on this carbon source was related to zzso zzso An zzso pH was required for ethanol zzso best yields were obtained at pH zzso zzso analysis of the cells showed that the concentration of zzso c per cell was zzso higher than at pH zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso c zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were the zzso A soluble zzso zzso was zzso from cells grown at pH zzso and characterized by zzso sequencing as the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso respiratory zzso zzso of total cell proteins showed higher zzso of zzso zzso at pH zzso than at pH zzso zzso zzso analysis gave clear evidence of the abundance of zzso transcript in cells grown at pH zzso The amount of zzso proteins obtained from cells grown at pH zzso was twofold higher than that of cells grown at pH zzso zzso isolated from both cell types readily oxidized zzso zzso or zzso The rates of oxygen zzso were zzso higher in zzso from cells grown at pH zzso Cyanide and zzso A inhibited zzso with zzso up to zzso in both types of zzso The participation of zzso zzso in zzso electron transport from zzso to oxygen was shown by spectral zzso
