The zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is a member of the zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso As the relationship between structure and function for this zzso remains poorly zzso the present study was undertaken to characterize the structure of a segment including the first and second zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso To accomplish this, a zzso zzso bundle from this region was zzso zzso and characterized by zzso zzso of this zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso using a fusion protein zzso strategy and zzso by affinity zzso combined with reverse phase zzso Chemical and zzso zzso methods were implemented to remove the fusion zzso The zzso zzso protein samples were analyzed and confirmed by zzso mass zzso and circular zzso zzso The CD analyses of zzso protein in solution and in zzso zzso preparations suggested zzso zzso structures under both zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was further verified and analyzed by zzso zzso zzso assignment was accomplished for more than zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso results show a clear chemical shift zzso of the zzso zzso correlation indicative of a pure zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that this method is capable of generating zzso zzso zzso from zzso in quantity and purity sufficient for zzso and other zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a satisfactory alternative strategy to obtain and assemble zzso structures from zzso zzso zzso
