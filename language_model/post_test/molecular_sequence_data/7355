The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso containing the structural gene zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The sequence was found to contain an open reading frame zzso with a zzso content of zzso oriented in the direction of zzso that was confirmed by primer zzso The zzso encodes a protein with an zzso of zzso consisting of zzso zzso acids and is preceded by a potential zzso zzso The zzso usage pattern is in agreement with the general pattern for zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso content in the third zzso The zzso sequence of the mature zzso zzso zzso exactly to that predicted from the zzso zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso zzso were identified for the zzso However, a zzso zzso was located near the zzso zzso of the mature protein and is a good candidate for the zzso zzso The zzso start point of zzso was located 36 zzso upstream of the start zzso by primer zzso The zzso region of the putative promoter showed some similarity to the consensus sequence for the major class of zzso zzso but the zzso region was less zzso zzso of the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso of zzso zzso with other zzso acid sequences indicated that zzso is a blue copper protein with copper binding zzso in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the promoter region of zzso and a portion of the zzso was shown to promote zzso expression when cloned in the zzso promoter probe zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso expression could be zzso by zzso in zzso zzso when the zzso was grown on zzso or zzso plus zzso Thus, the cloned promoter region appears to contain the sequences responsible for zzso repression of zzso zzso
