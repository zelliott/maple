A novel zzso was detected in the Factor VIII gene of a sporadic case of severe zzso zzso The zzso a zzso transition, converts zzso zzso to Term and adequately accounts for the severe zzso zzso zzso sequencing was used to confirm the carrier status in the zzso zzso of zzso A in an zzso pregnancy was then achieved by demonstration of the absence of this zzso in fetal DNA from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was also zzso by chemical zzso of mismatch zzso which both confirmed the prenatal diagnosis and established the carrier status of the zzso zzso This example therefore serves to illustrate the potential of direct gene analysis in sporadic cases of zzso A and/or in families zzso for known zzso
