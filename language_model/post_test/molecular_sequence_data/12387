zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso receptors define a family of receptors that mediates programmed cell zzso We have explored relationships of architecture and function in this family through a molecular model of zzso also called zzso or zzso Modeling by zzso took advantage of four modular zzso in the crystal structure of zzso that also occur in zzso zzso complexes between the model and a zzso structure (for nerve growth factor, zzso were then examined using zzso zzso zzso appears to bind in the zzso interface of zzso making two sets of zzso zzso zzso III and IV provide the zzso surfaces, in contrast to zzso in which zzso II and III contact zzso zzso zzso II appears to have been zzso zzso potentially contributing to an interface between zzso zzso These and other specific predictions of the model will require experimental zzso
