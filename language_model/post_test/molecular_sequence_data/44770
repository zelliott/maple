The degradation process of zzso a zzso zzso storage protein of soybean seeds, during zzso and zzso growth was examined by zzso A zzso combined with zzso gel zzso We detected and analyzed the structures of key zzso fragments of 30 zzso derived from zzso degradation, they were proved to be zzso type zzso of zzso We show here a degradation process of zzso zzso is subjected to limited zzso at exposed regions on the molecular surface, like domain zzso generating zzso zzso fragments before zzso zzso
