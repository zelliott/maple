In this study, we characterized a zzso hypersensitive response zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein that contains an zzso C2 domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso and its zzso in zzso were induced by infection with incompatible zzso indicating the zzso function of this zzso zzso was not induced by treatment with zzso hormones, but was induced by zzso zzso including zzso zzso of zzso in tobacco plants suppressed the spread of zzso cell death and restricted the spread of an incompatible virus from local zzso zzso the results suggest that zzso zzso regulates plant zzso cell zzso
