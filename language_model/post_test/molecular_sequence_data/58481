In this chapter, we review the structure and composition of zzso and zzso zzso We discuss how these observations support the model that zzso zzso is a deterministic process leading to the zzso folding of a given zzso The structural studies have also placed constraints on the mechanism of zzso and defined several activities needed to mediate zzso In the context of these activities and structural information, we present our current understanding of the role of zzso sites, zzso zzso II, and zzso proteins in zzso We conclude by using our current knowledge of zzso zzso to address the differences in zzso zzso observed from bacteria to humans and to explore the relevance of this process to other processes such as gene zzso
