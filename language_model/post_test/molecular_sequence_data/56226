Nine zzso zzso corresponding to genes that are responsive to zzso (named zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso The sequence of a putative protein zzso by one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits considerable zzso to an unidentified seed protein zzso of zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso zzso is induced by salt stress as well as by water deficit but not by cold or heat zzso zzso zzso appeared after the application of zzso acid zzso an indication that zzso of zzso zzso is induced by zzso zzso the production of which is triggered by drought and salt zzso The induction of zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited by zzso Thus, it appears that protein synthesis is required for the induction of this zzso by zzso By contrast, protein synthesis was not required for the zzso induction zzso zzso which zzso to another zzso gene of zzso zzso These results suggest that there are at least two mechanisms for the induction of zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso was also expressed during the early and middle stages of seed development, showing a pattern of expression similar to that of zzso The zzso expression of zzso seems not to be regulated by zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso clone revealed that the structural gene zzso zzso contains three zzso and only a single copy of the gene is present in the zzso zzso zzso while the gene for zzso from zzso zzso is actually a family of genes with 10 to 20 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
