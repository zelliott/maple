zzso studies of primary tumors and tumor derived cell lines revealed that inappropriate zzso of specific zzso zzso of zzso and zzso occurs with high frequency in a wide variety of human zzso We reported recently that the melanoma inducing zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso of zzso in fish melanoma zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in solid zzso in general and its function in melanoma in zzso Recent examinations suggest that activated zzso zzso zzso in zzso by stimulating cell proliferation and preventing zzso As an initial approach to understanding the consequences of zzso induced zzso zzso we used the well characterized pro zzso line zzso as a sensitive system to zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso as being involved in both growth and survival zzso triggered by the zzso zzso possibly due to zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso We also found a new mechanism of zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso direct interaction of the zzso zzso domain with the zzso protein in a zzso independent way led to zzso of zzso in terms of DNA binding and target gene zzso
