This review covers the functionally diverse type III zzso zzso zzso zzso of plant and bacterial zzso zzso from the discovery of zzso zzso zzso in the 1970s through the end of zzso A broader perspective is achieved by a comparison of these zzso zzso to mechanistically and zzso related families of zzso including the type I and type II zzso as well as the zzso and zzso zzso of fatty acid zzso As zzso is both the most frequently occurring and best studied type III zzso this zzso structure and mechanism is examined in zzso The in zzso functions and biological activities of several classes of plant natural products derived from zzso are also zzso zzso mechanisms of type III zzso divergence are considered, as are the biological functions and activities of each of the known and functionally divergent type III zzso zzso families zzso twelve in plants and three in zzso A major focus of this review is the integration of information from genetic and zzso studies with the unique insights gained from protein X-ray zzso and zzso zzso This structural approach has generated a number of new predictions regarding both the importance and zzso role of various zzso acid zzso observed among functionally diverse type III zzso zzso
