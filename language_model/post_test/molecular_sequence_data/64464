Analysis of deletion zzso of human zzso gene zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso is of particular interest because of the increased proportion of the deletion zzso among the infants born from the parents, one of which lacks the deletion zzso and the other is zzso for the zzso In this study, zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso examined were assessed in a number of zzso and zzso populations of zzso In all populations tested, relatively high prevalence of the zzso zzso ranging from zzso in ethnic Germans to zzso in zzso was zzso Russians and Kazakhs were characterized by intermediate zzso of the rare zzso zzso in these populations zzso and zzso zzso zzso expectations were met in all populations zzso pointing to a stable level of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso It was established by the context analysis of DNA of the deleted zzso along with the zzso sequences that this region contained a number of zzso factor motifs zzso zzso and zzso potentially capable of the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso The deletion zzso was localized within the zzso zzso which, together with the neighboring zzso zzso form the potential zzso composite zzso It was suggested that zzso lacking the zzso of zzso 11 could be restricted in its ability to zzso the level of the zzso zzso in response to the action of zzso The data of molecular zzso survey serve as the indirect evidence favoring the suggestion on the possible functional value of this gene zzso It was demonstrated that in the samples of acute zzso and zzso patients zzso and zzso zzso were statistically significantly different from those in the population zzso In case of zzso the frequency of rare zzso was zzso times lower, and in case of acute zzso it was zzso times higher than in the control zzso
