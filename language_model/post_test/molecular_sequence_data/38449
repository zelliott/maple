zzso of the zzso gene are frequent in various human zzso We investigated zzso gene status in 20 zzso zzso by zzso zzso chain zzso zzso zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso and sequencing zzso None of the primary tumors showed any zzso or zzso zzso However, 19 out of 20 tumors displayed both a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso In some of these samples, we detected zzso zzso zzso with partial deletions of both zzso 1 and 2, which could not zzso a functional zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso revealed common zzso zzso sequences before and after the deleted region, which might cause abnormal zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that both promoter zzso and zzso zzso processing may interfere with zzso expression in zzso zzso
