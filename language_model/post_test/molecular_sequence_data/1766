zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays an important role in tumor zzso where it functions as one of the major zzso factors sustaining growth and draining zzso In this study, we developed an zzso zzso targeted to the zzso part of human zzso zzso We endowed this zzso with an additional feature expected to improve its activity in zzso by cloning it into a zzso zzso zzso zzso is originally part of the zzso zzso and is characterized by high zzso rates, good stability due to its strong secondary structure and zzso zzso zzso of zzso human zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso for this zzso resulted in a strong zzso reduction of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso indicating a good biological activity of the zzso Moreover, this reduction in zzso zzso had the important functional consequence of drastically diminishing the formation of zzso structures of human zzso vascular zzso cells in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our zzso zzso zzso is a good inhibitor of zzso in zzso in a zzso cell zzso Thus, it may represent a useful tool for future applications in zzso for zzso gene therapy of zzso and of highly zzso zzso
