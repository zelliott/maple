Human plasma and serum proteins are subject to intrinsic zzso degradation both during and after blood zzso By monitoring zzso we investigated the stability of plasma and serum samples and the effects of zzso and zzso zzso on the plasma zzso zzso and plasma were subjected to zzso zzso and the peptides zzso zzso were extracted and analyzed with zzso zzso zzso of interest were further identified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our observations indicate that plasma peptides are significantly different from serum zzso zzso zzso cause these differences between plasma and serum samples, as well as the differences among three plasma samples using either zzso sodium zzso or zzso as the zzso which accounts for partial zzso effects on plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso including both zzso and zzso also cause zzso sequential generation and zzso of the peptides in serum and all three zzso specifically during early sample collection and zzso zzso zzso within an zzso device inhibit both intrinsic plasma zzso and zzso and moderate the zzso changes of the plasma zzso including zzso and complement zzso and zzso derived zzso Our results suggest that mixing zzso zzso immediately with blood during blood collection provides enhanced stabilization of the plasma zzso
