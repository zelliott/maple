A gene that exhibits sexually induced transcript zzso zzso was identified physically linked to a locus that is also under control of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence analyses were performed to determine a large open reading frame which starts with the zzso sequence zzso The zzso showed similarities to a novel family of zzso zzso with at least 12 putative zzso zzso A gene disruption resulted in a zzso with slow aerial zzso formation that could be zzso with zzso or zzso added to the growth zzso
