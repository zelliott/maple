zzso gene expression in relation to zzso zzso expression was investigated in various zzso from zzso zzso After a single 50 zzso subcutaneous injection of zzso zzso predominantly accumulated in the liver and zzso gene expression significantly increased zzso with zzso zzso but no zzso of zzso gene expression was zzso In the kidney and zzso both zzso and zzso zzso increased significantly but the zzso of zzso zzso levels (1 h after zzso zzso preceded that of zzso (3 h after zzso A significant zzso of zzso zzso levels was also observed in the zzso after 3 zzso but that of zzso zzso occurred after 6 zzso Not only zzso of zzso but also increments in both zzso and zzso zzso were minimal in the brain, but a significant increase in gene expression was observed after 1 h for zzso and after 3 h for zzso zzso except in the zzso zzso gene expression preceded zzso gene zzso the induced zzso might transpose zzso and thereby affect its levels immediately, thus reducing the levels of zzso available for zzso in other zzso zzso the zzso interaction might be secondary to the zzso zzso However, the fact that zzso zzso was predominantly induced by zzso administration in the target zzso of zzso zzso such as the zzso kidney and zzso suggests the possible involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
