One of eight patients with zzso zzso resulted by the zzso in zzso zzso showed the deletion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments identified by the zzso for this zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso region of this zzso in an organized structure and can produce these two zzso The other zzso zzso zzso carries a processed zzso Southern analysis using a limited segment of this zzso demonstrated that the zzso and zzso zzso fragments predicted from its recognition sites in both zzso clones occur actually in the human zzso indicating that at least two copies of zzso zzso zzso exist in the zzso zzso and the patient has the zzso zzso gene deleted at a zzso zzso
