zzso host cell invasion and gliding zzso depend on the zzso zzso system located beneath the plasma membrane of invasive zzso zzso A zzso a class XIV unconventional myosin, is the motor zzso A model has been proposed to explain how the zzso motor operates but little is known about the zzso zzso and connectivity of the motor zzso Using the zzso neck and tail domain as bait in a zzso zzso screen we identified zzso a novel 24 zzso protein that interacts with zzso zzso analysis shows that the 15 zzso zzso tail domain of zzso rather than the neck domain, specifically interacts with zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso to the inner membrane complex zzso where it is found clustered with zzso The data support a model for zzso zzso and invasion in which the zzso motor protein is associated via its tail domain with zzso zzso it at the outer zzso zzso The head domain of the immobilized zzso moves zzso filaments that, directly or via a bridging zzso connect to the zzso domain of a zzso protein of the zzso zzso The zzso complex is then redistributed by the stationary zzso from the anterior to the zzso end of the zzso leading to its forward movement on a zzso or to penetration of a host zzso
