An zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso by Fast zzso Q zzso zzso and zzso Q zzso The molecular mass of the zzso was determined to be 140 zzso by gel zzso and approximately 30 zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso was at pH zzso The zzso expressed maximum activity at pH zzso and 40 degrees zzso zzso activity on zzso was inhibited strongly by zzso and zzso and partly by zzso acid but not by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso 58 to 72 was zzso The zzso showed neither general zzso nor zzso activity, and it zzso only zzso between 8 and 13 zzso zzso The zzso readily zzso the zzso and zzso bonds of zzso the zzso bond of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso bonds of substance zzso and the zzso bond of zzso zzso activity toward the zzso and zzso bonds of zzso zzso 157 to zzso was zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso showed a high degree of zzso to the zzso B zzso from zzso zzso
