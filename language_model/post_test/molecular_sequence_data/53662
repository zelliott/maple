zzso leak zzso were recently revealed to exist as independent molecular zzso Here, the zzso structure, cardiac zzso and zzso properties of a zzso example are zzso zzso zzso have two zzso P zzso and unique functional zzso At steady state, zzso channels behave like open, zzso zzso holes that are inhibited by zzso levels of zzso With zzso steps, zzso channels open and close in two zzso one appears to be immediate and one is zzso zzso zzso approximately 5 zzso Both zzso block and gating are zzso this produces an anomalous increase in outward flux as external zzso levels rise because of decreased zzso zzso Single zzso channels open across the zzso zzso zzso hence they are zzso zzso however, they open only briefly and rarely even after exposure to agents that activate other zzso zzso
