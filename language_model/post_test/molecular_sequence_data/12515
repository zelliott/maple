To assess whether zzso zzso expression contributes to insulin zzso we have investigated normal and zzso zzso cells for zzso gap zzso and zzso We have found that the zzso cells of pancreatic zzso and of a rat zzso are functionally coupled by gap junctions made of zzso In contrast, cells of several lines zzso insulin zzso do not express zzso gap zzso and zzso After correction of these defects by stable zzso of zzso zzso cells expressing modest levels of zzso and zzso as observed in native zzso showed an expression of the insulin gene and an insulin content that were markedly zzso compared with those observed in both zzso zzso cells and in zzso cells zzso zzso These findings indicate that adequate levels of zzso zzso are required for proper insulin production and zzso
