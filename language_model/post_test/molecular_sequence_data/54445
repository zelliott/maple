zzso attract increasing attention due to their utility in the mild zzso of zzso According to activity and gene zzso zzso zzso are a rich source of zzso distinct in evolution from their widely examined bacterial zzso However, zzso zzso have been less explored than the bacterial zzso zzso are typically zzso in their zzso structures, forming short spirals and extended zzso these features making their structural studies zzso 

A zzso gene was amplified by zzso from the zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The zzso product was zzso into expression zzso zzso and zzso B to construct plasmids zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso was zzso with an about zzso increase in specific activity and zzso zzso The apparent zzso size was zzso zzso which is zzso 4 zzso higher than that of the zzso isolated from the native zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso in the zzso native zzso Mass zzso analysis showed that a zzso zzso zzso - zzso was present in zzso but missing in zzso and zzso zzso was shortened to zzso in zzso The latter zzso was thus truncated by 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differed in zzso zzso zzso ratio, reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso stored for one month at zzso was zzso by gel zzso and zzso were examined by electron zzso The late zzso were further analyzed by zzso zzso and dynamic light zzso and shown to consist of a rather homogeneous protein species composed of zzso zzso This hypothesis was consistent with electron zzso and our zzso of the zzso zzso which supports an arrangement of zzso into zzso segments as a plausible structural zzso 

The zzso from zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso with proteins deduced from gene sequencing in zzso and zzso zzso As the first of these zzso it was shown to exhibit zzso activity towards organic zzso The comparison of the zzso and zzso suggested that the zzso properties of zzso may be changed due to missing zzso zzso of the former zzso zzso exhibits a lower tendency to form filaments and, moreover, the sample zzso can be further improved by in zzso protein zzso The homogeneous protein species consisting of short spirals is expected to be more suitable for structural zzso
