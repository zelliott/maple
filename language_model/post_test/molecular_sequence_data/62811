zzso to stress requires removal of existing molecules from various cellular compartments and replacing them with new zzso The transport of materials to and from the specific compartments involved in the recycling and deposition of zzso is carried out by an zzso zzso trafficking zzso Here, we report the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso from zzso The gene was induced during programmed cell death after treatment of intact leaves with zzso and salicylic acid or infection with zzso zzso zzso plants that expressed the zzso gene under the zzso zzso promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus exhibited accelerated zzso in roots, leaves, and zzso The transgenic plants accumulated sodium in the zzso and had higher amounts of sodium in the zzso The transgenic plants also showed increased tolerance to salt and zzso stresses and reduced zzso of zzso oxygen species during salt zzso These results imply that zzso trafficking plays an important role in plant adaptation to stress, beyond the zzso function in zzso zzso zzso
