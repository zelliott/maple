Comparative analysis of the human and mouse zzso sequences downstream of the zzso E gene zzso revealed a highly zzso element with previously undefined zzso In reporter gene zzso studies, this element which is located approximately 42 zzso zzso to zzso was found to have zzso activity in a subset of cell lines zzso Analysis of transgenic mice containing a fusion construct linking this zzso zzso zzso zzso element to a reporter gene comprised of the human zzso gene with its zzso promoter resulted in robust brain expression of the transgenic human zzso zzso in three independent transgenic lines, supporting the identification of a novel brain controlling region zzso Further studies using zzso revealed widespread human zzso zzso throughout the brains of the zzso transgenic mice with prominent expression in the zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso performed on brain sections and cultures of primary cortical cells localized human zzso protein to cortical zzso and zzso These studies demonstrate that comparative sequence analysis is a successful strategy to predict candidate regulatory regions in zzso although they do not imply that this element controls zzso expression zzso
