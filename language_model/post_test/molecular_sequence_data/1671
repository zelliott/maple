zzso relationship has great effect on ecological zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso bias of zzso bacteria zzso zzso (whose host is an zzso zzso zzso was investigated using zzso known genes of this zzso zzso Analysis on zzso values show that there exists only one single explanatory major axis that is linked to the strand specific zzso zzso Majority of the genes have a tendency to concentrate on the leading zzso which may be related to the zzso property related to the replication zzso zzso acid zzso were markedly different between the highly and lowly expressed genes in this zzso and in particular, zzso rich zzso acids were found to occur significantly higher in highly expressed genes than the lowly expressed zzso Comparative analyses of the zzso genes of zzso coli and zzso zzso show that highly expressed genes are significantly more zzso than lowly expressed zzso Based on our results we concluded that strand specific zzso bias is strongly operational in selecting the zzso usage in this zzso zzso selection can be invoked from the presence of majority of highly expressed genes in the leading zzso Conservation of zzso rich zzso acids in the highly expressed genes to its zzso is the major source of variation in zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso of the genes is the second major source in zzso the genes according to their zzso acid zzso in this zzso
