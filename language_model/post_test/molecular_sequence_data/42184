The distribution of zzso oxide zzso zzso in the mouse zzso bulb and zzso zzso including the zzso organ, was studied using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso with zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso protein and zzso and exhibiting zzso zzso activity were detected in the zzso layer of the main zzso bulb and the zzso cell layer of main and accessory zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells in the main zzso bulb were also zzso positive with zzso and zzso for zzso In contrast, no evidence for zzso expression was found either in the main zzso zzso or in the zzso organ, in spite of the strong zzso zzso of the surface of the main zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification experiments for detection of zzso gene expression further indicated that zzso is expressed in the zzso bulb but not in either the main zzso zzso or zzso zzso Use of an zzso raised against another zzso zzso zzso showed that this protein was strongly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso of this zzso may account for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso An involvement of zzso zzso oxide zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso is therefore zzso although zzso is clearly expressed in zzso in both main and accessory zzso zzso
