The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains seven zzso repeats which interact with the zzso protein zzso We have identified zzso in zzso that disrupt this zzso The positions of the zzso acids changed by these zzso are consistent with zzso being folded into a zzso zzso like that formed by another zzso zzso zzso the beta zzso of the zzso G protein used in signal zzso Our results also indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso resembles the interaction between zzso and G zzso suggesting that a similar structural interface is formed by zzso repeat proteins that are used in both zzso regulation and signal zzso
