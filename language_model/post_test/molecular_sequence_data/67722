The zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso responsible for zzso of zzso genes during T and B cell development, and zzso expression is known to correlate strictly with the process of zzso In contrast to zzso the expression of zzso was not previously detected during any other stage of zzso or in any other normal zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso promoter of the zzso gene (the third zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso which is located in the second zzso of zzso has zzso activity and is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso in some zzso zzso We also identify zzso zzso promoter fragments responsible for this zzso activity, and show that it is activated by zzso factor zzso The possible implications of our findings are briefly zzso
