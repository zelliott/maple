zzso and zzso are zzso zzso responsible for de zzso DNA zzso but with distinguished biological zzso In mice, disruption of zzso but not zzso causes global DNA zzso especially in repetitive zzso which comprise the large majority of zzso DNA in the zzso By measuring DNA zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso from five species, we found that zzso zzso possessed significantly higher zzso activity on zzso DNA than zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso experiments identified a single zzso acid substitution zzso in zzso zzso as being crucial for its high zzso DNA zzso zzso Further zzso studies demonstrated this substitution markedly enhanced the binding of zzso to zzso and hence increased the zzso DNA zzso zzso Moreover, this substitution was crucial for zzso to efficiently zzso repetitive zzso which increased dramatically in zzso zzso zzso with our observation that zzso evolved more rapidly than zzso during the emergence of zzso these results demonstrated that the zzso substitution in zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso DNA zzso activity and contributed to functional adaptation in the zzso zzso
