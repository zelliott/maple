A combination of zzso zzso has been developed that produces higher quality cycle zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso is a zzso zzso engineered to catalyze the incorporation of zzso with an efficiency several zzso better than other zzso DNA zzso Since the zzso also zzso zzso at zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is needed to remove the zzso produced during sequencing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and effective for converting zzso to zzso The use of the combination of zzso zzso zzso and TAP for cycle sequencing yields sequence data with uniform band zzso allowing the determination of longer, more accurate sequence zzso Uniform band zzso also facilitate interpretation of sequence anomalies and the presence of mixed zzso zzso zzso products of DNA amplified from zzso zzso individuals results in signals of equal intensity from each zzso
