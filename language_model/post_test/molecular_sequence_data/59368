To investigate regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso we have isolated and characterized zzso zzso two types of zzso salmon zzso which are referred to as zzso and zzso Two types of zzso products were amplified from total zzso of zzso salmon zzso by use of rainbow trout zzso Full length zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso library of zzso salmon using the zzso products as zzso The zzso and zzso zzso have a length of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that both zzso and zzso zzso were expressed only in the zzso and their sizes were about zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The presence of two zzso genes was confirmed by Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA obtained from a single zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso and zzso contained 230 and 226 zzso zzso The zzso terminal of zzso in zzso which zzso to zzso domain is zzso which is different from zzso of zzso found in many other zzso zzso The zzso of zzso sequences between zzso and zzso is 59% in the entire coding region, whereas zzso coding regions are highly zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso show zzso overall zzso their zzso profiles are zzso with those of several other zzso species, particularly the zzso terminal of zzso zzso zzso shows almost the same pattern with other zzso zzso
