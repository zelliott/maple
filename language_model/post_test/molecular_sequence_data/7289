The virus populations of two French barley mild mosaic virus zzso have been characterized using Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso was obtained by mechanical transmission of the other, zzso transmitted isolate zzso The results obtained show that the two zzso contain distinct zzso and zzso molecules with respect to their zzso zzso and hence contain distinct barley mild mosaic virus zzso One strain is present mainly in isolate P and closely resembles a Japanese and two German zzso It contains an zzso of approximately zzso zzso The other strain is present mainly in isolate M and closely resembles a UK zzso This strain contains a smaller zzso of approximately zzso zzso The results show that mechanical transmission causes a shift in the virus populations in favor of the zzso zzso
