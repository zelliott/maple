zzso zzso is a climber with zzso zzso 22 and some terminal zzso zzso blocks that differentiate it from other species of the zzso The zzso highly repeated satellite DNA was isolated from zzso zzso by the zzso of total nuclear DNA with zzso and zzso and cloned in zzso zzso Satellite DNA structure and zzso distribution were zzso DNA sequencing revealed that the repeat length of zzso ranges between zzso and zzso zzso the percentage of zzso pairs was about zzso and the studied clones showed an identity of zzso Although this zzso has a zzso size, direct imperfect repetitions of zzso zzso zzso it in four zzso zzso were zzso The results obtained with FISH indicate that this zzso usually appears distributed in the terminal regions of most zzso and is associated to zzso blocks observed after zzso zzso These observations are discussed in relation to the satellite DNA evolution and compared with other features observed in several plant zzso
