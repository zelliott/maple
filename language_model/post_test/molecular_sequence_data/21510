zzso prevents zzso from releasing zzso until an action potential arrives at the zzso To understand the mechanism for this zzso we determined the structure of zzso bound to a zzso of a zzso zzso lacking the portion of the zzso that zzso last to trigger zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is anchored to one zzso complex, while its zzso zzso extends away at zzso and bridges to a second complex, occupying the vacant zzso binding site to inhibit zzso We expected the accessory zzso to compete with the zzso for zzso binding but found instead that the interaction occurs zzso Thus, zzso organizes the zzso into a zzso zzso that, when zzso between the zzso and plasma zzso is incompatible with zzso
