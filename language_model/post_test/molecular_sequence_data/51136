In order to identify comparative aspects of the interaction of zzso with its target zzso zzso zzso studies of complex formation between zzso and defined segments of zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso an integral membrane protein of cardiac zzso zzso believed to regulate the calcium pumping zzso are shown to contribute to interaction with zzso Using wheat germ zzso specifically modified with a zzso to provide the spectral means for spatial zzso these zzso of zzso were correlated with binding in the vicinity of the probe attached to zzso in the zzso domain of zzso This interaction, relevant to the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso that zzso its zzso influence on the calcium zzso provides a useful model system for comparative study of the properties of zzso zzso We contrast here a zzso segment in the zzso region of zzso zzso by zzso study of the zzso between the two zzso These observations are discussed in the context of other zzso zzso
