zzso DNA codes for a 181 zzso long zzso whose zzso is strongly activated in zzso zzso after their injection into a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be transcribed in zzso using an extract of zzso zzso zzso and total zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso as a probe indicates that zzso DNA is abundant in the zzso zzso (at least zzso copies per zzso zzso DNA is present in zzso repeated zzso units of zzso zzso The complete DNA sequence of one of these zzso zzso units is reported zzso The zzso zzso transcript has been mapped within the zzso zzso unit using zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso zzso unit or a zzso containing only the zzso coding portion of the zzso zzso unit both produce zzso zzso zzso This shows that the zzso promoter lies within the coding region of the zzso The zzso zzso sequence has two elements which fit the zzso zzso III promoter consensus zzso and shows zzso with dispersed zzso zzso III zzso units in zzso
