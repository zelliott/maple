In order to evaluate the in zzso zzso capabilities of zzso in an underground reactor facility housing two zzso columns filled with zzso soil, we examined the distribution and zzso of gene transcripts zzso zzso capable of catalyzing the zzso of the zzso aromatic ring during transformation of the main zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso bacteria in the originally zzso reactor columns was achieved by injecting nitrate and oxygen in the form of zzso Two zzso primer pairs were used for reverse zzso zzso zzso of partial zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso directly extracted from different groundwater and zzso zzso zzso retrieved from the zzso sections of the reactor zzso which were operated in zzso mode, were positive for the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso products were detected in a larger part of each reactor column, up to a zone zzso m above the zzso zzso analyses of these zzso zzso sequences clearly separated them into two main zzso one of which was closely affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso Analysis of sequences obtained from zzso products amplified with zzso zzso zzso revealed that their closest relative was the zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mars, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with sequence similarities between zzso and zzso
