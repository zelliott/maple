A pooled DNA probe from zzso artificial zzso clones zzso containing the human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene cluster was used in zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments assigning the genes to pig zzso zzso In addition, zzso derived from the coding regions in the human gene cluster were used in long range mapping experiments to show that the overall structures of the human and zzso zzso gene clusters are zzso Both the linear order and the close physical distance of five apparently unrelated genes have been maintained throughout 90 million years of divergent evolution between human and zzso The extremely dense zzso of the genes in the zzso gene cluster suggests that this gene organization has biological zzso The conservation of the gene cluster between human and pig supports this zzso
