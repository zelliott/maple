The existence of zzso zzso small molecular weight proteins from zzso zzso has been known for 2 decades, and their impact on cellular research has been substantial and zzso zzso have been the molecular scaffold used in the design of zzso for the prevention of zzso and zzso Their sequencing has provided insights into the evolution of proteins over zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and fusion proteins has allowed investigations into molecular mechanisms at work in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso proteins have shown zzso molecules in species ranging from slime mold to zzso zzso signaling events have been zzso through the use of zzso zzso including events related to programmed cell death, zzso cell proliferation and viral zzso zzso sequences zzso or zzso have been placed in zzso and zzso and been found to target zzso zzso and zzso tumors in two mouse zzso The purpose of this review is to highlight the members of this zzso family discovered since 1998 as well as the increased understanding of their usefulness in zzso and technical zzso
