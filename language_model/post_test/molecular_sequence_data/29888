zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to contain three major protein zzso Two proteins zzso and 25 zzso were released from the zzso by zzso zzso or chemical zzso A smaller protein (20 zzso not zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso with the zzso by conventional and high performance zzso exchange zzso by ethanol zzso and by affinity zzso on columns of zzso zzso to zzso zzso but could be separated from the zzso by gel zzso zzso in zzso zzso The three proteins produced different fragmentation patterns on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso after zzso with zzso zzso and each had unique two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the core proteins zzso In addition, the zzso containing these proteins differed in molecular size, suggesting different levels of zzso of the two core zzso zzso of the core proteins was suggested by similar zzso acid zzso similarities in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, seems to occur in two different, but zzso forms whose core proteins may represent members of a zzso zzso
