zzso zzso are essential regulators of plant zzso zzso how zzso control plant height and leaf angle would facilitate development of new plant type varieties by zzso A number of zzso involved in zzso zzso have been isolated but many of them lack detailed genetic zzso Here, we report the isolation and characterization of a severe dwarf zzso zzso segment deleted dwarf 1 zzso which was deficient in zzso zzso in zzso We isolated the zzso by screening a tissue zzso population, cloned the gene by zzso and confirmed its function by complementary and zzso experiments, combined with zzso and chemical zzso We showed that the severe dwarf zzso was caused by a complete deletion of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which was further confirmed in two independent zzso zzso lines in different genetic backgrounds and by zzso zzso Our chemical analysis suggested that zzso might catalyze zzso zzso step in zzso zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso gene plays a more important role than previously zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso varying degrees of zzso and leaf angle, thus providing useful information for molecular breeding in grain crop zzso
