zzso is an zzso zzso zzso slowly progressive limb zzso muscular dystrophy, with age-related zzso cardiac zzso disturbances and the absence of early zzso The disease has been linked to zzso zzso Within this locus another muscular dystrophy, the zzso dominant form of zzso muscular zzso zzso has recently been mapped and the corresponding gene zzso zzso is characterized by early zzso of elbows and Achilles zzso and a zzso distribution of weakness combined with a zzso with zzso zzso The disease gene of zzso is zzso which encodes zzso zzso two proteins of the nuclear zzso In order to identify whether or not zzso and zzso are zzso disorders, we carried out a search for zzso in the zzso gene in patients with zzso For this, zzso screening was carried out for the 12 zzso of zzso on DNA samples of individuals from three zzso families that were linked to zzso zzso zzso were identified in all three zzso families: a zzso zzso a deletion of a zzso and a zzso donor site zzso zzso The three zzso were identified in all affected members of the corresponding families and were absent in 100 unrelated control zzso The present identification of zzso in the zzso gene in zzso demonstrates that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso Further analysis of zzso relationship will help to clarify the zzso of the zzso observed in these two muscular zzso
