Type II zzso zzso zzso zzso act on both soluble zzso zzso and zzso zzso In many cases, these zzso occur as zzso proteins in which the zzso domain is linked to zzso or additional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exists as an isolated zzso domain which is zzso into the saliva of this zzso zzso It shows selectivity for soluble and zzso zzso having a zzso substitution pattern while only poorly zzso zzso containing a D3 zzso With soluble zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso were observed, suggesting the presence of zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also zzso up to zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were again zzso demonstrating that the zzso sites recognize zzso zzso zzso was positively zzso and analysis by the Hill equation suggests that at least three to four zzso sites are zzso In a zzso system, zzso of zzso followed a surface dilution kinetic model, and as expected, zzso was found to be strongly zzso If zzso zzso of type II zzso by zzso and zzso is a widespread feature of the group, it may represent a novel regulatory mechanism for these important zzso
