The zzso locus regulates pigmentation of the rice zzso layer, and selection for the zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred during zzso of the zzso White zzso is now ubiquitous among cultivated varieties throughout rice growing regions of the zzso We identified a new zzso that arose by natural zzso within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso restored the reading frame of the zzso and reverted the zzso layer pigmentation to red zzso By sequencing the zzso locus in plants derived from red seeds, and linkage analysis in a segregating population, we were able to demonstrate that zzso within zzso resulted in the new, dominant, zzso zzso zzso
