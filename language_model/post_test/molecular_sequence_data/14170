The hybrid nature of zzso zzso strains has been known for 25 years; however, zzso hybrids have only recently been described in cider and wine zzso In this study, we characterized the hybrid zzso and the zzso of the zzso industrial zzso strain and of 24 zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso strains used for wine making in France zzso Germany, Hungary, and the United zzso An zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso profile of the zzso zzso revealed a typical zzso zzso zzso of hybrids DNA content per cell by flow zzso revealed multiple zzso levels zzso zzso or zzso and restriction zzso length zzso analysis of 22 genes indicated variable amounts of zzso zzso genetic content in three representative zzso We developed zzso markers for zzso zzso and used them to analyze the diversity of a population isolated from zzso in zzso zzso This analysis revealed new insights into the diversity of this zzso We then analyzed the diversity of the wine hybrids for 12 zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso and found that these strains are the products of multiple zzso events between several zzso zzso wine zzso zzso and various zzso zzso zzso The zzso lineage appeared zzso since it harbors strains found over a wide geographic area, and the zzso divergence measured with a zzso genetic distance indicates an ancient zzso These findings reflect the specific adaptations made by zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrids to winery environments in cool zzso
