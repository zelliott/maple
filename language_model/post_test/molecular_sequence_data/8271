zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso were generated by zzso using both arbitrary and repetitive zzso ERIC and zzso zzso The identification of the strains was achieved also by zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso has significant zzso it is not only simpler and faster, but it is also much more zzso because it deals with the full bacterial zzso and not only with parts of it as is the case with zzso In addition, both kinds of zzso zzso zzso arbitrary or repetitive zzso generated highly specific and zzso patterns when parallel reactions with total bacterial DNA, extracted from independent liquid cultures were zzso The latter shows that zzso and zzso are convenient for controlling the production and application of zzso zzso
