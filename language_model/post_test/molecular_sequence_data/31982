A zzso shotgun zzso approach was used to characterize pomegranate zzso zzso by zzso zzso tandem mass zzso To identify both zzso and zzso zzso we applied two distinct sample preparation zzso zzso a classical one widely applied in literature and a second one able to reduce the dynamic range of protein concentration of the sample, based on zzso zzso zzso library zzso However, the proteins identified with the latter protocol were only a small zzso Because pomegranate is a zzso plant species, zzso information of its zzso sequence are zzso only a few protein sequences are included in the most widely known protein sequence zzso To improve both the number of identified proteins and data zzso identification was performed zzso the results obtained with three distinct plant protein databases, since the majority of proteins could only be attributed by zzso with other plant zzso Nevertheless, many proteins had assigned only one unique zzso because of the zzso distance of pomegranate from the main model zzso After manual revision of the identified proteins to eliminate the redundant or ambiguous zzso a list of zzso proteins was zzso only six of which belonging to pomegranate zzso To the author's best knowledge, this is the first work aimed at the zzso characterization of zzso zzso
