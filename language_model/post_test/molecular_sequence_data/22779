zzso is a progressive disease that zzso and scars the zzso In zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso including zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso B, are zzso and those of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The present study explored the possible involvement in zzso of zzso factor 6 zzso a zzso factor previously described to be essential for the integrity of the zzso zzso The transcript and proteins level of zzso and its action in regulating the genes affected in zzso were examined in this zzso 

zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, zzso and in zzso zzso were used to investigate the expression of zzso zzso and protein in normal and zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the promoter activity of zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso genes was studied after transient zzso of zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso cells using zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed to confirm the interactions between zzso and promoters of the genes affected in zzso 

A global increased expression of the zzso factor zzso in terms of zzso and proteins was observed in total cornea and/or the zzso in a substantial number of the zzso zzso The promoter activity of the human zzso gene was suppressed by expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso confirmed a physical interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso factor zzso zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso cells and may thereby be involved in zzso
