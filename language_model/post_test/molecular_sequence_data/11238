A study of the expression of a bean zzso zzso zzso zzso gene fusion in transgenic tobacco has shown that the zzso promoter has a modular zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in the vascular system involves positive and negative regulatory zzso zzso Among these elements is an zzso motif implicated in zzso expression and a suppressing zzso element for zzso zzso Using zzso complementary zzso bearing the zzso zzso a zzso clone zzso a zzso protein has been isolated from a tobacco zzso zzso expression zzso This factor, named zzso binding factor zzso showed binding specificity to the zzso zzso The specificity of zzso for the zzso region was also shown using a gel zzso zzso with an zzso zzso protein zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from zzso contains a long repeat of zzso zzso as found in well characterized zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso shared sequence similarity to zzso zzso acid motifs found in zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis indicated the presence of a small gene family of sequences related to zzso within the tobacco nuclear zzso Analysis of tobacco zzso using the zzso zzso as probe showed that while zzso zzso was present in all zzso zzso the highest transcript zzso occurred in stem zzso The functional characteristics of the zzso sequence were examined in transgenic zzso A zzso of the zzso zzso in front of a minimal zzso promoter from cauliflower mosaic virus zzso to zzso zzso specific expression in zzso
