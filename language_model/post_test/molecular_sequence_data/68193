zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso four zzso from the zzso of several proteins including zzso zzso is required for the transforming activity of zzso and many efforts are zzso to develop zzso of zzso We have used nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to determine the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso which competes for the modification of zzso in an in zzso zzso Analysis of transferred nuclear zzso effects reveals that the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso is directly involved in binding to the zzso and adopts a type I zzso zzso in the bound zzso The present structural information should aid in the design of more effective zzso of the zzso and in understanding the nature of the zzso binding zzso
