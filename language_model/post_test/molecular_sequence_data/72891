The zzso zzso is unable to generate zzso channel activity in zzso zzso or in zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed at high levels acts as a specific zzso of the activity of zzso and zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso At lower levels, zzso associates with zzso and zzso to form hybrid zzso channels, which have new zzso properties and more particularly modified properties of the zzso process as compared with zzso of zzso or zzso zzso The same effects have been seen by zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso zzso In these cells, zzso expressed alone remains in zzso zzso but it can reach the plasma membrane when it associates with zzso and it then also forms new types of zzso 2 zzso Present results indicate that zzso when expressed at low zzso acts as a modifier of zzso and zzso activity, while when expressed at high zzso in zzso it completely zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso channel zzso The zzso segment of zzso is zzso and contains the structural elements that modify zzso of zzso zzso
