We have characterized the zzso zzso zzso present in mouse liver by zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso and by the isolation of zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso clones indicates that the liver zzso is actually a family of zzso Two of these proteins are predicted to be zzso as precursors of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with common signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a portion of their zzso zzso are also zzso but these proteins differ markedly in the terminal region of this zzso A third zzso protein is predicted to be a truncated form and may be zzso These multiple zzso zzso appear to be zzso by at least two zzso with the sequence variation for the two full-length proteins likely due to alternative zzso zzso These results suggest that the varied actions of zzso may involve multiple receptors that are part of distinct signal zzso zzso
