zzso zzso of proteins typically occurs zzso via an zzso bond to the penultimate zzso zzso within the zzso motif zzso in a reaction zzso by zzso A second, less common zzso reaction occurs internally at zzso zzso acid zzso of proteins such as zzso In this case, zzso occurs within a portion of the zzso which is subsequently removed by zzso zzso The identity of the zzso catalyzing internal zzso is zzso Considering this information, the zzso virus zzso zzso inclusion protein zzso presents a zzso Although this zzso protein is clearly zzso the protein does not have the zzso zzso motif nor is it subject to zzso zzso In the experiments reported here, we zzso zzso ATI with zzso zzso and determined that the zzso zzso was present in the zzso half of the zzso We also subjected a zzso digest of zzso ATI to liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso which indicated that ATI is randomly zzso at six different zzso or zzso Analysis of the modification sites reveals no obvious zzso zzso motifs or zzso zzso zzso of these zzso alone or in combination does not abrogate zzso of the zzso suggesting zzso of alternative modification zzso This information implies that the zzso ATI protein is zzso in a zzso zzso Because viral zzso typically zzso the host cell modification apparatus, this result suggests there may be an alternative type of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
