The specific zzso by which some plant viruses are transmitted through seed, while others are zzso is not zzso Using infectious barley stripe mosaic virus zzso zzso transcribed in zzso from full-length zzso zzso the viral genetic zzso of seed transmission have been zzso Both zzso and zzso viruses were constructed from zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso (not seed zzso The markedly different seed zzso of these two strains facilitated the identification of zzso as the location of the primary zzso of seed transmission zzso zzso also played a role in seed transmission, but to a lesser extent than zzso Major genetic zzso of seed transmission on zzso included the zzso untranslated leader, a zzso repeat in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Important zzso of symptom zzso mapped to the zzso leader and the zzso gene as zzso Some zzso combinations of the zzso leader and the zzso gene resulted in dramatic changes in zzso and seed transmission, depending on the parental source of zzso alpha and zzso These results suggest that a complex interaction of the zzso leader, the zzso zzso and zzso alpha and beta are involved in zzso zzso Considering the putative regulatory role of the gamma gene zzso and Jackson 1994, Plant Cell zzso and the trans effects that zzso in the zzso gene have on zzso gene expression zzso et zzso 1990, zzso zzso zzso zzso effects attributed to elements of zzso could result from zzso or trans interactions involving the zzso leader, the zzso zzso and zzso alpha and zzso Clearly, virus replication and movement play pivotal roles in the seed transmission of zzso
