zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of which form zzso zzso capable of zzso with and stabilizing zzso zzso and regulating zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses a single essential zzso zzso which can be zzso on its zzso zzso zzso to increase its affinity for zzso and enhance its ability to regulate zzso zzso We have designed and generated a number of novel zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso to explore how stability of the zzso overlap region affects the regulatory function of this zzso By zzso the stability of each zzso its propensity to form stable zzso its ability to associate with zzso and to regulate myosin, we have shown that the stability of the zzso of the zzso zzso is crucial for zzso zzso In addition we have identified a novel zzso zzso with increased zzso stability, zzso of which are capable of forming zzso zzso significantly longer than the zzso zzso This protein had a reduced affinity for zzso with respect to zzso and was unable to regulate zzso zzso The results of the present paper are consistent with zzso providing a mechanism for modulating the formation and stability of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso The data also provide evidence for a mechanism in which zzso zzso form zzso zzso on the zzso filament, consistent with a zzso model for zzso binding to zzso
