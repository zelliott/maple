DNA sequence analysis revealed that the putative zzso DNA zzso gene of zzso coli is zzso identical to the zzso zzso strain zzso gene zzso DNA zzso zzso which zzso zzso in the recognition zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso and the zzso was zzso and zzso zzso and restriction analysis showed that the DNA zzso zzso the first zzso in the sequence zzso This DNA zzso was found to be regulated during the cell cycle, and the DNA zzso zzso was designated zzso (for zzso zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso zzso is required for viability in zzso coli, as a strain lacking a functional zzso copy of zzso can be isolated only in the presence of an additional copy of zzso supplied in zzso The cells of such a knockout strain stopped growing when expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene was shut zzso zzso of zzso slowed bacterial growth, and the zzso sites became fully zzso throughout the cell zzso a high proportion of cells with an anomalous size distribution and DNA content was found in this zzso Thus, the zzso control of this zzso may contribute to accurate cell cycle control of cell division and cellular zzso zzso of zzso are present in other bacteria belonging to the gamma subdivision of the class zzso suggesting that zzso at zzso sites may have similar functions in other members of this zzso
