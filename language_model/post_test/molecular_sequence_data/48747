zzso zzso have emerged as a major new class of zzso One important zzso factor of zzso is zzso zzso and therefore, it is important that zzso methods are able to thoroughly characterize all possible oxidized zzso Here, we present a fast and sensitive method to perform online zzso zzso site assignment using zzso zzso factor zzso as a zzso The method is based on zzso zzso using the zzso fragmentation mode of the zzso zzso mass zzso zzso that provide information on the intact mass of the protein as well as on zzso zzso that allow zzso site assignment of zzso zzso in zzso zzso as low as zzso of total peak area in a zzso time scale were zzso Using this method, we performed zzso zzso site assignment in zzso zzso and in zzso which was stored at intended conditions, zzso We show that the relative abundance of zzso species observed in zzso stored under intended conditions differs zzso from the oxidized species observed after zzso zzso Additionally, we report an oxidized zzso zzso that has not been previously described in the zzso
