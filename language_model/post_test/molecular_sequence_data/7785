Exposure of zzso zzso cells to various stresses including zzso zzso hydrogen zzso 50 zzso zzso 10 zzso of zzso zzso at 255 zzso and high zzso zzso M zzso or zzso M zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A part of the zzso gene of zzso zzso was amplified by zzso with zzso zzso designed from zzso acid sequences zzso in several species of zzso The zzso gene including its zzso sequence of zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso DNA library of zzso zzso which was constructed on the zzso zzso using the zzso DNA as a radioactive zzso A zzso zzso zzso fragment, which zzso with the zzso probe, was zzso into zzso and zzso The zzso contains one long open reading frame without any zzso The zzso deduced from the zzso sequence consists of 512 zzso acid zzso and is zzso to several other zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso peptides obtained from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso coincided with the zzso acid sequence predicted from the DNA zzso zzso of this gene starts at 370 bases upstream of the initiation zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses of the zzso zzso revealed that the stresses which induce the zzso activity also induce the zzso of the zzso zzso The induction of the zzso zzso by hydrogen zzso is not inhibited by zzso or zzso
