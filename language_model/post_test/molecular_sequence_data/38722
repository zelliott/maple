We showed recently that the zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso zzso gene symbol, zzso promotes zzso iron zzso by catalyzing the maturation of zzso proteins and zzso the zzso iron zzso that results from loss of zzso zzso a zzso protein required for zzso iron zzso This suggests that the human zzso zzso zzso gene symbol zzso may be one of the zzso predicted to influence the clinical manifestations of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso neurodegenerative disease caused by lack of human zzso To begin to test this hypothesis, we have characterized zzso at the functional and zzso zzso We show that zzso can complement a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso are functional zzso The zzso gene spans 57 zzso and consists of 19 zzso that correlate with the functional zzso of zzso zzso extension analysis has identified a major transcript of the zzso gene expressed zzso and predominantly in zzso with high oxygen consumption, while sequence analysis of approximately 2 zzso of zzso DNA has revealed putative zzso zzso and zzso elements that may regulate zzso expression in these zzso Using a new zzso zzso repeat in zzso 4, zzso has been genetically mapped within a zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso on zzso This work provides the basis for molecular analysis of zzso in zzso and possibly other neurodegenerative zzso
