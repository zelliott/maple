zzso muscle zzso sudden, zzso onset of muscle necrosis that is either progressive, as in zzso muscular dystrophy, or successfully arrested and followed by zzso as in most muscles of zzso zzso The mechanisms regulating zzso in zzso muscle are unknown, although the possibility that there is renewed expression of genes regulating embryonic muscle cell proliferation and differentiation may provide testable zzso Here, we examine the possibility that zzso and zzso zzso muscles exhibit renewed or increased expression of zzso zzso to receptors on muscle has been shown previously to be associated with zzso cell proliferation and delay of muscle zzso We find that zzso are present in zzso zzso mice in muscles that undergo brief, zzso necrosis zzso zzso or progressive necrosis zzso as well as in zzso control mouse zzso zzso indicate that the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and control muscles are zzso zzso zzso fibers and control fibers possess some cell surface labeling of fibers treated with zzso and viewed by indirect zzso zzso fibers in zzso muscle show zzso labeling for zzso and labeling of zzso regions at the muscle cell zzso Adult zzso muscle displays higher zzso of zzso in both zzso muscle zzso and progressively zzso muscle zzso than found in zzso zzso labeling of zzso zzso muscle is observed primarily in zzso surrounding central zzso or surrounding zzso located at the surface of zzso zzso No labeling of zzso regions of control muscle or zzso fibers was zzso zzso zzso from adult zzso zzso muscles contained no zzso indicating that zzso structures are not tightly associated with zzso or within zzso zzso zzso show zzso distributed zzso on the cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso with 10 zzso of zzso causes zzso zzso and concentration in zzso at zzso zzso Thus, zzso stimulation of zzso causes a zzso of zzso to resemble zzso zzso observed during muscle zzso These findings zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso of zzso zzso
