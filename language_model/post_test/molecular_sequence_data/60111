zzso zzso has been used successfully as a DNA carrier in zzso gene transfer, enhancement of zzso having been proposed to be in part through efficient nuclear targeting stemming from the resemblance of zzso to the nuclear zzso sequence zzso from zzso virus zzso large tumor zzso zzso In this study we test whether zzso carrying zzso attached peptides zzso the zzso zzso (the zzso zzso can enhance zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso itself or a zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso of a zzso reporter zzso The basis of this was shown to be the ability of the zzso DNA complex to be recognized with high affinity by the zzso zzso zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso was used to determine the nuclear import zzso of zzso labeled zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso indicating that zzso and not zzso complexes accumulated rapidly in the zzso We conclude that zzso itself does not function as an zzso and that the addition of zzso zzso zzso interaction with the cellular nuclear import machinery can increase zzso by enhancing the nuclear targeting of zzso zzso
