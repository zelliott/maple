DNA sequences from the long terminal repeat of the mouse zzso tumor virus zzso position zzso both in zzso and in zzso Here, were present zzso zzso experiments showing that zzso sequences from zzso to zzso accommodate two zzso zzso in positions compatible with the in zzso zzso This positioning is not influenced by the length of the DNA zzso and occurs in linear as well as in closed circular DNA zzso zzso DNA sequences show an intrinsic zzso that closely resembles its wrapping around the zzso zzso We propose that zzso is responsible for the observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso positioning seems also to be determined by the DNA zzso These data, along with the results from zzso experiments with zzso zzso support a modular model of zzso phasing on zzso where the actual positioning of the zzso zzso results from the additive effect of multiple features of the DNA zzso
