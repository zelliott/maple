zzso is a completely soluble zzso zzso acid zzso protein characterized by the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose zzso expansion causes the progressively neurodegenerative zzso disease zzso Biological evidence indicates that zzso zzso is beneficial to cells zzso to brain zzso and that loss of its zzso function may contribute to zzso The exact protein zzso involved in its zzso function are zzso zzso analyses of zzso primary zzso have so far been limited to a few species, but its thorough assessment may help to clarify the functions emerging during zzso We made an extensive comparative analysis of the available zzso protein zzso from different organisms along the zzso zzso tree and defined the presence of 3 different conservative blocks corresponding to human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso zzso the regulatory A zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso repeats are well zzso We also describe the cloning and sequencing of sea zzso zzso zzso the oldest zzso zzso so far zzso Multiple alignment shows the first appearance of a primitive zzso in sea urchin, which predates an ancestral zzso sequence in a zzso environment and defines the zzso characteristic as being typical of the zzso zzso The fact that zzso have zzso positions in zzso and the zzso size increases during evolution suggests that the protein has a possibly zzso zzso Finally, we report an evident relaxing constraint of the zzso block in zzso and zzso that zzso with the absence of zzso and which may indicate that the zzso portion of zzso has evolved different functions in zzso and zzso
