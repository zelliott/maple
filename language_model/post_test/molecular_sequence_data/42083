zzso deletions and loss of zzso zzso at certain restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso on the short arm of zzso 3 occur in most zzso clear cell zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso Studies of other zzso of zzso cell zzso are sparse and zzso We investigated the zzso at three of the most commonly deleted zzso on the short arm of zzso 3 in 50 zzso representing the zzso spectrum of zzso cortical zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso restriction zzso length zzso zzso and Southern zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso analysis accurately identified the zzso on the short arm of zzso 3 in the different zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was observed at zzso locus zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, 1 of 6 zzso zzso cell zzso showed zzso at zzso locus zzso zzso and one of seven zzso demonstrated zzso at zzso zzso We also report that 1 of 3 collecting duct zzso showed zzso at zzso zzso In this series there was no correlation between zzso zzso grade, tumor stage, and DNA zzso We conclude that zzso zzso on zzso is not restricted to the clear cell type of zzso zzso the most common zzso were zzso to zzso locus at the zzso region, and zzso no statistical correlation between the zzso at zzso and zzso grade, DNA zzso or clinical stage was found in this zzso
