zzso cells of normal first zzso human zzso share with zzso tumor cells the ability for significant cellular proliferation and invasion of basement zzso Because tumor cell zzso in zzso and invasion of basement zzso in zzso have recently been shown to require the expression of zzso beta zzso Man alpha zzso Man beta zzso complex type zzso zzso in tumor cell surface zzso we decided to determine if such structures were also necessary for invasion by zzso zzso We report here that invasive first zzso zzso express zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso on their zzso Moreover, basement membrane invasion by zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso the cells with zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso II which blocks beta zzso branching of zzso zzso The first zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso attached more avidly to the zzso basement membrane and to an zzso zzso zzso preparation compared to control zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment did not inhibit zzso of zzso or zzso zzso activities by zzso zzso These results suggest that expression of beta zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells may be functionally important for the zzso and zzso processes by reducing cell zzso to zzso and thereby zzso zzso cell zzso
