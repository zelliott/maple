zzso 10 zzso is a potent zzso zzso and inhibitor of inflammatory zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso role of zzso in pregnancy, the response of genetically zzso mice to zzso zzso zzso abortion was zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso and control zzso mice were administered zzso zzso on Day zzso of zzso zzso zzso predisposed to fetal loss accompanied by growth restriction in remaining viable zzso with an approximately zzso reduction in the threshold dose for zzso zzso After zzso administration, inflammatory zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso were markedly increased in serum, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso mice compared with zzso mice, with elevated local synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similarly elevated in serum and zzso zzso whereas zzso gamma zzso and soluble zzso content were unchanged in the absence of zzso zzso zzso rescued the increased zzso to zzso fetal loss in zzso mice but did not improve outcomes in zzso zzso zzso zzso also influenced the responsiveness of mice to a zzso zzso zzso Fetal loss in zzso mice was partly alleviated by moderate or high doses of zzso whereas zzso mice were zzso to high-dose zzso consistent with zzso by zzso status of zzso zzso after zzso zzso These data show that zzso zzso resistance to inflammatory stimuli by zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acting to protect against zzso pathology in the zzso zzso
