zzso zzso zzso can induce targeted zzso sequence correction in zzso genes in zzso and in zzso Our model for investigating the reasons for the low correction rates achieved by this method is the correction of a point zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso in the cell line zzso Using zzso zzso zzso the correction rates of this zzso zzso were low but always zzso One reason for low exchange rates may be fast zzso degradation of the zzso Therefore we compared the exchange rates of different 3' and zzso zzso zzso with their degradation zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso showed higher correction rates than those with a zzso zzso clamp and zzso zzso induced higher correction rates than zzso at the 3' zzso zzso on the stability of the most effective zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated rapid zzso and the occurrence of shortened zzso in the presence of zzso and nuclear zzso The zzso zzso were more stable, but their correction rates were zzso We suggest that there is no direct correlation between the biological stability of the full-length zzso and the exchange rates zzso
