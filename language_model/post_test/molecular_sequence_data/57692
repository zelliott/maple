zzso of the zzso gene (also known as zzso occurs in up to zzso of breast zzso and has been associated with poor zzso 

The purpose of this study was to define the relationship between zzso amplification and breast cancer progression in order to better understand the biological significance of zzso zzso 

We identified invasive tumors with zzso zzso zzso amplification by using Southern zzso analysis to examine frozen tissue from 135 breast zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso analysis to examine archival zzso tissue from an additional 19 invasive zzso These 19 tumors were selected on the basis of zzso identifiable in zzso and invasive components within the primary tumor and associated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in these areas was then assessed by quantitative zzso zzso 

We detected gross zzso amplification in 10 of the tumors zzso of the 135 frozen tissue specimens and two of the 19 archival zzso We selected five of these 10 invasive tumors for further regional zzso In all four cases where an in zzso component was present, amplification of zzso was present in both the in zzso and the invasive zzso However, zzso amplification was present in the corresponding zzso zzso in only two of the four cases where this could be zzso 

These results suggest that zzso amplification can occur at an early stage in tumor progression and that amplification does not always persist in the zzso zzso
