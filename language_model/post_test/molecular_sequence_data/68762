zzso analysis of a 4 zzso zzso from the right arm of zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with Northern zzso experiments revealed the presence of two zzso designated zzso and zzso The first gene encodes a 32 zzso protein showing significant sequence similarity with members of the zzso zzso Its zzso sequence is virtually identical to a sequence published previously as the zzso gene zzso and zzso Gene 114 (1992), zzso which, however, appears to start at an internal zzso zzso The zzso sequence also zzso the zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 (1992), zzso proposed to zzso the zzso zzso zzso The remainder of this zzso gene zzso with the zzso of the zzso zzso However, the zzso sequence lacks a portion of 276 zzso that in our zzso is part of the zzso region separating zzso and zzso From these results we conclude that the proposed zzso gene is the result of a cloning zzso and that the zzso protein is instead zzso by the zzso zzso
