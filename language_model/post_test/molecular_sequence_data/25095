The expression of zzso zzso zzso genes is induced by zzso and zzso factors in peanut cell zzso However, little is known about the regulation of the zzso gene expression in peanut zzso The expression of zzso genes was investigated in peanut plants with a peanut zzso zzso zzso which encodes two zzso that show about a zzso zzso acid sequence identity to peanut zzso and zzso zzso A low level of zzso zzso was detected in the roots of peanut plants grown zzso in zzso In mature peanut plants that were grown in the field, however, zzso zzso were present at relatively high levels in both the roots and zzso but at below the detection limit in zzso zzso zzso were abundant in young pods and decreased dramatically in mature zzso The zzso zzso expression was induced by zzso extract and zzso in leaves and roots, and also by wounding in zzso Stress hormones, such as zzso zzso acid, and salicylic acid, induced zzso zzso zzso in zzso These results indicate that the zzso gene expression is induced by zzso and zzso stresses through the stress hormones in peanut zzso The induction of the zzso gene expression by zzso and zzso stresses could provide peanut plants with protection from microbial infections through zzso zzso The zzso gene expression in developing pods has significant implications in terms of the role of zzso as a zzso for human zzso
