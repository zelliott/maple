zzso zzso of the zzso zzso express the zzso machinery to zzso zzso zzso via both de zzso and salvage zzso To evaluate the relative contributions of zzso zzso and salvage to zzso zzso in both life cycle stages of zzso zzso individual zzso lines deficient in either zzso zzso zzso zzso the first zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a salvage zzso or both zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a growth requirement for medium supplementation with one of a plethora of zzso zzso or zzso although only zzso or zzso could circumvent the zzso zzso of the zzso double zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso but could not salvage zzso or any zzso zzso The capability of the zzso zzso to zzso mice was somewhat diminished but still zzso indicating active zzso salvage by the zzso form of the zzso but the zzso zzso was completely attenuated with no persistent zzso detected after a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso clone with either zzso or zzso restored zzso These data establish that an intact zzso zzso zzso is essential for the growth of the zzso form of zzso zzso in culture, that all zzso and zzso zzso salvage in the zzso is zzso by zzso and that both the zzso and salvage pathways contribute to a robust infection of the zzso host by the zzso These findings impact potential therapeutic design and vaccine strategies for visceral zzso
