zzso zzso channels activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely distributed in the nervous zzso Their molecular architecture is fundamentally distinct from that of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso We have measured single-channel zzso spontaneous zzso and zzso of rat zzso zzso in which polar and charged zzso of the second zzso domain zzso were systematically zzso by zzso The results suggest that zzso and zzso lie respectively in external and internal zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso were particularly likely to cause spontaneously active zzso At zzso zzso and zzso the introduction of positive charge zzso zzso or zzso or zzso followed by treatment with zzso zzso greatly enhanced outward zzso suggesting that zzso of these three zzso are exposed in the zzso zzso of the open zzso These functional findings are interpreted in the context of the recently reported zzso A crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso in the closed zzso They imply that the gate is formed by zzso zzso to zzso and that channel opening involves a zzso rotation and separation of the zzso zzso
