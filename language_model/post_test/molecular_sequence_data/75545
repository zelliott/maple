The number of zzso genes in zzso zzso was examined by Southern zzso zzso labeled 23 and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded six radioactive bands each for the 23 and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso gave one band for the zzso zzso and one high-intensity band and six zzso bands for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing one of the zzso gene clusters was cloned into zzso zzso The hybrid zzso zzso was characterized by physical zzso Southern zzso and electron microscopic analysis of the R zzso formed between zzso and the 23 and zzso zzso There were at least six zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso The 16 and zzso zzso genes were estimated to be about zzso and zzso zzso pairs, zzso The genes for the zzso were aligned in the sequence zzso zzso genes were not found in the zzso region or in the context of the zzso zzso The G + C content of the zzso region was calculated to be approximately zzso in contrast to zzso for the zzso as a zzso
