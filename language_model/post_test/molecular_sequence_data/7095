zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and gamma zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that also has zzso effects in zzso To determine whether zzso of zzso can be related to zzso of cell growth with induction of zzso we compared the effects of zzso to those of the highly selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both compounds zzso inhibited zzso activity when added to zzso membrane preparations and reversed zzso zzso zzso gene expression in intact zzso However, whereas zzso zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso irreversible after 24 h of zzso zzso zzso had zzso for cell growth of zzso zzso Less than 3 h after addition, zzso but not zzso zzso cells displayed loss of cells with zzso DNA content, appearance of a zzso DNA zzso and evidence of zzso DNA zzso Six h after treatment, cells appeared to accumulate with zzso DNA zzso These effects correlated with selective zzso but not zzso zzso decrease in total and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, and with increases in the zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso was relatively less potent in zzso of properly activated zzso and zzso when added in zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1000 and 600 zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso alone is not sufficient to account for the actions of zzso and are led to the hypothesis that inappropriate zzso zzso either zzso with or actually mediates cell growth zzso with zzso in T zzso exposed to zzso
