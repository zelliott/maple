To zzso and identify the gene and zzso causing zzso zzso retinal zzso in two zzso Pakistani zzso 

zzso families from Pakistan were zzso to be affected with zzso zzso retinal zzso All affected individuals underwent thorough zzso zzso Blood samples were collected, and zzso DNA was extracted using a zzso out zzso zzso was performed using zzso markers spaced at approximately 10 zzso zzso zzso linkage analysis was performed with the zzso score zzso zzso DNA sequencing of amplified zzso DNA was performed for zzso screening of candidate zzso 

zzso linkage scans yielded a zzso score of zzso at zzso for zzso and zzso at zzso for zzso zzso the disease gene to a zzso zzso zzso zzso region flanked by zzso and zzso for family zzso and family zzso which contains zzso hydrocarbon zzso interacting zzso 1 zzso a gene previously implicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso sequence change in all affected individuals of family zzso and a zzso zzso zzso change in all affected members of family zzso 

The results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso zzso retinal zzso in these zzso Pakistani zzso
