A zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene has been cloned by zzso in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso predicts a gene product of zzso Da which shares significant zzso acid sequence identity with other known bacterial zzso zzso Analysis of the DNA sequence upstream and downstream of zzso identified two further, incomplete open reading zzso one of which shows predicted zzso acid sequence similarity to a second bacterial zzso acid synthesis zzso zzso zzso
