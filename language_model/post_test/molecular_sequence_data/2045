The zzso gene is growth regulated in a number of cell types from different animal zzso We have identified in the promoter region of the human zzso gene the sequences responsible for its growth regulation by zzso A number of deletion zzso and synthetic zzso all driving the zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed for this zzso zzso elements can be localized in the last 42 zzso immediately upstream from the zzso zzso
