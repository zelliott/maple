The zzso N zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in solution by classical methods and fully zzso This compound, prepared in order to obtain a deeper insight into the mode of binding at the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been tested for its ability to induce zzso zzso zzso from rabbit zzso zzso and found to be a complete zzso These results confirm the hypothesis that a zzso on the N zzso group of the zzso forms a hydrogen bond with an zzso in the binding zzso
