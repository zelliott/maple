The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a small essential protein shown to interact genetically and physically with the zzso protein zzso To investigate the specific functions of the zzso gene product, conditional zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso were found to impair the ability of cells to undergo both the zzso and zzso transitions of the cell cycle, as well as the ability to zzso zzso were not zzso however, in their ability to activate zzso zzso as zzso in zzso on the zzso zzso zzso It is zzso therefore, that zzso mediates a more specialized function of the zzso zzso such as its ability to form specific zzso complexes or to zzso properly in cellular zzso
