Members of the zzso III zzso zzso family are zzso zzso zzso specific zzso characterized by a signature motif in their active centers and a zzso 3' zzso in their zzso While zzso which produces small interfering zzso is currently the focus of intense interest, the structurally simpler bacterial zzso III serves as a paradigm for the entire zzso Here, we present the crystal structure of an zzso zzso complex, the first zzso complex observed for the zzso A 7 zzso zzso within the protein zzso induced fit in zzso zzso A pattern of zzso zzso defined by four zzso binding motifs in zzso III and three zzso boxes in zzso is responsible for zzso zzso while zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso are responsible for zzso zzso The structure reveals a wealth of information about the mechanism of zzso zzso that can be zzso to other zzso III family zzso
