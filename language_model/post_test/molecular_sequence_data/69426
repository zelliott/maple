Central features of progressive zzso sclerosis are initial zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso Since zzso 1 may play a key role in this zzso response to injury, the present study sought to explore further zzso 1 actions and regulated expression of its zzso in rat zzso zzso The rat zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by screening a rat kidney zzso library with a human zzso zzso zzso probe, and zzso zzso of this zzso zzso in rat zzso cells was then demonstrated by zzso protection zzso and by Northern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso cross linking studies demonstrated presence of this zzso on cell zzso zzso zzso cells also expressed zzso 1 and zzso by zzso 1 was observed in the same cells, suggesting that this zzso may act in an zzso fashion on zzso cells, and that it may stimulate a positive zzso zzso zzso 1 inhibited zzso cell proliferation and zzso significant overall protein and collagen zzso Furthermore, zzso cell size increased in response to chronic zzso 1 zzso These findings demonstrate that rat zzso cells express key components of the zzso system and raise the intriguing possibility that in the zzso zzso zzso 1 may not only induce zzso zzso zzso but may also participate in the process of zzso zzso in response to zzso
