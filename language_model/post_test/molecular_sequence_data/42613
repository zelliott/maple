zzso binding zzso transport systems represent a common mechanism for zzso and zzso zzso in zzso As a group, these systems are related to one another and to other zzso of both zzso and zzso based on sequence similarity within an zzso zzso and overall structural zzso These zzso probably all use energy derived from zzso to pump zzso across zzso Although there is considerable information about the sequences and identity of the zzso there is little information about how they zzso That is, where do zzso zzso Where do the zzso or zzso interact with one another? How is the energy of zzso binding and/or zzso converted to zzso changes? In order to address these questions we have taken a genetic approach that involves studying zzso forms of a zzso Rather than study zzso that result in complete loss of function, the study of zzso which zzso or alter the normal function of the zzso in a defined manner has provided a limited insight into how the answers to these questions may be zzso
