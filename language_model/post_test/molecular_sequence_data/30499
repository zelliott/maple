A zzso zzso expression system was developed to analyze the zzso relationship, in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The toxin structural gene was first deleted from the zzso zzso zzso into the resulting zzso zzso strain the toxin gene was introduced on a zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso toxin produced and zzso with this expression system was in the same order of magnitude as that produced by zzso zzso zzso I, indicating that although the zzso may be present in more than one copy per cell, overproduction of the toxin was not achieved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso toxin genes in which the zzso for zzso was deleted or altered or in which the zzso region was deleted showed that both the single zzso zzso bond and the zzso region of zzso are essential for the stable zzso zzso and zzso of zzso On the other hand, the B zzso was efficiently zzso in the culture medium in the absence of the zzso zzso The zzso B zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso and was fully functional with respect to zzso zzso Furthermore, the deletion of the zzso zzso region has a drastic effect on zzso zzso zzso however, inclusion of the zzso region was not sufficient for assembly and zzso indicating that other interactions involving zzso acids beyond zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are also zzso
