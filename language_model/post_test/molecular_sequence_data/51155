The upstream region of the rat zzso gene shows significant zzso to the upstream regions of the bovine and human zzso 53 and 60 percent, zzso The start site of zzso was determined by primer extension and zzso zzso protection to be 41 base pairs zzso upstream of the initiating zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed by zzso of upstream sequences into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using primary cultures of rat zzso cells indicate a strong zzso element located within the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was abolished when sequences upstream of zzso were included in expression zzso No significant expression was seen in zzso cells in the absence of zzso nor was there any expression in the presence or absence of zzso in rat skin zzso or in mouse adrenal zzso cells in which zzso is not normally zzso Three possible regulatory elements were found in the zzso upstream zzso a zzso consensus sequence zzso starting at position zzso a zzso consensus sequence zzso starting at position zzso and a consensus sequence for zzso binding zzso starting at position zzso It was concluded that the zzso at zzso is not responsible for increased zzso in the presence of zzso zzso
