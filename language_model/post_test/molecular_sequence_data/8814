The core promoter compositions of zzso zzso genes are highly zzso some contain zzso boxes, some contain zzso zzso zzso and others contain both or neither of these zzso zzso The underlying reason for this zzso remains a mystery, as recent studies have suggested that zzso and zzso core promoters direct zzso initiation by similar mechanisms and respond similarly to a wide variety of upstream zzso To analyze in greater detail the influence of core promoter structure on zzso zzso we compared zzso by zzso and zzso through synthetic core promoters containing a zzso box, an zzso or both zzso and zzso zzso differences were found between the two zzso most notably in the relative strengths of the zzso and zzso core zzso the zzso promoter was much stronger than the zzso promoter when zzso was activated by zzso but the strengths of the two promoters were more comparable when zzso was activated by zzso To define the zzso of zzso responsible for efficient zzso through an zzso several zzso deletion zzso were tested as zzso fusion zzso The results reveal that the zzso zzso zzso which previously were found to interact with zzso zzso zzso stimulate zzso core zzso In contrast, efficient zzso through zzso appears to require additional zzso of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso differ in their abilities to function with specific core zzso suggesting that the core promoter structure found in a given gene may reflect a preference of the regulators of that zzso Furthermore, the core promoter preference of an zzso domain may be related to a specific mechanism of action, which may provide a functional criterion for grouping zzso zzso into distinct zzso
