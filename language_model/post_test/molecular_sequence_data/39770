Many respiratory zzso including zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso express zzso that can cleave zzso zzso acids from zzso As zzso surfaces are heavily zzso zzso have been thought to modify zzso cells by exposing potential bacterial zzso However, in contrast to zzso produced by the influenza virus, a role for bacterial zzso in zzso has not yet been clearly zzso We constructed a zzso of zzso zzso zzso by deleting the zzso zzso locus zzso and tested its zzso and zzso capabilities in a mouse model of zzso Although fully virulent when introduced zzso the zzso zzso was unable to establish respiratory infection by zzso zzso The inability to colonize the respiratory tract correlated with diminished production of zzso as assessed by scanning electron zzso and in zzso zzso The importance of zzso in zzso production was further demonstrated by showing that viral zzso zzso in clinical use blocked zzso zzso zzso production in zzso as zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a key role in the initial stages of pulmonary infection by targeting bacterial zzso and contributing to the formation of zzso zzso bacterial zzso could provide a novel mechanism to prevent bacterial zzso
