The putative zzso gene of a zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso has been identified, cloned and the zzso sequence zzso The zzso location of the zzso zzso gene was determined and an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the putative zzso zzso gene with the sequence of the zzso zzso gene returned an overall identity of approximately zzso A stop zzso 144 zzso upstream and a start zzso 18 zzso downstream of the zzso were identified and comparison with the zzso zzso demonstrated that their positions corresponded to the stop site of the zzso gene and start site of the zzso zzso zzso To confirm the correct start zzso of the putative zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso site for the putative zzso zzso gene was determined from zzso and found to be between the two zzso immediately upstream of the first zzso in the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso protein showed overall identity of approximately zzso with higher identity in the zzso of approaching zzso over 380 zzso zzso Multiple alignment of the zzso zzso zzso acid sequence with other known zzso and animal zzso zzso sequences indicated that conservation is generally maintained but that identity is much lower within the loop structures of the zzso
