The zzso zzso nuclear gene zzso was identified as part of the European effort in sequencing zzso zzso zzso encodes for a zzso and basic protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular mass of 32 zzso The zzso part zzso zzso of the zzso protein exhibits significant sequence similarity to members of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted in the zzso copy of zzso were unable to zzso and displayed a characteristic zzso of zzso with defects in zzso protein synthesis as indicated by a loss of zzso c zzso zzso Additionally, no activities of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be observed under conditions of zzso zzso The zzso zzso could not be restored by transformation of the disruption strain with a zzso copy of zzso indicating that zzso disruption led to zzso or zzso zzso zzso similarities of zzso to other members of the zzso zzso family and the zzso of disrupted cells are consistent with an essential role of zzso is assembly and/or function of the 30s zzso of zzso zzso zzso
