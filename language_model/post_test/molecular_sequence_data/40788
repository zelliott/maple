Since zzso zzso zzso were reported in 1988, they have appeared in hospitals zzso Seven van gene cluster types zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are currently zzso We investigated a clinical strain of zzso zzso zzso that was isolated in 2006 from an zzso with zzso infection in zzso It was resistant to most zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso resistance could be transferred to zzso zzso zzso by zzso The donor and its zzso were negative by zzso for the known van zzso By cloning and primer walk sequencing, we discovered a novel van gene zzso designated zzso The zzso zzso gene was zzso in length and zzso a zzso protein that shared zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the zzso DNA sequence was closest to zzso the organization of the zzso gene cluster was most similar to that of zzso zzso from the zzso cluster was an zzso element, which may play a role in the dissemination of this resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso precursors extracted from the zzso strain zzso treated with zzso or zzso revealed a modified precursor zzso acid zzso indicating that zzso like zzso zzso zzso resistance by the zzso synthesis of precursor ending in zzso
