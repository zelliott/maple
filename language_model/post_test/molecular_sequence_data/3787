In the present study, we have characterized the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its role during zzso zzso We have also demonstrated that a lack of zzso results in a zzso in zzso metabolism and zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that is classically involved in the three-step conversion of zzso acids to their respective zzso zzso but zzso has also been shown to have other zzso The zzso gene was virtually identical in three zzso strains zzso Besides the functional zzso and motifs associated with this zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria totally lacked zzso activity, indicating that this gene encodes the only zzso in zzso zzso These zzso bacteria grew normally in zzso but were zzso in zzso and lung infection models in mice, indicating that zzso activity is necessary for the survival of zzso within the zzso The lack of zzso was not associated with a loss of zzso acid zzso activity, as the zzso zzso strains did not contain activity of any of the known zzso acid zzso zzso Instead, studies of zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso bacteria were impaired for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso lost their ability to zzso or grow with zzso or zzso as sole carbon source and showed reduced zzso and growth on zzso or zzso The bacteria had an zzso reduction in zzso activity and showed virtually no transport of zzso into the cells, which can explain these zzso zzso The zzso bacteria produced only 50% of normal zzso zzso a zzso that may be associated with impaired zzso zzso
