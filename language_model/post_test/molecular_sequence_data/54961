It is zzso that insect zzso proteins zzso are involved in sex zzso reception, while the general zzso proteins zzso are involved in reception of the general zzso including plant zzso However, this functional specificity is not completely zzso In the present study, full-length sequences of two new zzso genes were zzso identified as zzso and zzso from zzso zzso an important zzso of the zzso tree zzso zzso zzso of transcript levels by zzso showed that the two genes highly expressed in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso similar between zzso These expression patterns are consistent with the generally proposed functions of zzso and zzso With the zzso proteins obtained by a bacterial expression system, the binding specificity of these proteins was further investigated and compared using the competitive binding zzso zzso exhibited high binding affinities with all three putative sex zzso and 10 zzso zzso supporting its role in zzso zzso On the other hand, in addition to binding with some plant zzso zzso surprisingly displayed similar or even higher binding affinities with the sex zzso than zzso zzso we propose that zzso might play roles in reception of sex zzso Additionally, plant zzso zzso and zzso showed high binding with both zzso and zzso suggesting that these volatile chemicals have regulatory functions in the behavior of zzso zzso
