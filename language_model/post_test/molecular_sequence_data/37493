The major structural features of the zzso coli zzso zzso channel protein have been explored using alkaline zzso zzso zzso precise deletions and zzso zzso zzso protein fusion data, combined with the zzso rule, strongly support a model in which zzso crosses the membrane three times, adopting an zzso zzso zzso data suggest that the zzso domain of the protein is essential for the stability of the zzso channel, whereas the protein will tolerate small deletions at the zzso Four zzso that exhibit either zzso zzso or zzso have been zzso a double zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cause a strong zzso zzso The similarity of zzso to the last two zzso of zzso (formerly zzso is reinforced by the demonstration that expression of a truncated zzso protein can substitute for zzso and zzso in zzso survival zzso The data derived from studies of the organization, conservation and the influence of zzso provide significant insights into the structure of the zzso zzso
