zzso is identified in zzso cell extract by its intrinsic activity to facilitate zzso assembly in zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins are present in most zzso and their functional analyses in zzso have suggested that they are necessary to keep proper zzso structures in zzso and zzso This protein is also identified for its interaction with zzso in zzso To address the function of zzso in zzso we have surveyed for proteins to interact with zzso by zzso system and obtained two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso is an essential gene and encodes a novel protein consisting of 319 zzso zzso with a zzso structure in the center of the predicted zzso acid zzso Several zzso dependent zzso sites and zzso zzso sites are also zzso By zzso the zzso zzso we demonstrate that the nuclear division at a zzso temperature is delayed and that the population of cells with a large bud carrying a single nucleus with a short zzso are zzso This zzso also zzso resistance against zzso a zzso zzso Judging from the green fluorescent protein zzso signal fused with zzso this protein zzso in the nucleus as one or two tiny zzso
