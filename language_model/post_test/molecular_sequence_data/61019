A region located remotely upstream of the human zzso zzso zzso gene and required for efficient zzso gene expression in the zzso of transgenic mice was cloned as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the forward or reverse orientation increased zzso promoter activity significantly in zzso zzso and zzso cells after gene zzso The zzso zzso was also able to stimulate activity from a minimal zzso zzso zzso promoter which, unlike zzso lacked any zzso zzso zzso activity was localized by deletion analysis to a zzso region in the zzso of the zzso zzso and was characterized by the presence of a diffuse zzso zzso site, observed with zzso zzso but not zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso A major zzso complex was observed by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso with zzso cell nuclear zzso and the pattern was distinct from that seen with a zzso cell zzso The zzso region contains three zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso in the context of the zzso region fused to the zzso promoter, reduced zzso activity significantly in zzso cells in zzso A zzso in this region was also shown to decrease zzso activity in transgenic mice and correlated with a decrease in the zzso zzso region complex observed by zzso The participation of zzso in this complex is indicated by competition studies with zzso elements and zzso and direct binding of zzso to the zzso sequences was shown by zzso using zzso zzso These studies link the zzso sequences to the zzso zzso activity associated with the zzso locus control region in zzso and in zzso
