To examine the clinical and zzso zzso of zzso 

We divided zzso zzso patients into groups based on the zzso from clinical onset to initiation of insulin therapy: group A zzso 3 zzso acute zzso group, zzso zzso zzso group B zzso zzso intermediate group, zzso zzso 31), and group C zzso or zzso 13 zzso slowly progressive group, zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical markers were compared between group A and group zzso 

The mode age of onset was higher in group C zzso zzso than group A (10 zzso Group C had a higher prevalence of zzso cell zzso zzso 18 of zzso than group A zzso 34 of 134, P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in response to a zzso oral zzso tolerance test was significantly higher in group C than in group zzso Group C patients were also more likely to have a family history of zzso zzso 11 of zzso among their first-degree relatives than group A patients zzso 15 of 134, P zzso zzso The zzso of family history of zzso and zzso zzso diseases were not different between groups C and zzso The frequency of complications of zzso zzso disease was not different between group A zzso 9 of zzso and group C zzso 1 of zzso zzso associations with two class I major zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso and one class II zzso zzso were observed in group zzso Group A patients were associated with three zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, group C lacked the association with class I zzso although zzso and zzso were more common in this group than in control zzso 

These results indicate that the clinical zzso with slowly progressive course zzso progressive zzso has distinct findings including zzso zzso high prevalence of zzso cell zzso preserved zzso function, and high family history of zzso An additive effect of class I and class II major zzso complex zzso is suggested as an explanation for the acute clinical manifestations and more severe zzso destruction in group A zzso
