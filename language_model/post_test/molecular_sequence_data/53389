Among the five human zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was studied with a particular emphasis on the molecular interactions involved in zzso zzso For this purpose, we used zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Twelve zzso were constructed with a special focus on the zzso zzso of zzso IV which zzso in zzso receptors the highly zzso S zzso among the zzso family zzso The zzso receptors were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso binding or competition studies with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso antagonists, zzso and zzso were performed on wild type and zzso zzso zzso activity of the receptors was evaluated by measuring the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso zzso binding experiments revealed that zzso did not bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to double zzso zzso On the other hand zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared to promote a dramatic decrease of zzso zzso functional zzso From these studies, zzso and zzso clearly emerged as common zzso sites to zzso zzso and to zzso According to these results, we propose zzso complex models with zzso and zzso For zzso three interaction points were selected including zzso interaction with zzso a stabilizing interaction of this zzso pair by zzso and a hydrogen bond with zzso zzso was also zzso based on the same type of interactions with zzso and zzso the proposed model suggested a possible role of zzso in zzso IV structure allowing the involvement of a close zzso zzso zzso in a zzso pocket for zzso interactions with the zzso ring of zzso
