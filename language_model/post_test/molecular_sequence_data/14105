The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Two zzso interrupt the coding sequence of the zzso The deduced protein contains 422 zzso acids and is zzso to zzso zzso of other zzso zzso In zzso translation of a transcript of the zzso yielded an zzso active zzso The zzso is zzso zzso in size and is formed by zzso to zzso a common zzso zzso zzso zzso maps to the middle of LG zzso between zzso and zzso and near a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is low in starved stage 1 zzso zzso and, after zzso rises progressively as the worms zzso zzso gene disruption was used to create a zzso zzso zzso zzso are normally viable and show no apparent zzso with the exception of a somewhat reduced zzso zzso In zzso zzso for zzso zzso activity, however, show no zzso zzso activity, suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso for zzso growth in the zzso
