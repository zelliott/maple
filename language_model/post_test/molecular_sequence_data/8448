To determine the transport mechanisms of zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso a cell culture model of the human small zzso zzso 

zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso of these two drugs were measured using zzso cell zzso grown onto zzso and zzso stirred diffusion zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of both drugs depended on the maintenance of a zzso zzso zzso and temperature of the zzso However, zzso transport and zzso which did not display a maximum at approximately pH 6, was more sensitive to zzso zzso change, whereas zzso transport was more sensitive to concentration change zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso (1 zzso transport was decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso transport was decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso by all four zzso Similarly, zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso was also decreased by 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but these zzso effects zzso were zzso less than their zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso of zzso was also significantly zzso zzso zzso inhibited by zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (5 zzso 

The transport of zzso in the zzso cells is via a combination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and passive zzso
