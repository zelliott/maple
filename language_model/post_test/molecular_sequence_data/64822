A novel zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso against a number of zzso zzso strains is zzso This zzso a approximately zzso zzso called zzso was first observed within a complex mixture of soluble outer membrane proteins zzso following a series of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 different zzso zzso tested positive by Western zzso and zzso screening methods for the presence of the protein and the gene zzso zzso The strains tested included zzso of zzso zzso zzso A, B, C, zzso and Y, zzso zzso and zzso zzso To better understand the zzso of this zzso the zzso genes from 63 zzso zzso were zzso Two different zzso of zzso were identified based on deduced zzso acid sequence zzso A high degree of zzso acid sequence similarity exists within each zzso zzso The highest degree of genetic diversity was seen between the two zzso which share approximately 60 to zzso zzso at the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso analyses and electron zzso indicated that the zzso is localized on the outer surface of zzso zzso zzso produced against a single protein zzso was capable of zzso zzso activity against strains expressing different zzso zzso Combining one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from each zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso activity against all strains zzso The zzso family of zzso are candidates worthy of further vaccine zzso
