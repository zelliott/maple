We recently identified the gold compound zzso zzso as a potent inhibitor of the zzso and zzso zzso domain interaction between protein zzso C zzso iota and the zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocks zzso zzso signaling and the transformed growth of human lung cancer zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is a highly selective inhibitor of zzso domain interactions between zzso and the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso has no appreciable zzso effect on other zzso domain zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can form zzso zzso with zzso zzso on target zzso Interestingly, zzso (and zzso contains a unique zzso zzso zzso within its zzso domain that is not present in other zzso domain containing zzso zzso resides within the zzso PC, and AID motif of zzso at the binding interface between zzso and zzso where it interacts with zzso on zzso zzso modeling predicts formation of a zzso zzso at zzso that zzso into the binding zzso normally occupied by zzso providing a plausible structural explanation for zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso to zzso or zzso zzso frequently found at this position in other zzso zzso has little or no effect on the affinity of zzso for zzso but zzso resistance to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cell lung cancer cells zzso resistance to the zzso effects of zzso on transformed zzso We conclude that zzso zzso cellular transformation by selectively targeting zzso within the zzso domain of zzso
