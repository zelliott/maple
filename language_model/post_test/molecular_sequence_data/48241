We previously showed that zzso melanoma cells produce zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso The biological significance of zzso in melanoma formation remains zzso We found that infection of normal zzso with zzso resulted in zzso zzso It is likely that zzso emerged from the defective zzso zzso a single copy of zzso zzso existing in the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned and zzso the full-length zzso zzso and its zzso sites and we completed sequencing of the zzso zzso Our data show that zzso has a typical full-length zzso zzso with high zzso zzso to zzso indicating a close relationship between both zzso zzso probably emerged as a result of zzso between zzso and an zzso zzso zzso Some observed differences in the gag and pol regions of zzso might account for the restoration of productivity and zzso of a novel zzso that zzso emerged during melanoma zzso zzso does not contain any zzso and therefore might induce transformation by zzso zzso We zzso two zzso sites of zzso The first zzso site represents the 3' coding region of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso encodes a basic zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso melanoma cells resulted in the zzso of zzso It is noteworthy that the zzso zzso is also inserted into a zzso region at zzso zzso on the same zzso zzso The second zzso site is the 3' zzso region of the DNA zzso gamma zzso gene on zzso zzso The expression of zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso Further investigation of the biological significance of zzso in melanoma formation is being zzso
