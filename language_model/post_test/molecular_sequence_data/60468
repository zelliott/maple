The factor catalyzing the first step in the synthesis of the characteristic zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso by the essential gene zzso We have analyzed zzso composition and structure zzso when zzso expression is zzso The zzso zzso promoter was zzso with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso which allowed zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced growth and triggered a drastic zzso of zzso unmodified zzso zzso precursors at the expense of the zzso zzso leading to a substantial decrease in overall zzso zzso The composition of the zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso to be zzso zzso proving that zzso is involved in the attachment of the first zzso to the zzso zzso This zzso plays an important role in zzso and stability of the zzso zzso cell wall, acts as an anchor for cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso and is essential for the expression of zzso zzso Any zzso of the zzso side chain reduces or even zzso zzso resistance, as occurred with zzso zzso Because of its key role zzso is a potential target for novel zzso agents that could control the threat of emerging zzso zzso zzso
