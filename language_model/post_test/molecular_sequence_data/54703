The zzso locus zzso resistance to the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso It is positioned at the zzso end of zzso V of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on an zzso segment derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a high-resolution genetic map of the zzso locus zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 2004) were used to screen a zzso library to construct a physical map covering a zzso region of the resistant zzso coming from zzso For comparison, physical maps were also generated of the two zzso from the zzso susceptible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spanning zzso regions of 700 and zzso Gene predictions on the zzso segments resulted in the identification of a large cluster consisting of variable numbers of the zzso type of R genes for each zzso Furthermore, the regions were zzso with numerous zzso elements and genes coding for an zzso protein and an zzso acid zzso Comparative analysis revealed a major lack of gene order conservation in the sequences of the three closely related zzso Our data provide insight in the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the zzso locus and will facilitate the zzso cloning of the zzso resistance zzso
