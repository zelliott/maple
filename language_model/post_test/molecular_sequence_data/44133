The formation of zzso zzso is a major step in the zzso zzso in which zzso acid zzso cycle zzso are converted to zzso zzso In zzso (now zzso zzso this step is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso grow very poorly with zzso cycle zzso as the sole source of zzso Here, the isolation and mapping of zzso zzso which allow zzso zzso to grow on zzso and other zzso cycle zzso is zzso zzso insertions which abolished the zzso zzso and mapped to the zzso locus were located within the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso had increased zzso activity compared to the zzso The zzso zzso was dependent on the combined activities of zzso zzso and zzso which thus represent an alternative route for the formation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity was not required for symbiotic zzso zzso
