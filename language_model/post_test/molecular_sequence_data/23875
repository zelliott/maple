A large gene family zzso proteins with a zzso repeat zzso motif exists in flowering plants but not in algae, zzso or zzso This suggests that zzso protein genes expanded vastly during the evolution of the land zzso To investigate this possibility, we zzso zzso protein genes in the zzso land plant, the moss zzso zzso An extensive survey of the zzso expressed sequence tag zzso databases revealed 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso This indicates that a large gene family of zzso proteins originated before the divergence of the vascular plant and moss zzso We also characterized five full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated two zzso proteins in zzso zzso whereas the cellular zzso of the other three zzso proteins is zzso The genes of the zzso zzso and zzso were expressed zzso in zzso grown under different zzso conditions, suggesting they have distinctive functions in zzso This is the first report and analysis of genes zzso zzso proteins in zzso
