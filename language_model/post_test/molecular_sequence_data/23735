We analyze the zzso structures and zzso relationships of nine near full-length zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses from Brazil, eight of them newly zzso These were obtained by zzso amplification from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso DNA or zzso culture zzso zzso The zzso exhibited unique mosaic structures, except two viruses with a single near zzso zzso zzso with zzso revealed only two zzso zzso in two zzso zzso analyses failed to support a common ancestry of Brazilian zzso or their relationship to zzso which widely zzso in zzso zzso zzso distribution along the zzso was uneven, with the highest mean frequency in the zzso domain of reverse zzso and the lowest in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso from Brazil have independent origins and are unrelated to zzso and that zzso zzso are frequent in pol segments analyzed for drug resistance zzso
