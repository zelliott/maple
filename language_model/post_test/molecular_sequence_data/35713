An appropriate balance of zzso synthesis and degradation is required for normal zzso and maintenance of tissue zzso zzso zzso molecules and their zzso as well as zzso and their zzso are all involved in zzso zzso This report examines the idea that zzso zzso receptors can regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human embryonic lung zzso zzso were cultured under two sets of zzso First, they were zzso in serum and allowed to establish an zzso zzso over a 48 h zzso zzso zzso zzso to the alpha zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso or normal rat zzso was added to the medium and the expression of the zzso was zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso 1 expressed zzso and zzso whereas the control cells did zzso In both cases the cells were well spread and maintained a well-organized zzso In the second condition, cells were zzso in zzso medium on intact zzso zzso zzso 1, or fragments of zzso that contained the zzso zzso zzso attached and spread on all these zzso in a zzso zzso zzso They expressed zzso and zzso on zzso zzso 1 and on several zzso fragments, but not on intact zzso These data support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso can exist in more than one functional state and that these functional states provide information that influences gene zzso zzso and spreading are supported by all states, whereas only a subset permits zzso and zzso zzso
