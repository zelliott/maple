A family of zzso zzso regulatory factors zzso have been shown to play a role in zzso of zzso genes as well as zzso zzso We report the identification of a member of the zzso family which we have named zzso The zzso gene is present in a single copy in human zzso zzso It is expressed zzso in a variety of zzso and no increase in the relative zzso levels of zzso zzso was observed in zzso or zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso protein that binds specifically to the zzso response element zzso but not to the zzso binding site zzso zzso of zzso stimulates expression of the zzso gene 15 zzso promoter, an zzso zzso The zzso zzso promoter, which can be induced by zzso or viral infection, is not induced by zzso zzso of zzso as a zzso fusion protein does not activate expression of a zzso zzso reporter gene containing repeats of the zzso binding sites, indicating that this protein does not contain the zzso zzso zzso The high zzso acid zzso between zzso and zzso factor 3 gamma zzso zzso zzso and their similar binding properties indicate that, like zzso zzso zzso may activate zzso by complex formation with other zzso factors, possibly members of the zzso zzso Identification of this zzso protein may help us to understand the specificity in the various zzso zzso
