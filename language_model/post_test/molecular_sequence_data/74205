zzso zzso sequencing of a zzso template containing a zzso zzso or deletion results in a zzso mixed trace formed by two zzso traces superimposed onto each zzso zzso zzso methods for zzso of such traces require knowledge of a reference sequence or the availability of both direct and reverse mixed sequences of the same zzso We describe a simple yet accurate method, which uses dynamic programming zzso to predict superimposed zzso sequences solely from a string of letters representing zzso within an individual mixed zzso We used the method to decode 104 human traces zzso length zzso zzso containing zzso zzso 5 to 30 zzso with a mean of zzso bases per zzso sequence reconstructed correctly and zzso zzso with artificial sequences have demonstrated that the method yields accurate reconstructions when zzso the zzso sequences forming the mixed trace are sufficiently similar, zzso the analyzed zzso is significantly longer than the zzso and zzso multiple zzso if present, are zzso Because these conditions occur in most encountered DNA zzso the method is widely zzso It is available as a free Web application zzso at zzso
