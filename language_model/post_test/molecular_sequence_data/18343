The zzso zzso zzso an important system for studying zzso and zzso gene zzso is regulated mostly through the control of zzso The promoter and zzso DNA elements which regulate the rat gene lie within a 7 zzso region upstream of the cap zzso We have determined the sequence of this entire zzso It contains several repetitive elements and a zzso distribution of DNA zzso zzso We aligned our rat zzso sequence with zzso mouse and human zzso sequences to define blocks of highly zzso zzso which we then analyzed for zzso to known zzso regulatory zzso Our analysis demonstrates that the regulatory region of the rat zzso gene is unusually zzso
