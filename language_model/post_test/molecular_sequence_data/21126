The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso has high zzso to proteins belonging to two related families: the zzso zzso and the DNA zzso zzso zzso However, no crystal structures of these proteins have been zzso zzso of the crystal structure of zzso will help in zzso of its function and will be useful for understanding the relationship between the structure and the function of these zzso zzso In this study, zzso was zzso zzso and zzso X-ray zzso data were collected to zzso zzso The crystal belonged to the zzso space group zzso with zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso There was one zzso per zzso unit, giving a Matthews zzso of zzso and an approximate zzso content of zzso
