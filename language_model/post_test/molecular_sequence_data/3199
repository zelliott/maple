The zzso zzso zzso requires zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and an accessory protein called zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso Fraser, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso Thompson, zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to exhibit marked species zzso with zzso higher affinities for the human zzso zzso than for receptors from other species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kane, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hill, zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This observation provided an opportunity to map the zzso of zzso affinity exhibited by zzso and the truncated zzso zzso 1 and zzso All three compounds exhibited higher affinity for the human zzso human zzso zzso than for the rat zzso rat zzso zzso We have now demonstrated that this species selectivity was directed exclusively by zzso By generating zzso zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso of human zzso with rat zzso produced rat zzso zzso and vice zzso Moreover, with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have identified a single zzso acid at position 74 of zzso that zzso the affinity of small zzso zzso for zzso Replacement of zzso 74 in rat zzso with zzso (the zzso zzso acid in the human zzso resulted in a zzso or zzso increase in zzso zzso similar to the zzso values for the human zzso These observations suggest that important zzso of small zzso zzso affinity for the zzso zzso reside within the zzso region of zzso and provide evidence that this zzso accessory protein may participate in zzso zzso
