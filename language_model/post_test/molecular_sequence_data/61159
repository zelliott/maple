We used the zzso zzso expression system to examine the regulation of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso function by G protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of G zzso inwardly zzso zzso channels in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso In the absence of added zzso and zzso 2, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso current was zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso along with zzso 2 significantly increased the rate of zzso whereas addition of either zzso 2, zzso or zzso alone had no effect on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso as zzso delta zzso zzso responses were not affected by zzso zzso The rate of zzso zzso zzso was reduced by zzso of the zzso 26 zzso zzso zzso In contrast, substitution of Ala for zzso within the third zzso loop zzso zzso did not reduce the zzso zzso Within the zzso region, zzso substitution significantly attenuated zzso whereas the zzso and zzso point zzso did zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso or zzso and zzso 2 produced zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by a mechanism requiring the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso
