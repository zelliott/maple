The zzso of large sugar chains in zzso from zzso zzso containing up to 51 zzso zzso at a single zzso site on a 12 zzso acid zzso backbone was investigated by zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the same zzso acid sequence and different zzso having such a high zzso ratio, was achieved by applying infrared zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first zzso A zzso sequence coverage of the zzso chain and a 50% coverage of the zzso backbone fragmentation were zzso The zzso of zzso chains at the same zzso site, containing largely zzso could have been reliably zzso
