The zzso organization of a zzso binding zzso zzso II zzso zzso complex was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso results for the zzso of zzso II were used to determine the path of promoter DNA against the structure of the zzso The results indicate that promoter DNA wraps around the mobile clamp of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso both upstream of the zzso element and downstream of the zzso start site suggests that both factors associate with the zzso II mobile zzso zzso alpha closely approaches promoter DNA at zzso zzso a position immediately upstream of the zzso bubble in the open zzso Increased stimulation of zzso initiation by zzso alpha is obtained when the DNA template is artificially zzso in the zzso region, suggesting that zzso alpha zzso open complex formation, possibly through its interaction with the upstream end of the partially opened zzso zzso These results support the central roles of the mobile clamp of zzso II and zzso in zzso zzso
