The zzso zzso zzso zzso system has been expanded in plant zzso compared with its zzso zzso The zzso zzso core zzso consists of five different zzso zzso proteins and four different zzso zzso zzso with each present in one or more copies and organized in two zzso zzso We determined the exact zzso composition and zzso for the intact core and each zzso The zzso zzso zzso was affinity zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso versions of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was determined by mass zzso absolute zzso using stable zzso zzso peptides generated from a synthetic zzso One zzso ring contained zzso in a zzso zzso The other ring contained zzso and zzso in a zzso ratio, resulting in only three zzso zzso These zzso proteins are most closely related to the two zzso of the zzso zzso complex and the identical zzso ratio suggests zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso extensions of the zzso zzso were not zzso removed upon zzso suggesting a regulatory role in zzso zzso zzso These results will now allow testing zzso zzso relationships using rationale zzso The zzso zzso we have designed is zzso to other protein zzso
