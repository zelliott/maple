The recently discovered zzso calcium channels zzso and zzso are thought to play an important role in active calcium zzso in the zzso and zzso Vitamin zzso elements zzso were detected in the promoter sequence of human zzso and regulation of zzso by the steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso has been zzso In this study we describe the structure of two zzso zzso zzso each consisting of 15 zzso localized on zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was found in many target zzso of zzso including skin and zzso cells, while zzso expression is confined to the zzso By screening the zzso promoter zzso we detected a putative zzso in zzso and an zzso response element in zzso However, experiments in mice with a zzso zzso vitamin D zzso showed that expression of zzso in the kidney and of zzso in zzso is regulated by calcium levels, but not by zzso Also, zzso zzso zzso mice and zzso mice supplemented with zzso showed unchanged zzso zzso expression compared with control zzso We conclude that zzso expression in the kidney and the zzso is regulated by zzso calcium but not by vitamin D or zzso in zzso in zzso
