zzso development is a complex process involving the expression of specific growth factors and regulatory proteins that control cell zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we used the rat zzso zzso zzso to examine differences in skeletal gene expression between zzso zzso and normal zzso Total zzso isolated from long bone and zzso was used as a template for zzso differential zzso One of many zzso that were selectively expressed in either normal or zzso bone was cloned and zzso and found to share some zzso to the human zzso and zzso 17 zzso This novel zzso was named zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso that encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed the presence of a signal zzso and a zzso site at position zzso The protein also has thirteen predicted zzso zzso sites and a potential zzso zzso recognition site at position zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed that zzso was 3- to zzso zzso in zzso versus normal zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is most highly expressed in bone compared with any of the other zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis of zzso in normal bone revealed that it is primarily expressed in zzso actively engaged in bone zzso production and zzso In primary rat zzso cultures, zzso showed a zzso pattern of expression being expressed at highest levels during the later stages of zzso maturation and zzso and correlated with the expression of alkaline zzso and zzso Our findings show that zzso expression in bone is zzso and suggest that it may play an important role in zzso differentiation and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso zzso bone may be secondary to the zzso of bone zzso and formation resulting in abnormalities in zzso gene expression and zzso
