The zzso gene has been associated with a drug-resistant zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso has been associated with zzso and zzso zzso but little is known about the functional role of zzso in this zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso gene expressed in a zzso zzso system functions as a transport zzso and zzso a zzso in zzso a gene which encodes a mating zzso zzso export zzso In addition, the zzso gene containing two zzso which are associated with naturally occurring zzso resistance zzso this mating zzso suggesting that these genetic zzso alter this transport zzso Our results support the functional role of zzso as a transport zzso in the mediation of drug resistance and provide an zzso system to address the nature of this transport zzso
