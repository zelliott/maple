zzso zzso is a zzso that specifically zzso at the site after zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso thus zzso zzso To analyze the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we used in zzso selection to isolate zzso zzso zzso that bind to the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso were not zzso by zzso zzso they specifically bound to the protein zzso zzso 2-14 zzso and prevented the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso has a sequence similar to that of the region around the zzso site from zzso zzso to zzso including the decoding site, of zzso coli zzso zzso The secondary structure of zzso zzso was determined by the base pair zzso among the zzso obtained by a second in zzso selection, using a doped zzso pool based on the zzso zzso zzso The sequence and structural similarities between the zzso and zzso zzso provide insights into the recognition of zzso zzso by this specific zzso zzso zzso
