The zzso zzso body zzso complex of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso by electron zzso gel zzso and zzso acid sequencing of the major component zzso The zzso zzso complex consisted of the inner zzso and zzso rings, a rod and a zzso There were no outer zzso and zzso rings that are found in zzso zzso The hook was 15 zzso in thickness and 70 zzso in zzso which is thinner and longer than the hook of zzso zzso The hook protein had an apparent molecular mass of 29 zzso and its zzso sequence was identical to that of zzso zzso zzso which was previously reported as a rod zzso The sequence of the reported zzso protein of zzso zzso is more closely related to that of zzso (the hook zzso rather than zzso (the rod zzso of zzso zzso in spite of the difference of the apparent molecular masses between the two hook proteins (29 zzso versus 42 zzso The zzso body contained six major proteins (with apparent molecular masses of 82, 59, 35, 32, 29 and 20 zzso and two minor proteins zzso zzso and 13 zzso which consistently appeared from preparation to zzso The zzso of each of these proteins was zzso zzso with protein databases revealed the following zzso zzso 82 zzso zzso 59 zzso zzso 35 zzso zzso 32 zzso zzso 23 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso and zzso 13 zzso not zzso The band at 20 zzso was a mixture of zzso and zzso as revealed by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso features of zzso zzso zzso are discussed in comparison with those of zzso zzso
