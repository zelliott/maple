zzso of the zzso family mediate the zzso of proteins into zzso of zzso bacteria, and zzso Here we report the identification of a second gene of the zzso family in the zzso of zzso zzso which we have named zzso Its gene product, zzso is located in the inner membrane of zzso zzso of the zzso gene caused a specific zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and resulted in induction of the alternative zzso zzso which zzso the need for complex IV of the respiratory zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a common function for both zzso The zzso sequence allowed the identification of a new zzso of zzso proteins whose members appear to be zzso present in zzso of zzso plants, and animals including zzso
