DNA damage zzso the expression of many genes proposed to enhance DNA repair zzso We investigated the mechanism by which DNA damage zzso zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso Five zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Each is sensitive to DNA zzso zzso zzso are also defective for zzso and zzso induction but are zzso for induction of other zzso defining the existence of at least two distinct DNA damage induction zzso zzso encodes a nuclear protein zzso that is also a zzso zzso of zzso increases in response to DNA damage in a zzso manner, suggesting an increase in zzso zzso These results establish the existence of a zzso zzso response regulated by protein zzso
