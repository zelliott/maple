zzso zzso zzso is a large zzso bacterial toxin that causes zzso zzso Due to its size, it was predicted to undergo zzso zzso during zzso into host cells to deliver activity zzso to the zzso In this study, we identified a domain within the zzso toxin that is zzso in large zzso zzso toxins zzso zzso zzso and zzso putative toxins from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies and in zzso characterization of zzso zzso protein revealed that this domain from the zzso zzso zzso toxin is an zzso zzso zzso whose activity is zzso by the zzso zzso A zzso point zzso within the zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso activity suggesting that processing of the toxin is an important step in toxin zzso Overall, we have uncovered a new mechanism by which large bacterial toxins and proteins deliver zzso activities to the zzso cell zzso by zzso after zzso
