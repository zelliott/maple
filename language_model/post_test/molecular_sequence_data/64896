This study describes the zzso zzso gene family whose members zzso unusual zinc finger zzso In the zzso zzso both zzso and the newly isolated zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso boundary, where expression of zzso is dependent on zzso In addition, zzso is uniquely expressed more zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso proteins during zzso stages zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso expressed zzso zzso formation of future zzso 2 and 3 zzso zzso whereas neighboring zzso and zzso are not zzso zzso simultaneous reduction of zzso and zzso protein function by expression of zzso zzso zzso leads to expansion of future zzso and zzso with associated loss of zzso These data indicate that one function of the zzso gene family is to specify or maintain zzso identity, and to limit zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
