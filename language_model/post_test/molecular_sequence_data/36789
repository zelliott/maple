A new zzso zzso response factor zzso has been identified in nuclear extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The factor, zzso displays zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso regulatory element A specificity and differs from the previously described zzso response element zzso factor zzso in several zzso zzso is restricted to the nucleus, whereas zzso exists in the zzso and zzso into the nucleus upon treatment of cells with zzso The zzso strength requirement of zzso for zzso zzso activity is lower than that of zzso The zzso activity of zzso but not that of zzso is markedly suppressed by zzso In common with zzso the zzso form of zzso appears to be required for zzso zzso A model is proposed for the mechanism zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
