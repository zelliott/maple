zzso zzso disease virus, a zzso zzso virus of the family zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso as part of a large zzso Upon expression in zzso coli, the zzso releases itself from larger precursors by zzso zzso at its N and C zzso Both zzso sites were determined by zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso at the N zzso of the zzso occurred with high efficiency at an zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso zzso at the C zzso of the zzso occurred with low efficiency at an zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso To study the zzso specificity of the zzso zzso acid zzso were introduced at the zzso zzso and zzso positions at the zzso site at the zzso boundary of the zzso This analysis showed that the zzso acid at the zzso position is the most important zzso for zzso zzso Only zzso acid, zzso and zzso acid were tolerated at this zzso At the zzso position, zzso zzso and zzso were the preferred zzso of the zzso but a number of zzso acids with larger side chains were also zzso zzso at the zzso position had only little effect on the zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso half of the zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso at the junction of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso An zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso was identified as the putative zzso zzso Our data show that rabbit zzso disease virus encodes a zzso zzso zzso that is similar to zzso zzso with regard to function and specificity but is more similar to 2A zzso with regard to zzso
