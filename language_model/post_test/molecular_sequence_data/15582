zzso a spectral library for the identification of protein zzso data has proven to be a fast and accurate method, while yielding a high identification zzso We investigated the potential to increase zzso discovery rate, with little increase in zzso time, by constructing a zzso based on a sequence search with zzso followed by a library search with zzso zzso a consensus library compiled from the search results of the prior zzso search increased the number of confidently matched zzso by up to zzso zzso matched zzso by zzso included noisy zzso zzso representing missed zzso peptides as well as zzso from zzso modified zzso
