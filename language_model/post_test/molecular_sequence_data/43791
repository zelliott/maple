zzso from zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso An zzso of the zzso locus of zzso zzso which is required for zzso development and leaf zzso zzso has been generated by zzso zzso into the untranslated leader sequence of the zzso This zzso gives rise to a zzso zzso where zzso tissue containing zzso zzso zzso sections is observed in the leaves of plants grown at 15 degrees C, while leaves of plants grown at 25 degrees C appear near zzso The temperature sensitivity of zzso results from expression of the zzso locus responding to the activity of the zzso element, the zzso of which is very sensitive to growing zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso using the zzso zzso also results in suppression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso zzso similar to those described for zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in response to element zzso appears to result from use of an alternative promoter at the 3' end of the zzso zzso The production of zzso zzso by an zzso element is discussed in relation to the zzso potential of plant zzso in producing complex genetic zzso
