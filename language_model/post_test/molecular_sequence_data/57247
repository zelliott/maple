zzso study of a patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso showed an unusual zzso zzso zzso without apparent zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies showed zzso of the zzso acid zzso alpha zzso zzso gene but no zzso of the zzso leukemia gene consistent with the zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso acid treatment in this patient produced an early zzso which was followed by a zzso zzso but the patient died too early to achieve zzso Further molecular analysis of this patient showed a zzso between the zzso alpha gene and a newly discovered zinc finger gene named zzso zzso leukemia zinc zzso The fusion zzso alpha gene found in this case, was not found in DNA obtained from the bone zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and in one patient with zzso with a zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso using a zzso specific probe localized the zzso gene to zzso band zzso zzso zzso structure of the zzso gene zzso the break point on zzso 11 was also established and the zzso within the zzso alpha gene was mapped approximately 2 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso the zzso untranslated region and the unique zzso domain of the zzso alpha 2 zzso
