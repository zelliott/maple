Whole zzso sequencing of several zzso model organisms provides a platform for studying zzso zzso How representative are the zzso of these model organisms for their respective zzso Within zzso for example, the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso is a highly derived species with unusual zzso characters, such as a reduced zzso cluster zzso zzso 13, zzso and the absence of a zzso signaling zzso Here, we describe the recent loss of a DNA zzso gene zzso in zzso A zzso gene is present in the satellite model zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso that zzso from zzso zzso million years zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso all contain an zzso zzso which encodes another essential component of the zzso system of higher animals and zzso zzso is expressed throughout development and zzso interference zzso experiments result in variable zzso In contrast, zzso zzso results in paralyzed zzso or adult worms suggesting recent changes of gene function within the zzso zzso We speculate that both genes were part of an ancestral DNA zzso system in zzso and that gene loss and sequence divergence have abolished DNA zzso in zzso
