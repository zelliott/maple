The genes defining multiple B mating types in the zzso mushroom zzso commune are predicted to zzso multiple zzso and zzso zzso These genes are clustered in each of two zzso and independently functioning zzso B alpha and B zzso A difference in specificity at either locus between a zzso pair of individuals zzso an identical series of events in sexual zzso The B alpha 1 locus was recently found to contain genes predicted to zzso three zzso zzso and a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso These gene products interact in zzso pairs, the zzso of one B alpha specificity with the zzso of any one of the other eight B alpha zzso and are likely to activate a signaling cascade similar to that known for mating in zzso zzso We report here that the B beta 1 locus also contains at least three zzso genes and one zzso zzso zzso which function similarly to the genes in the B alpha 1 zzso but only within the series of B beta zzso A comparison of the DNA sequences of the B alpha 1 and B beta 1 zzso suggests that each arose from a common ancestral zzso allowing us to speculate about the evolution of this unique series of regulatory zzso
