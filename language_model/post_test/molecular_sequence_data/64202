zzso zzso growth zzso such as zzso impair zzso zzso in the adult zzso central nervous system zzso Here, we describe the cloning and expression of two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso As in zzso alternative transcripts are generated both through differential zzso and promoter zzso giving rise to zzso zzso zzso -C and to a new zzso zzso zzso is therefore the zzso zzso where zzso was zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in the nervous system, whereas the other zzso mainly occur in zzso zzso zzso specific zzso detect the protein in zzso fiber tracts of the spinal cord, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in isolated zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso This expression pattern is consistent with that observed for rat zzso and suggests similar zzso zzso in zzso zzso might therefore contribute to the failure of spinal zzso zzso in zzso feature that may have evolved during the transition from fish to land zzso
