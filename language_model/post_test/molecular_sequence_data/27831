Three zzso zzso zzso zzso clones containing 4 alpha zzso zzso genes have been isolated from a newly constructed human zzso zzso Each gene is an zzso of a previously described zzso zzso three being only minor zzso The fourth gene zzso is a functional zzso of the zzso zzso gene which previously has been described only as a zzso zzso it appears likely that other zzso zzso may remain to be described and that the zzso system may be able to tolerate some zzso as a consequence of the large number of members of the zzso
