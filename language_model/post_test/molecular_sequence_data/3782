Most zzso zzso fall into one of two families, based on evolutionary and zzso zzso These are the zzso zzso or zzso zzso family and the zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso are structurally diverse and functionally versatile and include zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recent studies have revealed that the zzso zzso family is equally versatile and members have a variety of structural zzso The zzso zzso are highly zzso only affect resolution or inversion and they have an zzso zzso domain and a zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cause integration and zzso with strictly controlled zzso and have an zzso zzso domain but much longer zzso zzso compared with the zzso This high molecular weight group also contains zzso zzso zzso from zzso Other zzso which belong to a third structurally different group, are similar in size to the zzso but have the DNA binding domain zzso to the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso These three structural groups represented by the zzso the large zzso zzso and relatives of zzso zzso correlate with three major groupings seen in a zzso of the zzso zzso These observations indicate that the zzso zzso are modular and that fusion of the zzso domain to unrelated sequences has generated structural and functional zzso
