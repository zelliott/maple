To study genetic variation and molecular epidemiology of the G protein of respiratory zzso virus zzso zzso strains from a children's hospital in Korea over 9 consecutive zzso were zzso zzso analysis of the entire G protein gene demonstrated 24 zzso among 188 zzso A and 6 among 65 zzso B zzso Two to 4 dominant zzso of zzso A zzso and different zzso predominated in each zzso zzso zzso were replaced with new zzso during consecutive zzso One of 2 dominant zzso among zzso B predominated alternately or zzso zzso analysis revealed that there were multiple zzso with zzso related to their location and time of isolation among strains from Korea and zzso zzso and zzso distinction have been shown more clearly for zzso B than zzso zzso These results suggest that the G protein of zzso is continuously evolving, with a distinct pattern presumably due to immune selection in a localized region over zzso
