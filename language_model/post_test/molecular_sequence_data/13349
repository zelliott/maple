zzso zzso zzso in the larvae of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are capable of detoxifying linear and angular zzso found in their host zzso The zzso zzso which is zzso induced in these larvae in response to zzso encodes a zzso that principally zzso linear zzso such as zzso and zzso We have now cloned zzso zzso derived from a second locus that is zzso related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern analyses have demonstrated that zzso transcripts are expressed in response to a wider range of linear and angular zzso but at lower abundance than zzso zzso Whereas zzso transcripts are expressed at a low zzso level in zzso control larvae and at high levels in zzso larvae, zzso transcripts are nearly zzso in control larvae and are highly induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fact that these two zzso zzso are zzso regulated by these four zzso indicates that zzso zzso has adapted to the presence of the wide range of zzso in its host plants by diversifying its zzso zzso structure and its zzso regulatory zzso
