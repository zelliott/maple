zzso mice were constructed with a functional T cell zzso beta zzso zzso of the introduced gene is largely confined to T cells, but low levels of transcripts are also seen in B cells and in other zzso zzso analyses show that most, if not all, of the T zzso express the transgenic beta chain on the cell surface and lack beta chains zzso by zzso beta zzso zzso genetic analyses of zzso and cloned T zzso demonstrate that zzso of zzso beta genes is zzso zzso D beta zzso beta 1 zzso are found zzso while complete zzso zzso are not zzso These findings show that expression of the zzso regulates the zzso of zzso beta zzso Although the alpha beta T cell receptors of the transgenic mice are homogeneous with respect to the beta chain, they are fully functional, at least in a variety of zzso zzso
