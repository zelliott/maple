zzso recruitment to the majority of zzso zzso is facilitated by the interaction of the cap binding zzso zzso with the zzso zzso cap zzso zzso stimulates translation through its interaction with a scaffolding zzso zzso which helps to recruit the zzso zzso also contain a zzso of zzso termed zzso which binds the cap structure, but not zzso and thus cannot stimulate translation, but it instead zzso the translation of only one known, and possibly subset zzso To understand why zzso does not inhibit general translation, we studied the binding affinity of zzso for cap zzso using two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso binds cap zzso zzso and zzso with 30 and 100 lower affinity than zzso Thus, zzso cannot compete with zzso for binding to the cap structure of most zzso
