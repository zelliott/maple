We have determined the DNA sequences in the zzso zzso of the T cell zzso zzso beta gene and analyzed nuclear proteins binding to this zzso Previously, we identified two zzso zzso I hypersensitive regions, potential regulatory regions, in the zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso revealed that both zzso I hypersensitive regions have similar DNA zzso suggesting that these regions are zzso zzso We have also identified zzso zzso binding regions downstream of the zzso hypersensitive zzso Although zzso zzso activity was not observed in the hypersensitive regions or the adjacent protein binding regions in the zzso zzso our findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may contain some other type of regulatory zzso
