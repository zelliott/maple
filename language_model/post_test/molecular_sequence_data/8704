We have used organ culture to investigate the in zzso toxicity of three zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B), and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso fraction III zzso and zzso 

Eight to 14 zzso biopsy specimens were obtained from each of 8 treated and 7 zzso zzso patients and 5 normal controls and cultured for 18 h in organ culture with test zzso (1 zzso or medium zzso Mean zzso cell heights zzso were compared with paired values for specimens grown in medium zzso 

A significant reduction in the mean of the zzso values for each of the patient groups was observed with zzso A and zzso in both treated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients when compared with tissue incubated with medium zzso No significant changes in the mean zzso value were noted in any of the patient groups in tissue incubated with zzso B, zzso C, or zzso as compared with those with medium zzso 

These results suggest that zzso A is toxic in zzso to the zzso zzso of both treated and zzso zzso patients, zzso with recent findings that this zzso zzso zzso disease in zzso
