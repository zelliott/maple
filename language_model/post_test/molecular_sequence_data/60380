The purpose of this study was to investigate the frequency of occurrence of zzso against zzso coupled cardiovascular receptors and their relation to the clinical manifestation of zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso were determined with zzso in 52 patients with zzso zzso male, 15 female, mean age 55 zzso 15 zzso and 40 healthy, age and sex matched zzso The clinical characterization of the zzso included zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results showed that there is no significant difference in the frequency of a single zzso between zzso and zzso However, if the number of patients who have zzso against zzso and/or zzso were counted together, there are significantly more zzso in zzso compared to controls (11 zzso 2, p zzso zzso Analysis of clinical data from this pooled group of patients showed that in patients with zzso heart rate zzso zzso ultra low frequency zzso and very low frequency zzso were decreased zzso by zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso p zzso zzso whereas the zzso was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso wall thickness was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso period was prolonged by zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the existence of these zzso could be associated with an advanced stage or a severe manifestation of zzso
