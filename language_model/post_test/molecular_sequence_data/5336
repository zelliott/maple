Essential zzso zzso is a zzso disorder associated with zzso zzso and zzso In this disease, in zzso autonomous growth of zzso colonies has been demonstrated by various zzso This phenomenon is impaired by the zzso of the zzso zzso In order to evaluate the potential role of zzso of the zzso gene in the origin of this autonomous growth, we compared the expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso derived from zzso patients and normal zzso Overlapping zzso zzso fragments derived from four zzso patients were zzso to search for small zzso In the 10 zzso and five normal samples we zzso relative expression of the zzso zzso was zzso New zzso of zzso and K zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Cloning of these zzso indicated that they are produced by alternative zzso of zzso 9 sequences shared by zzso and zzso Their predicted zzso acid sequence would be deleted by 24 zzso upstream of the zzso box of the second domain of zzso Two sequence variations, leading to DNA restriction zzso were present in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both were present in normal and zzso samples, excluding zzso of zzso as a cause of zzso
