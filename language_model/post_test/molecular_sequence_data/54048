The eyes absent zzso gene is critical to eye formation in zzso upon loss of zzso function, eye zzso cells die by programmed cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression directs eye formation, and zzso functionally zzso in zzso and physically interacts in zzso with two other genes of eye development, sine zzso and zzso The zzso protein zzso while highly zzso to zzso is zzso To define zzso acids critical to the function of the zzso zzso we have zzso zzso zzso These zzso have revealed that loss of the entire zzso zzso is zzso for zzso activity, but that zzso with zzso within the zzso zzso display partial zzso We then extended the molecular genetic analysis to interactions within the zzso zzso This analysis has revealed regions of special importance to interaction with zzso zzso or zzso Select zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso diminished the interactions with zzso zzso or zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso activity and may have functional zzso within zzso
