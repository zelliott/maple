zzso muscular zzso zzso is a group of clinically and genetically zzso disorders inherited in an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso called zzso has been shown by zzso and genetic analyses to be implicated in the zzso of the zzso form of zzso In the zzso zzso which represents about half of the cases, more zzso evidence of the involvement of the zzso zzso has recently been reported with the identification of zzso in the gene zzso the zzso of zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso Here we report on two siblings from a zzso family expressing an internally deleted zzso zzso as a result of a zzso site zzso in the zzso gene which causes the zzso of zzso zzso The predicted protein lacks 63 zzso acids in domain zzso which forms a zzso structure on the short arm of the zzso Interestingly, these patients appear mildly affected compared to others who completely lack this zzso This situation presents a striking zzso with Becker muscular dystrophy, where zzso deletions in the zzso gene result in the expression of a zzso protein and lead to a mild zzso
