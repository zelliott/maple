zzso tracts are frequently found in the zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso and have been proposed to act as upstream promoter elements for zzso zzso An zzso tract of 23 zzso is also found as a characteristic sequence motif in the zzso of the 230 zzso segment which separates the open reading frames of the zzso gene and its zzso gene on zzso zzso Recently we have reported that zzso of zzso is initiated immediately adjacent to this zzso tract zzso et zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso gene of unknown function is zzso transcribed into an zzso with zzso zzso zzso Two of these zzso ends map within the zzso stretch, while the third is located upstream, leading to an zzso species which is partially complementary to the zzso zzso zzso shift zzso show that the zzso stretch is specifically recognized by zzso binding zzso in nuclear zzso We discuss these results with respect to the role of zzso stretches in gene expression in zzso
