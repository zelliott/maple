Although a number of plant zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been functionally characterized in different plant species, little is known about the zzso role and zzso activities of members of the zzso 4 zzso To gain insight into their biological function, zzso genes were isolated from apple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rose zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and were zzso together with zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso well to yield zzso while zzso zzso and zzso were almost inactive towards this zzso No zzso products were found for any of the five zzso genes when they were zzso in zzso coli strains that accumulated zzso and zzso In zzso zzso however, demonstrated the breakdown of zzso by zzso and zzso to zzso while this zzso was almost not zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso clones of zzso genes revealed that zzso like zzso contains no zzso while zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso These results indicate that plants produce at least two different forms of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso cleave their zzso at the same position zzso and zzso they might have different zzso functions as they accept different zzso zzso show various expression patterns, and are zzso differently zzso
