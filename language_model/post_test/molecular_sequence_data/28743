To study the regulation of the zzso small nuclear zzso finger protein zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso of its zzso promoter was zzso This zzso zzso strong zzso in reporter gene zzso yielding zzso or zzso zzso of the activity of the zzso virus zzso zzso Interestingly, the short region from zzso to zzso zzso the zzso start site was sufficient for potent zzso promoter activity in various zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso box at zzso abolished nuclear protein binding to the zzso promoter and severely compromised promoter activity, suggesting that this element is critical for the assembly of the zzso apparatus to regulate zzso gene zzso Furthermore, our results show that the zzso tumor 1 gene product is one of the potential zzso of the zzso zzso
