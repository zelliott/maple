The gene zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the zzso brain and has been associated with such functions as feeding termination and zzso locomotion and zzso the zzso of zzso behaviors, and learning and zzso Here we describe the brain expression and song regulation of zzso in the brain of the adult male zebra zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is highly expressed in several discrete brain regions, most prominently the zzso portion of the zzso formation, the zzso zzso shelf and the zzso zzso zzso the core or shell regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell groups in the zzso and zzso the principal nucleus of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was largely absent in song control system, a group of zzso required for vocal learning and song production in zzso although sparse labeling was detected throughout the zzso including song nucleus area zzso We also show that levels of zzso zzso and the number of labeled cells increase in the zzso of males and females following auditory stimulation with zzso zzso Double labeling further reveals that the majority of zzso cells, excluding those in the zzso nucleus of the thalamus, are zzso Together, these data provide the first comprehensive characterization of zzso expression in a zzso and suggest a possible involvement of zzso regulation in important aspects of birdsong biology, such as zzso processing, auditory memorization, and/or zzso control of song zzso
