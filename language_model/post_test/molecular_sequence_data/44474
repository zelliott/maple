zzso I zzso of the rat zzso alpha promoter in the presence of crude cell nuclear extract revealed three sites of zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso in the region from zzso to zzso zzso of specific sites within the zzso and zzso regions reduced expression of a zzso alpha zzso gene zzso zzso from zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating the importance of zzso interactions at these zzso Since zzso contained a perfect zzso consensus sequence zzso as its center, we investigated the possibility that zzso binding is important for zzso alpha promoter zzso A zzso zzso spanning zzso displayed a distinct mobility shift in the presence of nuclear extract that was inhibited by an excess of known functional zzso zzso Moreover, a similar mobility shift occurred in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and the further addition of zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso More refined zzso I zzso of a smaller, zzso probe in the presence of zzso zzso protein revealed a protected region that included the putative zzso binding zzso Additionally, zzso of an zzso expression zzso increased zzso zzso expression zzso in zzso Schneider zzso These various findings corroborate a role for zzso in zzso alpha promoter zzso The zzso region contains a zzso motif that has been previously suggested to function as an zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso displayed a specific gel mobility shift in the presence of a zzso binding protein zzso complex, and the further addition of zzso zzso produced a zzso These results confirm that protein binding within zzso is functionally important, and they also indicate that the zzso motif functions as a zzso binding zzso
