The sequence of a new zzso zzso has been identified in a South African zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso differs at two zzso positions zzso and zzso from zzso The difference at position 246 is silent, while that at position 272 results in an zzso acid change from zzso zzso to zzso zzso As these same differences are found in other zzso zzso they were probably introduced into the zzso sequence by a short gene conversion event with another zzso This finding provides further evidence for the diversification of zzso zzso sequences via zzso
