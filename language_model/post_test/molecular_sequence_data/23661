zzso divergence has been found between zzso zzso vaccine strains and circulating strains in several zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso collected in Japan from 1988 to 2001 using zzso gel zzso zzso and sequencing of two zzso zzso The 107 zzso were classified into three major groups by zzso zzso 87 zzso were type A, 19 zzso were type B, and 1 zzso was type zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes revealed the presence of two zzso and zzso and three zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in the zzso Among those zzso 82 zzso of the 87 type A strains and the type C strain had the same combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as the Japanese vaccine zzso On the other hand, 17 zzso of 19 type B strains had an zzso zzso distinct from that of the vaccine zzso A correlation was found between the zzso variation and the zzso profile in the zzso In addition, the frequency of the type B strain was 0, 27, 0, 42, and 37% of the zzso in the periods 1988 to 1993, 1994 to 1995, 1996 to 1997, 1998 to 1999, and 2000 to 2001, zzso In contrast, the number of reported zzso and zzso cases decreased gradually from 1991 on, suggesting that the zzso divergence did not affect the efficacy of zzso vaccination in zzso
