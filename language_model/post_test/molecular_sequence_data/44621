A sequential assignment protocol for proteins was developed using zzso zzso zzso The protocol consists of an zzso acid type recognition zzso and a primary sequence mapping zzso The former measures the similarity between each detected spin pattern and 20 standard zzso acid zzso zzso Both chemical shift and zzso likeness are zzso The mapping zzso uses the zzso acid type information to direct detected zzso to proper position onto protein primary zzso The assignment protocol can be applied to spin systems generated by many different zzso We designed a few computer programs to derive a zzso backbone and side chain spin systems using zzso zzso zzso The results was then input to the sequential assignment zzso All of the zzso were tested on zzso data of a zzso zzso of chicken skeletal zzso
