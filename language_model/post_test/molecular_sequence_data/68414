A zzso zzso complex zzso S zzso was highly zzso from rabbit skeletal zzso The zzso 26 S zzso easily zzso into a 20 S zzso and a regulatory zzso complex on zzso zzso By using zzso and zzso zzso it was revealed that the 26 S zzso exists in two zzso one zzso zzso consists of the 20 S zzso and the regulatory zzso complex in the ratio of one to two, while the other zzso zzso exists in an equal zzso zzso zzso masses of the former and the latter zzso were estimated to be 1,700 zzso and 1,400 zzso respectively, by gel zzso and zzso zzso and 1,400 zzso respectively, by Ferguson plot zzso Furthermore, both zzso efficiently zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the D and C complexes are active zzso complexes, most probably corresponding to the zzso and zzso (or space zzso zzso zzso
