The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is the second zzso in the parallel zzso zzso zzso We previously reported the cloning and sequencing of the zzso acid zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence downstream of the zzso genes identified another open reading frame highly zzso at the zzso acid level to the zzso gene from zzso coli zzso We zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene on a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene consists of 338 zzso zzso weight of zzso zzso of the deduced protein sequence revealed a high degree of identity with the sequences of zzso genes from other zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene by a zzso resistance cassette resulted in zzso and zzso zzso
