The two major processes of bone zzso formation and zzso regulated by cellular zzso zzso and zzso play a significant role in bone zzso which is known to be regulated by local soluble factors and systemic zzso Although bone is a zzso tissue comprised of zzso and zzso cells, cellular zzso of zzso and its regulation remains to be zzso We first demonstrate that cellular zzso by which zzso communicate with opposing cells in bone milieu is involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso obtained from zzso patients expressed particular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso toe zzso zzso to T cells which were used as representative adhesive partners, since T cells possess all the receptors to these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were induced in the zzso by the cellular zzso to T cells and they were reduced by interrupting the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso on the zzso induced zzso zzso from the zzso These results indicate that zzso adhere to opposing cells through particular zzso molecules on their surface and that the zzso molecules on the zzso not only function as glue with opposing partners but zzso zzso signals that facilitate the production of zzso zzso We propose that cellular zzso of zzso as well as soluble factors is significant for the regulation of bone zzso
