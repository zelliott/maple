zzso reconstruction of the natural history of an zzso ultimately requires knowledge about the development, population zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso Such investigations would benefit from studies of zzso processes because zzso are the source of natural zzso The zzso zzso zzso has been developed as a model zzso in evolutionary biology by comparing its development with zzso zzso zzso zzso and related species are associated with zzso zzso and their ecology and zzso are well zzso More than 200 zzso zzso zzso from all over the world are available for this cosmopolitan zzso We generated zzso zzso zzso lines in zzso zzso to study spontaneous zzso rates in the zzso zzso and compared zzso rate estimates with natural variation between nine representative zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length and is typical for zzso zzso zzso has all known zzso genes and contains an unusual zzso transfer zzso zzso for the zzso zzso This has most likely influenced the spectrum of zzso zzso because 6 of 12 zzso found in the 82 MA lines analyzed are nonsense zzso that can be suppressed by the zzso zzso The overall zzso rate in zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso per site per generation and is less than one order of magnitude different from estimates in zzso zzso and zzso Using this zzso rate estimate in a comparison of the zzso zzso of nine zzso zzso zzso we calculate the minimum time to the most recent common zzso at zzso zzso The combination of zzso rate analysis with zzso divergence provides a powerful tool for the reconstruction of the natural history of zzso zzso and we discuss the ecological implication of these zzso
