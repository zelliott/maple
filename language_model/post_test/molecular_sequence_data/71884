zzso are key zzso in the metabolism of zzso zzso This paper describes a systematic approach to the isolation and molecular analysis of two families of bacterial zzso acid zzso zzso zzso called group I and group II zzso zzso The two families are zzso unrelated and together represent almost all of the zzso zzso genes described to zzso We report the design and evaluation of zzso zzso primer pairs for the separate amplification and isolation of group I and II zzso zzso zzso acid sequences derived from 10 of 11 group I zzso partial gene products of new and previously reported bacterial zzso showed conservation of five zzso previously identified as essential for zzso The exception, zzso from a zzso zzso had only two of these five zzso Group II zzso gene sequences were amplified from 54 newly isolated zzso and seven of these sequences were cloned and fully zzso Group II zzso were zzso zzso zzso but not zzso acid, and derived zzso acid sequences for all of the genes except zzso degrees zzso showed conservation of previously identified essential zzso zzso analysis of the two zzso families highlighted four subdivisions in each, which were supported by high zzso values in zzso trees and by zzso zzso zzso Group I zzso genes included two putative cryptic or silent zzso zzso degrees zzso and zzso degrees zzso produced by different zzso Group II zzso genes included two cryptic genes and an active zzso zzso that can be switched off and zzso All zzso bacteria so far described were zzso a result that may be explained by limitations either in the host range for zzso genes or in isolation zzso
