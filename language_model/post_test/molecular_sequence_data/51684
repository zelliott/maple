The central region of the zzso protein has a characteristic zzso acid sequence zzso which is very similar to those of particular zzso of zzso zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso virus 40 large zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of these three viral zzso have recently been shown to be specific binding sites for the zzso gene zzso zzso We have noted that the sequence of zzso followed by a cluster of zzso zzso acids is exactly the same as that of a typical zzso of zzso zzso II zzso zzso we investigated whether these nuclear zzso are zzso by zzso For this purpose, we fused the zzso and zzso genes including this domain and expressed it in zzso coli zzso Several zzso zzso zzso containing single zzso acid zzso in this domain, were also used to produce fused zzso Strong zzso by zzso was detected with the fused protein of zzso zzso However, no zzso of zzso itself was observed and the zzso of fused zzso proteins were zzso Another fused zzso protein containing most of the zzso region downstream of this zzso region was not zzso by zzso Analysis of zzso sites in synthetic peptides of this zzso region identified the major sites zzso by zzso as zzso and zzso On two-dimensional zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso major spots of in zzso and zzso zzso proteins were detected in the same zzso These results suggest that two zzso zzso of the zzso central region of the zzso protein are zzso by zzso in zzso as well as in zzso The functional significance of this zzso domain is zzso
