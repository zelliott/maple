Limited protection of current vaccines and zzso drugs against influenza A virus infection underscores the urgent need for development of novel zzso virus zzso While short interfering zzso zzso has been shown to be able to inhibit influenza virus infection in a zzso manner, zzso of the zzso zzso gene I protein zzso zzso has an zzso effect in a zzso zzso In this study, we designed and tested the zzso virus effect of a short zzso zzso designated zzso that possesses dual zzso an zzso influenza zzso gene and an zzso for zzso zzso This zzso zzso possesses a zzso group at the zzso end of the sense strand and is blunt zzso Our study showed that zzso could zzso inhibit influenza A virus infection both in cell culture and in zzso The strong zzso effect was attributed to its zzso function as well as its ability to activate the zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso can zzso inhibit influenza A virus zzso The development of such dual functional zzso molecules will greatly contribute to the arsenal of tools to combat not only influenza viruses but also other important viral zzso
