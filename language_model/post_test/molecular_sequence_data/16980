zzso dwarf clones of zzso zzso are tolerant to wind damage and therefore useful for zzso zzso The identification of molecular markers for the dwarf character is very important for zzso zzso high-yielding dwarf hybrid lines in the early stage of plant breeding zzso We have identified a dwarf zzso random amplified zzso DNA zzso marker in rubber zzso A total of 115 random zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify zzso DNA by zzso of which 19 zzso produced clear and zzso zzso The primer zzso generated a zzso DNA marker from both natural and controlled zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso derived from a cross between a dwarf parent and a normal cultivated clone as well as from the dwarf zzso it was absent in other parent zzso zzso To validate this DNA marker, we analyzed 22 zzso hybrids (13 with a dwarf stature and nine with a normal zzso the dwarf zzso zzso zzso marker was present in all zzso hybrids and absent in all zzso zzso This DNA marker was cloned and zzso DNA marker locus specificity was further confirmed by Southern zzso zzso Our results indicate that Southern zzso zzso of zzso using zzso made from cloned DNA fragments allows a more accurate analysis of the zzso pattern based on the zzso of specific DNA markers than zzso gels or Southern zzso analysis of zzso blots using zzso made from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso markers in the hybrid zzso indicates that zzso is a powerful tool for identifying inherited zzso segments following different zzso methods in perennial tree zzso
