zzso zzso factor, zzso is a zzso with multiple activities in both the adult and the zzso zzso appears to be zzso by a unique gene in both mouse and man, although the zzso region of the mouse zzso gene gives a complex zzso pattern on Southern zzso The complete zzso sequences of both the zzso and human zzso genes and their zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso pairs, zzso were determined and zzso Both genes comprise three zzso two zzso and an unusually long zzso region zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of approximately zzso zzso Two start sites of zzso were determined, by zzso protection and by a novel approach involving the zzso chain zzso zzso protection revealed a start site zzso base pairs upstream of the zzso start zzso and immediately downstream of a zzso box zzso The zzso approach identified a second zzso start site 160 base pairs zzso of the start zzso and adjacent to a zzso element zzso A comparison of the zzso and human zzso gene sequences revealed a high degree of conservation in the coding regions and in segments of the untranslated and zzso zzso Seven segments displaying greater than zzso zzso were identified, with the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso unit revealing the highest degree of zzso These zzso regions represents potential zzso control zzso
