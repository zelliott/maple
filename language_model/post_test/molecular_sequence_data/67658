zzso regions of the zzso are recognized by proteins containing zzso zzso zzso specificity toward zzso zzso Although zzso and structural studies revealed basic molecular principles involved in DNA zzso relatively little is known about evolutionary pathways leading to various types of zzso zzso proteins in divergent species of zzso Recently we identified a novel type of zzso protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso zzso zzso very similar to the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso In this study we prepared zzso versions of zzso lacking zzso zzso or both zzso zzso and found that zzso carrying either zzso domain exhibits preferential affinity to both zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the protein binding to zzso DNA revealed that the presence of both zzso zzso is required for a high affinity of zzso to either zzso zzso Additionally, we performed detailed zzso analysis of the zzso interaction with its zzso zzso DNA, which is to our knowledge the first energetic description of a full-length zzso binding to zzso Interestingly, when compared with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited higher affinity not only for zzso zzso zzso but also for human zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso domain region in zzso thus produces a synergistic effect on its affinity toward the zzso zzso zzso alleviating the need for zzso observed in zzso proteins possessing a single zzso zzso
