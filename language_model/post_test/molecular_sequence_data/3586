The zzso and unique zzso binding properties, including blood group zzso zzso and preferential binding to zzso sugar zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso are reported in an accompanying paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Goldstein, zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso fragments were zzso by high performance liquid zzso zzso acid sequence data were obtained for eight zzso Using zzso deduced from the zzso sequences for a reverse zzso a zzso pair zzso was zzso The zzso pair zzso allowed the generation a full-length zzso using zzso and 3' rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that contains a zzso zzso These zzso binding zzso were first described in zzso of bacterial toxins and are also commonly found in zzso zzso Whereas these proteins are known to display a variety of sugar binding zzso none to date are known to share zzso high affinity for zzso and zzso zzso expressed and zzso zzso retains the specificity and affinity observed with the native zzso This study provides the basis for analyzing the underlying cause for the unusual binding specificity of zzso
