zzso zzso D1 is a satellite zzso protein which zzso binds DNA sequences containing runs of AT base zzso zzso zzso this zzso have been isolated from a zzso zzso zzso library by zzso screening with a D1 zzso The deduced sequence of the D1 zzso is zzso zzso acids long and contains 10 copies of a repeating motif consisting of a zzso zzso zzso located within a cluster of basic zzso zzso Three copies of a similar motif have previously been observed in a zzso satellite zzso zzso high mobility group protein I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this motif may be a general feature of proteins which bind zzso satellite DNA and perhaps other zzso DNA as zzso
