Cancer chemotherapy targeted to zzso vessels is expected to cause indirect tumor zzso through the damage of the zzso without the induction of drug zzso To develop a tool for zzso drug delivery, we isolated novel peptides zzso to zzso vessels formed by a zzso air zzso method from a zzso zzso zzso Three distinct zzso clones that markedly accumulated in zzso tumor zzso presented zzso zzso or zzso zzso After the determination of the zzso sequences of these zzso we modified zzso with zzso zzso zzso modified with zzso showed high zzso in zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively suppressed experimental tumor zzso Finally, specific binding of zzso zzso to human zzso zzso cells, and that of zzso zzso to zzso vessels in human tumors, zzso zzso cell tumor and glioblastoma, were zzso The present study indicates the usefulness of zzso as a tool for zzso therapy, a novel zzso of cancer zzso
