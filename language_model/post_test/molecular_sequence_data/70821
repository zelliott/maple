Tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein zzso a putative viral zzso protein zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso which have been suggested to be involved in viral zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso precursors containing these proteins was studied in zzso coli and in zzso The zzso zzso could cleave the precursor proteins and release the predicted mature proteins or intermediate zzso Although processing was detected at all three predicted zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso processing at the zzso zzso site was inefficient, resulting in zzso of the zzso intermediate precursor in zzso coli and in zzso In addition, the presence of the zzso sequence in the precursor resulted in increased zzso at the zzso zzso site in zzso coli and in zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso of the mature zzso zzso from zzso coli extracts and of zzso mature zzso zzso from in zzso translation products revealed the sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso processing at the zzso and zzso zzso sites was not detected upon zzso or deletion of the zzso zzso at the zzso position of the zzso zzso These results are discussed in light of the zzso site specificity of the zzso zzso
