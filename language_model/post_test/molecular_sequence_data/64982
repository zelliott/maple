We isolated a new family of satellite DNA sequences from zzso and zzso zzso DNA of the zzso fish zzso ( zzso zzso The repetitive sequences were organized in tandem zzso of the 174 zzso element, and localized to the zzso regions of all zzso including the Z and W zzso and zzso This zzso pattern was consistent with the distribution of zzso zzso zzso and the satellite DNA sequences occupied zzso of the total zzso as a major component of zzso zzso The sequences were zzso between zzso and zzso in this species, and therefore zzso divergence of the zzso sequences was zzso The 174 zzso element zzso to the zzso DNA of six other zzso species, but not to that of the zzso suggesting that the satellite DNA sequences are zzso in the same family but fairly divergent between the different families in the zzso zzso the zzso satellite zzso were cloned from eight zzso species, and the zzso sequences of 41 zzso fragments were compared within and between zzso zzso zzso relationships of the zzso sequences were highly correlated with both the zzso based on zzso traits and the zzso tree constructed by zzso zzso These results suggest that the satellite DNA sequence has evolved by concerted evolution in the zzso and that it is a good zzso and zzso marker to examine genetic diversity between zzso zzso
