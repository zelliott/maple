We have shown previously that the zzso zzso zzso tail of the zzso coli inner membrane protein zzso can be zzso across the inner membrane in a zzso manner and that its zzso is blocked by the introduction of three positively charged zzso near its zzso end zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and von zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso We have now further analyzed the requirements for zzso of the zzso tail and found that the introduction of even a single zzso can block zzso zzso differences in the effects on zzso of zzso insertions suggest that the zzso end of the zzso tail is more critical for zzso than the central and zzso zzso We also show that the zzso tail is zzso in a zzso zzso where a stop zzso is placed immediately after the first zzso segment, provided that the zzso segment is flanked on its zzso end by positively charged zzso Thus, zzso zzso of a relatively large domain can be induced by a zzso signal located at the extreme C zzso of a zzso
