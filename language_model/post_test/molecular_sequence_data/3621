The importance of certain structural features of the zzso untranslated region of classical zzso fever virus zzso zzso for the function of the internal zzso entry site zzso was investigated by zzso followed by in zzso zzso and zzso zzso made from the zzso end of the zzso zzso sequence showed that the zzso boundary was close to zzso zzso thus, the zzso includes the whole of domain II but no sequences upstream of this zzso zzso which invaded domain II even to a small extent reduced activity to about zzso that of the full-length structure, and this zzso residual activity persisted with more extensive deletions until the whole of domain II had been removed and the deletions invaded the zzso zzso zzso activity fell to zzso The importance of both stems of the zzso was verified by making zzso in both sides of each zzso this severely reduced zzso activity, but the zzso zzso which restored base pairing caused almost full zzso function to be zzso The importance of the length of the loop linking the two stems of the zzso was demonstrated by the finding that a reduction in length from the zzso zzso to zzso almost completely zzso zzso zzso Random zzso zzso in the zzso sequence showed that zzso activity was fairly zzso to the number of A zzso retained in this zzso loop, with a preference for clustered neighboring A zzso rather than dispersed zzso Finally, it was found that the sequence of the highly zzso domain zzso loop is, rather surprisingly, not important for the maintenance of full zzso activity, although zzso of the entire domain zzso stem and loop was highly zzso These results are interpreted in the light of recent models, derived from zzso zzso of the interaction of the closely related zzso C virus zzso with zzso zzso zzso
