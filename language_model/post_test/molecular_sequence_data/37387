zzso sulfur compounds, including hydrogen zzso zzso have been implicated in the development of zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso source for zzso production in zzso zzso Our recent studies have delineated a zzso of zzso metabolism in zzso zzso that releases zzso In this pathway, zzso zzso has been proposed to catalyze the first step of zzso zzso We have cloned the gene of zzso from zzso zzso which contains an open reading frame of 726 zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso Transformation of this gene into zzso coli led to the expression of a zzso zzso After zzso by zzso the zzso protein showed zzso activity typical of zzso catalyzing the degradation of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso releasing zzso acid or zzso and zzso zzso is not a zzso of zzso zzso zzso when added to zzso zzso was able to compete with zzso and inhibit the production of zzso zzso and zzso This was accompanied by the suppression of zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso K zzso However, higher zzso activity was demonstrated in the presence of zzso and zzso Our further experiments showed that the addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso a zzso without significant zzso capacity, drastically increased the zzso of zzso by the zzso producing zzso zzso and zzso This was again accompanied by enhanced bacterial zzso and zzso zzso Together, the results suggest an important role for zzso in zzso metabolism in oral zzso
