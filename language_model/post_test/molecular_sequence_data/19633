The positively charged zzso zzso plays an important role in protein folding and zzso zzso of the charge often has a profound impact on the zzso zzso zzso all the known zzso modifications at zzso have pivotal roles in cell physiology and zzso Here we report the discovery of two novel, in zzso zzso modifications in zzso zzso zzso and zzso We confirmed, by in zzso labeling and zzso mapping by mass zzso that two previously known zzso zzso and zzso zzso could catalyze zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Finally zzso and zzso protein could carry out zzso and zzso in zzso Taken together, our results zzso establish that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are novel zzso zzso Given the unique roles of zzso and zzso in energy metabolism and the significant structural changes induced by the zzso the two modifications are likely to have important but distinct functions in the regulation of biological zzso
