The zzso Aedes aegypti can spread the zzso zzso and yellow fever zzso Thus, the search for key molecules involved in the zzso survival represents today a promising zzso control zzso High zzso Group Box zzso proteins are essential nuclear factors that maintain the zzso structure of zzso keeping zzso cells zzso Outside the nucleus, zzso zzso proteins could alert the innate immune system to foreign zzso and trigger the initiation of host zzso In this work, we cloned and functionally characterized the zzso protein from Aedes aegypti zzso The zzso protein typically consists of two zzso DNA binding zzso and an zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso contains a unique zzso zzso zzso region that seems to be exclusive of zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to the cell nucleus, mainly associated with zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso or the zzso truncated proteins revealed zzso zzso We showed that zzso can effectively bind and change the zzso of DNA, and that the zzso and the zzso zzso regions can zzso its ability to promote DNA zzso as well as its preference to bind zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso completely zzso its DNA zzso zzso Thus, our study shows that a functional zzso protein occurs in Aedes zzso and we provide the first description of a zzso protein containing an zzso regulatory zzso
