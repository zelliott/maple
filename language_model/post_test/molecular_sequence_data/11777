The biological properties and zzso acid sequences of the third variable domain zzso loop and zzso zzso of the zzso region of 34 zzso zzso obtained from Romanian children were zzso zzso zzso acid sequences were obtained from 31 zzso The derived zzso zzso acid sequences were highly zzso zzso and clustered with the zzso zzso F Romanian zzso Five of the 31 zzso presented a zzso zzso in zzso cells and established continuous viral replication in various zzso cell lines zzso zzso The zzso sequence from one of these zzso showed a slightly lesser degree of zzso with the consensus zzso The presence of positively charged zzso acids at positions zzso and 320 has been strongly associated with the ability to induce zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso or zzso zzso acids at these positions are present in zzso zzso zzso zzso There was, however, no correlation between zzso and zzso acid sequence in the five zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso acids were zzso at positions zzso and 320 for all 31 zzso in sequences obtained from zzso A tendency toward a more positive net charge in the zzso loop of zzso zzso was zzso These data confirm the recent observations that zzso zzso from Romania not only cluster in zzso zzso but also show a high degree of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
