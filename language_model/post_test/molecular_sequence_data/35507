The evolutionary arms race between zzso and zzso has long been recognized as one of the oldest zzso zzso Rapid evolution rates in zzso zzso have often made accurate viral age zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso however, integrate into the zzso of their zzso and are subjected to their evolutionary zzso This study zzso for the first time, a zzso zzso predating the divergence of zzso zzso giving it a minimum age of zzso zzso zzso other zzso selfish genetic elements zzso inserted into the zzso zzso provide evidence for the oldest individual zzso zzso repeat and zzso frequency zzso repeat zzso repeats, with the same minimum zzso The combined use of shared zzso and reconstruction of viral zzso defines new limits and increases maximum zzso times, with subsequent implications for the field of zzso
