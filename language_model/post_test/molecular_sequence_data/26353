To find out whether zzso coli heat shock promoters are recognized in zzso zzso the regulatory regions including the heat shock promoters of the main heat shock genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were fused to the indicator genes zzso and zzso Whereas all zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli at low temperature and transient increases of zzso activity could be measured at the inducing temperature, no zzso activity was found in zzso zzso This indicates that zzso coli heat shock promoters are zzso in zzso zzso
