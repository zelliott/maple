zzso nuclear receptors share sequence zzso with members of the nuclear zzso zzso but zzso are unknown or zzso A novel orphan zzso zzso zzso protein 3 zzso was identified by zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso interacting protein 1 zzso as zzso The putative full-length mouse zzso contains zzso zzso acids and is closely related to two known orphan receptors zzso and zzso All the zzso family members share an almost identical zzso domain, which has zzso zzso acid identity with that of zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to an zzso response element and activated reporter genes controlled by zzso response zzso both in zzso and in zzso cells, in the absence of any added zzso A zzso zzso zzso domain located in the zzso domain of zzso was primarily responsible for zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain bound zzso in a zzso manner both in zzso and in zzso through the zzso motifs of zzso and zzso functioned as a zzso zzso for zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in adult mouse was zzso highest expression was observed in heart, zzso and zzso In the mouse zzso no expression was observed at day 7, and highest expression occurred around the 11-15 day zzso Although zzso is much more closely related to zzso than to zzso the expression pattern for zzso was similar to that of zzso and distinct from that for zzso suggesting a unique role for zzso in zzso
