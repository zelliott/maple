A zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso protein was shown to bind specifically to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells by zzso Further analysis by zzso using zzso revealed that zzso also bound specifically to the zzso zzso in addition to the expected zzso zzso However, it did not bind to the zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso with zzso cells lies with the zzso zzso rather than the zzso gene zzso A comparison of the zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso zzso revealed a common zzso acid zzso at position 96, which may form the putative binding zzso of this zzso
