Mouse zzso gene is highly zzso from bacteria to zzso Even though this gene is expressed throughout embryonic development, its biological function is still zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso in zzso zzso neural differentiation of zzso embryonic zzso cells through cooperation with zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso from zzso cell zzso library by a zzso zzso screening using zzso as a zzso This interaction was confirmed by a pull-down zzso and an zzso zzso Although zzso was mainly detected in the zzso the zzso of zzso into the zzso was observed in zzso zzso neural differentiation of zzso cells and enhanced by the enforced expression of zzso Furthermore, enforced expression of sense zzso zzso but not zzso zzso enhanced the neural differentiation of zzso cells accompanying the intense zzso of zzso zzso expression and the rapid induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso could act as a zzso zzso and zzso the zzso repression by zzso These results indicate that zzso implicates in neural differentiation through the cooperation with zzso
