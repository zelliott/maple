Cell penetrating peptides zzso including zzso zzso are attractive tools for the zzso delivery of various zzso molecules with a low membrane zzso We showed that the accelerated zzso delivery of zzso peptides was achieved by the addition of a short zzso segment zzso accelerating zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso release of the zzso zzso zzso was observed within 5 zzso after the treatment of the cells with the peptides even in the presence of zzso zzso of the Pas segment in the zzso delivery of zzso peptides using zzso zzso was exemplified through the enhanced growth zzso activity of the zzso zzso cells by a zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso segment zzso zzso
