zzso displayed random zzso technology has been zzso to identify binding zzso of zzso or zzso zzso 

To zzso peptides from a zzso library which are specifically zzso by zzso in serum from patients with Crohn's disease zzso 

A zzso displayed random zzso library composed of nine zzso acids was established and zzso screened using serum zzso G obtained from CD zzso 

Five different CD specific peptides were isolated from the zzso zzso No zzso in zzso acid sequences was observed among four zzso zzso to zzso of the five peptides exhibiting different binding characteristics with each CD patient's zzso In contrast, two peptides zzso and zzso had similar zzso acid sequences and similar binding zzso Four multiple zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso to zzso were zzso and an zzso linked zzso zzso zzso using the four peptides was developed to detect serum zzso against zzso Fifty two of 92 CD patients zzso were detected by zzso none of 20 zzso colitis zzso patients, only one of 25 zzso zzso patients, and only three of 48 healthy zzso 

zzso using the four peptides isolated in this study may be useful for the differential diagnosis of CD and zzso
