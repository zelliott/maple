The zzso fungus zzso zzso causes vascular zzso of a wide variety of plant zzso zzso zzso produces three kinds of asexual spores, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are formed generally from terminal zzso on zzso and rarely from zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso are formed from zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso with thick walls are developed by the modification of zzso and zzso zzso Here we describe zzso of zzso zzso which zzso regulates the development of zzso zzso and zzso zzso encodes a basic zzso protein with similarity to zzso zzso zzso which has been identified as a zzso regulator controlling zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso was verified by using strains expressing zzso fluorescent protein zzso The zzso zzso exhibited normal zzso formation in zzso However, the zzso lacked zzso and produced zzso at low zzso only from zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to be necessary to induce zzso zzso In contrast, zzso formation was dramatically promoted in the zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a positive regulator and a negative regulator for the development of zzso and zzso respectively, and is zzso for zzso formation in zzso The zzso ability of zzso zzso was not affected by zzso in zzso However, the zzso produced markedly fewer zzso and zzso in infected plants than the wild zzso These results suggest that zzso also has an important role for zzso formation specifically in infected zzso
