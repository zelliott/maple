zzso zzso mapping of zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso gene coding for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is transcribed from two zzso The zzso start site for the upstream promoter zzso zzso was located zzso base pairs from the first zzso of the initiation zzso of zzso whereas the start site for the downstream promoter zzso zzso was 99 base pairs downstream of the zzso start zzso Transcriptions from these promoters were induced by zzso and were not zzso by zzso The promoter regions contained sequences zzso to the consensus sequence recognized by zzso 54 zzso zzso of enteric bacteria and found in promoters of other zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso provided evidence that the zzso gene is transcribed as zzso zzso with an approximate size of zzso zzso
