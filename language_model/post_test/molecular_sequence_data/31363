zzso zzso generated against a family of related nuclear pore complex proteins zzso from rat liver zzso zzso with several proteins in the zzso zzso zzso and show zzso nuclear envelope zzso similar to the pattern seen in zzso zzso We have cloned a gene zzso one of these proteins zzso and have confirmed the zzso of the zzso protein to the pore complex by zzso using an zzso construct to differentiate it from other members of this zzso The zzso protein is essential for cell zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso promoter prevents further cell zzso The central domain of zzso consists of a series of zzso repeats similar to those found in the zzso protein zzso a protein that zzso with zzso zzso against zzso We propose that the repetitive domain is a feature common to the zzso
