Type III zzso zzso zzso zzso the inner ring zzso zzso of T4 and zzso to the inactive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we describe the cloning and characterization of complementary DNA zzso coding for D3 in fish zzso zzso zzso This zzso contains zzso zzso and codes for a protein of 267 zzso zzso including a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso at position zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows zzso identity with frog, chicken, and zzso zzso zzso identity with frog, fish zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso identity with fish zzso chicken, and zzso zzso The 3' zzso contains a putative zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso D3 zzso expressed in zzso cells and native zzso in zzso brain zzso show identical zzso activities, with a strong preference for zzso of zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso zzso of zzso by native and zzso zzso are equally sensitive to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso T4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis using a zzso zzso shows high expression of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso and brain, although D3 activity is much higher in brain than in zzso The characterization of zzso zzso provides new information about the zzso relationship of zzso zzso and an important tool to study the regulation of zzso hormone zzso in zzso
