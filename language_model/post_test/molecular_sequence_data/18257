zzso 6 zzso 6) zzso differentiation of zzso zzso leukemia zzso cells into mature zzso This process is monitored by the sequential appearance of surface zzso induction of zzso zzso and changes in zzso as the cells progress from blast cells to mature zzso zzso is also associated with growth arrest and zzso of the zzso cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso zzso is known to be involved in the growth arrest of zzso cells by inducing zzso zzso zzso We therefore analyzed whether zzso 6 has the potential to trigger the full differentiation program directly or whether its effect on zzso cells is zzso through zzso or through the zzso of genes that are typically induced by zzso We first tested whether zzso 6 could induce zzso zzso Using a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso we found that zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso By Northern analysis we determined that zzso 6 also caused a significant increase in zzso gene zzso zzso 6, however, induced the expression of two zzso species zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso mainly induced the expression of the zzso zzso Enhancement of zzso gene expression by zzso 6 was observed even when protein synthesis was inhibited by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso growth arrest of zzso cells was not inhibited by zzso zzso Thus induction of zzso gene expression is a primary response to zzso and not secondary to the induction of zzso
