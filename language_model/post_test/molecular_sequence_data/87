zzso zzso factors help to control zzso zzso in plants, and zzso expression of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso factor activates the zzso zzso in zzso suggesting the general utility of such factors for zzso engineering of zzso and zzso compounds such as zzso zzso zzso However, zzso does not activate zzso zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso or in alfalfa zzso zzso A related zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene was identified from the zzso of zzso zzso When zzso expressed in transgenic zzso zzso zzso or white zzso zzso induced massive zzso of zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso of zzso zzso compounds with some diagnostic characteristics of zzso also accumulated in zzso plants, but these compounds were not composed of zzso zzso Over 260 and 70 genes were zzso in leaves of alfalfa or zzso zzso respectively, in response to zzso expression of zzso many of which are involved in zzso zzso In particular, the zzso zzso previously identified as showing preference for zzso zzso in zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and appears to function as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic alfalfa resulted in increased zzso zzso when plants were exposed to zzso zzso
