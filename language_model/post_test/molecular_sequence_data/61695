The aim of this paper was to study if zzso strains zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso in wine can degrade zzso via the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso acid bacteria zzso isolated from a typical red wine were investigated for their ability to produce zzso zzso was formed suggesting that the zzso metabolism takes place via the zzso zzso zzso zzso and not via the zzso zzso zzso was also detected with zzso zzso and all the strains examined were able to produce zzso Identification of zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso sequence zzso The strains were further classified as belonging to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the genes zzso for the three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were partially cloned and gene expression was performed at two different pH values zzso and zzso 

The results suggest that zzso production in wine, could be performed by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso may degrade zzso through the zzso zzso
