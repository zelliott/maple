zzso are zzso motor proteins that play roles in a variety of fundamental cellular processes including cell division and the zzso transport of zzso and zzso We zzso zzso and functionally characterized in zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso family, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motor domain of zzso were estimated at zzso zzso for the zzso zzso constant zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed an association of zzso with zzso zzso Because they were rapidly transported to the negative pole of the zzso after zzso treatment, these structures were considered to be associated with zzso zzso To determine the role of the zzso in zzso we produced an zzso zzso strain by zzso zzso interference zzso zzso cells were loaded with the fluorescent zzso zzso to measure zzso free calcium zzso The resting zzso was unchanged in zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso or zzso was not followed by release of zzso These data and the relative importance of the zzso and the zzso zzso pools suggest a lower zzso content in zzso and dysfunctional zzso zzso
