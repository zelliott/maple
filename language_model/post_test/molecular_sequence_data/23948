In zzso sex is determined essentially by two means, genetic factors located on sex zzso and zzso factors such as temperature experienced by the individual during zzso zzso especially zzso are clearly involved in zzso differentiation in zzso zzso In this regard, the expression of the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be zzso in species where temperature can reverse sex zzso especially in our model, the zzso zzso zzso We investigated here the regulation of zzso expression in the brain during sex differentiation in zzso We first isolated a brain zzso of zzso zzso which differs in its zzso untranslated region from the zzso previously isolated from adult zzso In adult zzso the brain zzso is mainly expressed in brain tissue while the other zzso is zzso zzso Thus, regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso could occur by alternative zzso of zzso zzso 1 as previously described in zzso We then investigated zzso expression in the brain of male and female larvae and found no differences with regard to zzso zzso of zzso activity in the brain also showed no differences between sexes at zzso stages whereas activity markedly increases in the zzso zzso with the start of zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso could be a target of a zzso zzso effect in the zzso but not in the zzso
