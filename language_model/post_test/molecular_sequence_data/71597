We compared the efficiency of zzso amplification using zzso containing either a zzso analog or a mismatch at the 3' zzso To determine the distribution of bases inserted opposite eight different zzso 3' analog zzso were used to amplify four different zzso The products from the reactions with the highest amplification efficiency were zzso zzso allowing efficient amplification followed by zzso of a new base at that position are zzso termed zzso The three zzso with the highest amplification efficiency were used to convert sequences containing C, zzso G and A bases into products containing the respective three remaining zzso Nine templates were used to generate conversion products, as well as zzso control products with no base zzso We compared the ability of natural bases to convert specific sites with and without a zzso step using zzso analog zzso zzso products were identified by a zzso detection reaction using zzso specific for the converted zzso We found that zzso resulting in transitions were easier to accomplish than zzso and that sequence context influences zzso Specifically, primer zzso appears to be an important mechanism for producing artifacts via zzso extension of a 3' base or analog zzso base paired to neighboring bases of the zzso zzso zzso could often reduce conversion artifacts and increase the yield of the expected zzso While new zzso are needed to reliably achieve zzso the current set have proven effective for creating transition zzso
