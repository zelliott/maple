The zzso zzso of zzso was identified on the basis of a decrease in the effective quantum yield of zzso II, among a collection of plants subjected to zzso tagging with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso level and the rate of zzso of zzso are significantly altered in zzso zzso The responsible zzso was zzso to zzso one of two zzso genes that zzso zzso E of zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso zzso was identified by reverse zzso In zzso plants, the zzso transcript is expressed at a higher level than zzso zzso In the zzso however, the E1 transcript was barely zzso and was expressed only in small groups of zzso cells resulting from zzso zzso As a consequence, the amount of zzso protein present in the zzso is significantly zzso zzso the levels of other zzso zzso I zzso zzso and zzso are also zzso zzso plants showed a marked increase in light sensitivity and zzso Additional effects of the zzso zzso include light green zzso an increase in zzso zzso and a decrease of approximately 50% in growth rate under greenhouse zzso
