The zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in inflammation and immune zzso Recently, two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

Our aim was to analyze zzso expression and the role of zzso zzso in Crohn's disease zzso 

We determined zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell zzso line zzso after stimulation with zzso zzso as well as in inflamed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso CD zzso by quantitative zzso By restriction zzso length zzso analysis, zzso DNA from 206 patients with CD and 211 unrelated controls was analyzed for the two single zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which result in the zzso and zzso zzso 

All zzso stimuli zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso expression in zzso There was also a significant increase in zzso zzso expression in inflamed zzso of CD patients when compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels correlated highly with zzso zzso expression levels zzso zzso zzso However, there was no difference in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso between CD patients and the control zzso In the CD group, zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso while zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso All zzso zzso were diagnosed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and zzso zzso and had significantly more often zzso involvement more often than patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These associations were independent of the zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of the zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and enhanced in inflamed CD zzso The zzso zzso zzso appears to influence CD zzso and zzso
