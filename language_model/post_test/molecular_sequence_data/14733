The zzso for zzso degradation of zzso was studied in the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso studies with whole cells indicated zzso induction of the capacity to degrade zzso zzso protein profiling zzso of zzso in comparison with zzso or zzso cells revealed the specific abundance increase of zzso protein zzso Their coding genes form distinct clusters on the zzso two of which were assigned to zzso and one to zzso zzso The predicted functions of the gene products agree with a specific zzso degradation zzso in addition to and analogous to the known zzso zzso degradation zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities revealed the electron donor and zzso formation of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was induced in the presence of zzso In zzso zzso analysis of cultures grown with zzso tentatively identified zzso The zzso induced genes were assigned to code for the putative zzso zzso their products display pronounced sequence disparity from the conventional class I zzso zzso which does not accept zzso at the zzso Identification of zzso together with the formation of specific proteins for ring zzso and zzso in zzso cells suggest conservation of the zzso group along the specific zzso degradation zzso
