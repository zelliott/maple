Response of the subsurface soil bacterial community of a uranium mining waste pile to treatments with zzso nitrate over different periods of time was studied under zzso zzso The fate of the added zzso without supplementation with electron donors was investigated as zzso By using zzso zzso gene zzso we demonstrated that incubation with zzso nitrate for 4 weeks resulted in a strong reduction in and even disappearance of some of the most zzso bacterial groups of the original zzso Instead, a strong proliferation of zzso and zzso populations of zzso zzso from zzso and of zzso zzso After longer zzso for 14 weeks with zzso zzso bacterial diversity increased and populations intrinsic to the zzso samples such as zzso and zzso zzso and replaced the zzso zzso zzso This indicated that zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed an increased zzso reduction by increasing the incubation time from four to 14 zzso This result zzso that zzso was used as an electron zzso by the bacterial community established at the later stages of the zzso X-ray zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that no zzso amounts of zzso were reduced to zzso in the time frames of the performed zzso The reason for this observation is possibly due to the low level of electron donors in the studied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that most of the added zzso was bound by organic or zzso zzso zzso both of zzso zzso
