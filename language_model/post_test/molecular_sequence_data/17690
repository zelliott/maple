This critical review considers recent work on zzso in DNA repair capacity in zzso syndrome as a molecular mechanism for this human zzso Four main types of DNA repair deficiencies are zzso These include zzso in the zzso regulation of DNA repair pathways during the cell cycle, failure to enhance DNA repair pathways during cell zzso reduced levels of DNA zzso in zzso syndrome cells, and the identification of zzso repair zzso zzso These deficiencies are considered in relation to the cellular characteristics of zzso syndrome, including delays in DNA zzso zzso and increased zzso of zzso aberrations zzso occurring or observed after exposure to environmental zzso The relationship between DNA repair deficiencies and the genetic basis of zzso syndrome is zzso Previous evidence suggested an zzso zzso mode of inheritance for zzso zzso A discussion is presented as to the molecular mechanism through which an zzso in a single gene could result in multiple DNA repair zzso
