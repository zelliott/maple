zzso factors other than zzso have been reported to be associated with the outcome of organ zzso Because binding of zzso to its zzso zzso could play an important role in zzso and in the death of graft zzso zzso cells during kidney zzso zzso a gene zzso recently identified in position zzso in the promoter of the zzso gene coding for zzso was investigated in zzso 

A zzso study was performed within a cohort of zzso adult patients who had received zzso kidney transplants based on the occurrence or absence of acute cellular rejection in the first 6 months after zzso zzso Each recipient from the acute rejection group zzso zzso zzso was matched for age zzso 5 zzso and number of zzso zzso with two recipients within the zzso rejection group zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was more frequent in donors in the group without rejection zzso In contrast, patients who received a kidney from a zzso carrier were more likely to experience acute rejection episodes zzso risk nearly zzso 

This study suggests that donor zzso zzso directly or indirectly influences acute kidney rejection zzso
