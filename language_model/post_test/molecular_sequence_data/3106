zzso is a member of a zzso family and encodes a zzso zzso that mediates zzso resistance to strains of zzso zzso zzso tomato expressing zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso from both resistant zzso to zzso and susceptible zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggested that most could zzso functional zzso zzso In addition, the zzso segments of the zzso are similar in sequence to that of zzso and some have zzso previously identified as required for binding of zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso were therefore characterized for transcription, for the ability of their products to interact with zzso in the zzso zzso system, for their zzso activity, and for their potential to elicit cell death in the presence of and absence of a zzso as well as their dependence on zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not transcribed at levels zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso The interaction with zzso was unique to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso as a fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso in zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in their zzso loop caused cell death in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso acid zzso in the zzso loop also zzso cell death in zzso this was dependent on the presence of zzso zzso zzso some zzso could potentially zzso functional resistance zzso zzso induced cell death specifically in response to expression of zzso in tobacco in a zzso manner; this is consistent with a zzso from a zzso zzso zzso a minor recognition zzso
