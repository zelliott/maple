We investigated the role of zzso oxide zzso in the expression of zzso zzso in the human melanoma cell line, zzso Three NO donors, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all caused an increase in both zzso protein zzso and promoter zzso zzso of the promoter showed that 101 zzso of the zzso zzso region zzso to the zzso start site are sufficient for the response to zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso B and zzso binding sites led to a significant decrease in zzso promoter zzso The zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso promoter activity by zzso zzso of excess zzso but not zzso partially reversed the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that NO is an zzso regulator of zzso production in zzso melanoma zzso
