zzso zzso strain 11 of zzso A contains a gene called the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not required for viral replication but is required for in zzso zzso and for the zzso capacity of the zzso To assess the effects of sequence variation on zzso function, zzso genes from six zzso A zzso were cloned and zzso zzso comparisons revealed extensive zzso acid zzso within the central region, but the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were well zzso zzso acid identities varied from 73 to zzso among all zzso zzso The highly zzso zzso motif at zzso acid zzso 115 to 118 was preceded by zzso charged zzso acid zzso and thus matched very well the consensus sequence for binding to zzso zzso of zzso family zzso The zzso of these zzso A strains were shown to associate with cellular zzso and to be an in zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso showed that binding to zzso zzso required the zzso zzso at zzso showing that zzso is a likely binding motif for zzso Also, zzso zzso of zzso by zzso led to subsequent binding to zzso and zzso in zzso Thus, the association of zzso with zzso is likely to be important for zzso transformation by zzso A strains of zzso zzso
