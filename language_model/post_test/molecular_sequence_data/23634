zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are composite zzso consisting of calcium zzso and zzso These zzso are part of the gravity and linear acceleration detection system of the inner zzso zzso in zzso 1 have been shown to result in lack of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The molecular function of zzso 1, a novel protein that contains ten predicted zzso zzso however, has remained zzso Here we show that a zzso in the zzso gene in zzso is responsible for the complete absence of zzso in zzso zzso We examined the zzso of zzso a zzso protein that is highly abundant in zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein accumulated within cells of the zzso zzso indicating a possible zzso in zzso Our data suggest that zzso 1 in zzso may be involved in the protein trafficking of components required for formation of zzso in the zzso
