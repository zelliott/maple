The zzso zzso forms of zzso African zzso are uniquely susceptible to killing by small zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso by zzso zzso and charge distribution and results from increased rigidity of the plasma zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso suggests a mechanism of zzso clamping in which an internal zzso zzso anchors the zzso in the membrane and positively charged zzso at the zzso coordinate zzso of the polar zzso zzso This mechanism reveals a necessary zzso in zzso form African zzso high membrane zzso and we suggest that targeting the plasma membrane zzso zzso as a whole may be a novel strategy for the development of new pharmaceutical zzso Additionally, the peptides we have described may be valuable tools for probing the zzso machinery responsible for the unique composition and characteristics of African zzso plasma zzso
