The zzso zzso protein was discovered by virtue of its role in zzso zzso in zzso To help determine the role of zzso in zzso we attempted to zzso the protein in zzso zzso However, cells with a zzso zzso zzso although expressing elevated amounts of zzso zzso show little increase in the level of the zzso zzso indicating that a zzso mechanism limits zzso zzso This control depends on an zzso element of zzso Using a genetic selection for zzso with increased expression of zzso fusion zzso we identified zzso in a novel zzso designated zzso zzso is essential and encodes a zzso protein with sequence similarity to a zzso of an zzso of the zzso zzso from bovine zzso called zzso Earlier work indicated that the zzso zzso associates with a zzso regulatory factor, resulting in a zzso zzso complex that degrades zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells have severe defects in the degradation of such zzso and accumulate zzso zzso Most importantly, we show zzso that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso These data provide evidence for the involvement of the zzso zzso in the degradation of zzso proteins in zzso and for a close relationship between zzso and the regulatory complexes within the zzso zzso and they directly demonstrate that zzso is a component of the zzso zzso zzso
