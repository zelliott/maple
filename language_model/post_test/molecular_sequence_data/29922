zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso protein zzso forms a complex zzso with zzso sequences and the cellular zzso factor zzso which has been implicated as an intermediate in the zzso of gene expression by zzso To examine structural requirements within zzso for this interaction, we analyzed extracts of zzso cells that express zzso zzso proteins by gel zzso zzso and identified two regions in the primary sequence of zzso which are necessary for in zzso assembly of zzso The zzso boundary for complex assembly and trans zzso mapped between zzso 49 and zzso At the zzso zzso deletion as far as zzso 388 did not affect in zzso zzso zzso although zzso activity was zzso zzso beyond zzso 388 rapidly impaired the ability of the protein to participate in the zzso complex, such that a truncated zzso of 380 zzso was completely zzso These requirements towards the zzso zzso overlap a region of strong local sequence similarity between zzso and terminal protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although substitution of corresponding zzso zzso into zzso failed to produce a functional zzso zzso zzso within the region of similarity identified a number of zzso zzso proteins which were completely deficient for zzso zzso These zzso proteins were also unable to trans activate expression from zzso zzso despite the integrity of the zzso zzso zzso The extreme sensitivity of both zzso formation and trans zzso to zzso zzso within this region of zzso suggests that it is directly involved in the zzso or zzso interactions required for assembly of a zzso complex containing zzso
