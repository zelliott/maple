In zzso protein sequence and structure, standardized zzso schemes allow comparison of features without explicit zzso This has proved particularly valuable in the case of zzso The most widely used schemes zzso zzso zzso zzso differ only in the zzso of the zzso determining regions zzso We have analyzed the numbered zzso in the widely used zzso database and found that approximately zzso of entries contain errors or zzso Further analysis of sequence alignments in the context of structure suggest that the sites of the insertions in some framework regions in the zzso and zzso schemes are zzso We therefore propose a corrected version of the zzso scheme which is structurally correct throughout the zzso and zzso To perform this analysis, we have developed, and made available, a tool for the automatic application of zzso zzso and zzso zzso schemes and have carefully zzso the performance of this zzso
