A plethora of both experimental and zzso methods have been proposed in the past 20 years for the identification of hot spots at a zzso zzso The experimental determination of a zzso complex followed by zzso scanning zzso though able to determine hot spots with much precision, is expensive and has no guarantee of success while the accuracy of the current zzso methods for zzso identification remains zzso Here, we present a novel zzso zzso approach that accurately determines hot spots through zzso into a set of proteins zzso to only one of the two interacting partners of a compound capable of zzso the zzso interaction zzso This approach has been applied to identify the hot spots of human zzso zzso type II zzso critical for its binding toward zzso The subsequent experimental confirmation of the zzso identified hot spots zzso a potentially accurate method for zzso determination in zzso given a compound capable of zzso the zzso in zzso The hot spots of human zzso first reported here may well become the focal points for the design of small zzso drugs that target the zzso The determination of their interface may have significant biological implications in that it suggests that zzso plays an important role in both zzso and zzso signal zzso
