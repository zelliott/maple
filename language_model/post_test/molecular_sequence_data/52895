The breast and zzso cancer zzso gene product zzso is a tumor zzso but its precise zzso function remains zzso The zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso domain, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region abolish zzso zzso whereas benign zzso do zzso These results raise the possibility that loss of zzso zzso by zzso is crucial for zzso zzso identification of zzso involved in zzso zzso by zzso will help understand why particular zzso zzso zzso are deleterious and may provide more reliable zzso risk zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso consists of two zzso preceded by a region likely to be zzso We combined zzso and random zzso followed by a functional zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso random zzso generated eight unique zzso zzso causing loss of function, six of which targeted zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso random zzso of a variable zzso cassette generated 21 zzso zzso All zzso insertions zzso to the zzso retained zzso activity, whereas insertions in the zzso were, with few exceptions, zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize five known zzso zzso and to perform deletion analysis of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the integrity of the most zzso zzso cluster zzso zzso and zzso is necessary for zzso We conclude that the integrity of the zzso zzso is crucial for zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may be important for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso can be used successfully to provide tools for zzso analysis of zzso and may form the basis of a zzso functional zzso
