A DNA zzso which carries the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been isolated by zzso of an zzso coli zzso zzso This zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso not only the zzso zzso zzso zzso but also the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the essential part of the zzso gene and its zzso regions was zzso This sequence contains an open reading frame of 371 zzso from which a protein having a Mr zzso zzso can be zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence and its zzso usage were compared with those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned DNA will be a useful marker when transforming zzso zzso
