The zzso microbial diversity of zzso was analyzed in order to examine the zzso behavior of zzso Six zzso samples were zzso five from zzso and zzso zzso zzso treating different zzso and one from zzso zzso microscopic counts reveal that with zzso zzso zzso only one per one thousand billion were zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Unit) zzso zzso zzso Strand zzso zzso shows that microbial communities in the zzso were not just a rough copy of zzso zzso microbial communities and zzso that all zzso are not equally zzso by zzso To assess the difference occurring in zzso 675 zzso zzso zzso DNA were analyzed and compared to published zzso zzso microbial zzso zzso show that zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups were zzso whereas zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as strictly zzso and occasionally zzso species presented high levels of zzso Finally, zzso belonging to zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent zzso zzso with similar zzso in zzso and zzso zzso microbial zzso
