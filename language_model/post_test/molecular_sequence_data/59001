We describe a new highly zzso DNA marker zzso the human zzso zzso gene zzso at zzso band zzso The marker is composed of a zzso zzso zzso a compound zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso mapping of previously published markers from zzso helped to integrate the genetic and physical maps of this zzso Together with zzso the new zzso forms a pair of markers closely zzso either side of the zzso gene which may be useful for linkage studies in families susceptible to zzso zzso and central core zzso
