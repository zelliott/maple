The seven class 2 zzso zzso that are alpha 2 zzso have previously been divided by sequence zzso into class zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and class zzso zzso zzso and zzso It has been more difficult to zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have different zzso zzso and which did not apparently contain all three zzso class 2 zzso New sequence and structural information relating to the three problematic zzso will be discussed permitting a step forward to be taken in the understanding of the evolutionary relationships between the class 2 zzso
