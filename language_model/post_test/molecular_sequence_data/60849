Free zzso have been implicated in the zzso of experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso are stable zzso with a zzso activity, which exert an zzso effect in various animal models of zzso damage and zzso such as experimental colitis and head zzso We examined the use of the zzso mimic zzso zzso zzso to suppress zzso Adult male Lewis rats were zzso with 125 zzso synthetic human retinal zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso toxin was simultaneously zzso Beginning on Day 6, rats were injected with a daily zzso dose of 35, 175 or 350 zzso of the zzso zzso Control rats received zzso normal zzso The animals were examined daily, and on the 19th day the eyes were zzso zzso protein zzso and retinal zzso zzso product levels zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso sections were stained and examined zzso zzso was found to penetrate the zzso humor zzso Beginning on day 12, rats developed a severe zzso zzso in the treatment group had a lower mean clinical and zzso score than that of zzso zzso of zzso humor zzso retinal zzso zzso and zzso were all significantly lower in the treatment zzso This effect was more pronounced with the lower zzso zzso We conclude that zzso reduces clinical, zzso and zzso severity of zzso induced zzso in Lewis zzso This effect is probably zzso by removal of zzso zzso but other mechanisms may also be zzso
