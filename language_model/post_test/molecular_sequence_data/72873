Details of the interactions between the human zzso virus zzso reverse zzso and zzso DNA were zzso both by introducing zzso and zzso modifications into DNA and by altering the structure of potential critical zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing R and S zzso of zzso oxide at zzso were zzso with two additional zzso to create zzso that served as templates for zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso that primed synthesis 5 bases 3' to the zzso could be extended up to 1 base 3' and opposite the zzso However, when the positions of the zzso of the zzso zzso were placed 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 bases downstream of the zzso oxide zzso zzso replication was zzso only to be blocked after incorporating 4, 5, 6, and 7 bases beyond the zzso The sites of this zzso termination corresponded to the position of the DNA where zzso H makes contact with the DNA minor groove, 3-5 bases upstream of the growing 3' zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso in zzso H zzso and zzso alter the termination probabilities caused by these DNA zzso suggesting that zzso H is a sensitive monitor of modifications in the minor groove of newly zzso zzso DNA several bases zzso to the zzso
