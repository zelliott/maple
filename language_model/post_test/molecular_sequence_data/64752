Major royal jelly proteins (named zzso of zzso zzso zzso yellow proteins of zzso together with putative proteins found in several bacteria, form a protein family termed the zzso zzso Members of the family exert diverse zzso functions and amongst zzso appear to be restricted to the order zzso zzso constitute about zzso of total protein of royal zzso which is zzso by nurse bees to feed the queen and growing zzso We looked for zzso and yellow zzso in a zzso brain expressed sequence tags zzso zzso In addition to the five zzso zzso previously zzso we found three additional zzso zzso novel zzso and importantly, two zzso coding for zzso of zzso yellow zzso One yellow zzso and all three zzso coding for the novel zzso were assembled completely, the sequence of the other yellow zzso was partially zzso The data we present here supports the view that repeated zzso and functional divergence occurred during the evolution of zzso in zzso with even closely related zzso appearing to perform diverse zzso zzso zzso yellow protein zzso appear to be zzso and thus candidates for maintaining the former zzso of yellow zzso
