We report a detailed characterization of cell division cycle zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A large set of zzso zzso zzso was isolated after treatment with the chemical zzso zzso Analysis of independently isolated zzso at the zzso temperature identified a variety of zzso terminal zzso including long zzso cells blocked at various stages of the cell division cycle and two unusual classes of zzso with defects in both cell growth and zzso The latter strains are zzso arrested as either short zzso coils or large zzso zzso The polar zzso of these zzso zzso supports the hypothesis that normal cell cycle progression is directly responsible for zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso and physical mapping of the conditional zzso zzso and the previously characterized zzso and zzso zzso identified at least 21 genes that are required for normal cell cycle zzso Although most of these genes are widely scattered, the genetically linked zzso zzso and zzso genes were shown by genetic zzso and physical mapping to be organized in one gene cluster at zzso units on the zzso DNA sequence analysis and marker rescue experiments demonstrated that zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso gene maps immediately adjacent to zzso On the basis of these results, we suggest that the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster zzso to the zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso
