zzso of zzso infections requires a robust zzso zzso method for efficient zzso A molecular zzso zzso multiplex real-time zzso system was developed to detect 15 high-risk zzso types 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, zzso and 5 low-risk zzso types zzso types 6, 11, 42, 43, zzso zzso zzso detecting high-risk types are zzso molecular zzso for low-risk detection are zzso while the internal control added before sample DNA extraction is detected by a zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso fluorescent data for zzso detection are collected at zzso zzso for high-risk types, zzso zzso in case of low-risk types and the reaction internal control is detected at 610 zzso on a Roche zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity for detected types varies between 22 and 700 zzso The clinical performance was tested on 161 clinical sample zzso The zzso zzso results were compared to the typing results obtained by the zzso zzso and zzso system described zzso and the zzso rate between the two systems was zzso The favorable characteristics shown by this multiplex zzso real-time zzso detection system make this promising approach worthy for further development and application for clinical zzso
