To determine if a zzso group called zzso has an important role in zzso motor function, we made a zzso heavy zzso zzso without the zzso group and analyzed its zzso In chicken gizzard myosin, zzso is located on the zzso zzso at position zzso By using genetic engineering techniques, this zzso was zzso with zzso in chicken gizzard zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso quantities using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso were similar to those of zzso whose zzso was modified by zzso zzso However, while the chemically modified zzso lost the function of the light chain zzso regulation of the zzso zzso activity, the zzso zzso exhibited the normal light zzso zzso zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso system, we found that the zzso zzso was unable to propel zzso filaments but that the zzso zzso was able to move zzso filaments in a manner indistinguishable from filament sliding generated by zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso itself is not essential for the motor function of zzso and suggest that various effects observed with zzso modified by zzso zzso such as zzso are caused by the zzso of the attached zzso which interferes with the swinging motion generated during zzso zzso
