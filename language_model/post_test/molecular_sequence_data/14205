A gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that encodes a putative zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by targeted gene disruption in combination with comprehensive product zzso Studies of the features of a corresponding zzso zzso allowed us to demonstrate that zzso is responsible for the synthesis of a new zzso compound, named zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso was established by extensive zzso and zzso zzso including low- and high-resolution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso domain zzso and the chemical structure of zzso we proposed that zzso of this compound requires the zzso of a zzso and an zzso unit, followed by zzso or reductive zzso and zzso removal of zzso zzso zzso of the pure zzso further displayed zzso against an oral cavity zzso cancer cell zzso
