The zzso of cone snails zzso zzso is a rich source of peptides exhibiting a wide variety of biological zzso Several of these zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and belong to the zzso zzso zzso C and the recently described zzso zzso Here we describe the discovery and characterization of two zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their primary structure was determined by zzso degradation, zzso analysis and by a zzso based zzso These peptides show close structural zzso to the zzso zzso and -C zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and are zzso (about zzso of similar or identical peptides with 49 zzso acid zzso and a characteristic arrangement of ten zzso zzso zzso These novel types of zzso specifically block zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Due to their high zzso these new zzso may provide a tool to decipher the zzso and function of the various zzso zzso
