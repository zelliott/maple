zzso and concentration of peptides using reverse phase zzso zzso zzso material based on zzso interaction is a routine approach used in mass zzso zzso zzso However, zzso detection of small zzso zzso in particular, zzso that bear multiple negative charges, is challenging due to the insufficient binding to zzso stationary zzso We described here the development of a new zzso method that takes the unique properties of zzso zzso The presence of positively charged nitrogen atoms under zzso conditions and zzso bonds in zzso provide a prospect for enhanced zzso of zzso or zzso peptides through extra zzso and zzso stacking interactions in addition to zzso zzso In tandem with reversed phase zzso zzso material, the new type of zzso method termed as zzso can significantly improve the zzso detection of zzso with multiple zzso groups and other small zzso zzso It has been applied to not only zzso digest of model proteins but also the analysis of complex zzso of zzso zzso The number of detected zzso groups on a zzso ranged from 1 to zzso zzso zzso based method can also be used in basic zzso Thus it provides a useful means to handle peptides that may not be zzso in zzso zzso It can be envisioned that the zzso should be able to facilitate the exploration of large scale zzso
