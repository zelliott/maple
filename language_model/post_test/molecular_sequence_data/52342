The zzso alpha zzso of zzso zzso II contains the 11 zzso zzso characteristic of all protein zzso zzso II and zzso are involved in zzso binding and zzso Two zzso of the alpha zzso zzso (in domain zzso and zzso (in domain zzso were changed to zzso and zzso the zzso present in more than zzso of the identified protein zzso zzso These changes altered the selectivity of the alpha zzso for zzso and zzso The zzso zzso showed an increase in the zzso value for zzso from 45 to 71 zzso while the zzso value for zzso decreased from 13 to 9 zzso The zzso value for zzso with the zzso zzso showed a decrease from 13 to 7 zzso A double zzso of zzso showed the combined effects, with a zzso of 6 zzso for zzso and 70 zzso for zzso zzso of zzso to zzso an zzso acid which is not present in the corresponding position of any known protein zzso resulted in a lack of zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso also altered the interaction of the alpha zzso with the regulatory beta zzso In contrast to the zzso alpha zzso which was zzso zzso by addition of the beta zzso the zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso by the beta zzso while the zzso zzso was zzso only zzso All of the zzso zzso were similar in molecular weight to the native zzso The stimulation of the zzso activity toward zzso B by zzso and zzso which is zzso by the beta zzso was similar for zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso alpha zzso zzso binding of the beta zzso appears to alter the active site of the alpha zzso directly or indirectly by inducing a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to change the structure of the alpha zzso sufficiently so that interaction of the zzso is altered and the zzso effect of the beta zzso is reduced or zzso
