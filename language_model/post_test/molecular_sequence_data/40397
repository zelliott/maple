zzso and zzso studies were performed on three strains of an zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso The zzso stained zzso and was a zzso rod that was zzso by zzso zzso The novel strains had an optimum pH for growth of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol, zzso and zzso as growth zzso zzso was produced from zzso zzso zzso and ethanol were produced from zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that the novel strains formed a new zzso in the family zzso zzso cluster zzso of the low zzso zzso bacteria of the class zzso The DNA zzso base composition was 34 zzso Cell wall analysis revealed the existence of a novel zzso zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso with a variation containing zzso zzso Based on zzso and zzso evidence, it is proposed that the new zzso represent a novel zzso and species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso
