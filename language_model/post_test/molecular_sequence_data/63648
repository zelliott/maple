zzso cells in animals are engulfed by zzso cells and subsequently zzso inside zzso To study the mechanisms controlling the degradation of zzso cells, we developed zzso imaging protocols in developing zzso zzso zzso and established the zzso order of multiple events during zzso and zzso zzso These include sequential enrichment on zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell death abnormal 1 zzso large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso as well as the incorporation of zzso and zzso to zzso Two parallel genetic pathways are known to control the zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso in each zzso not only delay or block zzso but also delay the degradation of engulfed zzso zzso One of the zzso composed of zzso the zzso protein zzso and zzso controls the rate of enrichment of zzso and zzso on zzso surfaces and the formation of zzso We further identified an essential role of zzso in promoting the recruitment and fusion of zzso to zzso We propose that zzso functions as a downstream zzso of the zzso zzso to mediate zzso zzso Our work suggests that zzso zzso which were thought to act specifically in initiating zzso also control zzso maturation through the sequential zzso of multiple zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
