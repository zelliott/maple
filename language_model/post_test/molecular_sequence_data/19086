Plasma membrane zzso helps determine the identity of this membrane and plays a key role in signal zzso as the precursor of zzso and its zzso Here, we report the atomic structure of the protein scaffold that is required for the plasma membrane zzso and function of zzso the zzso zzso responsible for this zzso zzso Both proteins of the scaffold, zzso and zzso are composed of zzso repeats, which are arranged into a rod in zzso and a zzso in zzso A zzso basic patch in zzso which binds zzso zzso anchors the complex to the plasma zzso zzso is recruited by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso which also binds to zzso regions in the zzso C zzso zzso of this zzso region zzso zzso zzso thus providing a mechanism through which zzso zzso and thus a zzso reaction of fundamental importance in cell zzso can be zzso
