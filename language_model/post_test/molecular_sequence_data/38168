The zzso element zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso factor that is essential for zzso In mouse zzso several zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso In contrast to the situation for the zzso however, little is known about zzso zzso in the zzso zzso We analyzed zzso zzso and zzso expression in a clinically relevant zzso model, the zzso monkey zzso zzso A zzso library was generated from monkey zzso and two zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso were identified, which displayed high sequence identity to mouse and human zzso The zzso of zzso gamma was observed for the first time in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was confined to the zzso where it was seen in late zzso zzso and round zzso in specific zzso zzso as revealed by in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and the recently described protein expression indicated a lack of zzso delay of zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso zzso expression by reverse zzso chain reaction yielded several transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso two transcripts in zzso and zzso zzso and one transcript in zzso These findings suggest an evolutionary trend from multiple zzso zzso to a single zzso transcript in zzso
