The effect of standard agricultural management on the genetic zzso of nitrous oxide zzso zzso fragments from zzso zzso in native and cultivated soil was zzso zzso soil zzso were zzso from each of the two soil management zzso zzso gene fragments were amplified from zzso samples, and zzso products were cloned and screened by restriction zzso length zzso zzso The total zzso zzso profiles increased in similarity with soil sample size until zzso zzso samples produced visually identical zzso profiles for each zzso Large differences in total zzso profiles were observed between the native and cultivated zzso The fragments representing major groups of clones encountered at least twice and four randomly selected clones with unique zzso patterns were zzso to verify zzso zzso The sequence diversity of zzso clones from the cultivated field was higher, and only eight patterns were found in clone libraries from both zzso among the 182 distinct zzso zzso patterns identified from the two zzso A group of clones that comprised zzso of all clones dominated the gene library of native soil, whereas many minor groups were observed in the gene library of cultivated zzso The zzso confidence intervals of the zzso zzso richness zzso for zzso zzso data did not zzso indicating that the levels of species richness are significantly different in the two soils, the cultivated soil having higher zzso zzso analysis of deduced zzso acid sequences grouped the majority of zzso clones into an zzso Michigan soil cluster whose cultured members are zzso Only four zzso sequences from cultivated soil and one from the native soil were related to sequences found in zzso zzso from the native field formed a zzso closely related cluster zzso zzso zzso containing zzso of the native zzso zzso from the cultivated field were more zzso related to each other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found outside of the cluster from the native soil, further indicating a difference in the two zzso Overall, there appears to be a relationship between use and zzso diversity, and the zzso position of zzso zzso indicating that agricultural use of soil caused a shift to a more diverse zzso zzso
