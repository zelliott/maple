The zzso zzso zzso and related species are zzso food-borne pathogens of zzso The muscle zzso stage of this zzso establishes a chronic infection in skeletal muscle cells of humans who acquire zzso Muscle larvae also reside in skeletal muscles of animals, zzso in particular, and other food animals, including game zzso These muscle larvae are the source of zzso transmission to zzso Once established, muscle larvae become less susceptible to zzso that are effective against other stages of the zzso Very little information exists to guide discovery of new drug targets and improved methods of eliminating muscle larvae established in muscle cells of humans or food zzso Here we discuss progress that has been made on sequencing the zzso of zzso zzso This informational resource should prove valuable for zzso molecular characteristics of this zzso that warrant investigation as targets for zzso The availability of the zzso zzso zzso has made possible the comparison of zzso from zzso that span the evolutionary extremes of the zzso zzso We describe a zzso comparison of zzso that is zzso This comparative zzso approach is expected to identify molecular characteristics that are zzso among all zzso and hence zzso to zzso pathogens throughout the zzso including species from the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression data for muscle larvae has been integrated with zzso sequences to identify specific genes and proteins with relevance to control of this stage of the zzso Examples are discussed in which zzso information may advance understanding of zzso zzso biology and new methods for treating infections by this zzso
