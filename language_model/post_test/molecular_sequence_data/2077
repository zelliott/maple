We have identified a zzso zzso B, zzso a nuclear protein of 338 zzso acids presenting a zzso zzso with zzso whose expression is activated during zzso zzso Growth factor stimulation of zzso cells leads to a rapid and transient zzso of zzso B zzso with zzso similar to those of zzso The induction of zzso B zzso levels is in part due to a dramatic increase in the zzso of the zzso The zzso of zzso B zzso is in the order of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso stability are substantially increased in the presence of protein synthesis zzso zzso studies showed that zzso B as zzso zzso forms a complex in zzso with zzso and zzso B proteins in the absence of a target binding zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso B protein positively influences the binding of zzso and zzso B proteins to an zzso binding consensus zzso suggesting that zzso B protein plays a role in control of gene zzso
