zzso protein of 14 zzso zzso has previously been identified only in zzso Here we report the identification and expression of an zzso zzso zzso named zzso the first such data in a zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso open reading frame coding for a zzso protein with a calculated molecular weight of 14 zzso It shares zzso identity with human zzso and possesses a highly zzso motif zzso zzso comparison suggests the evolutionary appearance of the zzso organization of zzso genes after the split of zzso which is highly zzso since zzso zzso has been successfully expressed in zzso coli and zzso The zzso protein exhibited features characteristic of human zzso including a zzso activity towards zzso Both in zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso was expressed in a zzso manner, with the most abundant expression in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso plays a fundamental but zzso role, or alternatively reflects differences in the tissue zzso to zzso zzso
