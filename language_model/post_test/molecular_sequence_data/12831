zzso involving the zzso region zzso are a zzso zzso zzso in frequent benign tumors mainly of zzso origin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso Mostly, these zzso abnormalities occur as a result of zzso also affecting zzso region zzso In addition to the frequent tumors mentioned above, these abnormalities have also been found in rare zzso tumors, zzso zzso Although recently the molecular basis of the aberrations of zzso region zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso gene has been identified, the molecular roots of the zzso changes still remain to be zzso zzso we report on 3' rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso results on zzso from a primary zzso zzso As an zzso sequence fused to zzso 3 of the zzso zzso we have identified a zzso sequence that revealed zzso zzso to zzso 13 of the human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso Because zzso 2 maps to zzso this fusion transcript is a good candidate underlying the zzso zzso involving zzso
