zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a drinking water treatment plant zzso zzso zzso tap water zzso zzso zzso cup zzso for dental chairs zzso zzso zzso and a water zzso filter zzso zzso zzso The bacterial zzso were identified based on analysis of the zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso variation was assessed on the basis of zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso were identified as members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The patterns of zzso to five classes of antibiotics were analyzed and compared for the different sites of isolation and zzso zzso zzso resistance was observed to be intrinsic zzso The highest zzso resistance prevalence values were observed in members of the zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso In tap water and in water from dental chairs, zzso resistance was more prevalent than in the other samples, mainly due to the predominance of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso These two zzso presented distinct patterns of association with zzso resistance, suggesting different paths of resistance zzso zzso resistance patterns were often related to the species rather than to the site or strain, suggesting the importance of vertical resistance transmission in these zzso This is the first study demonstrating that members of the family zzso are potential reservoirs of zzso resistance in drinking zzso
