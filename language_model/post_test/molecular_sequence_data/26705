zzso quality of forest zzso is among the major factors leading to a loss of zzso zzso zzso However, there is little information about how this factor influences the diversity of zzso zzso which do not grow over living trees and could be less susceptible to such zzso In this work we describe the genetic diversity of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso from three zzso at the zzso Natural Park zzso del zzso southern zzso which represent different conservation zzso native zzso zzso zzso zzso native zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In both forest zzso a higher diversity and a higher number of unique zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso In contrast, in the zzso the diversity was lower and the zzso species were mostly zzso The presence of unique zzso and the higher diversity of zzso in native forest areas highlight the importance of their preservation, indicating that decreasing forest quality also has a negative impact on zzso zzso zzso
