A two-dimensional zzso gel zzso study of zzso zzso strain zzso identified 20 proteins that are strongly induced in response to zzso zzso The induction of nine of these zzso zzso proteins was dependent on a functional zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso component of a zzso zzso regulatory system which, together with its partner response regulator zzso controls the expression of genes in the zzso zzso Genes zzso zzso zzso proteins are therefore likely to be members of the zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso the response regulator of the signal zzso zzso required for the induction of zzso has previously been shown to zzso affect the induction of the zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso The induction pattern of some zzso zzso proteins was altered in a zzso zzso such that their synthesis continued for longer than was found with the zzso The most abundant zzso zzso zzso was characterized by zzso sequencing of internal zzso fragments and shown to have a high similarity to an zzso coli protein which is involved in zzso zzso during zzso zzso
