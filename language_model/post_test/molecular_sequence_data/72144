The two groups of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso zzso to zzso due to point zzso in the consensus sequences of their zzso The different versions of promoters from zzso and zzso were cloned upstream of the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso and their relative strengths were determined in zzso coli and in zzso zzso The three different zzso in the zzso zzso promoters resulted in a zzso to zzso increase in zzso activity compared to that of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the first base of the zzso consensus sequence caused a greater increase in the promoter strength of the zzso promoter than the two other principal zzso (a zzso transition of the fifth base of the zzso consensus sequence and a zzso zzso of the fourth base of the zzso zzso The strength of the promoter carrying a double zzso zzso in the zzso box and the zzso in the zzso zzso was increased zzso to zzso in comparison to that of the zzso zzso A change from 17 to 16 zzso between the zzso and zzso consensus sequences resulted in a zzso decrease of the promoter zzso The expression of the zzso promoter in zzso coli differs from that in zzso zzso particularly for promoters carrying strong zzso Furthermore, the zzso promoter appears not to be controlled by DNA zzso or an upstream curved DNA, but it is dependent on the gene copy zzso
