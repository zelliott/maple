zzso beta zzso zzso represent a large group zzso zzso of zzso related to members of the zzso zzso family, that are abundant in zzso tissue and in the zzso of pregnant zzso We describe the isolation and characterization of two additional zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose transcripts are largely expressed in zzso tissue and to a lesser extent in some other cell types, including zzso cells differentiated to zzso zzso and zzso are representatives of two distinct classes of zzso protein that have zzso with or without the zzso motif implicated in zzso In addition to this distinction at the zzso acid level, our analysis of several zzso zzso suggests that the zzso units zzso these proteins may be further distinguished in their 3' untranslated zzso thus suggesting possibilities for zzso regulation of the two major protein zzso
