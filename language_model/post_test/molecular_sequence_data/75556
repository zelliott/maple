The zzso sequences of zzso sequences zzso (left) and zzso (right), present as direct terminal repeats in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso by zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were zzso The three zzso elements zzso zzso and zzso were zzso base pairs long and identical in DNA zzso zzso had zzso terminal zzso repeats with three bases mismatched and one long open reading frame zzso zzso zzso that was proposed to be a zzso Three zzso of zzso zzso and about 10,000 molecular weight, determined by zzso were identified in zzso Since zzso generates a zzso repeat upon integration, the zzso sequences of zzso were compared with those of zzso
