As a zzso zzso zzso Yang 1 zzso has been demonstrated to regulate both gene expression and protein zzso zzso However, gaps still exist in our knowledge of how zzso can be modified and what the consequences of its modifications zzso Here we report that zzso protein can be zzso both in zzso and in zzso We have identified zzso 288 as the major zzso site of zzso We also discovered that zzso a zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso protein and can stimulate the zzso of zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on in zzso zzso zzso correlate with the zzso interaction but do not depend on the zzso finger domain of zzso This regulation is unique to zzso zzso because zzso zzso zzso still relies on the integrity of zzso which is also true of all of the previously identified zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso with zzso in the nucleus, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso regulates zzso zzso activity on different target zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is a target of zzso and reveals a novel feature of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso family that selectively stimulates protein zzso independent of the zzso finger zzso
