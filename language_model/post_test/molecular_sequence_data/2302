To investigate the role of the zzso group and the influence of zzso on the biological properties of zzso constrained zzso zzso three series of compounds were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (10) zzso zzso The selectivity of these peptides was studied by measuring their ability to zzso zzso from guinea pig brain and pancreatic zzso All the peptides displayed low affinities zzso values around zzso zzso for the pancreatic receptors (A zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso zzso zzso displayed high affinities for zzso binding sites (B zzso especially compounds belonging to series C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In all series the linear zzso had relatively poor affinities zzso approximately 300 zzso for zzso zzso zzso 9 was the most potent zzso zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso receptors of guinea zzso The zzso of the zzso region of zzso permits one therefore to obtain zzso for central zzso and small changes directed toward the zzso part zzso the affinity for these zzso
