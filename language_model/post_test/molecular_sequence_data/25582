Human growth hormone zzso elicits a diverse set of biological activities including zzso that derives from binding to the zzso zzso zzso The binding affinity of zzso for the zzso binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso was increased about zzso by addition of 50 zzso zzso zzso was not required for binding of zzso to the zzso binding protein zzso or for binding of zzso to the zzso Other zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso did not support such strong zzso zzso analysis indicated a zzso of one zzso per zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a cluster of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso in all zzso receptors but not zzso zzso are probable zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a molecular mechanism to explain why zzso zzso are not zzso and offers a molecular link between zinc zzso and its association with altered functions of zzso
