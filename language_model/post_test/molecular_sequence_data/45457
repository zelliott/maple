zzso zzso zzso are modular proteins that operate in an assembly line fashion to zzso zzso and link zzso zzso In the zzso coli zzso zzso system, the zzso zzso domain zzso the transfer of a zzso of zzso acid to the zzso zzso of zzso We present here the crystal structure of the zzso protein that contains an zzso zzso zzso domain that functions in the synthesis of zzso and a zzso carrier protein zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso interaction was surprisingly tolerant of a number of point zzso on the surface of zzso and zzso zzso studies on zzso support our previous hypothesis that members of the zzso family of zzso adopt two distinct zzso to catalyze the zzso zzso
