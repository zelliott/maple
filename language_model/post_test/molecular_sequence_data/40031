zzso zzso has been used for the recovery of zzso regions zzso a known zzso although its application to zzso walking is limited due to inefficient amplification from low copy number zzso Here we present an improved inverse zzso scheme that enables walking of rare fragments in environmental zzso Our scheme includes the following steps: zzso inverse zzso in which one primer is connected to an affinity zzso zzso affinity zzso of zzso products for removing background zzso and zzso zzso zzso to recover target zzso regions zzso In a model experiment, zzso regions of a gene zzso in zzso zzso were recovered from zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by standard inverse zzso inverse zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso and zzso showing that they were recovered when ratios of zzso zzso to the background zzso zzso were greater than zzso zzso and zzso zzso The utility of zzso was also examined by recovering zzso regions of zzso putative zzso gene fragments from a groundwater zzso showing that zzso obtained zzso regions for more diverse gene fragments than zzso Since rare sequences are a critical element of natural genetic diversity, zzso enables access to undiscovered diverse genes in the zzso
