In zzso a highly regulated zzso zzso is essential for many cellular zzso These include zzso zzso regional specialization and synaptic zzso Given the critical roles of zzso proteins zzso in maintaining and regulating zzso stability and zzso we sought to understand how this regulation is zzso Here, we identify a novel zzso repeat zzso tentatively named zzso zzso enriched zzso interacting zzso as a potential regulator of zzso zzso zzso Based on expression at both the zzso and protein levels, zzso is enriched in the nervous zzso Its protein expression is detected as early as embryonic day 11 and continues through zzso Interestingly, when expressed in zzso cells, zzso displays a diffuse pattern with zzso although at the zzso level it zzso along the zzso network in zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the association of zzso to zzso may require an zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso with zzso protein 8 zzso results in zzso losing its diffuse pattern, instead decorating zzso zzso along with zzso Together, these results imply that zzso may play an important role in regulating the zzso zzso through an interaction with zzso
