The zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso chains linked by a zzso zzso it presents a peculiar fold in water resulting from zzso zzso of two zzso zzso To investigate the contribution of each zzso chain and the zzso bond to zzso zzso properties, different zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and comparatively evaluated with respect to the native zzso Our experiments demonstrate that the simultaneous occurrence of both zzso chains and the zzso bond is essential for the formation of the zzso structure of zzso in zzso media, able to resist zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso exhibited comparable zzso activities, suggesting only a partial contribution of the zzso bond to zzso killing zzso Relative zzso properties paralleled zzso zzso results, definitively demonstrating that microbial zzso are the main target of zzso zzso Various zzso experiments performed in zzso media, before and after zzso addition, provided information about zzso secondary structure, zzso zzso organization, and zzso orientation with respect to membrane zzso These data were instrumental in the generation of putative models of zzso zzso pore zzso
