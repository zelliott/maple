We wish to zzso the sequences required for zzso expression of the zzso hormone zzso beta 1 zzso beta zzso zzso activity of the promoter of human zzso hormone zzso beta 1 was assessed by transient zzso of deletion zzso attached to zzso as reporter, into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso of the beta 1 promoter including the zzso box induced minimal zzso activity, which was considered zzso zzso The activities of various lengths of the beta 1 promoter were estimated relative to the minimal promoter in five cell zzso The region between zzso and zzso was crucial for zzso activity in all cell zzso Further deletion analysis in zzso cells showed that two regions mainly zzso the zzso activity of the minimal 40 base pair zzso One region located at zzso to zzso which is highly zzso included the most zzso of five putative zzso boxes present in the whole zzso pair zzso A second region contributing to expression of zzso beta 1 in zzso cells is at zzso to zzso zzso of the most zzso zzso box strongly suppressed zzso of the whole promoter in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso in the other zzso boxes did not suppress zzso in zzso cells and slightly suppress zzso in zzso zzso In Schneider cells, which do not express zzso zzso of the region zzso to zzso is positively regulated by zzso with a zzso expressing zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
