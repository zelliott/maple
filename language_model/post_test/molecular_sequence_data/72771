zzso contain various zzso zzso and proteins in the zzso zzso have been known as the major zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso of 11 zzso zzso from guinea pig zzso zzso In this study, we have examined the zzso release and biological activity of zzso and compared with zzso zzso was zzso released from zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanied by the release of zzso a specific and zzso zzso zzso without release of zzso an zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso were released by zzso accompanied by the release of zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso and zzso is different among zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and inhibited zzso of zzso zzso particles and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not affect these zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso possessed the zzso activities for mast cells, but zzso was zzso less potent than zzso zzso and zzso showed the zzso activities against both zzso coli and zzso zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso was completely lost in the presence of zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso although zzso retained the zzso activity even in the presence of zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited the zzso more potent zzso activity than zzso against zzso zzso leukemia zzso Together these observations indicate that when released from zzso zzso likely functions as an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso whereas zzso may participate in the zzso of zzso function and mast cell zzso zzso
