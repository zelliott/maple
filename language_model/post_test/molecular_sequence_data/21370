zzso in the zzso zzso zzso sodium channel are responsible for mild to severe zzso zzso The ubiquitous calcium sensor zzso zzso bound to rat brain zzso and to the human zzso channel expressed by a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso region of the channel, as a fusion protein or in the zzso zzso system, zzso with zzso via a consensus zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso clamp experiments on zzso cells showed that zzso zzso increased peak current in a zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of fast zzso and accelerated the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of fast zzso and slowed down the fast zzso zzso and for high zzso this effect zzso with the acceleration induced by zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso action of calcium antagonized the zzso shift of the zzso of zzso due to zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso suggested that zzso could bind the zzso zzso region with zzso zzso
