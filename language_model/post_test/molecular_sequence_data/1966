In an attempt to identify new zzso genes that are involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso development, such as the zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso we cloned and characterized a new zzso protein zzso zzso from adult rat zzso The zzso zzso shared zzso sequence identity with an unnamed human zzso zzso and an zzso mouse zzso protein called transcript increased in zzso 78 zzso A zzso zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso and zzso manner; the zzso was evident at 28 days and remained at high levels throughout zzso An zzso protein of molecular weight 88 zzso was detected in zzso extracts by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as analyzed by in zzso zzso and zzso were both expressed in a zzso fashion during the cycle of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was predominantly localized to round and zzso zzso with zzso expression at stages zzso The zzso protein was mainly observed in zzso zzso and reached its highest levels during stages zzso A zzso zzso domain was detected in the zzso region of zzso and its zzso An analysis of the predicted zzso structural modeling and folding pattern further suggested that zzso is identifiable as a member of zzso zzso In zzso we have identified a new rat zzso protein zzso zzso and its zzso in human and mouse and demonstrated that zzso might belong to a zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may play a role in zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso development, as has been shown in zzso zzso
