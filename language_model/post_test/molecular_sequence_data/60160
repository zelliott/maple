zzso zzso zzso is pivotal for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso It produces zzso by condensing one zzso and three zzso A zzso into a zzso reaction intermediate that zzso The crystal structures of zzso alone and zzso with zzso and product zzso reveal the active site architecture that defines the sequence and chemistry of multiple zzso and zzso reactions and provides a molecular understanding of the zzso reaction leading to zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso with zzso also suggests how zzso zzso a related zzso uses the same zzso and an alternate zzso zzso to form zzso By using the three-dimensional structure and the large database of zzso zzso we can identify proteins likely to possess novel zzso and product zzso The structure zzso the chemical basis of plant zzso zzso and provides a framework for engineering zzso zzso to produce new zzso
