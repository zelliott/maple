Small zzso zzso zzso are involved in gene regulation through translation zzso zzso zzso or directing zzso zzso In rice, currently approximately 240 zzso zzso have been zzso We zzso more than four million small zzso from rice and identified another 24 zzso zzso Among these, we found a unique class of zzso that derive from natural zzso transcript zzso This zzso generates zzso that can perfectly match their zzso We provide evidence that the zzso function by inducing zzso zzso in the middle of their complementary zzso Their production requires zzso 1 zzso activity, which is essential for zzso zzso zzso All of the natural zzso zzso zzso identified in this study have large zzso in their precursors that appear critical for zzso evolution and for the formation of functional zzso zzso These findings suggest that other natural zzso zzso with similar zzso arrangements could be another source of zzso zzso
