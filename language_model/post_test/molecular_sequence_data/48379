The zzso of zzso zzso peptides and proteins is associated with a wide range of highly debilitating neurological and systemic zzso In this work we explored the potential of a zzso drug discovery procedure to target one such system, the soluble zzso form of the zzso zzso We zzso for this purpose a set of structures of the zzso zzso selected from clusters of zzso within an ensemble generated by molecular dynamics zzso Using these structures we carried out zzso mapping calculations to identify binding zzso zzso on the zzso form of the zzso zzso This procedure provided a set of hot spots with zzso efficiencies comparable to those observed for structured zzso and clustered into binding zzso Such binding pockets exhibited a propensity to bind small molecules known to interact with the zzso zzso Taken together these results provide an initial indication that zzso drug discovery may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for diseases associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
