The zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso repair of damaged DNA and is zzso to zzso zzso zzso which functions in repair and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells representing repair zzso group 1 have zzso zzso We report that repair of zzso DNA can be zzso by combining zzso group 1 cell extracts with correcting protein from zzso zzso zzso repair was minimized by employing zzso zzso cell extracts supplemented with human replication proteins zzso and zzso Group zzso activity has a native molecular mass of 100 zzso and contains the 33 zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso activities for extracts from zzso group 4 and zzso zzso group F zzso zzso zzso of group 1, group 4 or zzso cells do not complement one another in zzso although they complement extracts from other zzso The amount of zzso zzso by zzso is reduced in group 1, group 4 and zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli only zzso corrected the group 1 zzso The data suggest that zzso is part of a functional protein complex with group 4 and zzso correcting zzso The latter two may be equivalent to one another and analogous to zzso zzso zzso
