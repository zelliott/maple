With a final goal to study how zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso in zzso early zzso we cloned its zzso from zzso liver zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso long, with the open reading frame coding for 175 zzso zzso whose sequence was highly zzso to its human zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed from the earliest stage of zzso inherited as maternal zzso at a high level, but its level became low at and after the zzso stage where zzso synthetic activity is strongly zzso zzso zzso occurred in larger amounts in the animal half than in the vegetal half in zzso stage zzso and in zzso and zzso stage zzso its distribution was slightly larger in the anterior part than in the zzso zzso These data show that zzso zzso is expressed in a temporally and zzso regulated manner, and its occurrence at higher levels in earlier stage zzso may be responsible for their low zzso zzso
