Genes that have undergone positive or diversifying selection are likely to be associated with zzso divergence between zzso One indicator of zzso selection at the molecular level is an excess of zzso acid replacement fixed differences per replacement site relative to the number of synonymous fixed differences per synonymous site zzso zzso zzso We used an evolutionary expressed sequence tag zzso approach to estimate the distribution of omega among 304 zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso to identify genes potentially involved in the zzso divergence between these two zzso zzso We find that 14 of 304 genes zzso zzso have an estimated omega zzso 1 and are candidates for genes with increased selection zzso zzso population genetic analyses of 6 of these rapidly evolving protein zzso indicate that, despite their high levels of zzso zzso zzso these genes do not have elevated levels of zzso replacement zzso compared to previously studied zzso A zzso zzso analysis of zzso region evolution within and between species also indicates that the selection zzso of these genes are elevated compared to previously studied zzso zzso nuclear zzso
