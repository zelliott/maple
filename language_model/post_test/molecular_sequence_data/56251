The zzso zzso zzso does not zzso zzso genes at all and experimental evidence obtained with zzso zzso shows that zzso in zzso represent a selected set of imported zzso zzso In this paper we present the data showing that zzso derived from the clustered zzso zzso genes are invariably imported into zzso while zzso from the solitary gene is zzso By sequencing a zzso DNA clone of zzso zzso zzso DNA, we have identified a zzso zzso zzso a duplicate set of the closely linked zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis shows that these zzso are imported into zzso In contrast, when the zzso gene zzso zzso located alone in a zzso DNA zzso was zzso the corresponding zzso was not detected in the zzso This zzso zzso gene is highly unusual since the zzso putative zzso zzso III zzso termination signal sequence is characterized by a long string of 8 zzso followed by an A and a stretch of 7 zzso while all other zzso zzso genes whose zzso transcripts are imported are terminated by a possible zzso termination signal of only 4-6 zzso Whether the correlation found between the gene organization and zzso characteristics is of general significance needs to be investigated zzso A simple computer analysis presented in this paper rules out the possibility that zzso found in the zzso zzso are the products of the zzso type zzso zzso of zzso zzso
