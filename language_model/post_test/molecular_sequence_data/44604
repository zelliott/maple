zzso is a synthetic zzso acid zzso that mimics the second zzso region of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso has been shown to form an zzso channel in zzso zzso We have investigated the possibility that the zzso may incorporate into the zzso membrane of zzso zzso and induce the zzso of zzso and zzso We improved the zzso of this zzso by adding four zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso activity using a subculture of zzso canine kidney zzso zzso The addition of 100 zzso zzso to the zzso surface of zzso zzso significantly increased zzso current zzso zzso zzso potential difference, and induced fluid zzso The increase in zzso was inhibited by 100 zzso zzso and by zzso channel zzso The effectiveness of the channel zzso followed the sequence zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso from the bathing solutions also inhibited the effect of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso differs from the native zzso activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso First, zzso zzso levels were zzso Second, the concentration of zzso required to inhibit the effect of the zzso was much lower than that needed to block the zzso response zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso These results support the hypothesis that the synthetic zzso zzso can from zzso zzso channels in the zzso membrane of zzso zzso cells and can induce sustained zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
