zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso retinal zzso protein which activates rod outer segment zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This investigation was undertaken to determine the zzso structure and zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing zzso of the zzso mass spectral analysis, zzso and zzso studies revealed that zzso is identical to zzso another zzso zzso protein whose structure was zzso We had shown earlier that the latter zzso which is usually called zzso zzso or zzso of zzso also activates zzso but that the zzso of activated zzso was about 50% lower than when zzso by zzso zzso also required about 15 times more calcium zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso stimulation of zzso To investigate the possibility that zzso is a zzso modified form of zzso both proteins were treated with 1 M zzso which is known to zzso zzso After the treatment, zzso did not activate zzso while zzso zzso remained unaffected suggesting that zzso could not be a modified form of zzso zzso also broke down zzso into smaller fragments while leaving zzso zzso It therefore appeared that in spite of identical primary structures, the zzso of the two proteins were zzso We then investigated the possibility that the zzso procedures of the two zzso which were quite different, could have contributed to such zzso zzso zzso zzso included a step of heating at 75 degrees C in 5 zzso zzso while zzso zzso included zinc affinity zzso To test the influence of these treatments on the properties of the zzso zzso was subjected to zinc affinity zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso was heated in zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso is identical to zzso and that zzso is identical to zzso Taken together the results demonstrate that zzso and zzso are one and the same protein and that their functional differences are due to different zzso zzso zzso
