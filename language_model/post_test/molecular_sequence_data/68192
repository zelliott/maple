zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso indicates that zzso six base pairs apart on opposite DNA strands are zzso yielding two major zzso zzso differing in the central duplex region zzso one zzso zzso contains an AT step wherein both zzso are zzso and zzso base paired to zzso zzso zzso the other contains zzso zzso zzso that show no evidence of hydrogen bonding with pairing zzso zzso zzso The zzso model consists of three zzso undergoing exchange and differing in the orientation of the zzso zzso zzso size, zzso and zzso properties restrict the DNA zzso range of motion and freeze out DNA zzso adopted during the zzso zzso This most zzso DNA zzso zzso yields an zzso zzso zzso containing a stable region of zzso zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso While zzso exercises a selective effect on DNA zzso it zzso into regions of base stacking less than other zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso Because of this capacity to induce stable zzso base pairing with only minimal distortion of zzso zzso zzso zzso an opportunity to explore this unusual DNA zzso
