zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 3 with the zzso zzso 2 gave the zzso 4 as a key intermediate in the synthesis of the zzso 13 for zzso zzso zzso The following formation of the zzso 13, including introduction of a zzso group at zzso proceeded in six zzso Because of the difficulty of some steps, an alternative route for 13 was zzso Model compounds 20, 21, and 22 were zzso in order to confirm the zzso of the products of the zzso The zzso of the zzso gave zzso derivatives consisting mainly of three repeating zzso This result is in contrast with the degree of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of other synthetic zzso but is very similar to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
