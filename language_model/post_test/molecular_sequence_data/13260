The zzso G proteins are an extended family of zzso zzso proteins that serve essential functions in the mature nervous system but whose contributions to zzso development remain poorly zzso We have investigated the potential role of one specific G zzso zzso in the control of zzso zzso During zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an identified population of zzso zzso (the zzso zzso migrate along sets of visceral muscle bands to form part of the enteric nervous zzso Previously, zzso studies indicated the presence of zzso proteins in the zzso cells during zzso We have now verified this result, using zzso derived from the zzso gene in zzso A clone containing the full-length coding domain for zzso was zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were then made from this clone and used to examine the zzso expression of the zzso gene during zzso zzso transcripts could first be detected in the zzso cells several hours before the onset of their zzso The level of zzso expression in all of the zzso cells continued to increase during migration, but subsequently was zzso in a subset of the zzso zzso at the time of their terminal zzso This pattern of regulated expression is consistent with the distribution of zzso protein in the zzso zzso We also used a zzso culture preparation of staged zzso to investigate the effects of G zzso toxins on the migratory zzso zzso injections of the zzso toxin zzso a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the migration of individual zzso zzso zzso of zzso toxin (an inhibitor of zzso and zzso or zzso toxin (a selective zzso of zzso had no effect on migration, although zzso toxin treatments did cause a measurable increase in the subsequent outgrowth of zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso with zzso toxin blocked the zzso effects of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling events within the zzso cells may zzso their migratory behavior, possibly in response to zzso cues that normally guide migration in the developing zzso
