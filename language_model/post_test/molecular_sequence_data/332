zzso zzso zzso have fundamental roles in development, whereas zzso of zzso signaling leads to zzso Multiple zzso receptors are responsible for zzso and/or regulating zzso zzso Among these, the zzso protein zzso is a highly zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso We have solved a series of crystal structures for the human zzso zzso and Desert zzso zzso in isolation, as well as zzso in complex with zzso zzso and Sonic zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso The interaction zzso confirmed by zzso studies and zzso reveal previously zzso and distinct functions for the zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso that may be common to all zzso zzso zzso zzso makes a key contribution to the zzso zzso whereas zzso is likely to prevent zzso zzso between the two zzso suggesting an important zzso zzso This interplay of several metal binding sites suggests a zzso mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso
