zzso membrane zzso 1 zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the invasion of host zzso and is an important vaccine zzso We have previously described a zzso zzso zzso that binds to zzso and subsequently blocks zzso zzso Because this zzso appears to target a site critical for zzso function, it represents an important lead compound for zzso drug zzso However, the effectiveness of this zzso inhibitor was limited to a subset of zzso zzso indicating a requirement for broader strain zzso Furthermore, a barrier to the utility of any zzso as a potential therapeutic is its zzso to rapid zzso zzso In this study, we sought to improve the zzso stability and zzso binding properties of the zzso zzso by systematic zzso of backbone zzso zzso The inclusion of a single zzso group in the zzso zzso backbone dramatically increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso stability without introducing global structural zzso In addition, zzso of multiple zzso zzso further improved these zzso zzso we have shown that modifications to a biologically active zzso can dramatically enhance zzso This approach could be applied to many lead peptides or zzso zzso to simultaneously zzso a number of zzso
