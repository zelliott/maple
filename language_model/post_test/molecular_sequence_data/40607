In the present study, the zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso a strain isolated from bovine zzso were zzso and partially zzso After zzso by ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso and five runs of zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso activity was recovered with zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that more than one zzso zzso named zzso zzso is produced by zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analyses revealed three peptides zzso with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso B zzso and zzso C zzso and two peptides zzso with zzso zzso zzso D zzso and zzso E zzso Although five peptides have been zzso only four small zzso sequences were obtained by zzso laser zzso time of flight zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso The sequences zzso and zzso revealed identity with hypothetical peptides with unknown zzso The sequences zzso and zzso showed similarity to a segment of a precursor of zzso zzso The zzso activity detected in the zzso of strain zzso proved to be resistant to heat treatment at zzso however, treatment at zzso abolished completely its zzso zzso The concentrated zzso containing zzso zzso exhibited a strong zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso exhibited zzso activity against important zzso zzso including zzso zzso thus showing a potential application in food zzso
