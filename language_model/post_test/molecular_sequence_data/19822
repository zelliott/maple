The architecture of cellular zzso zzso zzso dictates that zzso can begin only after promoter DNA zzso into a deep channel and the start site zzso zzso binds in the active site located on the channel zzso zzso of this zzso competent zzso complex zzso by zzso coli zzso at the zzso promoter is greatly accelerated by DNA upstream of base pair zzso (with respect to zzso Here we report real-time zzso radical zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained under conditions selected for optimal characterization of the first zzso significant intermediate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that the DNA backbone from zzso to zzso is engulfed by zzso in zzso but not in zzso downstream protection extends to approximately zzso in both zzso zzso zzso detects zzso zzso bases in zzso but not in zzso We conclude that upstream DNA wraps more extensively on zzso in zzso than in zzso and that downstream DNA zzso to zzso occupies the zzso channel in zzso but is not yet zzso zzso of the zzso data onto available zzso structures provides a detailed model of a kinetic intermediate in bacterial zzso initiation and suggests how transient contacts with upstream DNA in zzso might rearrange the channel to favor entry of downstream duplex zzso
