The zzso gene encodes a zzso factor that is essential for maintaining the mouse zzso It is expressed during the earliest stages of zzso is zzso during zzso and is thereafter constrained to the germ cell zzso zzso acid induced differentiation of zzso zzso cells is also accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso of zzso expression is zzso by a hormone regulatory element zzso This element is located within the zzso promoter and zzso with a zzso box that is crucial for zzso promoter zzso The zzso is composed of three direct repeats with 1 and 0 zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso of direct repeats with 0 spacing zzso is bound by two novel zzso The initial repression of zzso by zzso acid zzso with the disappearance of the first factor (named zzso for zzso cellular zzso and the appearance of a zzso induced factor zzso which forms a larger complex with zzso in zzso mobility shift zzso These observations support the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso gene during early mouse zzso involves the repression of its promoter by zzso
