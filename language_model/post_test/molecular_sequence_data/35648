A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso acids were found to overcome ammonium repression of the zzso and zzso transport zzso in strain zzso Several zzso acids increased the toxicity of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso with little or no increase in toxicity of zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso completely reversed the toxicity of zzso by competing with the transport of zzso into the zzso In contrast, zzso increased the toxicity of zzso zzso and zzso but had no effect on the toxicity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cells with zzso for 4 h resulted in a zzso increase in the rate of transport of zzso zzso indicating that increased sensitivity of zzso zzso to some toxic peptides in the presence of zzso may be attributed to an increased rate of transport of these zzso Our results indicate that the zzso and zzso transport zzso of zzso zzso are regulated by zzso amounts of zzso acids in a similar fashion to the regulation of zzso transport in zzso zzso and that multiple zzso transport systems zzso regulated by various nitrogen sources and zzso acids exist in zzso zzso
