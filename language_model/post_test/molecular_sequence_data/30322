We have identified a region in the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ya zzso gene that contains a unique zzso element zzso The regulatory region spans zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso sequence and is responsible for part of the zzso level as well as zzso expression of the Ya zzso gene by zzso aromatic compounds such as zzso zzso and zzso The DNA sequence of this region zzso zzso is distinct from the DNA sequence of the zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to the region containing the zzso element, two other regulatory regions of the Ya zzso gene have been zzso One region spans zzso zzso to zzso and has a DNA sequence with identity to the zzso nuclear factor 1 recognition motif found in several zzso zzso The second region spans zzso zzso to zzso and contains a DNA sequence with identity to the zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence also contributes to part of the responsiveness of the Ya zzso gene to zzso aromatic zzso Our data suggest that regulation of gene expression by zzso aromatic compounds can be zzso by a DNA sequence that is distinct from the zzso zzso
