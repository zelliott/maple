Human zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso that is only expressed in zzso zzso cells and a member of the primary response gene family induced by growth factors, was isolated from the zzso library of an activated human helper T cell line, zzso Human zzso has zzso identity in a zzso zzso acid overlap to zzso zzso Furthermore, as in the case of zzso zzso human zzso encodes a protein remarkably similar in sequence to the zzso portion of human zzso 1 zzso both types 1 and zzso The expression of zzso in human zzso could trigger further investigations into its zzso role in zzso
