The orphan nuclear hormone zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso plays a key role in the regulation of development and determination of adult zzso To understand the effects of zzso on aging we characterized the lifespan of zzso and zzso zzso zzso that have been identified on the basis of their effects on zzso zzso We find that these zzso have opposing effects on longevity and resistance to zzso and zzso stress which makes zzso the first gene with zzso that can extend or shorten zzso We find that the shortened lifespan of the zzso zzso is due to accelerated aging in young adulthood rather than an adverse effect of the zzso on zzso zzso analysis of worms carrying the two zzso revealed a relatively small number of genes zzso expressed between the two zzso zzso of the expression profiles with the profiles associated with zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso revealed that while the profiles are largely different, there is significant overlap among the genes zzso but not zzso in all zzso Several of these genes zzso in multiple zzso worms have known effects on zzso and many of the genes belong to a family of poorly characterized genes that are strongly zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results point to zzso modulating aging and stress responses in part through the repression of specific zzso and emphasize the role that the repression of genes that curtail zzso lifespan plays in lifespan zzso
