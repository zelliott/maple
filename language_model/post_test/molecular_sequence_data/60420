The function of the zzso tumor zzso protein is regulated by interaction with zzso which targets zzso for zzso dependent zzso We show here that like zzso zzso alpha forms an interaction with zzso both in zzso and in cells, but this does not result in the degradation of the zzso alpha zzso The human zzso E6 protein also fails to degrade zzso zzso suggesting that the mechanisms governing zzso alpha stability are distinct from those known to regulate zzso zzso However, the interaction of zzso with 73 alpha is sufficient to impede zzso alpha zzso function, despite the lack of zzso
