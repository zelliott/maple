Eight human genetic diseases have been associated with the expansion of zzso or zzso zzso zzso The molecular zzso behind expansion is unknown but may involve participation of an unusual DNA structure in zzso repair, or zzso We show that DNA fragments containing zzso zzso repeats derived from the human zzso zzso gene migrate up to zzso faster than expected in zzso zzso gels, suggesting the presence of an unusual DNA zzso structure within the zzso zzso zzso The anomalous migration is dependent upon the number of zzso repeats, the length of the zzso DNA, and the percentage and temperature of the zzso The effect could be reduced by the addition of zzso zzso zzso a zzso model for zzso the results are consistent with a zzso increase in persistence length of the zzso zzso products containing zzso or zzso repeats from the zzso zzso type I gene zzso or the fragile X zzso zzso respectively, also showed higher zzso zzso These are the first sequences of defined length for which a dramatic increase in mobility can be attributed to zzso structural elements in zzso
