zzso elements in the promoter region of the mouse zzso colony stimulating factor zzso gene were assessed by constructing zzso promoters linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and by employing a transient zzso zzso of human T cell leukemia zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso (at positions zzso to zzso which is zzso to the zzso B binding zzso and zzso (at positions to zzso of the mouse zzso promoter are essential for zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso and the zzso B binding motif are functionally interchangeable and that zzso and zzso as a unit activate the basic zzso promoter in response to zzso zzso This unit is also capable of zzso zzso promoters in response to zzso zzso In addition, we show that Tax, the zzso zzso by human T cell leukemia virus type I zzso activates the zzso promoter via zzso without the involvement of zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene proceeds through distinct zzso
