The zzso zzso is subject to complex regulation during T cell differentiation and zzso The elements regulating zzso gene expression have only partially been zzso In this report, we identified a promoter element located in the first zzso of the zzso zzso This promoter zzso functions in T cell lines and is zzso active in zzso zzso zzso These findings are similar to other systems in which multiple promoters define zzso and zzso patterns of zzso Through a series of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso III protection zzso we localized the zzso promoter element to a zzso zzso This element lacks potential binding zzso for zzso and zzso both of which have previously been shown to be involved in the function of the zzso zzso and human zzso promoter, and this suggests the presence of a novel, zzso zzso zzso These results also suggest that the zzso expression requires the use of multiple regulatory elements located throughout the zzso zzso
