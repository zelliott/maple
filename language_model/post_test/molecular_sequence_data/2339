Four zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso of zzso virus that fail to make zzso at the zzso temperature are known, and we have previously shown that group F zzso have defects in zzso Here we map representatives of groups A, B, and zzso zzso fragments from a full-length clone of zzso virus, zzso were replaced with the corresponding fragments from the various zzso These hybrid plasmids were transcribed in zzso by zzso zzso zzso to produce infectious zzso zzso and the virus recovered was tested for temperature zzso After each zzso was mapped to a specific region, zzso clones of both zzso and zzso were zzso in order to determine the precise zzso change responsible for each zzso zzso of viral zzso and zzso by rescued zzso were also examined in order to study the zzso of each zzso in a uniform genetic zzso The single zzso of group B, zzso had a zzso in zzso zzso to zzso All of the group A and group G zzso examined had zzso in zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso for three group A zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso and zzso to zzso in zzso for two group G zzso In addition, zzso had a change in zzso zzso to zzso which also rendered the virus temperature sensitive and zzso Thus, changes in any of the four zzso proteins can lead to failure to zzso zzso at a zzso temperature, indicating that all four are involved in zzso zzso From the results presented here and from previous results, several of the activities of the zzso proteins can be zzso It appears that zzso may be involved in the initiation of zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be involved in the initiation of zzso zzso zzso and in addition it appears to be a zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso It may also be involved in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to function as the viral zzso or zzso zzso The functions of zzso are as yet zzso
