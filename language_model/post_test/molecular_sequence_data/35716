The zzso of zzso and zzso by mechanisms that might be functional in zzso has been zzso Studies with cell zzso zzso onto collagen films have indicated key roles for zzso and zzso in these zzso zzso zzso could be rapidly zzso by zzso zzso in the presence of zzso with identical zzso to zzso generated zzso zzso zzso by zzso was shown to be poor, although an zzso shift of 11,000 zzso zzso was enhanced zzso by the presence of active zzso even at a very low zzso zzso A zzso cell line zzso zzso but not zzso was found to be dependent upon the addition of both zzso and zzso to effect degradation of collagen zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso were carried out using other zzso zzso zzso by zzso tissue cells including zzso zzso zzso zzso B and zzso zzso None was a particularly effective zzso relative to zzso but zzso B was shown to activate zzso By use of both cell model systems and zzso studies of zzso zzso we have found that the role of zzso as the major zzso zzso in normal zzso tissue cells remains zzso
