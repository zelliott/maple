The identification and zzso of peptides selected by class II zzso molecules during natural processing of proteins is of key importance in understanding the repertoire and distribution of T zzso The examination of peptides selected by class II zzso molecules has depended greatly on mass zzso a powerful technique that identifies and sequences peptides in complex zzso with great sensitivity and zzso Such analysis has resulted in the identification of several factors, including the repertoire of peptides selected by zzso molecules during natural processing of zzso motifs important for selection of processed zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes, and zzso changes to the zzso
