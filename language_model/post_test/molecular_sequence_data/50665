zzso virus zzso zzso one zzso zzso zzso at a specific site in a zzso of the zzso transcribed from the zzso zzso gene to produce V zzso Using an zzso against the unique zzso region of the predicted V zzso we found that a zzso V protein was expressed in two acute zzso strains zzso and zzso and three zzso virus strains zzso zzso and zzso The V protein of zzso strain zzso virus was zzso and zzso indistinguishable from the V protein of zzso strain acute zzso the likely zzso of the zzso zzso The V protein of these two viruses was not present in the zzso viral zzso but was found only in the zzso free protein zzso zzso experiments failed to show transport of the V protein to the plasma zzso The V protein was also absent in the zzso zzso The P protein zzso from the cloned gene associated with the zzso zzso in zzso but the V protein had no affinity to the zzso zzso These results suggest that expression and properties of the V protein are zzso in chronic zzso zzso
