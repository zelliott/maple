The entire zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso strain, has been cloned into the zzso expression zzso and used for the synthesis of a zzso protein in zzso zzso The expressed protein is a fusion between the zzso 13 zzso acids of the zzso zzso 8 zzso acids resulting from the zzso zzso and the 180 zzso acids that comprise the zzso zzso sequence from the zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso protein has been zzso to apparent zzso on zzso scale zzso zzso by a combination of sequential zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso protein is highly susceptible to zzso zzso zzso and this property accounts for the low yield obtained by gel zzso and zzso zzso amounts zzso 100 zzso of the zzso zzso protein have been produced by a zzso procedure that employs sequential zzso zzso zzso on zzso in the presence of 7 M zzso and zzso on zzso also in 7 M zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein has been used for the production of zzso and zzso zzso The milder method of zzso should facilitate zzso studies of the zzso protein and its role in the life cycle of zzso
