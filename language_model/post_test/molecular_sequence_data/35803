Most natural zzso zzso display a high degree of secondary structure with zzso as their most prominent zzso zzso affecting the zzso activity of these zzso most often map in or close to loop regions in both the zzso and target zzso The primary recognition zzso often contain zzso zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso affect the binding rate and, zzso the zzso effect on the activity of the target zzso Here we address the question whether loop sizes affect binding rates between zzso and target zzso using the replication control system of zzso zzso as a model zzso By creating a series of loop size zzso we show that loop size zzso have strong effects on the binding rates between the two zzso zzso in zzso and that most of the zzso analyzed display corresponding effects on zzso zzso control in zzso Our data suggest that the three-dimensional structures of zzso and target zzso zzso are crucial for determining binding zzso The implications of these results for the design of efficient artificial zzso zzso control systems are zzso
