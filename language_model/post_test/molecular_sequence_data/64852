We examined six human short tandem repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and von zzso factor, zzso in the Japanese macaque, zzso zzso using commercially available human zzso zzso No products were amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso using the human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified with human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso products amplified with the zzso and zzso zzso migrated more slowly than human ones during zzso zzso results showed that the zzso sequences of the counterpart of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the Japanese zzso were closely similar to those of the human genes except for tandem repeat zzso The zzso products amplified with human zzso and zzso zzso were highly zzso with four zzso of the former and 15 zzso of the latter in the nine zzso These results indicate that the commercially available kits can be used to discriminate the Japanese zzso samples from human zzso
