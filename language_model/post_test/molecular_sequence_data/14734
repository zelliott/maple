Most marine sponges establish a persistent association with a wide array of zzso and zzso diverse zzso To date, the role of these symbiotic microbial communities in the metabolism and zzso cycles of the zzso consortium remains largely zzso We identified and zzso the microbial communities associated with three common Mediterranean sponge species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso For each sponge we zzso the zzso and release of dissolved organic carbon zzso and nitrogen zzso zzso nitrogen and zzso Low microbial abundance and no evidence for zzso zzso or zzso were found for zzso In contrast zzso and zzso showed high microbial abundance zzso and zzso of their tissue occupied by microbes zzso and both species exhibited high zzso and high zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, these unique zzso pathways were zzso in each sponge species by a different, and host specific, microbial zzso The functional convergence of microbial zzso found in these two zzso sponge species, suggest that these zzso processes may be of special relevance to the success of the zzso
