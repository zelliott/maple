zzso of the zzso zzso I zzso current during the zzso zzso phase of an action potential is the main mechanism underlying spontaneous, rhythmic activity of cardiac zzso zzso In the past three decades, a wealth of evidence zzso the function of the funny current in the generation and zzso of cardiac zzso activity has been zzso The slope of early zzso zzso and thus the heart rate, is controlled precisely by the degree of I f zzso during zzso I f is also accurately and rapidly modulated by changes of the zzso concentration of the second zzso zzso operated by the autonomous nervous system through zzso mainly zzso and in the opposite way by zzso zzso zzso Recently, novel in zzso data, both in animal models and humans, have been collected that confirm the key role of I f in zzso In particular, an zzso point zzso in the zzso zzso domain of human zzso the main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contributing to native funny channels of the zzso zzso was shown to be associated with zzso zzso in a large zzso Because of their properties, funny channels have long been a major target of classical pharmacological research and are now target of innovative zzso therapeutic approaches aimed to exploit their function in cardiac rate zzso
