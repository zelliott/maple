During zzso infection, the zzso host zzso zzso protein of zzso causes the degradation of zzso zzso In this work, we cloned the zzso gene zzso open reading zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso zzso by zzso and its zzso sequences were zzso The zzso product of zzso gene was zzso into the zzso zzso expression zzso and production of the zzso zzso protein was examined by zzso zzso of Western zzso demonstrated that our zzso zzso protein reacted with zzso against a synthetic zzso of 17 zzso acids of the zzso zzso After zzso with zzso affinity zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein exhibited in zzso zzso activity as zzso We further cloned the zzso gene into zzso expression zzso and investigated the zzso function of zzso protein by DNA zzso By transient zzso and zzso zzso we found the zzso activity was reduced in the presence of zzso indicating that degradation of zzso of the zzso gene was caused by the zzso Furthermore, our results showed that the plaque formation of zzso virus was blocked by zzso zzso Taken together, we have cloned the zzso gene of zzso virus zzso zzso and conducted functional analysis of the zzso zzso protein in zzso as well as in zzso
