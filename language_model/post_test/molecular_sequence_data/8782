zzso G proteins have emerged as important regulators of membrane zzso To explore a role for G beta gamma in zzso fusion, we have taken advantage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso to zzso by interaction with G beta zzso The zzso zzso of beta zzso zzso zzso has a G beta zzso domain which blocks some G beta zzso zzso We found that beta zzso and zzso G, a zzso derived from beta zzso inhibit in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso G and zzso share sequence zzso zzso G and beta zzso reversed zzso zzso of zzso fusion and blocked zzso binding to zzso Using an zzso fusion zzso we show that both G beta gamma and G alpha s interact with the small zzso zzso an interaction that is regulated by zzso zzso We conclude that G proteins may participate in the regulation of zzso trafficking by directly interacting with zzso a zzso factor required for zzso
