zzso syndrome is an inherited disorder defined by the association of zzso and zzso zzso to impaired targeting and migration of zzso zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso The gene responsible for the zzso form of zzso syndrome, zzso encodes a zzso protein of still elusive zzso It has been proposed that zzso might be involved in some aspects of zzso zzso zzso However, the unavailability of a mouse model, and the difficulties in studying cellular and zzso migration in zzso have hampered an understanding of its zzso We have identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso and document its function in zzso We show that zzso is part of a mechanism by which zzso influence migration and zzso of zzso cells undergoing zzso during zzso zzso and male tail zzso We also show that zzso affects zzso outgrowth in zzso by modulating zzso Finally, we find that human zzso zzso can compensate for the loss of zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso or human zzso zzso in the zzso results in the same zzso These data indicate functional conservation between the human and zzso proteins and establish zzso zzso as a powerful animal in which to investigate zzso function in zzso Our findings add a new player to the set of zzso which appear to zzso both zzso and zzso navigation in zzso and zzso
