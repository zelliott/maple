The dominance of sexual reproduction is still an unresolved zzso in evolutionary zzso Strong advantages of sex have to exist, because only a few zzso zzso persist over evolutionary zzso zzso zzso zzso include outstanding exceptions to the rule that zzso zzso zzso are of recent origin and doomed to zzso In addition to the existence of large zzso clusters in zzso zzso zzso analyses of this study and zzso reconstruction of ancestral states of reproduction imply that zzso have zzso sexuality from zzso ancestors within one of those zzso This reversal in zzso mode is unique in the animal kingdom and violates zzso law that complex ancestral states can never be zzso The zzso of sexuality requires that ancestral genes for male production are maintained over evolutionary zzso This maintenance likely is true for zzso zzso because zzso males exist in various species, although mechanisms that enable the storage of genetically ancestral traits are zzso Our findings present zzso zzso as a unique model system to explore the evolutionary significance of zzso and sexual zzso
