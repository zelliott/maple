zzso zzso zzso of metabolically labeled zzso zzso identified a series of spots at a molecular size of 90 zzso zzso point zzso zzso zzso that was induced by zzso but whose intensity was reduced in cells obtained from animals treated with an extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso component zzso B zzso We have now identified zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered to rats for 8 zzso zzso cells were prepared and zzso with zzso for 3 zzso zzso obtained from zzso rats responded to zzso by producing high amounts of zzso an effect that was inhibited in cells obtained from zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso analysis of the zzso spots isolated from the gels revealed sequences sharing identity with the zzso precursor zzso Further zzso screening of a rat adrenal zzso library identified a sequence with a high degree of zzso zzso to zzso precursor zzso and a lesser degree to rat zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was also recognized by a zzso zzso raised against human zzso zzso Iron binding zzso with rat adrenal zzso extracts further identified a zzso zzso zzso protein binding iron, suggesting that the identified zzso which we name zzso may have zzso zzso This is the first report describing the presence of a zzso precursor protein zzso belonging to the zzso family and sharing zzso with zzso in the zzso its induction by zzso and sensitivity to zzso
