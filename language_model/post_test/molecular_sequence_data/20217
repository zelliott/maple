The zzso is a key regulatory unit of the neuroendocrine system and plays an essential role in energy balance and zzso Despite its important role, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso development are not fully zzso Here, we report molecular analyses of a newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso that is expressed in the developing and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is a DNA binding protein and a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso identified the zzso region of zzso as an zzso zzso We have isolated an alternative zzso form of zzso designated zzso which retains the zzso region but lacks the zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso cell lines revealed that zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses suggested that both zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso zzso Taking these data together, we propose that alternative zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso
