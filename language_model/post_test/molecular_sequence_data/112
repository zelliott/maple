High levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transcripts are found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso cells and enhances a zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso in zzso In addition, both zzso and Mars, a zzso zzso sequence zzso promote zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the genetic interaction of zzso with zzso might be required for accurate zzso zzso 

To reveal whether zzso zzso was zzso the frequency of zzso an individual with both male and female zzso and of zzso were measured in the progeny from parents with reduced zzso and/or zzso activities and analyzed by zzso zzso To show that the genetic interaction between zzso and zzso is zzso or zzso a zzso analysis of zzso with either reduced or increased activities of zzso and/or zzso was used to reveal defects in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A significant but small fraction of the progeny from parents with reduced zzso activity showed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso analysis revealed that the decrease in zzso zzso was a result of delayed zzso of the zzso zzso which led to zzso zzso segregation in zzso that had reduced zzso zzso By removing one copy of zzso zzso zzso from flies with reduced zzso activity, zzso zzso was further zzso This was indicated by an increased in the zzso rate and more severe zzso However, the zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso at zzso where both gene activities were reduced was similar to that in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso did not affect the zzso of the zzso zzso and the cellular zzso of Mars zzso 

zzso zzso in progeny from parents with reduced zzso and/or zzso activity was zzso The results from zzso studies revealed that zzso and zzso function in parallel and that a balance between zzso activity and zzso activity is required for cells to progress through zzso correctly, thus ensuring zzso zzso
