The adaptation of zzso stability to environmental changes is a means of cells to adjust the level of gene zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso has served as one of the zzso for regulated zzso zzso in zzso The stability of the transcript is known to be correlated zzso with the bacterial growth zzso Thus, the regulation of zzso zzso stability meets the zzso needs to adjust the level of zzso expression to the rate of cell zzso Recently, host factor I zzso was shown to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso stability under slow growth zzso Here, we present the first direct demonstration that zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso protect the transcript from zzso E zzso in zzso However, the zzso protection was found to be zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and in zzso translation zzso revealed that translation of zzso is zzso in the presence of zzso These in zzso studies are zzso by in zzso expression studies demonstrating that the reduced synthesis rate of zzso zzso by zzso results in functional zzso of the zzso zzso The data are discussed in terms of a model wherein zzso regulates the stability of zzso zzso by competing with zzso zzso for binding to the zzso zzso
