The zzso protein export system is located in the bacterial zzso membrane and operates in parallel to the well-known zzso zzso While the zzso system only zzso zzso zzso the function of the zzso zzso is to zzso folded zzso The zzso zzso thus faces the formidable challenge of moving structured zzso zzso across the bacterial zzso membrane without rendering the membrane freely permeable to zzso and other zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso are often proteins that bind zzso molecules in the zzso and are thus zzso prior to zzso Such zzso zzso proteins are essential for most types of bacterial respiratory and zzso energy zzso In addition, the zzso zzso is involved in outer membrane zzso and in bacterial zzso zzso are targeted to the zzso zzso by zzso signal sequences zzso zzso essentially zzso zzso zzso and movement of proteins through the zzso system is energized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein probably forms the transport channel while the zzso proteins act as a zzso complex that recognizes the signal zzso of the zzso zzso
