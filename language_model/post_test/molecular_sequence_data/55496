The emergence of zzso zzso bacterial pathogens in hospitals zzso zzso presents a global threat of growing importance, especially for zzso bacteria with extended spectrum zzso zzso or the novel New Delhi zzso 1 zzso zzso Starting from the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have zzso the sequence to treat systemic infections with the most threatening human zzso such as zzso coli, zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The lead compound zzso enters bacteria without zzso effects at the membrane and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso binding domain with a zzso of 5 zzso The zzso crystal structure revealed that zzso binds with a seven zzso long sequence zzso in two different zzso Mice did not show any sign of toxicity when zzso was injected four times zzso at a dose of 40 zzso body weight zzso within 24 zzso whereas three injections of zzso zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso were sufficient to rescue all animals in lethal zzso models using zzso zzso coli strains zzso zzso and Neumann, zzso zzso labeling showed that zzso enters all zzso investigated including the brain and is cleared through both the liver and zzso at similar zzso In conclusion, zzso is a novel, highly promising, zzso zzso lead compound with favorable in zzso and in zzso properties including a promising safety zzso
