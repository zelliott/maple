The product of the cell cycle control gene zzso is required in zzso for transition through both zzso and zzso control points of the cell zzso The zzso protein in higher zzso has been shown to be a component of the zzso promoting factor complex and may thus regulate entry through the zzso control point into zzso It is suggested from the work presented here that, as in zzso the human zzso gene product zzso may also play a role in cell cycle control in the zzso phase of the cell zzso zzso zzso the growth of the human zzso line zzso in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and prevents cells from entering zzso zzso the cells with zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and causes the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso cell cycle in zzso and causes the zzso of zzso zzso and a reduction of zzso zzso These studies provide insights into the process of growth control and the zzso mechanism of zzso
