zzso type 4 zzso zzso zzso shows the least sequence zzso to the other zzso suggesting a distinct function for this zzso We have isolated a complete zzso corresponding to the mouse zzso which includes the signal zzso and a complete zzso features that were lacking from the human form originally zzso Mouse zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells is located at the cell surface but does not show ability to activate zzso The zzso domain was expressed in zzso coli as zzso inclusions and active zzso recovered after zzso zzso of the isolated zzso domain against synthetic peptides commonly used for zzso zzso zzso could be inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain was also unable to activate zzso and was very poor at zzso components of the zzso zzso with the exception of zzso and zzso zzso was able to zzso efficiently a zzso consisting of the zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso site, a zzso zzso fusion zzso and was found to shed zzso when zzso in zzso zzso zzso was detected by Western zzso in zzso cell lines which in combination with its zzso and zzso activity suggests a role in zzso
