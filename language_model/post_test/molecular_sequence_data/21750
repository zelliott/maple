zzso repeat zzso proteins zzso are zzso by a large gene family in zzso zzso zzso and their functions are largely zzso The few studied zzso are implicated in different zzso processes through their function in zzso metabolism and zzso regulation in plant zzso Here, we studied the functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso FOR zzso ON zzso zzso in plant defense and zzso stress zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso to zzso zzso pathogens as well as hypersensitivity to zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso expression of zzso results in the same zzso as the zzso zzso zzso indicating that a tight regulation of the zzso transcript is required for normal zzso Loss of zzso function dramatically enhanced zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso in response to salt zzso zzso of zzso synthesis and signaling partially zzso the zzso sensitivity of zzso suggesting that the zzso accumulates high zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is significantly higher in zzso and the zzso has higher zzso zzso levels, which may zzso its zzso The zzso zzso has altered expression of other zzso genes as well as zzso zzso most notably elevated levels of zzso and zzso zzso which are known for their roles in retrograde signaling induced by changes in or zzso of zzso zzso These data, coupled with its zzso zzso suggest that zzso functions in regulation of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso during zzso and zzso stress responses, likely through involvement in retrograde zzso
