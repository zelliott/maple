zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the zzso component zzso of an zzso zzso toxin as well as proteins required for its zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso coli protein zzso is required for zzso zzso expression at the level of zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso Leeds and zzso zzso Welch, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also required for the zzso of zzso levels of zzso from zzso genes in the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso supporting the role for zzso in zzso zzso All or portions of a common zzso sequence termed zzso are present in the untranslated regions of zzso zzso In this study, we tested the model that the zzso sequence and zzso are part of the same functional zzso We examined the effect of zzso deletion zzso within the untranslated leader of a zzso derived zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso protein levels in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also provide in zzso physical evidence that is consistent with zzso zzso pausing at the zzso zzso zzso
