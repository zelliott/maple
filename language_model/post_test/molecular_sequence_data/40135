In an analysis of a combined zzso digest of zzso by positive zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso several peptides were observed which showed metal zzso zzso as their most abundant zzso zzso The most prominent zzso zzso were observed at zzso values corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso investigation of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed that it was not, as originally expected, a zzso zzso zzso but had the composition zzso This was verified by several zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in the virtually exclusive formation of doubly charged zzso zzso zzso mass determination by zzso zzso zzso provided a preliminary zzso and zzso accurate mass measurement using zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso at a mass resolving power of 500 zzso allowed the specific detection and identification of the zzso zzso pairs zzso and zzso All peptides in the zzso zzso digest without a basic zzso (K or zzso showed addition of calcium as the most prominent zzso zzso A further common feature of these zzso peptides was the presence of several zzso zzso which is assumed to be a factor promoting the intense addition of zzso It was observed that the common trace levels of sodium and calcium in zzso grade zzso (about zzso zzso are sufficient to generate the zzso and zzso zzso as the most prominent species of the zzso zzso We conclude that the sequence motifs zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of alkaline earth zzso in zzso In view of the successful detection of zzso zzso interactions by zzso this finding may point to a zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso The findings open new routes of research in the study of zzso and zzso interactions
