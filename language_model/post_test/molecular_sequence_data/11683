zzso between gamma delta T cells and heat shock proteins zzso have been proposed as contributing factors in a number of diseases of possible zzso zzso but definitive evidence to support this hypothesis has been zzso In multiple sclerosis zzso a chronic inflammatory zzso disease, zzso and gamma delta T cells are known to zzso in brain zzso Analysis of T cell zzso zzso gene usage in these zzso has detected evidence of zzso within both the V delta zzso delta 1 and V delta zzso delta 3 populations of gamma delta T zzso In our own studies, using direct sequence analysis, a dominant V delta zzso delta 3 zzso sequence was found in 9 zzso brain samples, suggesting a response to a common zzso In this report, we have examined gamma delta T cell zzso gene usage in zzso peripheral blood T cell lines selected for zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso patterns for V delta zzso delta 1 and V delta zzso delta 3 were studied using the zzso chain reaction zzso and a direct sequencing technique in populations of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso cultured with zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and then selected for zzso to a zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso were obtained from health donors, patients with zzso and patients with tuberculosis zzso zzso products were subjected to direct sequence analysis to look for evidence for zzso within these T cell lines and to define the sequence of the zzso zzso region of the zzso 

In freshly isolated zzso both V delta zzso delta 1 and V delta zzso delta 3 gene zzso patterns were zzso whereas in zzso T cell lines the zzso delta chain zzso pattern was V delta zzso delta zzso zzso sequence analyses indicated that in cells zzso with zzso the V delta zzso delta 3 sequences were usually zzso and used D delta 3 zzso In four of four zzso and two of three zzso patients, the zzso sequences in the zzso T cell lines were identical to one another and to a dominant sequence previously detected in zzso brain zzso In two of three zzso T cell lines from healthy controls, the zzso sequences differed from those found in both groups of patients but were identical to one another except for a small region of zzso in the second N zzso In contrast, in freshly isolated zzso or in zzso T cell lines, the V delta zzso delta 3 gene zzso patterns were usually zzso and dominant sequences were rarely zzso 

These results support the conclusion that a zzso of gamma delta T cells in zzso zzso are responding to zzso 70 and that zzso zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso
