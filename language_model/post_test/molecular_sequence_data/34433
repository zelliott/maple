zzso T4 zzso the outer membrane of zzso coli using a zzso device composed of a gene product 5 zzso protein zzso We report that zzso zzso exerts distinct functions along the course of penetration stages induced by screw zzso A zzso zzso of zzso acts as a zzso drill bit to make a hole on the membrane and then send the lipids upward efficiently by strong charge zzso The zzso zzso zzso which degrade the zzso layer later, are shown to play novel roles to enlarge the hole and control the release of the zzso The zzso active site is protected from zzso binding during the penetration and is exposed after the zzso zzso zzso multiple functions of zzso are shown to be served in turn regulated by gradual change of zzso zzso which enables the initial infection process with single protein zzso by continuous screw zzso The results of zzso domain should be understood as the case where a zzso protein acquired multiple chemical functions through interplay with other zzso in a zzso zzso
