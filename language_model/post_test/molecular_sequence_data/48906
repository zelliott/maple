The zzso profile of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by in zzso search and zzso zzso activity zzso Twenty-five structural zzso zzso were predicted based on the zzso zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso Moreover, a predicted zzso regulatory gene was identified in addition to the previously characterized zzso The zzso profile of thirteen zzso genes during tomato plant colonization revealed that zzso zzso and zzso were highly induced between 21 and 96 h after zzso zzso zzso in five zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in the regulatory genes zzso and zzso as well as a zzso double zzso were zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction expression analyses of structural zzso genes in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated the existence of a complex zzso regulation network in zzso zzso The reduction of total zzso activity, as well as the severely reduced zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides evidence for an important role of the zzso system of this fungus in zzso
