zzso structures of zzso zzso with three different zzso zzso were subjected to energy zzso using molecular mechanics, the minimized structures analyzed and the inhibitor binding energies zzso zzso charge assignment for the hydrogen bonded zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was in good agreement with charge calculations using zzso molecular zzso zzso Root mean square zzso on zzso were small and similar for both zzso in the zzso zzso The surface zzso which had the largest B factors, changed most on zzso the zzso core and the inhibitor binding site showed little zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found to be preferable to zzso zzso zzso zzso restraints were applied for the zzso hydrogen bonds to maintain the zzso of the inhibitor binding zzso Using the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the calculated interaction energy of the three zzso with the zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The zzso groups of the zzso were changed to add or remove a zzso state zzso zzso group, and the loss in energy on the removal of this group was calculated to be zzso zzso This would represent zzso of the total measured difference in binding energy between the zzso zzso and zzso
