zzso zzso formed after donation of the zzso group of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso is zzso zzso to zzso zzso and homocysteine zzso by zzso zzso zzso In chestnut blight fungus zzso zzso zzso a zzso gene that encodes a deduced zzso protein was shown to have an zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the increased zzso of zzso zzso and SAM but decreased zzso and a remarkably increased zzso of transcripts that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso key components of the zzso zzso The zzso knockout zzso showed a zzso of slower growth rate, fewer aerial zzso loss of orange zzso absence of asexual zzso bodies and zzso and a significant reduction in zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the zzso level of transcripts of the zzso that encodes zzso A as well as genes of the zzso zzso signaling pathways including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso a target activated by the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrated that zzso is required for zzso and multiple traits of zzso in zzso by regulation of the expression of genes involved in key process of the zzso
