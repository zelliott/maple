Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from surfaces within the zzso zzso zzso zzso where robotic spacecraft are assembled and tested before zzso at the Kennedy Space Center at Cape zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarities, these strains were shown to belong to the family zzso and the zzso zzso The highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity was approximately zzso observed between the novel strains and zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso such as growth with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were useful in the discrimination of this novel species from the closely related zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed zzso values of less than zzso between strain zzso zzso and its closest zzso zzso The combination of unique zzso and zzso characteristics allowed the differentiation of these zzso and zzso zzso strains from related zzso species, and a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
