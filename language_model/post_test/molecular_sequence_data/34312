The human organic zzso transporting zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso membrane of zzso mediates the zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and drugs from blood into zzso The transport activity of zzso is influenced by positively charged zzso zzso which are facing the central zzso zzso modeling was performed to select zzso positively charged zzso zzso which may influence transport activity and zzso of zzso in the plasma zzso The modeling revealed that zzso faces the zzso and zzso is oriented to the plasma zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were generated using zzso zzso to investigate the impact of the positive charges on transport activity and zzso in the zzso Transport kinetic analyses for the zzso zzso and zzso showed a loss of function for the zzso zzso whereas the transport activity was maintained by the zzso zzso indicating that the positive charge at position zzso is important for transport activity of zzso Comparative modeling with zzso and zzso revealed that the pore size around this zzso zzso is larger in zzso and smaller in zzso compared with zzso which could be related to the respective zzso zzso Cell surface expression of zzso and zzso was decreased to 16 and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, indicating that the positive charge of zzso at position 399 is necessary for an zzso cell surface zzso Furthermore, we provide a summary of zzso zzso which influence the transport activity of zzso
