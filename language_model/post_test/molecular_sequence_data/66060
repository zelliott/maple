zzso is a zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso inhibitor zzso that is highly effective in treating zzso and drug-resistant zzso infections in clinical trials at relatively low doses ( approximately zzso zzso We have determined the structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at zzso A resolution, using an zzso crystal form engineered by systematic zzso zzso This high-resolution structure reveals that the zzso group of zzso is positioned in a zzso tunnel connecting the zzso pocket to the zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso in complexes with the double zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso adapts to bind zzso zzso In the zzso zzso structure, loss of the aromatic ring interaction caused by the zzso zzso is zzso by interactions between the zzso group of zzso and the aromatic side chain of zzso which is facilitated by an approximately zzso A shift of the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso structure, the binding mode of zzso is significantly altered so that the drug zzso to changes in the binding pocket primarily caused by the zzso zzso The flexible binding pocket acts as a molecular zzso zzso that makes a shape complementary to the zzso zzso in zzso and drug-resistant forms of zzso zzso The crystal structures provide a better understanding of how the flexibility of an inhibitor can compensate for zzso zzso
