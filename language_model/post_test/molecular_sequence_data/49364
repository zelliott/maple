zzso of 55 clinical zzso of zzso zzso coli producing the zzso toxin demonstrated that the zzso gene is systematically associated with a zzso zzso via a highly zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso as shown in the zzso zzso zzso We examined if this association could reflect a zzso of the production of these zzso zzso of zzso from an immediately upstream promoter has been shown to be controlled by means of an zzso sequence present in the zzso coding sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not regulated by elements present in the zzso An zzso covering the full zzso zzso the zzso and extending on the zzso zzso was then detected in the zzso zzso This zzso could be part of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso resulted in a zzso reduction of the zzso content of zzso The production of zzso from a zzso zzso DNA was not sensitive to zzso indicating that this factor acted on zzso zzso via the zzso zzso This way the zzso zzso mechanism might be overcome by zzso of zzso from the zzso promoter and zzso by zzso This constitutes a novel system of bacterial zzso factors zzso
