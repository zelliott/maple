zzso zzso are regulated molecules that control muscle contraction by the selective binding of zzso The essential and the regulatory light chains are regulatory zzso zzso zzso is the favorite material for studying the interactions of the light chains with the zzso heavy chain since the regulatory light chains can be zzso removed from it and its essential light chains can be zzso zzso and structural studies show that the essential light chain binds calcium provided that the zzso loop is stabilized by specific interactions with the regulatory light chain and the heavy zzso The regulatory light chains are zzso zzso zzso requires the presence of both zzso heads and an intact zzso zzso Heavy zzso is regulated and shows cooperative features of zzso while zzso is zzso The zzso heavy chains of the functionally different zzso zzso and the smooth catch muscle zzso are products of a single zzso the zzso arise from alternative zzso The differences between zzso of the zzso are clustered at surface zzso of the heavy chain and account for the different zzso activity of the two muscle zzso Catch muscles contain two regulatory light chain zzso one zzso by gizzard zzso light chain zzso zzso of the light chain does not alter zzso zzso We could not find evidence that light chain zzso is responsible for the catch zzso
