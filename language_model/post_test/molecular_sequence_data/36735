The membrane zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso cell zzso zzso which forms a zzso zzso complex with zzso zzso of zzso to the high affinity TM zzso zzso its zzso activity into an zzso potential, by zzso protein zzso The fate of TM in the presence of zzso is still zzso some authors claim that the zzso complex is zzso in zzso while others find this complex to be stable for at least 2 h at 37 degrees C on the zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the interactions of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso coupled to 5 or 15 zzso gold particles with zzso vein zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that TM can be observed both on the plasma membrane and in coated structures only in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the extent of this zzso while in double labeling experiments, where cells were incubated with 5 zzso gold coupled zzso and 15 zzso gold coupled zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso was zzso only when zzso zzso were zzso These results show that zzso complex is not significantly zzso in zzso The zzso of this complex induced by zzso zzso could play an important role in the zzso complications induced by zzso zzso
