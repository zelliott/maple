zzso sequencing and characterization of nearly full-length zzso zzso genes in 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were carried out using two novel zzso primer zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso genes from the 12 zzso were first shown not to carry any intervening sequences zzso in both the 25 and 45 zzso zzso Then, two zzso primer sets were designed in zzso for amplification of the zzso 25 and 45 regions within zzso zzso gene sequences from zzso zzso No zzso were identified within the zzso zzso genes among a total of 53 zzso of zzso zzso following zzso amplification, zzso cloning and sequencing zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in all 65 zzso zzso zzso resulting in no production of the fragmented zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may not have any opportunity to interact with any other source of zzso until now, or has been unable to integrate zzso into their own zzso
