zzso zzso channels undergo a zzso zzso change that plays a key role in modulating cellular zzso While the Open state is captured in crystal structures of zzso and a zzso zzso channel, the Close state and the mechanism of this transition are still a subject of zzso Here, we propose a model based on zzso combined with zzso of both zzso and gating currents which is consistent with the idea that the Open state is the default state, the energy of the electric field being used to keep the channel zzso Our model incorporates an zzso zzso where the bulk of sensor movement is completed without channel zzso The model accounts for the well characterized zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso where sensor movement and channel opening occur over distinct zzso zzso Moreover, the model proposes relatively small protein zzso in going from the zzso to the Open state, consistent with the rapid transitions observed in single channel records of Shaker type channels at zero zzso
