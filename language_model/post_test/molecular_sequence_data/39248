The zzso agent causing canine zzso zzso tumor zzso is thought to be the tumor cell zzso To test this hypothesis, we analyzed genetic markers including major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso in naturally occurring tumors and matched blood zzso In each case, the tumor is genetically distinct from its zzso Moreover, tumors collected from 40 dogs in 5 zzso are derived from a single zzso clone that has zzso into two zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso most likely originated from a wolf or an East Asian breed of dog between 200 and zzso years zzso Although zzso is highly zzso it has a remarkably stable zzso During progressive growth, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings have implications for understanding zzso instability in cancer, natural transplantation of zzso and the capacity of a zzso cell to evolve into a zzso zzso
