We have analyzed one of the functional zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping analysis of the zzso region of the zzso protein revealed that the terminal 18 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso are zzso for the zzso zzso zzso deletions up to the zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso activity of the zzso in zzso but increased it in zzso The zzso zzso with enhanced in zzso zzso zzso activity were found to have relaxed template specificity for zzso zzso and cellular zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso beyond the zzso zzso abolished both the zzso zzso activity and the binding ability to zzso zzso zzso a zzso of a natural template for zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso part of the zzso zzso in zzso recognition of zzso zzso
