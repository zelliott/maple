A zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso A1 DNA which zzso a zzso zzso of zzso coli has been zzso zzso coli zzso zzso which carries zzso exhibits growth zzso in the presence of vitamin B12 similar to that of the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso coli is susceptible to killing by zzso zzso 80 and zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence in the zzso DNA showed that it codes for three genes in the order of zzso This genetic organization has been reported in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and may represent a separate lineage of evolution from that of the zzso in which zzso is zzso with the accessory genes zzso and zzso A comparison of the DNA zzso the zzso locus in zzso zzso A1 and zzso zzso showed that the zzso regions are completely different between the two zzso
