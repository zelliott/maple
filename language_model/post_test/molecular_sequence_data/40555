When zzso diminution occurs during a cell division a portion of the zzso is zzso resulting in daughter cells with a smaller amount of genetic zzso In the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso diminution creates a genetic difference between the zzso and the zzso However, the function of zzso diminution remains a mystery, because the vast majority of the eliminated DNA is zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (in zzso and zzso zzso (in zzso employ zzso sex determination, but the situation in zzso zzso (in zzso is different but zzso 

We demonstrate genetically that zzso zzso employs zzso zzso diminution to eliminate an internal portion of one of the two zzso of one zzso pair in zzso zzso to zzso the eliminated DNA in zzso zzso contains a large number of zzso We demonstrate that the region undergoing diminution is zzso to the X zzso of the closely related zzso zzso The zzso regions, which are not diminished, are zzso to the zzso zzso zzso number zzso Furthermore, we found that the diminished zzso is not incorporated into zzso resulting in a zzso transmission ratio zzso 

Our data indicate that on the evolutionary path to zzso zzso the X zzso fused with an zzso zzso diminution serves to functionally restore an zzso zzso zzso A consequence of the fusion and the process that zzso with it is a transmission ratio distortion in males for certain zzso
