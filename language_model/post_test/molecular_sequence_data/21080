An important aspect in the safety assessment of transgenic plants is the exact location of zzso zzso sites within the host zzso However, robust standard operating procedures are not currently zzso Using potato as a test species, different zzso for the determination of zzso sites using a range of published protocols and commercially available kits were assessed in transgenic lines of varying degrees of complexity, from low copy number to complex zzso and zzso zzso Three commercial zzso zzso GOLD Genome Walking Kit zzso zzso DNA Walking zzso Kit II zzso and Universal zzso System zzso were compared with an zzso zzso zzso Overall, the zzso kit was used with a high success rate with low copy number potato lines, and also more complex zzso and zzso lines, and adhering to key confirmation steps it was possible to obtain zzso sequence ranging in size from 300 to zzso and eliminate zzso zzso from the zzso
