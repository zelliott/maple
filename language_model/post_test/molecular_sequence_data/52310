DNA sequences required for expression of the mouse zzso c zzso zzso IV zzso promoter were identified by transient expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is shown to depend upon upstream zzso binding sequences and two zzso repeated zzso pair sequence elements each mapping to sites of zzso zzso Each initiation region repeat contains a binding site for an zzso zzso factor which demonstrates specificity for the characteristic zzso zzso sequence motif and zzso with an zzso zzso zzso pan zzso zzso The two zzso pair repeats are sufficient for zzso activity suggesting that the zzso factor may be involved in both zzso zzso and start site zzso The zzso protein found in zzso nuclear extracts is shown to be identical or closely related to the zzso protein zzso by comparison of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso complexes formed with zzso zzso expressed zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso and the zzso factors also bind to another mouse zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The similar promoter features of these two genes suggests a possible means of coordinate zzso regulation among such respiratory zzso
