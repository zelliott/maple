zzso the use of zzso to convert light energy into chemical energy for carbon dioxide zzso is the primary zzso process linking the zzso and organic carbon pools on zzso To understand the potential effects of various environmental constraints on the evolution of zzso better, we studied the distribution, diversity, and abundance of zzso and genes involved in their synthesis along geothermal zzso in Yellowstone National Park, zzso Genes involved in zzso zzso were constrained to temperatures of less than zzso zzso and were only detected at this elevated temperature when the pH was in the zzso to alkaline zzso The upper temperature limit for the detection of zzso and zzso decreased systematically with increasingly zzso zzso an observation likely attributable to zzso which upon zzso generates zzso spring water and reduces the availability of zzso the preferred source of zzso carbon for zzso Spring pH was also the best predictor of the zzso diversity of zzso zzso The zzso similarity of zzso genes between sites was significantly correlated with that of zzso The predominance of zzso a and zzso a among extracted zzso was consistent with predominance of zzso genes affiliated with the zzso and zzso respectively, and might be related to the fact that the majority of these organisms are zzso Together, these results suggest that a combination of temperature, zzso and/or zzso influences the distribution, diversity, and evolution of zzso and the zzso that they zzso
