A family of zzso peptides zzso to sequences on different chains of zzso was zzso These zzso zzso termed zzso include the peptides zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to sequences on the zzso of zzso chains zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not affect cell survival and rate of proliferation of the normal cell types zzso The use of new sensitive zzso of cell zzso clearly demonstrated the ability of zzso bound to zzso zzso to mediate attachment of different zzso cell types including normal zzso zzso and smooth muscle zzso Here we present new active zzso bearing zzso sequences derived from the zzso of other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell zzso properties of all the zzso were found to be associated mainly with their 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides revealed that positively charged zzso account for their attachment zzso These results suggest a mechanism of direct zzso interaction of zzso with the cell zzso The extended zzso family may be applied in modulating zzso of cells to scaffolds for tissue zzso and for enhancement of zzso zzso into zzso
