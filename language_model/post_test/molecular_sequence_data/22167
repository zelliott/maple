The molecular diversity of the zzso zzso cell surface arising in zzso from local variations in genetic expression and tissue zzso may create opportunities for achieving targeted molecular imaging and zzso Here, we describe a strategy to identify zzso and their zzso zzso for targeting vascular zzso of specific zzso in zzso We zzso screen zzso libraries to select zzso zzso by using zzso zzso cell plasma zzso isolated directly from tissue and highly enriched in zzso expressed proteins exposed to the zzso To zzso liver zzso of zzso injected zzso we convert the zzso zzso into zzso fusion zzso which then are able to rapidly target select zzso in zzso as zzso directly by zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso helps identify the zzso zzso This comprehensive strategy provides new promise for harnessing the power of zzso display for mapping vascular zzso zzso in tissue and for achieving vascular targeting of specific zzso in zzso
