zzso interactions between DNA and zzso factors are necessary for zzso zzso These interactions provide a potential target for the selective zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso is a DNA binding zzso which, in the presence of zzso binds zzso containing sequences in the minor zzso The zzso early promoter contains six zzso zzso zzso which are binding sites for the zzso zzso factor, zzso Each of the six zzso binding sites of this promoter is protected from zzso 1 zzso by zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso rich sequences in the zzso early promoter prevents subsequent protein binding to these zzso The gel zzso of the zzso early promoter zzso incubated with a zzso cell extract is completely zzso by zzso of the DNA zzso with zzso The functional significance of zzso binding is reflected in the ability of zzso to block promoter zzso zzso zzso promoter dependent zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso system in a concentration dependent zzso This suggests that zzso prevents zzso zzso of the zzso early promoter by blocking binding of zzso zzso proteins to zzso rich promoter zzso
