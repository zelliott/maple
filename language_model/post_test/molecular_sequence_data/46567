Using a random zzso library designed for the zzso zzso system, we identified a zzso that binds strongly to the zzso structural protein of rice dwarf zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso showed a high zzso to the zzso region of zzso zzso truncated zzso lost its ability to interact with authentic zzso Our observations suggest that the zzso region of zzso is important for the zzso interaction, which forms the core shell structure of zzso
