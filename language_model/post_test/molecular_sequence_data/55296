Despite increasing demands to employ zzso zzso as zzso and zzso it remains a significant challenge to simultaneously reduce the particle size and enhance the particle zzso zzso to zzso chemical bonding and attractive zzso zzso zzso zzso can be incorporated by rational design in the zzso of an zzso to generate small zzso with enhanced zzso A new family of zzso zzso zzso is presented where the zzso zzso is composed of a zzso coiled zzso with zzso zzso attached to the exterior of the zzso zzso When zzso form, the zzso chains are confined in close proximity and are compressed to act as a spring to generate lateral zzso The formation of zzso zzso determines the location and the zzso of the force zzso of each zzso elastic spring so as to slow down zzso zzso Since each component of the zzso can be readily tailored, these zzso provide numerous opportunities to meet current demands for organic zzso with zzso stability in life science and energy zzso Furthermore, present studies open new avenues to use energy arising from zzso zzso chain deformation to zzso energetically stable, single zzso objects, much like zzso that zzso bulk zzso of zzso zzso
