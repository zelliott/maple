In order to study the molecular evolution of the zzso grouped in the zzso zzso zzso species complex by analysis of the zzso gene family, we have cloned and zzso two new zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a Japanese zzso zzso zzso The clones were identified by sequence zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Both clones revealed an zzso of zzso zzso coding for a protein of zzso zzso zzso The deduced molecular weights of the zzso zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes showed zzso zzso The degree of identity of zzso to the zzso gene was zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence was zzso identical to the zzso gene and zzso to the zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso zzso zzso The strains studied each have only one zzso zzso The zzso gene is located on the zzso zzso equivalent of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was on the zzso that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso marker zzso
