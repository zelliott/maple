A human zzso small cell zzso line zzso expresses abundant zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso per zzso that are zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso for the zzso on these zzso cells is approximately zzso zzso for salmon CT and approximately zzso zzso for human zzso To clone a human zzso zzso a zzso zzso library was screened using a zzso probe from a zzso zzso zzso zzso that we recently zzso One positive clone of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of this zzso into zzso cells resulted in expression of receptors with high affinity for salmon CT zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and for human CT zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso The expressed zzso was coupled to zzso zzso Northern analysis with the zzso zzso probe indicated a single transcript of approximately zzso zzso The cloned zzso encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso acids with seven potential zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso is zzso identical to the zzso although the zzso contains an insert of 16 zzso acids between zzso domain I and zzso The structural differences may account for observed differences in binding affinity between the zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The zzso are closely related to the receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso these receptors comprise a distinct family of G zzso seven zzso domain zzso Interestingly, the zzso sequence is remotely related to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but is not significantly related to other G zzso zzso sequences now in the data zzso
