The mouse zzso zzso zzso cell line is zzso suited to study the zzso transition accompanying the differentiation of primitive to zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the application of zzso agents including zzso acid or zzso of signal zzso zzso downstream of zzso triggers widespread changes in gene expression and leads to the formation of primitive zzso The zzso transition is completed and zzso zzso develops as of result of increasing zzso activity in primitive zzso zzso zzso of a zzso active form of zzso is sufficient to induce zzso cells into zzso zzso and a model is emerging that a signaling axis linking zzso signaling to zzso and the zzso protein zzso is required for zzso In this study, we found that expression of either zzso or a zzso active, zzso form of zzso promoted zzso but not zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso but not zzso caused zzso to zzso to the zzso Surprisingly, the stimulation of the zzso zzso was accompanied by nuclear zzso and primitive zzso formation, even when a dominant negative was used to block the signaling axis at the level of zzso or when ROCK activity was inhibited using the pharmacological agent zzso Together, results indicate that the coordinate signaling by two independent zzso one involving zzso zzso zzso of target genes and the other with zzso signaling to zzso proteins to zzso zzso changes, is required during the zzso acid induced differentiation of zzso cells to primitive zzso
