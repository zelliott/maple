zzso acid binding zzso zzso zzso are important components of immune zzso The organization of zzso genes in different species is consistent with rapid selection imposed by zzso We studied zzso genes in human, zzso dog, cow and zzso zzso The lineages of zzso genes in these species have undergone dynamic gene zzso and conversion, forming a potential zzso zzso zzso zzso pair in zzso and zzso A zzso zzso human zzso currently zzso as a zzso in the databases zzso is expressed in various cell lines and zzso A zzso screen for the two zzso zzso type and zzso pair zzso zzso of zzso found their zzso to be 50% amongst the UK zzso A search for donor sequences for zzso revealed a zzso of zzso zzso with charged zzso zzso predicted to associate with zzso zzso zzso In support of this, zzso was expressed at the cell surface in the presence of zzso but not the zzso zzso Using zzso specific to the zzso tail of zzso we identified zzso expression in zzso tissue zzso and in normal human brain, zzso zzso and zzso This is the first zzso human zzso zzso found to have functional and zzso zzso within the zzso
