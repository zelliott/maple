The complete zzso zzso sequence of the virulent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso The linear zzso with a zzso of zzso contained 3' zzso cohesive ends of 12 zzso A total of 51 putative open reading frames zzso were zzso zzso showed to be evolutionary closely related to the temperate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso High DNA zzso with zzso zzso was shared over the late transcribed zzso and the highest zzso with zzso was within the genetic switch zzso The truncated zzso zzso was the only zzso related gene left, which strongly suggested zzso to be recently evolved from a temperate zzso Three putative zzso and zzso were detected from the region of zzso zzso The putative origin of replication within the putative gene zzso zzso to zzso organizers resembled to that of zzso zzso The present study suggested zzso to be a new candidate for the proposed zzso zzso
