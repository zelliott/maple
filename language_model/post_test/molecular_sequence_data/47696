The growth properties of an zzso coli strain carrying a zzso deletion of the zzso genes (formerly designated zzso indicated that the products of this gene cluster are required for the zzso of sulfur from zzso zzso zzso similarity searches indicated that the proteins zzso by zzso zzso and zzso are likely to constitute an ABC type transport system, whereas zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso van der zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso fusion was zzso by zzso or zzso and depended on the presence of a functional zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso with the zzso promoter region and zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso showed that full expression of the zzso zzso required the presence of a zzso site upstream of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso regulator for the zzso zzso was not required for expression of a zzso zzso fusion although the zzso promoter region contained three zzso zzso zzso host factor could also occupy three binding sites in the zzso promoter region but had no influence on expression of a zzso zzso zzso
