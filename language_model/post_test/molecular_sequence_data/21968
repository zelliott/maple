zzso in the fruit fly zzso zzso is increasingly zzso from zzso combinations to their zzso projection patterns into the zzso lobe zzso zzso thus offers an excellent opportunity to study the evolutionary and ecological dynamics of zzso zzso We compared the structure and function of the zzso zzso zzso with that of specialist zzso zzso which zzso exclusively on zzso fruit zzso Our analyses show that whereas the zzso zzso was dominated by zzso antennae responded most strongly to zzso zzso zzso exhibited an extraordinarily strong response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was much more attracted to these zzso fruit zzso than was zzso zzso The high sensitivity to zzso was paralleled by a zzso zzso overrepresentation of zzso zzso on the antenna and a zzso zzso zzso increase in volume of the corresponding zzso as compared to zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso exhibited an extreme sensitivity down to zzso of its zzso In contrast, no peripherally zzso shift was found zzso zzso zzso increased attraction to zzso These findings are a demonstration of evolution acting at several levels in the zzso zzso in zzso a fruit zzso unique preference for fruit toxic to its sibling species zzso
