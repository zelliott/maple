The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is the only one which is zzso by zzso zzso among the zzso zzso of the putative zzso region zzso zzso et zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso transport activity of the zzso zzso was completely abolished by zzso however, zzso zzso only abolished zzso of the activity, even in the presence of an excess of the zzso Since zzso did not further zzso the zzso zzso zzso it is clear that the modified zzso zzso with a small zzso a zzso group, had significant but lower activity than the unmodified zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso zzso was inhibited in the presence of zzso These findings indicate that position 65 is close to the site of the interaction with the zzso and the modification of the side chain at this position caused zzso hindrance as to zzso zzso
