We used zzso zzso to study the chemical zzso between an zzso protein zzso containing the core zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso and a zzso zzso response element zzso a consensus zzso zzso a consensus zzso response element zzso zzso and two intermediate zzso zzso and zzso zzso parameters were determined at 20 degrees C and buffer conditions that approximate zzso zzso The association zzso for zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 85 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso at pH zzso and low zzso of an zzso and a zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The association zzso for binding to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso The implications of these numbers for the specificity and affinity for the binding of the intact zzso to DNA are zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding to a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso sequence allowed us to estimate the zzso zzso omega zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso binding to zzso The thermodynamics of the zzso zzso interaction with a zzso zzso were also investigated by determining the temperature dependence of the observed association zzso The zzso dependence in zzso zzso as a function of zzso is consistent with a change in standard heat capacity, delta zzso degree zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
