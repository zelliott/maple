We have recently cloned zzso zzso human zzso growth factor binding proteins zzso -5 and zzso and have now expressed these zzso in zzso as zzso zzso fusion zzso Western zzso zzso with zzso II under zzso conditions of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed specific binding bands for zzso zzso and zzso at apparent molecular masses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicating expression and processing of the fusion zzso zzso zzso zzso had virtually the same zzso acid zzso zzso acid number, and zzso sequences as the native zzso zzso zzso directed against each zzso -5 and zzso reacted specifically with the respective zzso as well as with the native human counterpart and displayed very low zzso with other zzso Except for the affinity of zzso for zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the affinity zzso of the three zzso for zzso I and II lie between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso DNA and zzso synthesis in human zzso cells, although zzso had only a weak zzso effect on zzso I in agreement with its relatively lower zzso I affinity zzso
