To define genes associated with the zzso disorder zzso gene expression was compared in zzso zzso cultured from three zzso patients and from three control zzso cultures by differential zzso A basic local alignment search tool search did not reveal zzso of six zzso expressed zzso fragments to previously identified expressed sequence zzso thus, one was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso The underlying zzso gene maps to zzso zzso The 3' portion of the zzso message is complementary to the 3' end of zzso zzso enabling the formation of zzso hybrids, which may interfere with zzso mismatch repair zzso Moreover, the aligned zzso sequence revealed an open reading frame identical to a hypothetical protein expressed in brain, with a similarity to zzso zzso and containing a zzso motif partially identical to zzso zzso of zzso zzso was confirmed for multiple skin cell types, suggesting its importance for skin zzso
