The effects of regulatory proteins on the expression of zzso and zzso were studied using zzso fusion zzso The expression of the zzso gene was activated by the zzso gene product and the zzso gene zzso protein zzso The zzso gene product inhibited zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso or the zzso gene product and its zzso was greater in the absence of zzso The expression of the zzso gene was activated by zzso and zzso by the zzso gene zzso The zzso gene product acted as a zzso in the absence of zzso but not in its zzso Studies using zzso fusion genes with upstream deletions showed that the region required for the zzso of zzso by zzso was within 234 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site and that that for the zzso of zzso was within 107 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the zzso zzso This supported the suggested locations of zzso binding zzso The region required for induction of zzso and zzso expression by zzso was located at the zzso site 182 zzso upstream of the zzso starting site of zzso suggesting that a sequence of zzso symmetry located 1 zzso to the left of the zzso site is a candidate for the binding site of the zzso gene zzso
