zzso response factor zzso has been shown to play a key role in cardiac cell growth and muscle gene zzso To understand the role of zzso in heart failure, we compared its expression pattern between control and failing human heart zzso Western zzso analysis of control samples showed expression of four different zzso of zzso with zzso full-length zzso being the zzso zzso Interestingly, in failing hearts we found robust expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accompanied by decreased expression of full-length zzso By zzso and Southern zzso zzso we characterized this zzso zzso zzso as being zzso by an alternatively spliced form of zzso lacking zzso 4 and 5 of the zzso primary zzso transcript zzso zzso We cloned zzso zzso and showed that zzso of this zzso into cells zzso zzso zzso of cardiac muscle zzso These results suggest that expression of zzso in failing hearts may in part contribute to impaired cardiac gene expression and consequently to the zzso of heart zzso
