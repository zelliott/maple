The identity of zzso bacteria of some marine, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was studied using zzso zzso complementary to short sequence elements of zzso zzso zzso The zzso bacteria of all species zzso with a zzso probe and those of the two former mentioned species zzso with a general probe for zzso bacteria, but not to a probe specific for zzso The results support indirect evidence suggesting that zzso bacteria of zzso zzso are zzso which depend on host zzso for zzso
