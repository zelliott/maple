zzso zzso found in zzso vegetables, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit zzso in animal models and induce zzso and cell cycle arrest in various cell zzso The zzso mechanisms of cell growth zzso by zzso are not fully zzso Our recent study showed that zzso binding to zzso proteins may be an important initiating event for the induction of zzso However, the specific protein zzso and molecular mechanisms were not zzso In this study, two-dimensional gel zzso of human lung cancer zzso cells treated with zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso may be a major in zzso binding target for zzso We examined whether binding to zzso by zzso could lead to cell growth zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was significantly reduced by zzso with relative activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All three zzso also induced zzso arrest and zzso with the same order of zzso We found that zzso disrupted zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso with the same order of zzso Mass zzso demonstrated that zzso in zzso were zzso modified by zzso Ellman zzso results indicated that the modification levels follow the same order, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results support the notion that zzso is a target of zzso and that zzso interaction can lead to downstream growth zzso This is the first study directly linking zzso zzso formation to cell growth zzso
