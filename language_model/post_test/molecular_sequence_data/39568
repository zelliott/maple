The zzso zzso zzso not only remains one of the most neglected zzso species due to its remote range, but also has been identified as a vulnerable species due to its declining zzso zzso its zzso efficiency could be a strategy for reversing its population zzso Considering the importance of zzso zzso as a primary signal in establishing maternal recognition of pregnancy zzso the present study was undertaken to characterize the zzso gene of the zzso A 588 zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso amplified using zzso DNA as the zzso Its zzso sequence comprised an entire open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a 195 zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso the zzso gene was more than zzso similar to the zzso genes of domestic and wild zzso species characterized to zzso However, zzso analysis placed zzso into a zzso containing zzso of the red zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso or zzso or other wild zzso zzso Our characterization of zzso represents the first complete sequence of any gene from the zzso
