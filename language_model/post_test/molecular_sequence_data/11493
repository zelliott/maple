zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that, as a result of zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acids and zzso zzso It is applied as a zzso in various food zzso The zzso and stability of zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso It is demonstrated that zzso zzso can be produced with improved functional zzso The zzso of zzso A is highest at low pH values and gradually decreases by almost 2 orders of magnitude when the pH of the solution exceeds a value of zzso At low zzso zzso Z exhibits a decreased zzso relative to that of zzso zzso at neutral and higher pH values, the zzso of both zzso are zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso which contain zzso zzso at positions 27 and 31, respectively, instead of zzso and zzso were produced with the aim of reaching higher zzso at neutral zzso Both zzso were zzso to zzso and their structures were confirmed by one- and two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic zzso Their zzso activities were found to be similar to that of zzso zzso whereas their zzso at pH 7 increased by factors of 4 and 7, zzso The chemical stability of zzso A was studied in the pH range of 2 to 8 and at a 20, 37, and 75 degrees zzso zzso stability was observed at pH zzso zzso Z showed a behavior similar to that of zzso zzso A zzso containing zzso at position 5 instead of zzso had lower activity but was significantly more resistant to zzso chemical degradation than zzso zzso zzso
