Three zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso from white roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso A and zzso zzso from zzso The zzso acid sequences of three of them zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined and compared with one another and with those of other higher plant zzso so far zzso zzso A and zzso zzso had zzso at four and two zzso acid sites, zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were deduced to be expressed only in root tissue on the basis of sequence studies and zzso acid compositions of all zzso isolated from the zzso zzso The root zzso zzso in this study were similar to each other, but quite different from other higher plant zzso all of which were isolated from leaf zzso The zzso activities of these zzso zzso were measured in the zzso system of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso systems isolated from zzso leaf and root zzso No distinctive zzso characteristics were observed among these zzso
