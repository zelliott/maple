The coding sequences for the variable regions of heavy and light chains of zzso zzso zzso to beet zzso yellow vein virus zzso coat protein zzso or the 25 zzso zzso protein zzso were cloned into the zzso zzso and expressed as zzso zzso fragments zzso in zzso zzso For expression in higher plants the zzso were targeted either to the zzso zzso by including the sequences zzso the zzso zzso B zzso or the zzso zzso signal peptides in the zzso zzso or they were targeted to the zzso by omitting a signal zzso sequence from the zzso The zzso were detected mainly in plants in which the zzso signal zzso had been used for targeting demonstrating for the first time the usefulness of this zzso for enabling zzso expression in zzso The zzso were not zzso into the culture zzso of suspension cultures, but were retained in the zzso The amount of expression of zzso in the best expressing plants was at least as high as in bacterial culture zzso In a dot zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were detected by the respective zzso either from zzso coli or from zzso The majority of the 21 plants expressing zzso zzso had zzso growth whereas the three plants expressing zzso zzso grew poorly and did not form zzso
