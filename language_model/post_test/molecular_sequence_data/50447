zzso in the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso is regulated by binding the viral zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to the zzso response zzso zzso zzso Here, vacuum zzso circular zzso zzso is used to study the structure of zzso and its complex with two zzso fragments that are important for zzso binding to zzso The zzso spectrum of zzso is typical of zzso zzso and is minimally zzso when bound to either the short or the long zzso zzso The CD zzso of the complexes indicate an extended structure in the zzso region of zzso from zzso acid zzso 47 through zzso 58 and a short zzso within the adjacent zzso zzso Models of zzso and its zzso complexes are constructed to integrate these zzso results with current zzso zzso The model suggests that zzso the zzso zzso region is primarily responsible for zzso interactions with the zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso side chains can additionally interact with zzso groups of the zzso bases to zzso base recognition in the complex, zzso the recognition of zzso in zzso is facilitated by the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso face of an zzso within the zzso region pairs to bases zzso at zzso positions zzso in the zzso loop and thus provides an additional motif in the zzso zzso protein to recognize zzso zzso
