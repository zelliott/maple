We characterized two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso regulate zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso which relies on zzso for zzso zzso We isolated the zzso zzso zzso a truncated form of zzso as a zzso that restores zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similar suppression zzso as zzso indicating that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a protein sharing significant similarity with zzso zzso zzso double zzso are better zzso of zzso than is either single zzso indicating that zzso and zzso function zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that suppression is due to increased zzso transcript zzso The roles of zzso and zzso are not restricted to the zzso zzso because zzso zzso zzso also suppress zzso expression defects associated with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso express significant levels of zzso even in zzso cells and this unscheduled expression results in premature zzso These zzso and interactions with zzso suggest that unscheduled zzso of zzso is probably due to a zzso in recognition of nutritional zzso
