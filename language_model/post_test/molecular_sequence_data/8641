The expression of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso was studied by zzso in whole zzso of rat hearts during zzso development zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso of zzso rats, although zzso and zzso 1 were only barely zzso All zzso were rapidly zzso during development, with zzso relative to total protein declining in the adult to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 was not zzso in adult zzso The specific activity of zzso was also zzso The rat zzso zzso becomes zzso soon after birth but continues to grow, increasing its protein content zzso to zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso An important question is thus whether the amount of zzso per zzso is zzso With the use of isolated cells, zzso showed that the contents per zzso of zzso and zzso increased approximately zzso between the zzso and adult zzso In rat zzso the rank of association with the particulate fraction was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Association of these zzso with the particulate fraction was less in the adult than in the zzso In primary cultures of zzso zzso prepared from zzso rat hearts, 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from the soluble to the particulate fraction in zzso 1 zzso after which time no further zzso was zzso zzso exposure (16 zzso of zzso to 1 zzso zzso caused essentially complete zzso of these zzso although zzso of zzso was slower than for zzso In contrast, zzso was neither zzso nor zzso by 1 zzso zzso zzso of human zzso samples also revealed zzso of zzso relative to total protein during zzso zzso
