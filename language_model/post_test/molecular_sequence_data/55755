zzso in promoters of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes from the class II major zzso complex were mapped by placing Z and X boxes of these silent genes into a synthetic zzso zzso These zzso upstream sequences zzso zzso and zzso expression to the zzso zzso Since zzso promoters containing the X box from the zzso gene and Z boxes from zzso zzso and zzso genes were neither expressed zzso in B cells nor zzso by gamma zzso in zzso cells, these zzso upstream sequences are implicated in the zzso defects of these silent zzso
