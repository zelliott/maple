zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene family, is essential for the formation of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso causes zzso zzso and lateral zzso formation in animal cap zzso and zzso of zzso with zzso a zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso Although zzso and the zzso genes are thought to be direct targets of zzso no other target genes have been zzso Here, we describe the use of zzso versions of zzso and zzso to construct zzso libraries enriched for targets of these zzso zzso Five putative targets were isolated: zzso the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso a putative zzso of the zzso gene zzso called zzso and zzso a gene of unknown zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is controlled by zzso alone as well as by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and caused defects in zzso zzso and in zzso and muscle formation, a zzso reminiscent of that observed with a zzso version of zzso called zzso The zzso genes we have isolated shed light on the mechanism of zzso function during zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells is regulated by targets including zzso and zzso while zzso movements and perhaps cell division are regulated by zzso and zzso
