zzso to direct solid phase sequencing of zzso and zzso DNA have been developed using magnetic zzso coated with zzso as solid zzso The DNA is immobilized through selective incorporation of zzso into one of the zzso A single stranded template, suitable for sequencing, is obtained through zzso zzso Using this concept, in zzso amplified zzso DNA and zzso DNA were zzso directly from single zzso The solid phase approach ensures that the amplification and the sequencing reactions can be performed under optimal zzso The system was found to be suitable for sequencing using both zzso and zzso zzso
