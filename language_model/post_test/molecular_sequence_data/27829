A systematic investigation of the influence of the zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso columns is zzso A zzso digest of bovine serum zzso and a mixture of synthetic peptides were used to monitor the separation zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso column in the presence of various amounts of zzso The data demonstrate that even traces of zzso in the sample reduce the separation efficiency and zzso zzso An extraction method is presented which reduces the zzso content in zzso zzso below the critical concentration without affecting significantly the recovery of individual zzso After zzso of the sample, the zzso is extracted into zzso alcohol zzso zzso In combination with chemical or zzso fragmentation techniques, this extraction method zzso the sequence analysis of minute amounts of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the method is demonstrated on the example of the integral membrane protein zzso
