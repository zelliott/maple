Each individual carries thousands of zzso single zzso zzso zzso in their zzso each corresponding to a single zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It is important to be able to directly detect and zzso these variations at the protein level to study zzso regulation, differential zzso zzso and other important biological zzso However, such zzso peptides are not generally detected in standard zzso analyses due to their absence from the generic databases that are employed for mass zzso zzso Here we extend previous work that demonstrated the use of customized zzso databases constructed from zzso zzso zzso We collected zzso zzso data from the zzso cell line, compiled the set of zzso that are zzso used this information to construct a customized zzso database, and searched it against zzso shotgun zzso data obtained from the same zzso This approach enabled the detection of zzso zzso peptides mapping to 395 zzso We compared these peptides to peptides identified from a large generic search database containing all known zzso zzso and found that more than zzso of the zzso peptides from this zzso search were not supported by the zzso data and thus are likely false zzso Next, we increased the zzso coverage from the zzso derived database by utilizing multiple zzso zzso thereby increasing zzso detection to zzso zzso peptides mapping to 504 zzso zzso These detected zzso peptides corresponded to moderate to high abundance transcripts zzso transcripts per million, zzso The zzso peptides included 192 zzso zzso the relative expression levels of the two zzso were evaluated for 51 of those pairs and were found to be comparable in all zzso
