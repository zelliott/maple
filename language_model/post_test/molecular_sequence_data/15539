Development of uncommon viral infections in zzso transplant recipients can pose major diagnostic zzso We present a case report of an zzso patient suffering from pneumonia, for which the zzso agent was not identified by routine zzso 

To identify the potential cause of the pneumonia using a zzso zzso primer zzso zzso that is designed to detect all zzso 

zzso was applied to zzso zzso fluid from this zzso zzso zzso products were cloned and zzso 

The novel universal virus zzso detected human zzso in the clinical zzso The finding was confirmed by two independent zzso specific zzso targeting different regions of the viral zzso 

The zzso was used to detect and identify the sequence of an unidentified zzso This study provides proof of concept for the use of clinically relevant specimens in this unbiased universal zzso which requires no previous viral sequence zzso
