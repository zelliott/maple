zzso T cells zzso recognize viral zzso as short peptides zzso displayed at the cell surface by zzso class I zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso either side of an zzso zzso zzso zzso within full-length influenza zzso zzso can impact, even zzso presentation of that zzso while having no effect on presentation of zzso zzso The most severe blocking zzso zzso to Pro at position zzso did not inhibit zzso presentation in the context of a truncated zzso zzso that this zzso is not a functional processing zzso An zzso zzso replacement also significantly reduced presentation of zzso zzso zzso while the same zzso did not affect a third zzso zzso Thus, while trends in processing specificity may exist, the zzso itself contributes to zzso sequence zzso These findings were paralleled by in zzso zzso experiments in which, depending on viral dose, subtle in zzso blocking effects were zzso zzso zzso zzso studies support a role for enhanced zzso destruction in preventing zzso as did the effect of the zzso zzso zzso which restored presentation of zzso from the zzso zzso This zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso even from zzso zzso suggesting that its production may be zzso zzso These results support the notion that point zzso of zzso zzso sequence can serve as a mechanism for viral immune zzso shed light on the mechanisms involved, and suggest that in zzso zzso may not be sensitive indicators of zzso sequence zzso
