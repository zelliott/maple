zzso zzso are manufactured by zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or 1 zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso gel pads arranged on the surface of a microscope zzso The gel pads are separated from each other by zzso glass zzso and serve as a kind of zzso zzso of 200 zzso or 20 zzso volume, zzso zzso of zzso zzso is carried out by their zzso with chip pads containing immobilized zzso DNA extracted separately from each pad is transferred onto a sequencing chip and analyzed zzso The zzso containing a set of zzso was zzso zzso then zzso with DNA and zzso in a zzso manner with a zzso stacked zzso Several cycles of successive zzso of the zzso zzso with different zzso stacked zzso and zzso with DNA were carried out to sequence DNA containing zzso zzso Combined use of these techniques show significant promise for sequence comparison of zzso regions in different zzso and for sequence analysis of comparatively long DNA fragments or DNA containing internal zzso
