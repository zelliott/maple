Genome research in farm animals will expand our basic knowledge of the genetic control of complex traits, and the results will be applied in the livestock industry to improve meat quality and zzso as well as to reduce the zzso of zzso A combination of quantitative trait locus mapping and zzso analysis is a useful approach to reduce the overall effort needed to identify genes associated with quantitative traits of zzso 

We constructed a full-length enriched zzso library from zzso zzso zzso The estimated average size of the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and the zzso fullness ratio was zzso In total, we deposited zzso high-quality sequences in the zzso division of zzso zzso zzso zzso For all the expressed sequence tags zzso approximately zzso zzso of zzso sequence were generated with an average length of zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and assembly of these zzso resulted in a total of zzso unique sequences with zzso zzso zzso and zzso singleton zzso zzso From a total of zzso unique zzso zzso zzso were similar to other zzso and zzso zzso were identified as having no hit or low identity zzso and zzso coverage in The Institute for zzso Research zzso gene index of zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso of unique sequences showed that approximately zzso zzso and zzso were assigned molecular function, biological process, and cellular component GO terms, zzso A total of zzso putative novel transcripts resulted after comparison and filtering with the zzso zzso these included a large percentage of zzso zzso and a small proportion of zzso zzso 

The sequence data generated in this study will provide valuable information for studying expression profiles using zzso zzso and assist in the zzso of current pig zzso into clusters representing longer stretches of zzso zzso The isolation of genes expressed in zzso tissue is the first step toward a better understanding of zzso tissue on a zzso zzso
