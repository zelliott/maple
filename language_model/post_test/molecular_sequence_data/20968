zzso zzso a zzso agent of zzso has at least two types of thin, zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso zzso to the names of major zzso which can be zzso by filament length and by the size of their major zzso zzso zzso zzso are long filaments that are easily detached from cells, whereas zzso zzso are short filaments that are tightly bound to zzso However, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso a gene downstream of zzso produced long filaments (10 times longer than those of the zzso easily detached from the cell surface, similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contributed to stronger zzso of bacterial zzso zzso of the zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in trans restored the parental zzso zzso is present in the outer membrane of zzso zzso but does not zzso with the zzso zzso However, zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso are associated with each other in whole zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso including double zzso confirmed that zzso was located on the cell surface and likely associated with zzso zzso zzso may therefore play a role as an anchor for the zzso zzso and also as a regulator of zzso filament zzso Two additional downstream genes zzso and zzso are zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins derived from zzso zzso and zzso appear to be accessory zzso zzso
