The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso zzso each contain a discrete zzso domain zzso at the zzso or zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso the zzso can be fused to the gene of a protein of zzso Using this approach hybrid proteins can be engineered which bind zzso to cellulose and exhibit the biological activity of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, and a zzso zzso from an zzso zzso are zzso zzso The fusion zzso zzso and zzso are sensitive to zzso at the junctions between the fusion zzso zzso results in a mixture of zzso and zzso these bind to cellulose if one or both of the zzso carry a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fusion zzso could be used in this way to purify zzso which associate with the fusion zzso
