zzso zzso is able to zzso on a variety of organic and zzso zzso including nitrate and zzso zzso of nitrate to zzso and zzso to ammonium is zzso by zzso nitrate and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Global regulator zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for growth of zzso on both nitrate and zzso In this study, we discovered that zzso zzso are not only severely deficient in nitrate or zzso zzso but are also hypersensitive to zzso This zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso Using random zzso zzso we obtained 73 zzso zzso strains resistant to zzso zzso zzso sites in 24 zzso strains were exclusively mapped in the region upstream of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso resulting in expression of the zzso now driven by a zzso zzso Further investigation indicated that the promoter in zzso strains comes from the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene zzso the essential zzso II of the zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso
