A zzso gene zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso by the method of zzso The zzso open reading frame consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso specificity study revealed that the zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso This zzso shows higher activity against zzso zzso of zzso than those of zzso or zzso The zzso exhibited the zzso activity at zzso and the optimal pH was zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso as the zzso zzso modeling and zzso zzso showed that there should be one active center responsible for the zzso activity in this zzso since the active site pocket was substantially wide to allow the entry of zzso zzso and zzso which zzso the zzso relationship in zzso zzso zzso zzso results indicated that zzso and zzso were the essential zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso values obtained by zzso zzso indicated that the zzso has higher activity against zzso than those of zzso and zzso These observations are in conformity with the results obtained from experimental zzso zzso such zzso specificity makes this zzso of great interest for further study on zzso and zzso reaction zzso
