We aimed to study the relationship between the zzso B virus zzso zzso core zzso stop zzso zzso and zzso liver damage among zzso B e zzso zzso zzso 

Liver biopsy specimens of 55 zzso chronic zzso patients were zzso A zzso activity index was scored for degree of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as described by zzso et zzso zzso DNA was determined by a zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso at the core zzso region and the S zzso zzso samples were directly zzso for core promoter and zzso zzso and examined by restriction zzso length zzso for zzso 

zzso males and 14 females at a median age of 43 were zzso zzso DNA was zzso in 32 zzso and 37 zzso patients by the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at the time of liver zzso The median zzso zzso and zzso scores were 5 zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso by either the zzso zzso or zzso was associated with a higher zzso zzso Eleven and 31 patients had zzso B and C zzso zzso zzso C zzso was associated with higher zzso than zzso B zzso Core promoter zzso and zzso stop zzso zzso were detected in zzso and zzso patients, respectively, but they were not associated with higher zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso DNA and zzso C zzso but not core promoter or zzso stop zzso zzso are associated with more severe liver damage in zzso zzso
