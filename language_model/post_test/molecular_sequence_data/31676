A zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso from an animal isolate of zzso zzso consists of a mosaic of genetic fragments from different zzso zzso A zzso of zzso was confirmed in zzso zzso from a zzso A complete zzso with a zzso zzso is integrated into a zzso zzso region harboring a putative zzso exclusion system, a putative zzso zzso zzso and key components of a type IV zzso zzso Moreover, zzso encodes a putative zzso family zzso protein and a zzso and, thus, in total has all genetic components essential for zzso zzso A zzso element within zzso zzso among others, putative proteins similar to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso which may contribute to the detected low-level zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso encodes a novel zzso resistance locus that is associated with reduced zzso to zzso when transferred to zzso zzso The expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso indicating an active zzso system which may contribute to stabilizing zzso within new zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing confirmed that zzso excised to form a circular intermediate in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Transfer between zzso zzso cells was observed in the presence of helper zzso zzso zzso analysis of the original zzso zzso donor and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso in a zzso manner into the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
