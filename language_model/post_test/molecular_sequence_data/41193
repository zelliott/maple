Although zzso are known to zzso various animals by adapting to new zzso zzso transmission events are still poorly zzso During a surveillance study from 2005 to 2010, a novel zzso zzso zzso was detected in two very different bat species, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bats in the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in Pomona zzso bats zzso zzso zzso bats in the zzso zzso in Hong zzso Although infected bats appeared to be healthy, Pomona zzso bats carrying zzso zzso had lower body weights than zzso zzso To investigate possible zzso transmission between the two bat species, the complete zzso of two zzso zzso and six zzso zzso strains were zzso Genome and zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso represented a novel zzso species, sharing highly similar zzso except in the genes zzso spike zzso which had only zzso zzso acid zzso Evolution of the spike protein was also rapid in zzso zzso strains from 2005 to 2006 but stabilized zzso zzso analysis dated the most recent common zzso of all zzso zzso strains to 1959 zzso zzso density regions at zzso zzso 1886 to 2002) and that of zzso zzso to 1986 zzso 1956 to zzso The data suggested recent zzso transmission from zzso zzso to Pomona zzso bats in southern zzso zzso the rapid zzso genetic change in zzso zzso spike protein by zzso zzso acid divergence after recent zzso transmission was even greater than the zzso zzso acid divergence between spike proteins of severe acute respiratory zzso zzso bat coronavirus zzso in bats and zzso This study provided the first evidence for zzso transmission of coronavirus between bats of different zzso
