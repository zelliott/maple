zzso virus zzso the sole member of the zzso zzso in the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso a single zzso zzso zzso containing sequences from the 3' end of the zzso zzso including the open reading frame zzso that encodes the zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso is initiated internally on a zzso zzso template at a site known as the zzso promoter zzso zzso the zzso zzso was initiated by using an infectious zzso zzso zzso in which the region containing the zzso was duplicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Frey, zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is followed by the first zzso zzso the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso the second zzso zzso and the structural protein zzso The duplicated zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site, including the 3' zzso zzso of the zzso and 47 zzso between the zzso and the zzso start zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso (9 zzso beyond the 3' end of the zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso in terms of virus replication and zzso zzso zzso beyond this point impaired zzso however, the analysis was complicated by zzso zzso between zzso and zzso that resulted in deletion of the zzso gene and resurrection of viable virus with one zzso Since the zzso region was not necessary for zzso activity, subsequent mapping was done by using both zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which the zzso is replaced with the reporter zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso infectious zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso deletions to zzso zzso resulted in the synthesis of zzso zzso In the infectious zzso deletions through zzso zzso gave rise to viable zzso A series of short internal deletions confirmed that the region between zzso zzso and the zzso start site was essential for viability and showed that the repeated zzso zzso at the zzso end of zzso zzso was also zzso Thus, the minimal zzso maps from zzso zzso through the zzso start site and appears to extend to at least zzso zzso although a larger region is required for the generation of virus with a zzso zzso Interestingly, while the positioning of the zzso zzso immediately adjacent the zzso start site is thus similar to that of members of the zzso zzso the other zzso in the zzso family, it does not include a region of zzso sequence zzso with the zzso zzso that is located between zzso zzso and zzso zzso with respect to the zzso start site in the zzso zzso
