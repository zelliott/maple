zzso zzso zzso regulates the flux of zzso fatty acids into the zzso for subsequent zzso A zzso zzso segment of the promoter for the gene zzso the 68 zzso zzso was isolated from a rat zzso DASH zzso library using the zzso chain zzso The promoter contained a consensus binding sequence for zzso zzso zzso response element binding zzso at zzso to zzso and for zzso alpha zzso binding zzso at zzso to zzso zzso I zzso using proteins isolated from rat liver zzso indicated the presence of several regions of nuclear protein zzso most notably at zzso to zzso at zzso to zzso and at a wide region encompassing zzso to zzso zzso I zzso studies with zzso zzso and zzso alpha confirmed that protein binding to DNA occurred at the sites predicted by the consensus zzso The segment containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence plus 181 zzso of untranslated zzso was zzso to the structural gene for zzso zzso zzso When this zzso was zzso into zzso zzso cells, zzso activity was zzso zzso by addition of 1 zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the expression zzso coding for the zzso zzso of protein zzso A zzso The ability of several known second zzso and zzso factors to stimulate zzso of 68 zzso zzso zzso reporter was tested in zzso zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso activity was zzso zzso by addition of zzso and this induction was depressed 50% by the addition of zzso zzso When the 68 zzso zzso zzso reporter was zzso with an expression zzso for zzso or zzso zzso zzso was increased 3- and zzso zzso zzso caused an additional zzso induction in the presence of each factor to yield zzso and zzso induction zzso zzso of the expression zzso for zzso also increased the zzso activity driven by the 68 zzso zzso promoter, while zzso with the expression zzso for zzso had no zzso When expression zzso for both zzso and zzso were zzso with the 68 zzso zzso promoter, zzso depressed the induction seen with zzso zzso
