Within the zzso zzso untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso three highly variable regions were zzso zzso the zzso start zzso multiple cryptic zzso zzso and several small open reading frames are characteristic for all the five zzso zzso of the context of zzso revealed that the zzso initiation zzso of zzso has a weak context for efficient translation zzso The most favorable context was found in two of the cryptic zzso Two zzso tracts upstream to the zzso either cryptic or authentic zzso in the zzso of zzso were identified and zzso of their zzso sequences are complementary to the consensus sequence at the 3' zzso of zzso zzso zzso A secondary structure model for the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso sequence comparison among five zzso led to the identification of a variable region and a zzso region in the zzso A deletion of 41 zzso was found within the variable region in zzso A secondary structure model for the zzso was also zzso The structural similarity of the zzso between zzso and zzso and zzso C viruses was demonstrated and the possible implications of features of the zzso and zzso of zzso are zzso
