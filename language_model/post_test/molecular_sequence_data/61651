zzso progression through zzso is essential to reduce segregation errors in the cell's genetic zzso We have used a zzso screen to identify a zzso that zzso through zzso zzso and have cloned the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein related to zzso and other zzso zzso zzso We show that loss of zzso function leads to premature zzso zzso zzso premature zzso exit, errors in zzso zzso and failure to delay zzso exit under conditions that normally evoke the zzso zzso checkpoint zzso Whereas premature zzso exit is dependent upon zzso promoting complex function, premature zzso zzso is zzso We conclude that zzso is zzso required for orderly zzso progression under normal growth conditions and also required for the conditional zzso zzso checkpoint zzso
