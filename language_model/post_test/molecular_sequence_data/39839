zzso S zzso and its zzso zzso are thought to have a role in asthma zzso a number of single zzso zzso within zzso have been shown to be associated with an increased zzso of zzso One such single zzso zzso leads to the zzso zzso zzso which results in an increase in the potency of zzso for zzso To gain insight into zzso relationships within zzso and zzso we first carried out a limited structural characterization of zzso and subjected the zzso to extensive zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso third of zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are necessary and sufficient for zzso of zzso Furthermore, part of a nascent zzso within the zzso spanning zzso 5 through 13, acts as a regulatory region that zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso is absent in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso 107 interacts with the aforementioned regulatory region of zzso Whereas this interaction may be at the root of the increase in potency associated with the zzso zzso we show here that the zzso also causes an increase in zzso expression of the zzso zzso leading to a zzso increase in the zzso efficacy zzso of zzso Our results identify the key zzso of zzso involved in zzso zzso and suggest a molecular basis for the functional effects of the zzso zzso and for its putative zzso link with zzso
