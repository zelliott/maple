zzso zzso and related zzso aromatic zzso zzso are highly toxic to most zzso animals, but there are dramatic differences in sensitivity among species and zzso Aquatic birds including the common zzso zzso zzso are highly exposed to zzso in the environment, but are up to zzso less sensitive to these compounds than the typical avian model, the domestic chicken zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso toxicity involves altered gene expression subsequent to zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse strain differences in sensitivity to zzso and zzso aromatic zzso but the role of the zzso in species differences in zzso sensitivity is not well zzso Here, we show that although chicken and zzso zzso both exhibit specific binding of zzso the zzso zzso has a lower binding affinity and exhibits a reduced ability to support zzso zzso as compared to zzso from chicken or zzso We further show through use of zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso that the difference between the chicken and zzso zzso resides in the zzso domain and that two zzso acids zzso and zzso are responsible for the reduced activity of the zzso zzso Other avian species with reduced sensitivity to zzso also possess these zzso These studies provide a molecular understanding of species differences in sensitivity to zzso compounds and suggest an approach to using the zzso as a marker of zzso zzso in zzso
