zzso zzso were released by mild acid degradation of the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso strain, a zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and a zzso zzso strain zzso Studies by sugar analysis and partial acid zzso along with zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso from both strains have the same zzso repeating unit of the following zzso zzso where zzso stands for zzso zzso for zzso acid, zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso ( approximately zzso or zzso ( approximately zzso The structure of the zzso studied resembles much that of a marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this zzso The latter differs in zzso the absolute zzso of zzso acid zzso vs zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso replacement of zzso with its zzso zzso zzso
