The zzso of zzso zzso was studied in zzso Of the zzso tested, zzso and its zzso zzso exhibited the strongest zzso against the zzso from rat zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso by zzso was competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with respect to the zzso protein zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were also zzso but less potent ones than zzso The zzso zzso with one or both primary zzso groups replaced by the zzso group did not zzso A number of zzso including zzso were found to display little or no zzso The observed effects of naturally occurring zzso on zzso zzso activity is consistent with a suggestion of regulation of this zzso activity by cellular levels of zzso A synthetic zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence of which zzso to that surrounding zzso in zzso initiation factor zzso was found to display zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso from Chinese zzso zzso zzso Free zzso and zzso on the other hand, possessed no zzso zzso A zzso analogous to the zzso zzso with zzso in place of zzso had little effect on zzso zzso The preparation of a zzso of zzso suitably protected for use in the zzso synthesis of zzso zzso is zzso
