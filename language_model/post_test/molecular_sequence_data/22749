zzso attachment of fatty acids to proteins is a common form of protein modification which has been shown to influence both structure and interaction with zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is zzso zzso by the fatty acids zzso and zzso We have zzso four peptides corresponding to the first 28 zzso acids of the zzso region of zzso Besides the zzso zzso zzso three additional peptides with different degrees of zzso have been zzso zzso doubly zzso and zzso zzso and doubly zzso zzso itself, zzso and/or zzso zzso the zzso the ability to adopt extended zzso indicated by the fact that the CD spectrum of all zzso peptides has a minimum at approximately 215 zzso characteristic of zzso zzso The zzso sequence interacts with model zzso composed of zzso zzso probably through zzso interactions with the polar zzso of the zzso However, the zzso peptides are able to insert deeply into the zzso core of both neutral and zzso zzso maintaining the spectral features of extended zzso When zzso zzso containing cholesterol and zzso at zzso were used, the zzso of the zzso zzso almost completely canceled the zzso transition, although the interaction of the other zzso peptides also reduced the transition zzso but to a much lower extent and affected only the zzso chains in the fluid zzso
