We present the complete zzso sequence of the essential zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a valuable case study for several zzso First, it is hosted by a zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso of zzso are still poorly known because of a lack of extensive molecular zzso Second, the single species zzso zzso contains both symbiotic and zzso zzso allowing for a comparison between closely related organisms with different zzso Third, zzso zzso zzso strains are exceptional by themselves because of their small zzso size, reduced zzso flexibility, and high worldwide abundance in freshwater zzso We provide a comparative analysis of zzso zzso metabolism and explore the peculiar features of a zzso reduction that occurred on an already streamlined zzso We compare this unusual system with current hypotheses for zzso erosion in zzso and zzso bacteria, propose modifications to the presently accepted model, and discuss the potential consequences of zzso DNA zzso zzso
