The results of this study clearly demonstrates the utility of novel zzso zzso systems in zzso transfer of zzso into and across deeper strata of skin following topical zzso These findings indicate that it may be possible to deliver therapeutic doses of a wide variety of peptides to local skin tissue via topical zzso The results also suggest the possibility of controlled enhancement of skin penetration or zzso zzso deposition through appropriate choice of zzso zzso zzso The pronounced enhancement of zzso and zzso transport from zzso containing the zzso lipids suggests a promising delivery system for zzso drugs in zzso
