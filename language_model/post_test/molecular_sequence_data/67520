zzso H zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso backbone of the zzso template within an zzso hybrid to complete the synthesis of zzso viral zzso In the present study we have determined the complete structure of the zzso H domain from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The basic zzso motif of the zzso zzso H domain is folded as a short zzso and an adjacent highly bent zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso experiments suggest that the basic zzso motif plays a role in direct binding to the major groove in zzso hybrid, as well as in establishing the zzso among zzso in zzso necessary for proper zzso
