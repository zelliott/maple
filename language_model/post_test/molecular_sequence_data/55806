The zzso zzso group consists of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we report zzso sequences for zzso and for 2 zzso of both zzso and zzso Combining these results with previously determined sequences for zzso zzso and zzso enables molecular comparison of all the zzso defined A10 zzso They form a closely related and zzso group of zzso which may have originated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso are correlated with sequence and a public zzso shared by zzso and members of the A10 family is localized to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to have derived from zzso by single gene conversion events with other zzso zzso In the case of zzso the donor zzso was probably an zzso zzso as zzso has a small element of sequence in the alpha 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso uniquely shared with zzso The zzso structure of zzso explains the zzso of zzso molecules with both A10 and zzso zzso The rare Oriental zzso of zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso that differs from zzso by a unique zzso substitution which changes zzso to zzso at position 116 in the floor of the zzso binding zzso Thus zzso is a functionally distinct zzso that originated by a point zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found to have very similar structures, explaining the difficulty in their zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
