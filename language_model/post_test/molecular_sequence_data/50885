zzso zzso were constructed in which a synthetic gene of human zzso growth factor zzso joined with a gene coding for the leader zzso to one of the zzso coli outer membrane major proteins zzso is controlled by zzso zzso The increase of the zzso yield was achieved by the zzso of the gene zzso The zzso in bacterial cells was zzso into zzso The zzso protein was isolated by means of reverse phase zzso as almost zzso preparation zzso than zzso the yield being 7 zzso bacterial zzso The sequence of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso of the isolated zzso coincided with that of the natural zzso The preparation proved to be biologically zzso
