The genetic zzso responsible for zzso in zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso induced zzso zzso has recently been mapped zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso exchange between zzso and zzso to the zzso at the 3' end of the zzso This region of zzso and zzso differs in 11 zzso Of these 11 zzso differences, 9 are distributed within the two zzso the two zzso zzso and the two zzso elements of the zzso Since both the zzso binding sites of zzso are zzso with respect to those of zzso we compared nuclear proteins of a zzso zzso cell line and a zzso cell line zzso which bind to the zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso Using both the zzso zzso and southwestern analysis with labeled synthetic zzso we showed that a zzso protein from zzso and zzso cells bound specifically to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso 6 of the zzso consensus, zzso significantly reduced binding of the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso However, the zzso of zzso 3 from zzso had little effect on the binding of the zzso protein to the zzso zzso In addition, the zzso protein bound zzso to the zzso element of zzso A zzso virus, zzso was generated by introducing the two zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso Although the zzso period of zzso in the induction of zzso was not significantly different from that of zzso preliminary findings suggest that the zzso induced by zzso may be more widely zzso
