zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are zzso in many types of cancer cells and have been implicated in tumor growth and zzso While zzso zzso regulation of the zzso promoter has been well zzso regulation in cancer cells remains to be zzso We recently reported zzso results demonstrating that increased zzso group zzso zzso protein expression zzso with increased zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso analysis indicates a potential for multiple zzso binding sites within the human zzso zzso In order to better define the underlying molecular mechanisms that zzso uses to facilitate zzso transformation of cancer cells, we have used a variety of methods to determine whether zzso directly regulates the human zzso promoter in breast and zzso cancer zzso Our results indicate that: zzso zzso promoter activity is significantly higher in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso protein binds to zzso regions of the zzso promoter DNA both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso regions zzso zzso binding in zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly decreases zzso of zzso in zzso human zzso cancer zzso In addition, zzso cells with transgenic zzso zzso stained positive for the zzso protein by zzso and zzso and were zzso by zzso zzso The cumulative evidence indicates that zzso positively regulates the human zzso promoter in breast and zzso cancer cells and implicates serum zzso as a diagnostic marker for zzso zzso
