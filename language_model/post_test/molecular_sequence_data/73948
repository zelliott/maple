zzso differentiation is regulated both positively and zzso by external growth factors such as insulin, zzso growth factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso A key component of the zzso differentiation process is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the relationship between zzso zzso and growth factor stimulation in zzso we investigated the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso zzso activity in a transient reporter zzso In zzso zzso labeling experiments demonstrated that zzso is a zzso that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso by zzso activated zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence revealed a single zzso zzso consensus recognition site at zzso zzso of zzso to Ala inhibited both in zzso and in zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso contributes to the reduction of zzso zzso activity by growth factor zzso
