We have identified an zzso acid sequence in the zzso zzso zzso protein that is capable of directing a zzso protein to nuclear zzso regions of the nucleus previously shown to contain high zzso of zzso small nuclear zzso and zzso zzso This sequence contains a zzso zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso and a repeating zzso zzso zzso sequence adjacent to a short stretch of basic zzso zzso zzso comparisons from a number of other zzso factors that zzso to nuclear zzso reveal the presence of one or more copies of this zzso We propose a zzso zzso zzso mechanism for zzso zzso The first step is transport across the nuclear envelope via the zzso zzso while the second step is association with components in the speckled domain via the zzso zzso zzso
