The zzso and zzso zzso zzso constitute the zzso zzso abundant in the zzso of the zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso however, are not present in the zzso of a closely related zzso zzso zzso To study the evolution of zzso zzso in zzso we have analyzed all zzso elements and highly zzso zzso sequences identified in the recently completed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso major zzso The coding sequences of 242 zzso zzso elements zzso in all three zzso were zzso by removing the numerous frame zzso Three independent zzso analyses conducted on the zzso zzso zzso by these elements show that all zzso including the 52 zzso major zzso form a zzso group belonging to the zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso contained active mobile elements that have been retained in the zzso species, but were lost from zzso major zzso where only remnants zzso are zzso All 242 zzso analyzed group together according to their species origin with the exception of 11 zzso zzso zzso which are close to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Considering the absence of known horizontal transfer between the African zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso this suggests that this group of elements evolved at a lower rate when compared to the other zzso zzso Interestingly, the only zzso sequence zzso between zzso and zzso (the first 79 zzso is also present at the zzso of all the full length zzso and suggests a possible role for this zzso zzso as well as for zzso
