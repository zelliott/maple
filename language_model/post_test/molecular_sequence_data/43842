We have previously shown that chick muscle extracts contain at least 10 different zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present studies, one of the zzso called zzso was partially zzso by conventional zzso procedures using zzso zzso as a zzso The zzso zzso behaved as a zzso protein under both zzso and zzso conditions, suggesting that it consisted of a single zzso zzso It was zzso active at zzso between 8 and 9, but showed little or no activity at pH below 6 and above zzso Like other zzso its activity was strongly inhibited by zzso blocking zzso such as zzso and by zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso extension protein of 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso was also capable of generating free zzso from zzso zzso and from zzso zzso chains that are zzso to proteins through zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play an important role in the generation of free zzso from zzso protein zzso and linear zzso as well as in recycling of zzso molecules after degradation of zzso protein zzso by the zzso zzso
