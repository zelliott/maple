Several conditions have been used in the zzso reaction of zzso zzso at elevated temperature zzso but we have elected the following as our first choice: zzso zzso excess of zzso M zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso amount of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 degrees C, conventional zzso In this study, aimed to further examine zzso under such condition and study the zzso of our protocols to zzso peptides containing zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso were manually zzso zzso at 60 degrees C using conventional heating and at 60 degrees C using zzso zzso zzso assessment of all crude peptides (in their intact and/or fully zzso zzso revealed that, except for the zzso zzso of zzso all other reactions occurred with low levels of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso provide new zzso that our protocols for zzso at 60 degrees C using conventional heating are suitable for routine use, zzso demonstrate their appropriateness for zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso disclose advantages and limitations of the three synthetic approaches zzso Thus, this study zzso our past research on zzso and suggests alternative conditions for zzso zzso
