zzso is a recently discovered zzso zzso zzso zzso of which is associated with zzso mental zzso Since little is known about the cellular zzso of zzso in central and peripheral zzso we investigated its expression by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso cells forming zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso nerve and zzso roots of zzso rat and human, in zzso cells of the adrenal zzso and in zzso cells associated with sympathetic zzso No zzso was detected in sympathetic zzso in zzso cells surrounding these zzso in zzso nerve or in spinal zzso zzso The full length zzso sequence was determined from guinea-pig zzso zzso The translated zzso acid sequence was zzso identical to the published human zzso zzso Western zzso revealed two protein forms which were expressed to different relative zzso in different zzso A 91 zzso form was zzso in extracts of zzso nerve whereas a 36 zzso form was relatively more abundant in adrenal zzso and zzso Greater amounts of the full length zzso protein occurred in the zzso nerve of adult rats, compared with zzso rats, which reflects the development of zzso The presence of multiple forms does not appear to be due to alternative zzso zzso since zzso products amplified from a variety of zzso were identical and only a single zzso transcript of zzso zzso was identified by Northern zzso These findings demonstrate that a major site of zzso expression is peripheral zzso
