The gem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso snails in the family zzso A gene zzso of zzso peptides expressed in zzso zzso ducts was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso duct zzso clones revealed two different zzso zzso zzso with identical signal zzso a largely zzso pro region, and a zzso zzso mature zzso zzso The zzso signal sequence was used to successfully amplify zzso genes from three other zzso zzso all had the same pattern of zzso zzso in the predicted mature zzso zzso Although the signal sequence and zzso regions were highly zzso the mature toxin regions zzso greatly in zzso except that the zzso zzso were zzso We designate this as the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of two members of the family directly from zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso acid sequence analysis revealed that these peptides are highly zzso zzso With at least zzso as many species of zzso as cone zzso identification of rapidly diversifying gene zzso such as the zzso of zzso is essential before the facile and systematic discovery and characterization of zzso toxins from zzso zzso can be zzso
