Four zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso or zzso chemical functions in each of the three chemical regions of zzso were zzso as alternative zzso of zzso I zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were zzso presenting zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, very similar to the zzso of zzso zzso measured for zzso and zzso of 40 and 4 zzso compared with 2,200 zzso for zzso The low zzso efficiency of these zzso permits the study of activity at in zzso zzso zzso zzso was a competitive inhibitor of zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not an zzso zzso 3 and 4, obtained by modification of the zzso and zzso groups of zzso were neither zzso nor zzso of zzso highlighting the importance of these zzso for recognition by zzso zzso is a suicide zzso About zzso turnovers zzso to zzso zzso zzso Such a property can be exploited to reveal and zzso zzso transfer from zzso to other proteins at in zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso with an apparent zzso of zzso zzso The rate of zzso increased with the concentration of zzso indicating a preferential or exclusive reaction with the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso much more slowly, and unlike zzso it did not protect against zzso by zzso This and the ineffectiveness of zzso as a competitive inhibitor have been related to the presence of two zzso active zzso zzso of zzso was identified by mass zzso as the reacting zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed less than zzso zzso zzso zzso alignments and comparisons of zzso structures of different zzso zzso indicate that zzso might serve as a zzso donor during zzso
