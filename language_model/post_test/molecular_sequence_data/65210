A zzso zzso tandem zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso zzso zzso zzso approach for structural characterization of protein zzso is zzso Identification of zzso peptides is based solely upon mass measurement by high field zzso zzso zzso zzso The location of the modification within any zzso is then established by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso information is zzso by use of electron capture zzso zzso and/or infrared zzso zzso zzso The zzso utility of the method is demonstrated by characterization of protein zzso A zzso zzso In a single zzso zzso experiment, 30 zzso zzso peptides (including three zzso were mass measured by internal zzso to within an absolute mean error of zzso zzso The location of each of the three sites of zzso was then determined by zzso and zzso experiments, in which zzso and zzso provide complementary zzso sequence zzso In two out of three cases, electron zzso of a zzso zzso + zzso zzso produced an abundant zzso zzso + zzso zzso but few zzso c and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso radical zzso resulted in the detection of a large number of zzso zzso products zzso and zzso zzso but no b or y type zzso The utility of activated zzso zzso for the characterization of zzso zzso was then zzso
