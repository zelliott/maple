zzso zzso is an essential precursor of zzso and the zzso zzso region of zzso cell zzso In zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso shows strong zzso to the zzso protein involved in the formation of zzso from other zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso two sequential steps in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso Since zzso of zzso synthesis often results in cell zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso is a potential zzso zzso drug zzso In this study we cloned zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso and expressed soluble zzso protein in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso tuberculosis zzso protein exhibits both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also investigated the effect on zzso zzso when the activity of zzso is fully removed or reduced via a genetic zzso The results showed that activity of zzso is required for growth of zzso zzso as the bacteria did not grow in the absence of active zzso zzso As the amount of functional zzso zzso was gradually reduced in a temperature shift experiment, the zzso zzso cells became zzso and their zzso changed from a normal rod shape to zzso zzso and in some cases they zzso Finally a zzso plate based zzso for zzso activity with an zzso read out was zzso These studies therefore support the further development of zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso as a target for new zzso zzso
