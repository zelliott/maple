zzso is a gene zzso a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso previously isolated from the citrus hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA of zzso zzso with zzso suggested the presence in the hybrid of another gene zzso another zzso zzso A zzso clone from this new gene zzso was isolated using zzso from the other parent zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids that showed zzso identity with zzso and its expression product zzso the in zzso conversion of zzso to zzso confirming that it zzso to another active zzso zzso of zzso DNA and isolation of zzso clones of zzso and zzso revealed that the parental sources of these genes in the hybrid were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequences of zzso and zzso showed that both genes contained two zzso which are also zzso in zzso genes of other species like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of transcript levels in the zzso zzso hybrid by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction showed that zzso was expressed mainly in zzso leaves and seeds, and zzso in flower buds and flowers at zzso with the genes having similar transcript levels in young developing zzso
