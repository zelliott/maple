zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso is a human pathogen of the zzso family which zzso and spreads in the nervous zzso zzso play a key role in the process of assembly and maturation of zzso which is essential for zzso and zzso zzso zzso B zzso is a main component of the zzso envelope and is necessary for the production of infectious zzso The zzso domain of zzso the longest one among zzso zzso contains several highly zzso zzso sequences zzso to motifs involved in zzso zzso To determine the specific roles of these motifs in processing, zzso zzso and the capacity of zzso zzso to complement a zzso virus, we generated truncated or point zzso forms of a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso with a deletion in the zzso cluster zzso zzso acids zzso zzso to zzso behaved the same as the parental zzso zzso or disruption of the zzso motif zzso zzso to zzso abolished zzso and reduced zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso motif zzso zzso to zzso impaired the return of the protein to the zzso network zzso while enhancing its recycling to the plasma zzso zzso from zzso E zzso abolished transport and processing of the truncated zzso which had zzso zzso activity, through the zzso zzso Altogether, our results favor a model in which zzso gets its final envelope in the zzso and they suggest that zzso albeit not necessary, might play a role in zzso
