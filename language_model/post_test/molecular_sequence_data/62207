A successful defense against potential pathogens requires that a host zzso is able to discriminate between self and zzso zzso zzso zzso max zzso exploits a specific molecular pattern, a zzso and zzso zzso zzso present in cell walls of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso as a signal compound zzso the onset of defense zzso The specific and high affinity zzso site is contained in the zzso protein zzso which in turn is part of a proposed zzso zzso The ability to perceive and respond to zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is exclusive to plants that belong to the zzso However, we propose that the presence of the zzso is essential, but not sufficient for zzso zzso disease resistance because genes zzso zzso proteins can be retrieved from many plant zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso is composed of two different zzso protein zzso one containing the zzso site, and the other related to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso displays most likely an zzso mode of action, zzso only zzso linkages of zzso consisting of at least four zzso Thus, the intrinsic zzso activity of the zzso is perfectly suited during initial contact with zzso to release zzso fragments enriched in motifs that constitute zzso for the high affinity binding site present in the same zzso The concept of innate immunity in plants receives substantial support by this highly sophisticated system using ancient zzso zzso as an active part of the recognition zzso
