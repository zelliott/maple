The zzso clock plays a vital role in monarch butterfly zzso zzso migration by providing the timing component of zzso sun compass orientation, a process that is important for successful zzso We therefore evaluated the monarch clockwork by focusing on the functions of a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso and a zzso cry, designated zzso that are both expressed in the butterfly and by placing these genes in the context of other relevant clock genes in zzso We found that similar zzso patterns of clock gene expression and protein levels occur in the heads, as occur in zzso cells, of a monarch cell line that contains a zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso degradation by light in zzso cells, and a zzso zzso decrease occurs in putative clock cells in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Moreover, monarch zzso zzso partially rescue both zzso and behavioral zzso defects in zzso zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without involvement of zzso zzso is zzso with clock proteins in the zzso and there it zzso to the nucleus at the appropriate time for zzso zzso We also discovered zzso neural projections that zzso in the central zzso The results define a novel, zzso clock mechanism in the monarch in which zzso likely functions as a zzso zzso for zzso whereas zzso functions within the clockwork as the zzso zzso of a negative zzso feedback zzso Our data further suggest that zzso may have a dual role in the monarch zzso zzso a core clock element and as an output that regulates zzso activity in the central complex, the likely site of the sun zzso
