Although initially described as a zzso scaffolding zzso zzso zzso protein of 65 zzso is known to associate with multiple zzso factors in the zzso Using affinity zzso and mass zzso we show that zzso interacts with zzso nuclear zzso protein U zzso U), an zzso and zzso protein enriched in the nuclear zzso that also plays a role in the regulation of gene zzso zzso U interacts specifically with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso a region of zzso that is not found in the related protein zzso Although zzso U and zzso zzso to both the nucleus and the zzso zzso does not zzso to the nucleus in an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso U and zzso only interact in the nucleus, suggesting that the association between the two proteins is zzso zzso of zzso U zzso the ability of zzso to increase the activity of a zzso zzso reporter zzso In contrast, zzso U has no effect when zzso with a truncated zzso protein lacking the zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is distinguished from the zzso zzso by its zzso zzso zzso the zzso U interaction may uniquely regulate the nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso U interaction provides another mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
