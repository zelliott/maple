The zzso zzso of zzso coli is rendered cryptic and zzso in zzso cells by the presence of DNA structural elements that zzso regulate zzso We have carried out a detailed analysis of the sequences implicated in negative zzso zzso deletion analysis of the upstream sequences showed the presence of at least two elements involved in zzso the zzso Chemical probing of zzso DNA in zzso showed that a region of zzso zzso present upstream of the promoter, is hypersensitive to zzso The hypersensitive region detected zzso to the potential zzso structure implicated earlier in negative zzso Enhancement of zzso from the zzso promoter, observed in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso was absent in a zzso that carried point zzso in the zzso zzso This observation suggests that the zzso seen in a zzso zzso is zzso by zzso of the zzso because of reduced zzso zzso of sequences downstream of the potential zzso also resulted in an increase in transcription, indicating the presence of a second regulatory zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso promoter carrying the zzso in a strain that has a zzso in the zzso zzso indicated that this region is likely to be involved in binding to zzso or a protein regulated by zzso which acts as a zzso zzso We also provide evidence which suggests that zzso zzso by zzso at the zzso zzso protein zzso site is zzso partly by zzso of the negative effect of zzso by zzso as a result of its increased affinity for the zzso zzso
