The zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso cell envelope stress response system originally characterized in zzso zzso zzso the zzso response regulator, was shown previously to be involved in repression of the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mock, and zzso zzso Hansen, zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were shown to closely resemble those of other well-studied bacterial zzso A zzso deletion zzso and a zzso strain were used to explore the extent of the zzso zzso DNA zzso and real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated several potential regulatory targets for the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso were used to prove that zzso zzso zzso zzso with the promoter regions of genes zzso both known and putative zzso factors of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the use of zzso also indicated that zzso zzso zzso did not bind to the promoter regions of several genes predicted to zzso factors involved in the cell envelope stress zzso Taken together, these data suggest that the zzso system in zzso zzso in contrast to that in zzso coli, may be involved primarily in controlling expression of genes not involved in the cell envelope stress zzso
