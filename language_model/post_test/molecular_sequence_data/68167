zzso 19 strains belong to 13 species of zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso were tested in zzso zzso system for their influence on the translation of alkaline zzso gene zzso It was found that 10 species (13 zzso of zzso protein zzso did affect the translation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso almost did not translate the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the expression of zzso gene at the zzso level, but had no influence on neutral zzso zzso There is a secondary structure complex at the translation initiation region of zzso zzso When one of the secondary structure was destroyed by site directed zzso the translation efficiency was enhanced by zzso to zzso zzso The higher order structure of zzso and zzso zzso were different and so were the affinity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso end of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could not translate zzso zzso because of the secondary structure complex, low initiation strength of zzso zzso and zzso of the higher order structure of the zzso zzso
