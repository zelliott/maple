The zzso that decorate zzso zzso contribute to the zzso and zzso properties of these molecules and hence their function as a barrier and zzso on zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in certain diseases may contribute to zzso It is known that both the host cell type and the zzso acid sequence of the zzso tandem repeat contribute to the zzso of a zzso zzso We expressed an zzso zzso zzso zzso construct in the airway cell line zzso and the colon zzso cell line zzso and used Fast zzso zzso Mass zzso to evaluate the contribution of the host cell to differences in zzso of a single zzso Many of the zzso detected on the zzso zzso were common to both cell types, as would be predicted from zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in the airway cell line showed comparatively low levels of zzso but carried a range of zzso structures that were not seen in the colon zzso cell zzso
