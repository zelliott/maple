zzso growth factor zzso family plays key roles in development, wound healing, and zzso zzso of the molecular nature of interactions of zzso with their receptors zzso has been seriously limited by the absence of structural information on zzso or zzso zzso In this study, based on an exhaustive analysis of the primary sequences of the zzso family, we determined that the zzso that constitute the primary zzso site of zzso are zzso throughout the zzso family, whereas those of the secondary zzso binding site of zzso are zzso We propose that the zzso interaction zzso by the zzso primary site interactions is likely to be similar if not identical for the entire zzso family, whereas the zzso secondary sites, on both zzso as well as zzso mediates specificity of a given zzso to a given zzso zzso Furthermore, as the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso share the same structural scaffold, we find that the spatial orientation of the primary zzso site of zzso zzso structurally with the zzso zzso site when the two molecules are zzso The structural similarities between the zzso and the zzso system provided a framework to zzso molecular principles of zzso zzso In the zzso model proposed here, the two zzso of a single zzso wrap around a single zzso zzso such that one domain of zzso binds to the primary zzso site of the zzso zzso while the second domain of the same zzso binds to the secondary zzso site of the same zzso zzso Finally, the proposed model is able to accommodate not only zzso zzso zzso interactions with zzso and zzso but also zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso
