The structure of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the integral membrane zzso respiratory nitrate zzso zzso has been determined to zzso A resolution revealing the molecular architecture of this zzso zzso containing zzso which includes a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso together with the related zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the generation of zzso motive force across the membrane in zzso coli nitrate zzso A comparative study revealed that zzso and zzso employ different approaches for acquiring zzso reflecting different zzso zzso zzso uses a very narrow and zzso zzso cavity with a zzso zzso binding site, whereas zzso zzso a wider, positively charged zzso cavity with a more specific zzso binding zzso The zzso structure also demonstrates the first example of an zzso side chain acting as a Mo zzso providing a structural basis for the zzso of zzso zzso
