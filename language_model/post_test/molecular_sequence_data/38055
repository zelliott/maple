zzso zzso zzso zzso values were measured for natural abundance samples of the human milk zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso four of which have Lewis blood group zzso Each zzso was dissolved in a zzso solution of 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso oriented in the zzso magnetic zzso The zzso zzso data and zzso were fitted to zzso models with calculations of an optimum orientation zzso which best represents the zzso zzso values for a zzso hypothesized to adopt a single zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the models confirm previous zzso models for the Lewis zzso based on zzso and molecular dynamics zzso zzso of the model provided new structural data for the remaining zzso In all cases, upper limits for the errors in the zzso angles of the models were zzso Since residual zzso zzso provides information on long-range order, it is a valuable complement to other types of zzso data such as zzso and zzso zzso for exploring zzso of complex zzso
