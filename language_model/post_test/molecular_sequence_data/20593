zzso interaction zzso 1 zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso channel by first sensing the changes in zzso concentration in the zzso zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso motif and subsequently zzso to interact with the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso In this work, we applied a zzso approach to obtain the intrinsic zzso affinity of the isolated zzso of zzso and further investigated its zzso state using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso bound zzso with a zzso constant at a level comparable with zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso The binding of zzso resulted in a more compact zzso of the engineered zzso Our results also showed that D to A zzso at zzso loop positions 1 and 3 of the zzso from zzso led to a zzso decrease in the zzso zzso which explains why this zzso was insensitive to changes in zzso concentration in the zzso zzso zzso and resulted in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso In addition, the grafted single zzso motif formed a zzso regardless of the presence of zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso motif tends to zzso for functionality in solution and is responsible for sensing changes in zzso
