The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso from a human zzso virus is described at ca zzso A resolution, both in native form and in complex with three zzso zzso In support of earlier work on the structure of the zzso protein from the avian pathogen zzso disease virus zzso we observe a zzso of zzso and find no evidence for zzso separated sites performing the zzso and zzso functions of the zzso As with the zzso zzso the active site of the zzso of zzso viruses is structurally flexible, suggesting that it may be able to switch between a zzso state and a zzso zzso However, in contrast to the zzso structures, we observe no zzso structural changes that extend beyond the active site and modify the zzso zzso
