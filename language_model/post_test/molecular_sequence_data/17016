Two zzso groups of liver fatty zzso proteins zzso have been zzso the zzso type liver zzso and the basic type zzso characterized in several zzso but not in zzso The two groups have similar sequences and share a highly zzso three-dimensional structure, but their specificity and zzso of binding are zzso The crystal structure of chicken zzso zzso with zzso acid and that of the zzso refined to zzso A resolution are presented in this zzso The two forms of the protein crystallize in different space groups, and significant changes are observed between the two zzso The zzso binds two molecules of zzso in the interior zzso and the contacts observed between the two zzso can help to explain the reason for this zzso of zzso Most of the zzso acids involved in zzso binding are zzso in other members of the zzso zzso Since the zzso acid sequence of the zzso is more similar to that of the zzso zzso proteins than to that of the zzso the possibility that the zzso might be more appropriately called liver zzso zzso proteins zzso is zzso
