zzso zzso DNA is highly packaged into zzso by zzso to fit inside the zzso Other than the bulk packaging role of zzso zzso with an expression peak at S phase and zzso deposition, different zzso zzso have evolved distinct regulatory mechanisms for their zzso deposition and functional zzso The diversity of zzso zzso results in structural plasticity of zzso and highlights functionally distinct zzso domain, which plays critical roles in development from a zzso egg into a complex zzso as well as in aging and zzso However, the mechanisms of this fundamental process are poorly understood so zzso It is of particular interest to investigate how the zzso are incorporated into zzso and mark specific zzso states to regulate gene zzso and how they are involved in development and zzso In this review, we focus on recent progress in studies of zzso regulation of three extensively investigated zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and their functional implications in development and zzso
