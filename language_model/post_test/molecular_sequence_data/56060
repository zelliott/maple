In this study we analyzed the T cell zzso delta transcripts expressed by zzso cells and we investigated whether these cells expressed the zzso T cell zzso factor and the zzso gene zzso Multiple zzso delta transcripts zzso from an zzso zzso delta gene were detected in both zzso and zzso zzso natural zzso cell zzso Two zzso zzso delta transcripts had a size similar to that of the functional zzso delta zzso zzso and zzso zzso found in zzso zzso T zzso zzso analysis of nine different zzso zzso clones obtained from zzso zzso zzso confirmed that they corresponded to an zzso zzso delta zzso These zzso were zzso zzso long and their zzso initiation site was located zzso zzso upstream from the J delta 1 zzso The sequence located upstream of the J delta 1 segment corresponded to the previously reported zzso zzso The J delta 1 segment was correctly spliced to C zzso in addition the four C delta zzso were found to be already zzso Two zzso sites were present in the fourth C delta zzso However, only that located at the 3' end appeared to be zzso in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso a T zzso factor known to be involved in the regulation of the zzso of zzso delta zzso was analyzed by Northern zzso in cultured zzso cell population and clones (but not in freshly derived cell zzso All zzso clones and cell lines studied were found to express zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may be involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso delta gene expression in zzso zzso Finally, no zzso of the zzso gene could be detected in all zzso cell lines or clones zzso
