An industrial approach to protein production demands zzso of cloned gene zzso balanced with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of toxic genes from zzso poses particular difficulties due to high zzso content, zzso secondary structures, rare zzso usage and zzso the zzso coding zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso which are a fusion of the restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in a single zzso The family contains zzso zzso with distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a few zzso found in zzso While not being zzso the zzso exhibit zzso acid zzso sequence zzso having molecular sizes of zzso zzso share common modular architecture, resemble zzso zzso cleave DNA zzso zzso from the recognition sites, their activity is affected by zzso zzso 

We describe the zzso gene design, cloning and expression of the zzso zzso The zzso amount in natural hosts is extremely zzso To improve expression of the zzso gene in zzso coli zzso zzso we designed and cloned a fully zzso low zzso content, low zzso secondary structure zzso zzso gene under a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso usage based on a modified zzso zzso zzso zzso strategy, weighted towards low zzso content zzso resulted in approximately zzso higher expression of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso of total zzso were changed, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The reason for we choose a less effective strategy rather than a resulting in high expression yields zzso zzso strategy, was zzso zzso zzso in zzso production, in order to decrease the high zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and synthetic zzso gene were cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The modified zzso zzso zzso zzso method tuned for zzso genes was applied to obtain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The method appears suited for industrial production of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso This novel zzso of the method biased toward increasing a zzso AT content may provide economic benefits for industrial zzso
