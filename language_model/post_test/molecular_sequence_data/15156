The Human zzso type zzso zzso gene was zzso by overlapping zzso after zzso using plant preferred zzso 

The gene sequences of zzso were obtained from zzso and analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The target sequence was selected and modified using plant preferred zzso by the zzso Gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the addition of a zzso to the zzso to construct the full-length modified zzso zzso zzso was divided into 5 large zzso namely zzso to zzso with sizes ranging from 204 to 477 zzso zzso small zzso fragments with sizes of zzso zzso and 6 pairs of zzso were designed and zzso zzso was amplified by overlapping zzso and zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified by restriction zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso was successfully assembled using overlapping zzso The results of zzso with restriction zzso and zzso amplification confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso contained the zzso with expected size of zzso zzso zzso sequence was confirmed by zzso 

zzso with plant preferred zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso
