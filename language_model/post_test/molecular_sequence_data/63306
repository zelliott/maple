In a previous zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso of the zzso DNA zzso region were detected using the restriction zzso length zzso technique zzso Seven percent of the individuals showed patterns in which the sum of the sizes of the restriction fragments exceeded the size of the original zzso zzso In the present paper we analyze possible causes of these zzso zzso zzso products were zzso and two or three different clones from a single individual were detected by their zzso zzso Nine clones with different restriction patterns were selected for sequence zzso A maximum zzso zzso analysis revealed two zzso zzso zzso One group comprised sequences showing low zzso divergence compared with the most common zzso detected in the zzso zzso The other group was zzso to the three species of zzso other than zzso zzso included in the study; the zzso in the short portion of the zzso b gene amplified corresponded to 12 zzso acid zzso The results suggest that two independent insertions of zzso sequences into the nucleus zzso these sequences would zzso in the zzso zzso Identification of zzso is crucial to obtain reliable reconstruction of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
