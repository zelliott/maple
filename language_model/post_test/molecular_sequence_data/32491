There is a continuing interest in the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso in body zzso of patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso however, at present there is no general procedure to produce and test the required zzso We examined various methods to generate rabbit zzso zzso that are specific for zzso zzso and zzso and we tested their specificity and sensitivity by zzso and Western zzso To produce zzso zzso required repeated zzso of small doses of zzso zzso over a period of at least 6 zzso zzso generated to peptides derived from the zzso sequence showed some zzso with zzso but zzso generated to zzso peptides did not zzso with zzso The shortest zzso capable of generating zzso of moderate affinity possessed the sequence zzso however, zzso raised to the zzso zzso possessed the greatest affinity zzso zzso 1 zzso and specificity for zzso The latter zzso were over zzso more zzso with zzso than with zzso They can detect zzso zzso in extracts of normal brain, where the peptides are present at levels below one part per zzso Our results provide methods to generate and characterize the specificity and affinity of zzso zzso This information is necessary to develop sensitive and specific zzso to zzso zzso zzso in brain extracts and in body zzso
