zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli donates electrons directly to zzso during the zzso of zzso as a zzso and these electrons are subsequently transferred to zzso zzso in the respiratory zzso To determine whether the specific zzso site of zzso resides in the zzso zzso domain or in the large zzso zzso zzso domain zzso we constructed a fusion protein between the signal sequence of zzso and zzso This truncated zzso was found to complement a zzso zzso strain in zzso The signal sequence of the fused protein was shown to be zzso off, and the remaining zzso was shown to be recovered in the membrane zzso suggesting that zzso has a zzso site that is responsible for binding to zzso like peripheral zzso zzso analysis and zzso experiments revealed that zzso has zzso zzso activity nearly equivalent to that of the zzso zzso Thus, it is likely that the zzso zzso domain of zzso possesses a zzso site and transfers electrons directly to zzso
