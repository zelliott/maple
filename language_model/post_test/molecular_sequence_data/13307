We report the sequence of an zzso zzso zzso located on the left arm of zzso zzso of zzso zzso By sequence analysis we have detected six open reading frames zzso longer that 300 zzso which cover zzso of the entire zzso zzso zzso is zzso identical to the zzso zzso also identified as zzso zzso zzso and zzso while zzso is zzso identical to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso shares some identity with a hypothetical protein of zzso zzso while the other four zzso show no significant zzso to known zzso
