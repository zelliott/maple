In an effort to gain insight into the zzso zzso of zzso Y upon interaction with its zzso all zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso were prepared, and their zzso and zzso zzso binding affinities were evaluated using the human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso produced zzso of high purity that were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso Of the 37 zzso (a naturally occurring zzso at position 9 was replaced by Ala and zzso zzso zzso binding was most zzso by zzso inversion of zzso at the zzso zzso 20, 27, zzso Ki zzso or zzso 300 zzso zzso at zzso 2-5, 28, and 36 had Ki values ranging from 40 to 260 zzso zzso at all other positions yielded zzso with affinities ranging from zzso to 20 zzso zzso affinities to the zzso class of receptors all measured in the low or zzso zzso with the exception of zzso modified zzso zzso zzso Only zzso and zzso displayed no measurable binding affinity to zzso receptors at the highest concentration tested zzso zzso Representative zzso were selected on the basis of their binding affinities and position in the sequence for structural analysis using circular zzso zzso zzso Of the nine zzso evaluated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso expressed a definitive correlation between loss of binding affinity and disruption of secondary structure by having the propensity to form zzso at the expense of zzso zzso It was concluded that although the incorporation of a single zzso acid within the sequence of zzso may zzso a zzso zzso the zzso interaction was only affected when certain critical zzso were zzso findings that provide a basis for the identification of the binding zzso of zzso
