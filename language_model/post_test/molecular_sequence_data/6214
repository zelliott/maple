zzso zzso markers are widely used in molecular zzso The range of zzso sizes and the zzso zzso within a population are important characteristics of the zzso Their determination previously has involved zzso a large number of zzso We have developed a technique for defining these characteristics by zzso of many samples in a DNA zzso Groups of 32 and 42 DNA samples were zzso and results were compared with those from individual zzso zzso To improve the accuracy in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso removal of zzso bands was carried out and the consistency of each marker was zzso This approach was also applied to a group of 94 zzso All of the work has been done using zzso zzso Potential applications of this technique are in population zzso high zzso zzso and loss of zzso zzso
