The urinary protein C inhibitor zzso binding region in the B zzso of human zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso The B zzso isolated from reduced and zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso to yield eight peptides consisting of 10, 12, 13, zzso 14, 16, 17 and 18 zzso bands and the zzso peptides were zzso The 12 zzso band bound to urinary zzso Moreover, the zzso B zzso was isolated by zzso and the zzso peak showing positive binding to urinary zzso was zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was A V S Q zzso which zzso to zzso in the B zzso Judging from the zzso of this zzso (12 zzso it comprises the region from zzso to zzso which are partly located in the zzso It is concluded that the urinary zzso region to the B zzso resides in the sequence of zzso to zzso
