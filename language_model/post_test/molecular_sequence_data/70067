Two of the dominant zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and late zzso protein zzso have been positively identified on zzso zzso zzso gels by zzso protein zzso The origin of the zzso variation present in these proteins has been found to be principally zzso The variation was examined in 97 zzso female zzso zzso of which 10 were followed throughout zzso to determine if any zzso variation zzso The only distinguishable zzso difference results from the previously described appearance of LLP at the beginning of phase III of zzso zzso 180 days after birth of the zzso zzso analysis of zzso implies that it exists in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Very strong linkage zzso indicative of close linkage, was found between zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of their zzso sequences suggests that LLP and zzso represent an ancient gene zzso Both have zzso zzso acid zzso characteristic of the zzso The results imply that the zzso mode of zzso and hence of zzso is also very zzso
