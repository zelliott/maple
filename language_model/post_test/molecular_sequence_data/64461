To screen for expression of 9 zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso family, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso of zzso zzso in primary tumor tissue biopsy specimens of vaccine zzso zzso zzso in cats and compare expression profiles of zzso with expression profiles of zzso and zzso 

31 primary tumor tissue biopsy specimens and 6 zzso zzso tissue biopsy zzso 

zzso specimens were obtained from primary tumor biopsy specimens of zzso zzso for reverse zzso chain reaction zzso were designed on the basis of known zzso Data were analyzed for patterns of expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in expression patterns were evaluated among cats of differing zzso ages, zzso status, and overall survival zzso and between cats with zzso and cats with zzso tumor zzso 

A total of 31 primary tumor tissue biopsy specimens and 6 zzso zzso tissue biopsy specimens were screened for the presence of 6 zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was found in zzso zzso and zzso No significant differences were found in patterns of expression among tumor zzso zzso was found to be the only zzso factor for overall survival zzso A significant correlation was found between zzso and zzso expression and overall duration of zzso 

The identification of zzso in zzso zzso supports an underlying inflammatory zzso for this zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were correlated with survival time in our zzso
