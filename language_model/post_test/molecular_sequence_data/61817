The initiation of zzso immune responses requires the direct interaction of zzso cells zzso with zzso T zzso It is well established that the maturation state of zzso has a critical impact on the outcome of the zzso We show here that mature zzso form stable zzso with zzso T cells and induce the formation of organized immune zzso zzso zzso in contrast, form few stable zzso with no organized immune zzso A dynamic analysis revealed that mature zzso can form long-lasting interactions with zzso T cells, even in the absence of zzso zzso zzso in contrast, established only short intermittent zzso suggesting that the premature termination of the interaction prevents the formation of organized immune zzso and full T cell zzso
