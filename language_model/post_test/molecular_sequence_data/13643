We zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso G gamma and A gamma zzso zzso from single red blood cells isolated from a zzso transgenic fetus harboring a single copy of the human zzso A detailed structural analysis of the zzso showed a single copy of each zzso zzso gene is present and linked to the locus control region zzso zzso protection analysis of zzso isolated from zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of development and the adult stage showed proper zzso switching of the zzso zzso gene zzso Using zzso zzso gamma and G gamma zzso A gamma primer sets in separate zzso reactions on zzso from single zzso red blood cells we observed an zzso variation in the zzso and gamma zzso products that may be indicative of a change in the zzso preference from the zzso gene promoter to the gamma gene promoter during zzso We also found that the majority of the red blood cells examined contain all three zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that either the zzso is capable of interacting simultaneously with more than one zzso gene promoter or zzso the zzso may interact with only one promoter at any given time, but its interaction zzso between promoters zzso zzso resulting in expression of more than one gene from a single zzso zzso
