The cauliflower mosaic virus zzso II zzso the zzso transmission factor zzso was zzso to introduce a zzso restriction site upstream from the initiation zzso and then cloned into an zzso viral expression zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso All zzso viruses tested in zzso zzso zzso cells expressed a protein of about 18 zzso which zzso in PAGE with zzso from infected zzso Western zzso using an zzso zzso to zzso confirmed the identity of the zzso protein from infected cells as the product of the zzso II sequences zzso zzso zzso of cells infected with the zzso zzso demonstrated that the expressed zzso accumulated zzso in an zzso zzso zzso was produced in rabbit against the partially zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso When used to zzso label zzso sections of cauliflower mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso this zzso was shown to be highly specific, zzso only the zzso inclusion bodies zzso zzso and not other plant cellular zzso
