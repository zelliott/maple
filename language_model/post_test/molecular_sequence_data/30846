zzso independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso made with zzso zzso were analyzed by sequencing the zzso zzso zzso junctions by using zzso amplified with the zzso chain reaction or zzso zzso Our DNA sequence analysis showed that the zzso DNA in zzso zzso has an unexpected structure that is comprised of 104 bases of zzso DNA in the form of a large zzso zzso which we zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed regional zzso for the zzso sites despite the randomness of zzso zzso insertions into the zzso as a zzso Gene products or open reading frames were identified for seven unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso by searching DNA data bases with the sequences adjacent and upstream of the zzso zzso One zzso zzso lies in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso lie in the zzso zzso and one zzso zzso lies in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso the large and small zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso lies in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso which codes for the zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lie in zzso open reading frames near the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six other zzso zzso lie in yet zzso zzso coli zzso
