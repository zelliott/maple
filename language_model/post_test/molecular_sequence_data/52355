We have determined the structural organization of the zzso zzso zzso gene of the human zzso chain zzso acid zzso zzso The single copy zzso gene spans approximately 68 zzso of zzso zzso The complete coding region consisting of the zzso and zzso regions, the zzso targeting sequence zzso zzso zzso and the mature zzso sequence (421 zzso zzso are zzso by 11 zzso ranging from 62 to zzso base zzso All the donor and zzso zzso sites conform to the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region showed the presence of a zzso zzso sequence zzso bases upstream of the zzso initiation zzso The zzso zzso sequence is zzso Also located in this region are sequences resembling zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Several sets of direct and zzso repeats are also zzso zzso zzso using human zzso cells zzso and Swiss mouse zzso zzso showed that a zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start site zzso high expression of the zzso reporter zzso Moreover, an zzso zzso zzso was zzso It zzso to the complete zzso zzso and the zzso domain that are zzso by zzso I through IV of the functional zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso contains multiple base changes, zzso and zzso and is flanked by short direct zzso The data indicate that the zzso zzso is a zzso
