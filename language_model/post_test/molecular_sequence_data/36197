High levels of active zzso zzso zzso were produced in zzso coli, amounting to zzso of total cell zzso High production levels were achieved by altering the following zzso zzso zzso preference of the coding region, zzso zzso at the zzso end of the coding region, and zzso zzso To circumvent the toxicity of zzso zzso in zzso coli, the gene was expressed as a fusion protein with two different zzso zzso zzso In both the cases, the fusion protein could be zzso in zzso to give an active zzso with the native sequence at the N zzso
