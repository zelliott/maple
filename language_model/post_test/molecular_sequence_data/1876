From 1999 to 2002, 246 serum samples taken from zzso children were tested for the presence of zzso virus C zzso zzso using a real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso This zzso was based on the zzso technology and allowed viral load determination in infected children with a dynamic range from zzso to zzso zzso equivalent zzso zzso The limit of detection was estimated to 619 zzso zzso with a zzso or zzso zzso probability of a positive zzso Thirty five zzso were found to be zzso zzso positive, corresponding to a prevalence of zzso of zzso The mean viral load was high, zzso 6 zzso zzso log zzso zzso zzso zzso but low viral loads were also zzso zzso of the zzso region zzso identified a majority of zzso 2 strains zzso distributed into two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso active infection is very frequent in exposed populations such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using real-time zzso may be useful for diagnosis and follow-up of the natural history of zzso zzso
