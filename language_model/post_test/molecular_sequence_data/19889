We present a zzso based model of the zzso binding domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The model is based on multiple sequence alignment with other members of the zzso zzso gated zzso channel zzso and two zzso zzso binding proteins zzso from the freshwater zzso zzso and saltwater zzso zzso snails with known high resolution zzso Using two template proteins with known structure to model three zzso structure of a target protein is especially advantageous for sequences with low zzso as in the case presented in this zzso The final model was zzso by critical evaluation of experimental and published zzso functional and other zzso zzso In addition, a complex structure with zzso zzso in the putative binding site is proposed based on zzso simulation using zzso zzso zzso dynamics zzso simulations with simulated zzso protocol are reported on the proposed zzso of zzso which is stable in 5 zzso simulation in water, as well as for a zzso zzso structure modeled on the corresponding domain determined in zzso zzso structure of the alpha zzso of the full-length zzso zzso zzso Our simulations demonstrate that the zzso central core of the protein zzso is fairly rigid in the simulations and resistant to zzso in zzso
