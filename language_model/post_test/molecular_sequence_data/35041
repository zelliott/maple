In this study, we have identified zzso molecules across the zzso spectrum and propose a unified nomenclature for zzso zzso in fish, zzso and zzso based on zzso zzso zzso on earlier studies in zzso fish, lineage specific zzso zzso that have no apparent zzso in zzso were zzso Furthermore, in addition to the two zzso of the zzso zzso known in zzso fish, a third group was identified zzso zzso as was a further zzso of the fish zzso genes related to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso found in rainbow trout, zzso zzso was studied in response to stimulation with inflammatory and zzso zzso and zzso zzso distribution analysis revealed distinct expression profiles for these trout zzso zzso zzso three of the trout zzso including two novel fish specific zzso zzso containing three pairs of zzso were produced as zzso proteins and their effect on trout zzso migration zzso These molecules increased the relative expression of zzso and zzso in migrated cells in an in zzso zzso zzso
