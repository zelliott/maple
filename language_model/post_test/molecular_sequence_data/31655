In this study we expand the accessible dynamic range of zzso force zzso by optical tweezers to the zzso range by fast zzso We are able to investigate a single zzso for up to 15 zzso and with zzso bandwidth as the protein zzso tens of millions of zzso zzso Using equilibrium analysis and zzso analysis of the time zzso the full zzso as well as real-time zzso of the zzso folding of zzso zzso 35 and a stable zzso 68 zzso 70 zzso zzso can be measured zzso We also performed zzso dynamics simulations of the response of the zzso system to zzso zzso All key features of the zzso zzso fluctuations could be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our zzso reveal a difference in folding zzso and zzso between zzso and stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso force zzso pushes the time resolution of zzso force zzso to zzso zzso thus approaching the zzso accessible for all atom molecular dynamics zzso
