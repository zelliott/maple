The zzso of zzso is a new source of zzso zzso and zzso Here we reported the development of a zzso and host system in moderately zzso zzso via an zzso zzso By screening about 80 zzso zzso 6 of them zzso 8 plasmids zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of zzso consisted of zzso zzso with zzso G + C content, zzso 17 open reading zzso 5 of them resembled those of zzso zzso A rep locus zzso within the zzso was identified for replication in zzso zzso zzso zzso and rep protein bound to its zzso zzso This system may be useful for gene cloning and expression in zzso
