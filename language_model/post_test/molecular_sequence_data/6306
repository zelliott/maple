The zzso sequence zzso element zzso of zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso imperfect terminal zzso repeats (three zzso and a size of zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso generates a putative target zzso of 2 zzso zzso carries two major overlapping open reading frames zzso and zzso with a coding capacity of 135 and 201 zzso acids zzso zzso A potential zzso zzso window zzso is located in the overlapping region of both zzso The putative fusion product of both zzso which probably represents the mature zzso has a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso of the deduced zzso sequence of zzso with database entries revealed zzso to putative zzso of some IS elements of the zzso family, as well as to zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso by zzso shows zzso to zzso zzso of the recently proposed zzso family which includes zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the distribution of zzso in natural zzso populations showed that this IS element is abundant in zzso zzso
