Four proteins of zzso zzso having apparent molecular weights as 35, 14, 21 and 16 zzso are expressed from zzso zzso zzso zzso located almost in the middle of the zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence supported by some experimental zzso suggest that these four proteins are expressed from zzso message without any zzso zzso Stop and start zzso of consecutive zzso overlap and rare initiation zzso are zzso Computer analysis of the sequence suggests the presence of two more open reading frames within the zzso of 35 and 16 zzso proteins but in the opposite orientation, zzso in the complementary zzso
