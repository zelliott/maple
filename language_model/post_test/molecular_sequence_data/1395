Cellular zzso protein zzso functions in the retinal zzso zzso zzso as an zzso of zzso in the zzso step of the rod visual cycle and as a zzso carrier for zzso zzso Toward a better understanding of zzso function, the zzso binding cavity in human zzso zzso zzso was characterized by zzso labeling with zzso and by high resolution mass zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso were identified in zzso by liquid zzso tandem mass zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Multiple different zzso masses were found on the zzso zzso and the molecular identity of each modification remains zzso Supporting the specificity of zzso 50% of the modified zzso have been associate with zzso interactions by independent zzso In addition, zzso analysis of zzso and zzso by zzso exchange and mass zzso demonstrated zzso zzso incorporate significantly less zzso when the zzso binding pocket is occupied with zzso This zzso region encompasses all but one of the zzso zzso A structural model of zzso zzso binding domain was constructed based on the crystal structures of three zzso in the zzso family of zzso zzso In the model, all of the zzso zzso line the zzso binding cavity except zzso which appears to reside in a flexible loop at the zzso of the zzso zzso Overall, the results expand to 12 the number of zzso proposed to interact with zzso and provide further insight into zzso zzso and protein zzso
