zzso DNA containing the protein coding region for zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The probe used to detect and isolate the gene zzso was constructed from two partially complementary synthetic zzso and contains 60 base pairs that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso of the beef heart zzso zzso In reduced stringency zzso conditions, the probe recognizes two target sites in fly zzso DNA with zzso zzso One of these sites is in the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which was isolated as a zzso pair zzso zzso This zzso contains all of the protein coding portion, 900 base pairs upstream of the zzso zzso and 2000 base pairs downstream of the termination zzso zzso The coding portion of the gene contains no zzso and yields a protein of 352 zzso zzso There is a zzso acid zzso near the N zzso of the fly protein relative to the beef and mouse zzso Of the remaining 350 zzso zzso 273 are zzso in the three zzso A probe derived from the coding sequence of the zzso clone zzso strongly to a zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed in adult zzso A zzso pair zzso zzso zzso containing the second site recognized by the zzso pair probe has also been zzso DNA sequence analysis demonstrates that this zzso is part of the zzso protein zzso gene or a close zzso The zzso zzso gene and the zzso protein zzso gene have been located in regions zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso zzso
