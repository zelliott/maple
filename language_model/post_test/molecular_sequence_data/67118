zzso analysis of zzso from zzso zzso mouse zzso was performed to establish a global gene expression profile during injury and zzso stages at two different zzso A single dose of zzso at zzso or zzso zzso body weight was given zzso and the liver samples were obtained after 6, 24, and 72 zzso zzso studies enabled the zzso of the zzso effect into injury zzso 24 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso By using the zzso zzso mouse zzso survey zzso a total of zzso out of zzso zzso genes were found to be statistically reliable at zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at false discovery rate zzso by significance analysis of zzso Among the statistically reliable clones by both zzso methods, zzso genes were zzso expressed when compared with zzso control, with more than a zzso difference (which equals zzso in zzso zzso at one or more zzso treatment conditions and with less than zzso difference at all three zzso zzso Three hundred thirty six genes and 13 genes were identified as zzso and zzso zzso respectively, showing that most of the zzso changes were seen during the injury zzso Furthermore, multiple genes involved in protein synthesis and degradation, zzso processing and zzso and cell cycle regulation showed variable transcript levels upon acute zzso zzso
