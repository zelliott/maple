zzso therapy with zzso human zzso zzso zzso could be an effective therapy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus zzso zzso the human zzso transgenic zzso zzso we produced fully human zzso spike zzso protein specific zzso zzso were examined for zzso against a zzso zzso zzso to which 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso neutralized zzso zzso zzso Additionally, 57 zzso zzso were found that are likely specific to zzso zzso of the binding region was achieved with several zzso zzso zzso Most zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso However, two zzso specific zzso reacted with a domain upstream of the zzso between zzso 12 and zzso zzso gene sequence analyses suggested at least 8 different binding zzso zzso human zzso could be used as a cocktail that would simultaneously target several zzso zzso and prevent emergence of escape zzso
