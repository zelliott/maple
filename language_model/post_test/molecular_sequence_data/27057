The zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurs in numerous zzso and integral membrane proteins and, in many cases, plays a crucial role in controlling the interactions of these proteins with zzso binding partners as well as invading zzso Recent advances in our understanding of protein zzso zzso have come about zzso to the cloning of two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso the development of novel zzso and synthetic zzso and detailed studies of proteins and peptides containing zzso zzso In this article, we describe the zzso zzso review the major techniques available for studying the presence, location and function of zzso zzso in proteins and discuss the biological functions and zzso interactions of several proteins (or protein zzso in which zzso zzso influences the protein zzso In particular, we describe the detailed evidence supporting the importance of zzso zzso in the cellular zzso function of zzso zzso zzso the zzso trafficking and pathogen invasion functions of zzso receptors and the zzso binding and zzso of other zzso receptors by complement zzso zzso and zzso zzso
