We posed two hypotheses for broad scenarios of zzso zzso of Korea by the zzso zzso zzso that extant Korean populations are derived from a single zzso or zzso that they are derived from multiple zzso We chose a zzso zzso typical of East Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso to test which of the two scenarios is more likely and to check whether Japan contained putative glacial zzso 

Using 16 zzso zzso we obtained zzso of zzso individuals from 20 zzso representative of the whole distribution area in Korea (including zzso zzso Japan, and zzso We assessed genetic zzso within and among zzso Wright's zzso and conducted analysis of molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso and bottleneck zzso 

We found no zzso variation within populations of zzso zzso in mainland Korea, whereas genetic zzso was detected for populations from zzso Island, Japan (in particular a population from zzso zzso and zzso The levels of zzso within populations were high, consistent with the potential of zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

Data on zzso richness together with zzso zzso methods suggest a pattern of zzso zzso of mainland Korea from a single zzso probably located either on zzso Island or in zzso zzso Island should merit the highest priority for conservation zzso as it played a role as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso temperate as well as zzso plants, as suggested zzso
