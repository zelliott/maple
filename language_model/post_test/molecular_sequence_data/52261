zzso proteins are zzso by a 26 S zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of the zzso 26 S zzso reveals more than 20 zzso ranging in apparent molecular masses from 20 to 110 zzso Although many of the zzso smaller than 30 zzso are members of the zzso zzso family, the identity and function of the larger zzso have remained zzso We report here the zzso sequence for zzso 4, a zzso chain of the 26 S zzso zzso 4 belongs to a recently identified zzso zzso family, which includes proteins involved in zzso formation, zzso and human zzso virus gene zzso zzso 4 also shows weak similarity to zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso
