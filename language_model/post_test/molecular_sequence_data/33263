The zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequence at the 3' end of zzso without a zzso acid zzso The crystal structures of class II zzso zzso zzso zzso and its complexes with zzso or zzso were zzso The zzso replacement of both the zzso heads and zzso neck zzso of the zzso closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso by the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso allowed the zzso zzso to add zzso in zzso and in zzso However, the replacement of only the zzso head domain did not allow the zzso zzso to add zzso and the zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso We identified the region in the neck domain that prevents zzso zzso activity and defines the number of zzso zzso and the specificity for correct zzso zzso We also identified the region in the head domain that defines the terminal A addition after zzso zzso The results collectively suggest that, in the class II zzso zzso the head and neck zzso zzso and zzso define the number of zzso additions and the specificity of zzso zzso
