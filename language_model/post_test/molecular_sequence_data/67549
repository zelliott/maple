zzso zzso zzso is a clinically and genetically zzso zzso Various molecular mechanisms are known to zzso the disease including impaired zzso mechanics, abnormal zzso zzso zzso DNA damage response, defective zzso machinery, and abnormal replication zzso Here, we describe a zzso form of zzso associated with severe intellectual disability and distinct facial features in a large multiplex Saudi zzso Analysis reveals a novel underlying mechanism for zzso involving depletion of zzso an abundant cellular zzso zzso zzso due to zzso of its zzso zzso We show that zzso levels are tightly linked to zzso expression across cell lines, and that this zzso is zzso expressed in the mouse zzso The zzso is known to influence the expression of a wide array of genes through its zzso effect on the positive zzso zzso factor b zzso as well as its competing role in zzso zzso zzso This study documents a critical role played by zzso in human development and adds to the growing list of molecular mechanisms that, when zzso zzso on the zzso zzso
