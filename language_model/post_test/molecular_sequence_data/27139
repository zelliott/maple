zzso human zzso memory T zzso have mostly been studied using zzso of proliferation in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell populations but barely detect responses to certain recall zzso that elicit strong zzso responses, zzso zzso zzso that comprise zzso zzso zzso We have found that zzso whole blood with zzso for zzso h zzso specific zzso T cells to simultaneously express zzso and zzso This new technique readily detects responses to zzso zzso T cell recall zzso including preparations of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso with high zzso The zzso detects much higher levels of zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso plus the cells retain viability and can be sorted for in zzso zzso Furthermore, current in zzso zzso for human zzso memory T zzso are too zzso and difficult to zzso for routine diagnostic laboratories, whereas the zzso zzso zzso combines simplicity of setup with a straightforward cell surface flow zzso zzso In addition to revealing the true extent of zzso human zzso memory T zzso its greatest use will be as a simple in zzso monitor of zzso T cell responses to zzso such as tuberculosis infection or zzso
