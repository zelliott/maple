In our ongoing studies of zzso resistance zzso in zzso centers zzso we have shown a high rate of zzso colonization with zzso zzso coli and, using total zzso content analysis, have shown that this is due to a diversity of zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso highly zzso zzso greater than or equal to 2,000 zzso zzso of zzso coli from 72 children over a zzso period and found at least 83 distinct zzso patterns, indicating that at least 83 strains were zzso Several strains were particularly common in a given zzso including one found in zzso of children with zzso zzso zzso these common strains usually persisted within a zzso for several zzso Colony zzso were zzso with gene zzso for zzso zzso zzso types I, II, III, zzso and zzso zzso zzso under stringent conditions, and all of these were with type I zzso or type V zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso probe was prepared from this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso coli strains zzso zzso in the zzso were found to have this new zzso 74 of which were in one zzso The DNA sequence of this gene was determined, and the predicted zzso acid sequence was shown to have between zzso and zzso identity with the zzso acid sequences for types I, III, zzso zzso and zzso and the partial sequence of type IV and approximately zzso identity with types IX and X zzso This confirms the uniqueness of this zzso which has tentatively been named zzso and its translation product, zzso type zzso
