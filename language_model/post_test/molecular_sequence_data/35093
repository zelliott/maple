The zzso zzso protein of zzso disease virus zzso plays an important role in virus zzso and tissue zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene of many zzso enteric zzso strains encodes a larger open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso with additional 39 zzso at its zzso when compared with that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso it has been suspected that the zzso zzso extension may contribute to the enteric zzso In the present study, we generated a zzso zzso strain zzso zzso virus with a zzso zzso extension of 39 zzso derived from an zzso zzso strain using reverse zzso zzso The biological characterization of the zzso virus, zzso showed that the zzso zzso extension slightly attenuated the virus zzso in zzso eggs and in zzso zzso when compared to the parental zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso extension did not alter virus tissue zzso In infected zzso the zzso virus was detected and zzso from the zzso zzso but not from the zzso zzso exhibiting a similar zzso tissue preference as its parental zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso protein zzso extension of zzso is not the zzso of the virus enteric zzso
