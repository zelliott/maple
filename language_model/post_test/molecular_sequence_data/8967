zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso in solution and at the zzso zzso membrane surface were examined using CD, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso to the plasma membrane and then to the nucleus is associated with its cellular zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains a zzso site and a nuclear zzso zzso which zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and nucleus, zzso CD and zzso zzso showed that a significant zzso zzso involving formation of zzso structure occurs when the zzso domain binds to zzso zzso or zzso zzso embedded in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that Ala and zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso of the zzso domain undergo zzso zzso to form a zzso structure at the zzso zzso These zzso zzso were not induced by association with zzso zzso in solution or coexistence of zzso zzso zzso with the plane of the zzso zzso via association with the zzso is required for the unfolding of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The unwinding of the zzso zzso could regulate the functions of zzso at the plasma membrane zzso
