Heat shock proteins and zzso play a crucial role in cell survival under conditions of environmental zzso The heat shock protein zzso produced by gene zzso at elevated temperatures in zzso coli, is a zzso protein consisting of a large A domain and a smaller P domain connected by a zzso Two zzso zzso are present per zzso with the zzso and His contributed by the A domain and an zzso by the P zzso A new crystal Form II confirms the zzso and zzso zzso arrangement seen in the earlier crystal Form zzso In addition, several zzso exhibit increased flexibility compared to the previous zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso and D3 are intriguing because their mobility leads to the exposure of a sizable zzso patch made up by surface areas of both zzso near the zzso zzso The zzso creating this zzso surface are completely zzso in the zzso zzso At the same time, access to the zzso zzso is zzso These observations lead to the hypothesis for the functioning of zzso wherein zzso zzso and D3 play a key zzso first, at elevated temperatures, by becoming mobile and uncovering a large zzso area that helps in binding to client zzso and second, by removing the client protein from the zzso patch when the temperature decreases and the zzso adopt their zzso positions at the zzso zzso The proposed mode of action of flexible zzso in the functioning of zzso may be a general principle employed by other zzso
