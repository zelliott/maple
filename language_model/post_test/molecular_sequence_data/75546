The gene zzso the zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso The gene was present as a single copy on the bacterial zzso and the zzso usage in the gene zzso closely to that expected for an abundant zzso The predicted size of the mature protein was zzso zzso and the zzso form may have had a zzso zzso leader sequence similar to the leader sequences of the zzso zzso zzso The protein sequence had no marked similarity to known zzso zzso and no zzso sequences could be found in other zzso zzso species, suggesting that zzso represents a class of zzso zzso protein of limited zzso
