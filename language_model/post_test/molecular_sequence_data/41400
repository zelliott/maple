The lack of a universal method to extract zzso from soil zzso the progress of studies related to zzso in soil, which is an important step in the nitrogen zzso It is particularly difficult to extract zzso from certain types of zzso such as zzso zzso ash zzso which is the dominant agricultural soil in Japan, because of zzso zzso by zzso To obtain zzso from these challenging zzso to study the bacteria involved in zzso we developed a soil zzso extraction method for gene expression zzso zzso zzso was added to an zzso extraction buffer to recover zzso from soil, and high-quality zzso was successfully extracted from eight types of agricultural zzso that were significantly different in their zzso zzso To detect bacterial zzso zzso zzso A gene zzso zzso bacterial zzso DNA and zzso zzso were zzso from two different types of zzso during incubation with ammonium zzso zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso gel zzso analyses of zzso in soil zzso revealed that only few zzso which had the highest similarities to those in zzso zzso were expressed in these zzso after treatment with ammonium zzso although multiple zzso genes were present in the soil zzso zzso
