zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly caused by zzso in the zzso zzso which encodes a new member of the AAA zzso zzso associated with diverse cellular zzso protein family zzso zzso of zzso correlation is important for better understanding of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To perform a clinical and genetic study of families with zzso and to perform the functional analysis of the founder zzso discovered in the zzso zzso 

zzso and clinical zzso Patients Fifteen unrelated families with zzso originating from southern zzso 

Clinical assessment, linkage analysis, zzso study, expression of zzso zzso protein in cultured zzso 

Nine families with zzso were linked to the zzso locus at zzso zzso analysis of zzso a novel zzso zzso in all 9 of these zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso distribution in cultured zzso zzso analysis suggested the existence of a common zzso Clinical examination of the affected members carrying the zzso showed zzso variations including broad range of age at onset and disease duration and additional zzso features such as mental zzso zzso resonance imaging demonstrated unique features, including thin corpus zzso and zzso of the zzso in 2 zzso zzso and sequence analyses showed no evidence of linkage to the currently known zzso zzso in the remaining 6 zzso 

A founder zzso zzso zzso was identified in the families with zzso originating from southern zzso Clinical investigation showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso The genetic study demonstrated evidence of further genetic zzso in zzso
