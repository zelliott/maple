zzso group G of zzso zzso zzso is one of the most rare and zzso zzso forms of this inherited zzso zzso patients exhibit varying zzso from having a very mild zzso in DNA repair to being severely affected, and a few cases are also associated with the neurological zzso and growth zzso of zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso nuclear protein that is essential for the incision steps of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein contains a putative zzso zzso motif in the region that is most zzso among the members of zzso zzso zzso To establish the functional significance of the zzso zzso we used several approaches, including theoretical zzso functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA binding zzso A secondary structure of the motif was predicted by energy zzso and the zzso Carlo simulation and zzso proven using the circular zzso to contain a high content of zzso When an zzso zzso lacking the zzso was zzso in zzso cells, which have defects in the zzso zzso of zzso the zzso gene failed to zzso to the zzso cells the resistance to zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein lacking the zzso motif was zzso from insect cells and tested for a zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein failed to cleave the zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso acids zzso was expressed in and zzso from bacteria, tested for DNA binding activity, and found to bind to a DNA zzso with the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso motif is required for the zzso and DNA binding activities of zzso
