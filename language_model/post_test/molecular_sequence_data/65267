zzso zzso 50% of currently prescribed drugs and is frequently involved in clinically relevant drug zzso The understanding of roles and regulations of the individual zzso genes in pharmacology and physiology is zzso 

Using zzso sequences from 16 species we investigated the evolution of zzso zzso zzso over a period of 450 million zzso 

zzso genes in zzso evolved from two ancestral zzso zzso Upon the emergence of zzso zzso one of them was lost, zzso the other acquired a novel zzso environment zzso to zzso In zzso zzso underwent rapid evolutionary changes involving multiple gene zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso The expansion of zzso in zzso (Old World zzso great apes, and zzso differed substantially from New World primates zzso common zzso and zzso zzso zzso We detected two recent episodes of particularly strong positive selection acting on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso early in zzso evolution, which was accompanied by a restriction of its zzso expression to fetal period and zzso on human zzso following the split of the zzso and human zzso In agreement with these findings, three out of four positively selected zzso acids investigated in previous zzso studies of zzso affect the activity and zzso 

zzso and zzso may have acquired zzso functions especially important for the evolution of zzso and humans, zzso
