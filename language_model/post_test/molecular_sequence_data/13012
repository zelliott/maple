zzso and genetic analyses were performed in order to establish relationships between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso bovine viral zzso viruses zzso involved in the induction of a case of zzso induced zzso zzso disease zzso zzso The persistent zzso the zzso used for zzso zzso zzso and the virus zzso from zzso zzso were examined using an zzso test zzso to distinguish between zzso and zzso virus zzso The zzso populations were cloned by plaque zzso and found to be free of zzso when using the zzso The zzso clones and the persistent zzso were zzso in an zzso zzso on zzso infected cells zzso and in a zzso test using a panel of 27 zzso zzso against the zzso zzso and zzso zzso viral zzso It was found that strain zzso contained two zzso distinct zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso clones had the same zzso pattern in both zzso In addition, zzso gene zzso in the zzso of the zzso clones were zzso using the zzso chain reaction and subsequent restriction zzso analysis of the zzso The clones zzso from zzso and those from zzso had gene zzso of identical sizes showing the same restriction zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso which finally lead to zzso MD arose by zzso and/or by zzso of the zzso used for zzso
