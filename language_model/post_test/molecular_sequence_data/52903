A zzso library derived from zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was screened with zzso from a cow naturally infected with zzso zzso The DNA sequence of 1 zzso isolated predicted a significant protein sequence zzso of the gene product to the 28 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Studies on the zzso zzso gene coding for this zzso demonstrated the presence of a single zzso flanked by 2 zzso the gene was also highly expressed in zzso zzso The zzso was expressed in zzso zzso when injected into mice it zzso the production of zzso which detected a 29 zzso zzso of zzso zzso Secondary structure predictions made for the zzso zzso protein showed support for several zzso zzso separated by zzso and zzso The available evidence indicates maintenance of protein secondary structure, and not DNA or zzso acid zzso has occurred during the evolution of zzso proteins in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
