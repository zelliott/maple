zzso in the zzso tumor zzso gene are the most commonly observed genetic zzso in human zzso The majority of these zzso occur in the zzso central portion of the zzso but there has been little information about the function of this zzso Using zzso zzso of the zzso human zzso zzso we have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the central portion of zzso and we show that this core zzso is the zzso zzso domain of the zzso DNA binding is inhibited by metal zzso agents, and we find that the core domain contains zzso zzso zzso also reveal a zzso zzso domain which we show to be the zzso domain of zzso
