To obtain enough human zzso zzso protein for structural and functional zzso 

The full-length zzso coding for zzso was cloned by zzso from human fetal zzso The open reading frame zzso of the zzso consists of 1 700 zzso zzso a mature protein of 556 zzso zzso The zzso was inserted into the zzso A zzso to construct a expression zzso named zzso zzso Then the zzso was transformed into a zzso zzso strain, zzso and the positive strains were screened on the zzso plates with zzso The positive strains were further screened on cellulose zzso and zzso membrane with zzso labeled zzso zzso The selected strains were induced by methanol and the zzso were analyzed by zzso and Western zzso 

zzso analysis showed an anticipated band on the gel that could bind with zzso zzso Furthermore, the strain was fermented and the expression level was about 5 zzso and the zzso zzso protein was zzso by zzso zzso from the zzso zzso 

Human zzso was expressed successfully in zzso zzso and zzso to obtain the zzso protein from zzso zzso which made it possible for further structural and functional studies on zzso
