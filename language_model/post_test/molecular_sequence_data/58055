DNA libraries from zzso zzso zzso zzso had been screened earlier zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for clones that would functionally complement a strain of zzso coli zzso with a deletion in one of its zzso zzso zzso During those studies, an zzso zzso gene was hypothesized to have been incorporated into the zzso of strain zzso producing zzso zzso After introduction of a deletion in the second known zzso coli zzso zzso zzso libraries were prepared from zzso and screened for zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Instead of retrieving an zzso zzso an unexpected zzso coli gene was identified on the basis of its ability to restore zzso resistance and membrane zzso zzso activity to such zzso zzso The active open reading frame in the clone maps at 27 zzso on the zzso coli zzso and is identical in sequence to a wild type zzso It would be predicted to zzso an extremely zzso protein with multiple zzso regions and a molecular weight of zzso A region in one of the predicted zzso zzso in the gene product structure possesses striking sequence similarity to zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso from an zzso coli zzso with a clone possessing only this open reading frame was indeed found to have enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso activities zzso by the clone were both inhibited by zzso The gene was designated zzso and is proposed to be the structural gene for a zzso zzso whose zzso leads to resistance to growth zzso by both calcium and zzso
