zzso enhances membrane zzso zzso signaling and is required for B zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso when zzso is zzso and binds zzso zzso signaling zzso We suggest that the basis for zzso is the association of zzso with zzso and other components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso from zzso zzso of B zzso The association was maintained with a zzso form of zzso containing only the zzso domain and the membrane zzso 17 zzso acids of the zzso domain zzso by zzso zzso This sequence is sufficient to mediate the association, as a synthetic zzso of the zzso zzso region zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso 17 zzso acids of the zzso domain zzso by zzso zzso 6 zzso association of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso which contain no zzso also reduces zzso zzso zzso of the remainder of the zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso to zzso restores zzso Thus, a discrete region of the zzso domain regulates the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso of B cells by zzso
