Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were predicted from the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso We show here that the three genes are expressed zzso during cell zzso In a rich zzso zzso expression of zzso was detected only during exponential growth, that of zzso was drastically elevated at the transition between exponential growth and stationary phase, and that of zzso was seen only later in zzso In a minimal zzso both zzso and zzso were expressed zzso during exponential growth and in stationary phase, while the expression of zzso was not detected in either zzso However, when the minimal medium was supplemented with zzso only the expression of zzso was partially zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso was possibly zzso with a downstream zzso zzso while the zzso gene was transcribed as the fourth gene of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene is a zzso zzso the expression of which was dependent on one of the zzso zzso factors, zzso Each of the three zzso carried on a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of an zzso coli strain lacking zzso zzso indicating that all zzso an zzso zzso In zzso zzso deletion of zzso or zzso zzso or in zzso had essentially no effect on growth rates in media with or without zzso In contrast, deletion of zzso led to a zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso A strain lacking all three genes still grew without zzso albeit very slowly, zzso that zzso zzso might have yet another zzso zzso not recognized by sequence zzso The strains lacking zzso failed to zzso indicating an involvement of this gene in zzso
