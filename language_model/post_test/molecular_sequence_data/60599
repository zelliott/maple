A composite plot for depicting in two dimensions the zzso and the secondary structural features of protein zzso has been zzso Instead of presenting the exact values of the zzso and zzso zzso angles zzso zzso and zzso it indicates the region in the three-dimensional zzso space to which a zzso zzso Other structural aspects, like the presence of a zzso zzso bond and zzso zzso are also zzso The plot may be used to recognize patterns in the backbone and zzso zzso along a zzso chain and to compare protein structures derived from X-ray zzso zzso zzso or molecular zzso studies and also to highlight the effect of zzso on zzso
