zzso zzso is the prevailing molecular mechanism for the integration of zzso DNA into the zzso of most zzso systems and the generation of deletions by zzso zzso We developed a zzso marker system to screen for zzso illegitimate zzso events in order to assess the sequence and zzso requirements for illegitimate zzso in zzso In 12 illegitimate zzso products zzso we found that all deletion zzso zzso to sites of zzso structures or to zzso DNA zzso All deletion zzso showed zzso of two to six zzso In three plants, the zzso products contained zzso or an inversion of an zzso zzso Our data strongly suggest that illegitimate zzso in plants is zzso by a DNA zzso process, and that this mechanism is promoted by DNA regions that can form zzso structures or facilitate DNA zzso
