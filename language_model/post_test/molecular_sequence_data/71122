The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso each adopt a zzso zzso structure with a zzso into which zzso cellulose and soluble zzso zzso To determine the orientation of the sugar chain within these binding zzso the association of zzso zzso zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso with isolated zzso and zzso was studied using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso indicate that the zzso zzso does not significantly zzso the affinity of the zzso derivatives for the zzso The zzso enhancements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso relaxation rates were measured by comparing the effects of zzso in its zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms on the two zzso The bound zzso affects most significantly the relaxation rates of zzso located at both ends of the zzso zzso of each zzso Similar results are observed with zzso bound to zzso This demonstrates that the zzso zzso and by zzso strands of zzso zzso can associate with zzso and zzso in either orientation across their zzso binding zzso The ratio of the association zzso for binding in each of these two zzso is estimated to be within a factor of five to zzso This finding is consistent with the approximate symmetry of the zzso groups on both the zzso and the zzso forming the binding zzso of the zzso zzso
