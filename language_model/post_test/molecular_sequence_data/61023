The human zzso plasma factor zzso has been proposed to play a role in minimal change disease in zzso Since preliminary data suggested similarity between zzso and the human plasma zzso zzso zzso this study was conducted to compare zzso with zzso zzso for sequence zzso zzso properties in Western and zzso zzso ability to affect zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso as well as their zzso zzso increasing effect following alternate zzso into the rat kidney ex zzso zzso was zzso from normal pooled plasma according to standard zzso techniques, and from the same batch zzso was prepared using affinity zzso A second batch of zzso was prepared directly from human serum according to a standard zzso (For comparison, additional zzso samples obtained from other centers were also included in the zzso The results show: zzso zzso zzso of zzso with plasma zzso after internal sequence zzso zzso positive zzso of the zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso zzso and similar bands on Western zzso using the same zzso zzso affection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso after incubation of kidney tissue with either zzso or zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso 37 degrees zzso as detected by computerized zzso zzso and zzso significant enhancement of urinary protein leakage after zzso zzso followed by diluted rat serum into the rat kidney ex zzso zzso zzso zzso protein leakage per zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From these data and from the observation that both zzso and zzso activity can be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso but not by broad spectrum zzso zzso it is concluded that zzso may be closely related or identical to the active zzso of zzso
