The zzso system is a powerful technique for detecting zzso interactions that zzso the well-developed molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, the full potential of this technique has not been realized due to limitations imposed by the components available for use in the zzso These limitations include unwieldy zzso zzso incomplete or poorly designed zzso libraries, and host strains that result in the selection of large numbers of false zzso We have used a novel zzso approach to generate a set of highly representative zzso libraries from zzso zzso In addition, a unique host strain was created that contains three easily zzso reporter zzso each under the control of a different zzso zzso This host strain is extremely sensitive to weak interactions and eliminates nearly all false zzso using simple plate zzso zzso zzso were also constructed that simplify the construction of the gene zzso necessary for the zzso zzso Our analysis indicates that the libraries and host strain provide significant improvements in both the number of interacting clones identified and the efficiency of zzso zzso
