The role of zzso T zzso in recovery from and zzso of zzso infections is not zzso In the present paper, we have defined a zzso zzso recognized by two zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The T cell clones were established from the peripheral blood T zzso of a zzso zzso using a zzso method with zzso zzso These two T cell clones were zzso for dengue virus types 1, 2, 3 and 4, yellow fever virus and West Nile virus, and recognized zzso zzso The smallest synthetic zzso recognized by these T cell clones was an identical 9 zzso acid zzso which contains zzso acids 146 to 154 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was the restriction zzso for recognition of this zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso both used T cell zzso V alpha 8, but zzso used V beta 8 and zzso used V beta zzso This result indicates that this zzso is recognized by two zzso zzso T cell clones which originated from different T cells in zzso
