The gene for zzso zzso the key zzso in zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso manner in the liver and zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso expression of the zzso zzso we characterized zzso promoter activity by transient expression zzso The zzso promoter is active in zzso zzso cells, but inactive in zzso zzso or zzso zzso DNA elements essential for optimal and zzso expression of the zzso gene were contained within zzso zzso to zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso promoter contained three zzso elements zzso at zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso contains binding sites for zzso nuclear factors zzso 1 and zzso zzso shift and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso but not zzso bound to its zzso site and zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso promoter contained five zzso zzso 1 zzso 2 zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso and 5 zzso and all five sites bound zzso with high zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso showed that zzso site 1 is not required for zzso promoter activity, but is essential for zzso zzso from the zzso zzso We further showed that zzso sites 3, 4, and 5 were essential for zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso by zzso zzso zzso in addition to a zzso zzso a zzso element zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso DNA containing zzso formed multiple zzso complexes with zzso nuclear zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso We showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso
