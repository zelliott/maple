zzso in the zzso eye project their zzso zzso to targets in the zzso lobe of the zzso The zzso of zzso cells zzso terminate in the first zzso zzso the zzso while zzso and zzso zzso project through the zzso to terminate in distinct layers of the second zzso the zzso Here we report the identification of the gene zzso zzso and show that its function is required in the developing eye specifically for the zzso targeting of zzso zzso In mosaic animals lacking zzso function in the eye, zzso zzso project through the zzso to terminate in the zzso Other aspects of visual system development appear completely zzso zzso and zzso cell fates are correctly zzso zzso zzso correctly target the zzso and both correctly targeted zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso maintain their zzso order with respect to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso encodes two unusually zzso nuclear protein zzso one of which contains a putative zzso zinc finger zzso zzso expression of either zzso zzso is sufficient to restore the zzso targeting of zzso zzso in zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso or zzso zzso to the zzso These data demonstrate the existence of a zzso targeting mechanism for zzso zzso in the zzso visual system, and provide the first entry point in the molecular characterization of this zzso
