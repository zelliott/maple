In zzso zzso zzso acid zzso are divided into two zzso One class, represented by the general zzso acid zzso zzso contains zzso regulated in response to the nitrogen zzso The other class, including the high affinity zzso zzso zzso consists of the so-called zzso zzso We show that zzso is regulated at the level of protein zzso In zzso growing cells, zzso is in the plasma membrane and also accumulates in internal compartments of the zzso zzso Upon zzso deprivation or zzso treatment, zzso is transported to and zzso in the zzso The zzso machinery and zzso zzso within the zzso 31 zzso acids of zzso mediate zzso and degradation of the zzso zzso degradation of internal zzso is blocked in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that, upon zzso zzso internal zzso is diverted from the late zzso zzso to the zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso stability and sorting are controlled by the zzso signaling pathway, and regulated zzso to that of zzso
