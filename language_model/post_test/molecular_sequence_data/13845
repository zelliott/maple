The development of blood cells requires the interplay of zzso stem and zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso Although many proteins support the expansion of zzso precursor cells, identification of the late acting, lineage specific growth factor for zzso production, termed zzso has remained zzso Recently, characterization of the zzso zzso revealed structural zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the cell of origin of its zzso we hypothesized that the zzso for zzso might be identical with zzso and together with scientists at zzso zzso recently cloned its zzso Using zzso protein we have shown that the zzso displays all of the expected biological properties of the major regulator of zzso development, and proposed that it be termed zzso
