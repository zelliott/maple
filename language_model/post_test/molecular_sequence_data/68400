alpha zzso of satellite zzso zzso of zzso coli is zzso in zzso replication with three zzso First, the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes specifically the zzso origin and the zzso replication region required for zzso alpha zzso interacts with all six type I repeats zzso present in the zzso Second, associated with the alpha protein is a DNA zzso activity that is fueled by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso All common zzso except zzso and zzso can serve as zzso Strand separation of partial duplexes containing zzso ends that resemble a replication fork is zzso although a zzso fork is not absolutely required for the zzso to invade and unwind duplex zzso alpha zzso zzso unwinding in the zzso direction with respect to the strand it has zzso Finally, the zzso activity already demonstrated for alpha protein is due to synthesis of zzso zzso In zzso alpha protein generates zzso to zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso product is the zzso zzso on which most of the longer zzso are zzso Using DNA zzso of defined sequence as templates, synthesis of zzso was also zzso To date, among zzso and zzso replication systems, zzso alpha is the only protein known that combines three activities on one single zzso zzso
