The zzso sizes of the Venezuelan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated and proved to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, the highest so far recorded among zzso also the zzso zzso zzso of Variation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contents are very zzso zzso repetitive zzso zzso were isolated from restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso The zzso and zzso zzso allocations of these rep zzso were analyzed by direct and zzso zzso show that the two zzso zzso several rep DNA families which show both zzso and zzso zzso in their in zzso zzso zzso The rep DNA families show an zzso distribution at both the zzso areas of all zzso and in the whole arms of two pairs of the zzso group, suggesting zzso of the rep zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA, when cloned and zzso proved to consist of a long zzso unit zzso zzso containing two copies of each of zzso and zzso internal zzso zzso restructuring between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mainly due to zzso changes, was accompanied by slight zzso and zzso movements of the putative satellite DNA families within stable zzso sizes and zzso zzso We discuss the findings obtained in zzso in the light of those regarding the zzso zzso the pocket zzso and the house zzso they support the idea that zzso restructuring could be the expression of molecular driven events of rep DNA amplification and zzso through zzso zzso
