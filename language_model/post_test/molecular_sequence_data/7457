Two rat zzso zzso were zzso they zzso fusion proteins that have at their zzso zzso the zzso 76 zzso acid zzso and at their zzso zzso the extension zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso acids and a molecular weight of zzso or zzso zzso zzso acids and a molecular weight of zzso The fusion proteins are processed in a zzso zzso to zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso of zzso to zzso of nuclear DNA suggests that there are 14 to 19 copies of the zzso and 6 to 10 of the zzso zzso The zzso for zzso has about 700 zzso and zzso about zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso contain zinc finger motifs of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are related to zzso proteins from other zzso
