zzso in the zzso gene have been reported to be associated with different forms of human zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To better understand the disruptive role of these zzso knowledge of the zzso relationship of the zzso gene is zzso To facilitate that, zzso clones zzso the mouse gene were isolated using bovine zzso sequences as zzso zzso analysis of clone zzso zzso that contained the entire coding sequence for the mouse zzso yielded the zzso organization of the zzso The gene is composed of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two zzso with the first and second zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in size, zzso Two major zzso and zzso zzso and three minor zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected on zzso zzso The major transcripts first appeared in the brain at embryonic day 13 and in the zzso at zzso day zzso zzso were missing in brain and eye of mice at embryonic day zzso Several zzso start sites were mapped within 26 zzso approximately 200 zzso upstream from the translation initiation zzso However, transcripts varied in the lengths of their 3' untranslated portion as a result of the zzso of different zzso zzso
