zzso fusion protein zzso has been shown to be involved in numerous zzso transport zzso In an effort to understand the basic mechanism of zzso in zzso membrane fusion events, we have examined the role that each of its three zzso play in how zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso of the first zzso domain zzso zzso acids zzso demonstrates that zzso binding by this domain is required for 20 S particle zzso A second zzso which permits zzso binding but not zzso yields a protein that can form 20 S particle but fails to mediate its zzso Similar zzso of the second zzso domain zzso zzso acids zzso result in zzso molecules that behave like wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to further probe the functional role of each zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso acids zzso is absolutely required for binding of zzso to the zzso complex, because the truncated zzso zzso is unable to form 20 S zzso When tested as an isolated zzso zzso the N domain is not sufficient for binding to the zzso complex, but when adjacent to the D1 domain or in a zzso zzso the N domain does mediate binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could both participate in particle zzso Only the zzso zzso was able to facilitate zzso release from the zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso binding to the zzso complex is zzso by the N domain and that both zzso binding and zzso by the D1 domain are essential for 20 S particle zzso The zzso interactions outlined suggest a mechanism by which zzso may use zzso zzso to facilitate the zzso fusion zzso
