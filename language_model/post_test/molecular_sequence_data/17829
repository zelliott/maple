zzso for increasing the efficiency of DNA modification with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso used as a target DNA treated with zzso derivatives of zzso having alternating zzso and zzso zzso bonds (both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso The reactions were carried out in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing two zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso and being complementary to the part of the target DNA zzso with zzso It was shown that zzso of the duplex formed by the target DNA, zzso and zzso is by zzso degrees C higher than in the absence of the zzso thus considerably increasing the efficiency of the zzso zzso of the target zzso at 40 degrees C, the increase for the zzso based on the zzso is zzso zzso of the target DNA modification by the zzso zzso derivatives in the presence of zzso is same as with zzso based on zzso with natural zzso zzso
