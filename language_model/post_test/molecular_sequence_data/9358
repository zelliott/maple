zzso zzso is the zzso agent of human zzso the most common zzso sexually transmitted infection zzso Despite its zzso little is known about the genetic diversity and population structure of this zzso zzso due to the lack of appropriate zzso The development of a panel of zzso makers and zzso from mining the zzso zzso sequence has paved the way to a global analysis of the genetic structure of the pathogen and association with clinical zzso 

Here we zzso a panel of zzso zzso genetic markers to zzso 235 zzso from Mexico, Chile, India, Australia, zzso New zzso Italy, Africa and the United States, including 19 clinical zzso recently collected from zzso women attending New York City sexually transmitted disease zzso Using population genetic analysis, we show that zzso zzso is a genetically diverse zzso with a unique population structure consisting of two types present in equal proportions zzso zzso belonging to the two types zzso 1 and type 2) differ significantly in the rate at which they harbor the zzso zzso virus, a zzso virus implicated in zzso zzso and in their sensitivity to the zzso drug, zzso We also uncover evidence of genetic exchange, indicating a sexual zzso of the zzso despite an absence of zzso sexual zzso 

Our study represents the first robust and comprehensive evaluation of global zzso zzso genetic diversity and population zzso Our identification of a unique zzso structure, and the clinically relevant zzso associated with them, provides a new dimension for understanding zzso zzso zzso In addition, our demonstration of the possibility of genetic exchange in the zzso has important implications for genetic research and control of the zzso
