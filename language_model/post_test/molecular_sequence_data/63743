zzso and zzso are short zzso zzso zzso peptides that hold potential as future alternatives for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been applied as the main tool in this study to investigate the thermodynamics of the interaction of these two zzso peptides as well as five zzso zzso with large zzso zzso zzso representing model and natural zzso zzso The zzso zzso were composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso natural zzso coli polar zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to make model zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained to characterize the zzso zzso binding to the zzso which then allowed for calculation of the zzso parameters of the zzso All peptides exhibited substantially stronger binding to zzso zzso and zzso coli membrane systems than to the zzso zzso system due to strong zzso attractions between the highly positively charged peptides and the zzso charged membrane surface, and results with zzso derivatives further revealed the effects of various zzso acid zzso on membrane zzso No significant improvement was observed upon increasing the zzso zzso charge from zzso to zzso Replacement of zzso zzso with zzso did not substantially change zzso binding to zzso zzso but moderately decreased the binding to zzso zzso Pro to Ala zzso in zzso allowing the zzso to adopt an zzso structure, resulted in a significant increase of the binding to both zzso and zzso zzso and therefore reduced the selectivity for bacterial and zzso zzso In contrast, substitution of zzso with other aromatic zzso acids significantly decreased the zzso ability to bind to zzso zzso and essentially eliminated binding to zzso zzso The zzso results were consistent with the outcome of zzso zzso membrane binding and zzso zzso Overall, our work showed that a natural zzso coli polar zzso extract as a bacterial membrane model was advantageous compared to the simpler and more widely used zzso zzso zzso
