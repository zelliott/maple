Two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by screening a zzso library, have a zzso consensus sequence with zzso zzso terminal repeats and a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso the zzso The zzso elements were amplified by zzso chain reaction from zzso DNA and contain the central part of the zzso zzso Individual clones of both zzso elements contain zzso zzso and stop zzso The zzso elements are present in zzso copies, while the zzso elements are present in approximately zzso copies per zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso suggesting the presence of functional zzso elements elsewhere in the zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso elements belong to the zzso zzso and zzso elements to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
