The zzso juvenile zzso stage of the insect zzso zzso zzso zzso is the only stage in the life cycle which is capable of surviving outside its host and it is adapted for tolerating environmental stresses and for host zzso We have isolated 45 unique expressed sequence tags zzso that are zzso in response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The majority of these zzso were zzso in response to zzso and zzso stress and were generally not induced in response to heat and cold zzso zzso zzso showed similarity to known zzso Among these were sequences which zzso putative zzso molecules or zzso factors, sequences which zzso zzso oxygen species, two zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso proteins and seven distinct late zzso abundant zzso zzso We also isolated 13 novel zzso These data show that the molecular response to zzso stress in zzso zzso zzso is complex and parallels many of the zzso changes which occur in drought tolerant plants during exposure to zzso and zzso zzso A notable feature of the zzso response of plants is the number and diversity of zzso zzso proteins zzso in response to zzso All of the zzso sequences detected in animals to date, including those reported in this study, belong to zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso expresses several novel sequences which zzso putative zzso and zzso unfolded zzso It is likely that these novel and putative proteins play an important role in zzso zzso possibly by carrying out analogous roles in zzso to those carried out by the other zzso protein classes in zzso
