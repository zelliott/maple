zzso zzso zzso against prion proteins zzso are indispensable in research and diagnosis of prion diseases, however the majority of these bind both the cellular zzso and the zzso zzso zzso According to the widely accepted zzso hypothesis the two zzso share the same zzso but differ in their zzso In the present study we set to determine the critical binding zzso of our zzso zzso with the view of discerning which zzso play a key role in the zzso transition between zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso that provided differential zzso of zzso tissue from individuals positive for zzso zzso zzso we performed zzso scanning and zzso zzso mapping to zzso the zzso zzso of this zzso and gain insight into its specificity on a molecular zzso We observed that instead of discriminating between the two prion protein zzso based on zzso differences, zzso binds a previously zzso zzso truncated form of zzso that ends with the zzso zzso which we named zzso The addition of a single zzso zzso zzso completely abolished zzso zzso while Western blots using zzso full-length zzso and zzso terminating at zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso discriminates between the two based on their difference in zzso
