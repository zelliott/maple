zzso zzso antagonists, such as the zzso tamoxifen or the zzso zzso can have inappropriate zzso effects in zzso and zzso To explain this paradox we zzso that zzso are inadvertently brought to the promoters of zzso zzso zzso The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding domain zzso was used as bait in a zzso screen of a zzso zzso library, in which the zzso cells were treated with zzso We have isolated and characterized two interesting steroid zzso proteins that regulate zzso in opposite zzso The first is zzso a previously described zzso protein containing a basic region zzso zzso domain, having no known nuclear zzso When zzso with zzso zzso receptors zzso or zzso zzso or zzso receptors zzso zzso increases the partial zzso activity of the zzso by 3- to zzso but it has no effect on zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso maps to the hinge region, and indeed, the zzso hinge region zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso Interestingly, pure zzso that lack partial zzso effects, such as the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso cannot be zzso by zzso We also isolated, zzso and zzso the human zzso zzso of the zzso mouse zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of zzso maps to the zzso zzso and a related human zzso zzso suppress zzso or zzso partial zzso activity by more than zzso This suppression is completely zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso Additionally, both zzso reverse the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso Our data suggest that the direction of zzso by zzso steroid receptors can be controlled by the ratio of zzso to zzso recruited to the zzso complex by zzso zzso In normal zzso and in zzso breast zzso in which the zzso activity of mixed zzso zzso steroid receptors may be zzso bound by zzso This suggests a strategy by which such partial zzso activity can be eliminated and by which candidate zzso zzso can be screened for this zzso
