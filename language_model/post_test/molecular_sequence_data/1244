The ABC zzso gene family has evolved by a gene zzso process; however, the number of ABC zzso in the human zzso is surprisingly zzso On zzso zzso spanning 90 zzso is an ABC zzso sequence zzso zzso as zzso with the highest similarity to zzso Here we show that while comparative analysis and in zzso prediction methods indicate the presence of at least 28 zzso the major zzso transcript in humans consists of only 6 zzso with a total length of zzso zzso The open reading frame of this transcript is capable of zzso a zzso of only zzso zzso zzso compared to the more than 1500 zzso acids of related ABC zzso The truncated zzso transcript shows zzso zzso highest in fetal liver, bone zzso and zzso Since the last zzso of the zzso transcript contains an apparent zzso we zzso the respective region from several primates and found that the zzso is due to an zzso deletion that is shared between human, zzso and gorilla, but is not found in zzso In addition, the human zzso gene contains two other zzso zzso in the zzso that zzso the second zzso domain, indicating that zzso is not capable of zzso a functional ABC zzso In an attempt to identify an intact zzso zzso we have zzso the full-length zzso from zzso macaque, which contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso producing an apparently functional ABC zzso Although the mouse and rat zzso contain long-range similarity in the locus where zzso is expected to zzso most of the zzso zzso in zzso are zzso below the threshold of sequence zzso searches or have been deleted zzso
