Many inherited diseases are associated with changed zzso patterns, and alternative zzso influences several biological processes as well as the replication of certain viral zzso For this reason, there is a broad interest in modulating individual zzso events for therapeutic zzso Based on the small nuclear zzso zzso zzso we have developed expression zzso for short zzso zzso that accumulate in the cell nucleus where zzso occurs and that can very specifically zzso the zzso of individual zzso More specifically, in the context of the fatal zzso disorder Spinal zzso zzso zzso we have shown that zzso zzso zzso can restore the inclusion of zzso 7 in the zzso gene and thereby alleviate or even fully cure disease symptoms in a severe mouse model for zzso Here we describe more generally procedures to produce zzso zzso to induce zzso inclusion and to test their efficiency in cell culture experiments at the level of zzso as well as zzso The zzso methods comprise reverse zzso zzso to detect the zzso changes, quantitative real-time zzso to measure zzso zzso expression levels and western zzso and zzso methods to detect a restoration of protein zzso Additionally, we indicate how zzso zzso can be introduced into gene transfer zzso for in zzso experiments in animal models or to zzso cell systems that are not readily amenable to DNA zzso
