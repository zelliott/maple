zzso zzso receptors zzso play an important role in the targeting of newly zzso soluble acid zzso to the zzso in higher zzso zzso These acid zzso carry zzso zzso recognition markers on their zzso zzso that are recognized by two distinct zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso Although much has been learned about the zzso it is unclear how these receptors interact with the highly diverse population of zzso zzso It is known that the terminal zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso However, the results from several studies using synthetic zzso indicate that the binding site encompasses at least two zzso of the zzso We now report the structure of the soluble zzso domain of a zzso form of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso This construct consists of the zzso 154 zzso acids zzso the signal zzso with zzso zzso for zzso at positions 31, 57, 68, and zzso The binding site of the zzso encompasses the zzso group plus three of the five zzso rings of zzso zzso zzso specificity for zzso arises from protein contacts with the zzso on the terminal zzso ring adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso linkage preference originates from the zzso of zzso interactions between the zzso and zzso
