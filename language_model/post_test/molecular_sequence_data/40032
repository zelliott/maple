zzso C virus is associated with diverse liver diseases including acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several studies have explored viral mechanisms involved in the establishment of persistent infection and zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso of zzso C virus core protein suggest that this protein has transforming and zzso properties with zzso activities in host zzso zzso of expressed genes in cells expressing Core protein is important in order to identify candidate genes responsible for these zzso zzso 

To compare and identify gene expression profiles in the human zzso derived cell line, zzso with transient expression of zzso C virus Core zzso 

We have used comparative zzso differential display of zzso from zzso zzso with and without transient expression of zzso Core protein or green fluorescent zzso previously obtained using the zzso Forest zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We observed differences in band zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso compared with those detected in cells without zzso and zzso with zzso Cloning and sequencing of a gene zzso zzso zzso that was expressed zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso was identified as zzso zzso 

The results confirm that zzso Core protein expressed in zzso is associated with specific changes in zzso zzso including the gene for zzso zzso This gene may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
