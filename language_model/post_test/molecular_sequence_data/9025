zzso zzso cell death protein 4) is an important novel zzso zzso zzso zzso translation, invasion and zzso and its expression is zzso in several zzso However, little is known about the zzso regulation and the promoter of this important zzso zzso So far the following is the first comprehensive study to describe the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso besides characterizing the gene zzso We identified the zzso start sites of the human zzso promoter, a functional zzso and the zzso promoter zzso Within this zzso region, computer-based analysis revealed several potential binding sites for zzso especially for zzso zzso zzso family members and zzso We identified four zzso elements to be indispensable for zzso promoter zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso was not sufficient to enhance zzso protein zzso Analysis in different solid cancer cell lines showed a significant correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso factors, zzso of zzso led to an enhanced expression of zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, specific zzso of zzso resulted in a decreased zzso gene zzso zzso gene analysis showed a significant zzso of zzso promoter activity by zzso with zzso which could be abolished by zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso to the zzso promoter was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso data and zzso analysis for zzso Taken together, data for the first time zzso zzso as a regulator of zzso by binding to the zzso promoter either alone or by interacting with zzso family zzso
