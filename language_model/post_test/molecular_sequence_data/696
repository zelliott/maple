zzso zzso zzso are universally zzso detoxifying zzso which have been shown to play a unique detoxifying role in northern zzso zzso consists of two distinct zzso zzso domain which contributes zzso to form zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain which provides zzso to form a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso of two zzso from the northern zzso zzso zzso were cloned and characterized for the first zzso Two full-length zzso zzso were obtained and named as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso have an open reading frame of 624 zzso which encodes a zzso acid zzso Multiple sequences alignment analysis shows that the deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and zzso have high zzso with other zzso class zzso The evolutionary relationship assessment indicates that the two deduced zzso acid sequences are closely related to zzso class zzso The zzso zzso gene is an zzso gene so that it has the same sequence as the zzso The zzso zzso fragments of the zzso northern zzso zzso were analyzed by tandem mass zzso and the results confirm the existence of the translation products of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The predicted three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso and zzso showed that both proteins have two zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso The zzso zzso serving as the ball in ball and zzso style interface in all reported zzso class zzso was found in both zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso from the northern zzso belong to the zzso class zzso which may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso
