zzso zzso zzso are a group of zzso that play a key role in zzso zzso zzso and in prevention of zzso However, their structure and mechanism of action are poorly zzso zzso seem like zzso acting on a very wide range of zzso most of which are of no zzso zzso Family zzso and screening lead to the first zzso zzso that express in a soluble and active form in zzso zzso We describe zzso with kinetic parameters similar to those reported for zzso zzso from zzso and others that show dramatically increased zzso In particular, we have evolved zzso zzso with zzso activities zzso higher than wild type and a specificity switch of zzso producing zzso specialized for zzso rather than zzso zzso Analysis of the newly evolved zzso provides insights into the evolutionary relationships between different family zzso
