The highly zzso Group 1 late zzso abundant zzso genes are present in the zzso of most plants as a gene zzso Family members are zzso along the entire coding region, especially within the extremely zzso internal 20 zzso acid zzso which may be zzso Cloning of Lea Group 1 genes from barley resulted in the characterization of four family members named zzso zzso zzso and zzso after the presence of this motif 1, 1, 3 and 4 times in each zzso zzso We present here the results of comparative and evolutionary analyses of the barley Group 1 Lea gene family zzso The most important findings resulting from this work are zzso the tandem zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the spatial conservation of putative regulatory elements between the four zzso gene zzso zzso the determination of the relative zzso of the gene family members and zzso the zzso nature of zzso and zzso reflecting a zzso or zzso event in their common zzso We also show evidence for the presence of one or two additional expressed zzso genes in the barley zzso Based on our results, we present a model for the evolution of the family in zzso including the 20 zzso acid zzso Comparisons of the zzso between the barley family and all other known Group 1 Lea genes using maximum zzso zzso analysis provide evidence for the time of divergence between the barley genes containing the internal motif as a single copy and as a zzso The zzso analyses also provide evidence for independent zzso of Group 1 genes containing the internal motif as a repeat in both zzso and zzso
