Seven zzso of a slowly growing, zzso zzso species were obtained from zzso and zzso zzso fluid samples from elderly patients in different regions of zzso These zzso were distinguished from related zzso species by colony zzso positive results for zzso zzso zzso at 68 zzso nitrate zzso and zzso and negative results for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid pattern obtained by zzso revealed a single cluster of zzso zzso acids similar to but different from those of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences were unique in comparison with those of other zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the zzso were most closely related to zzso tuberculosis zzso (21 base differences in zzso zzso zzso % zzso zzso gene sequence zzso A representative strain, zzso zzso showed zzso % zzso sequence similarity with zzso zzso strain M, 95 % zzso sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso ITS sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes showed that strain zzso zzso was located on a distinct zzso adjacent to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso values of 81 zzso zzso zzso demonstrated less than 70 % zzso with type strains of genetically related species and supported the novel species status of the zzso On the basis of this evidence, a novel species with the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain, isolated from a zzso sample, is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
