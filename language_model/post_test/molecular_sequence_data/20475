The zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned the first zzso zzso from a zzso library of the Pacific oyster zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso clone containing zzso zzso DNA revealed that the zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame that encodes a zzso zzso acid protein of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso of Homo zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso 22 zzso acid zzso which is characteristic of a signal zzso It also contains a zzso zzso In addition, it contains the zzso zzso zzso motif at the zzso which suggests that zzso zzso in the zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in the zzso which zzso zzso is induced during air exposure zzso zzso patterns of zzso zzso differed between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was induced at high temperature during air exposure zzso These indicate that zzso zzso is induced by zzso and heat shock stress, and there are different strategies for air exposure condition between zzso and zzso
