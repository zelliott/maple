A new zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso clones isolated from a zzso zzso library of zzso zzso The first transcript of this gene appeared 9 days after zzso of the roots with zzso zzso The time of expression and the quantity of the transcripts of the zzso gene was similar to that of zzso genes suggesting a similar zzso A protein of 246 zzso acids could be deduced from a full-length zzso zzso The first 24 zzso acids at the zzso end of this protein formed a signal sequence which might direct membrane transport into the zzso zzso Using different zzso methods the signal sequence zzso protein was tentatively predicted to be a zzso zzso but not zzso
