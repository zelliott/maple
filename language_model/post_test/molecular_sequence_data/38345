zzso zzso within viral zzso zzso of the zzso protein of zzso disease virus were analyzed using zzso peptides and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from vaccinated zzso zzso An zzso region between zzso zzso 16 and 35 was identified, with zzso zzso 20 to 34 zzso and 21 to 35 zzso particularly zzso for zzso from all of the vaccinated zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso memory cells in the zzso zzso using zzso zzso complex class II zzso zzso indicated recognition by zzso zzso zzso zzso was retained in a tandem zzso with the zzso zzso 137 to 156 sequential zzso zzso This zzso site also retained zzso but evidence is presented that specific zzso induction in zzso required both this and the zzso zzso zzso recognition of the zzso 20 to 35 region was also zzso zzso the zzso zzso 20 to 35 region is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso site for pigs that is capable of providing help for a zzso zzso when in tandem, thus extending the possible zzso repertoire of zzso zzso
