zzso proteins are zzso III zzso that process double stranded zzso precursors into small zzso zzso as small interfering zzso zzso or zzso zzso which suppress gene expression through the zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso the first gene of this family to be identified in zzso The zzso zzso occurred in multiple forms, including the truncated molecules that result from premature zzso zzso zzso zzso were not impaired as regards zzso gene zzso since they exhibited the same zzso frequency as the zzso strain and accumulated the two size classes of zzso associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso showed a reduced growth rate and a zzso growth zzso which suggests that the zzso gene has some role in the control of zzso zzso
