zzso proteins have been implicated in the regulation of gene expression during a variety of biological zzso including growth control, zzso development and zzso More than 35 related proteins containing the zzso zzso have now been found which specifically interact with DNA sequences encompassing the core zzso zzso Although zzso responsive genes have been identified in the zzso little is known about their distribution and function in this zzso We have now demonstrated that zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso numerous zzso zzso The expression of some of these proteins is regulated as a function of zzso Among these is a novel zzso zzso factor with a dual zzso zzso which we have called zzso The expression of zzso is not only zzso specific, but it is the only zzso protein so far zzso and one of the very few zzso factors whose expression is restricted to the most differentiated zzso zzso We show that two zzso marker genes whose expression zzso with that of zzso are zzso by this protein in a complex mode which involves interactions with other zzso regulators such as zzso and zzso
