zzso of the zzso transient zzso potential zzso are involved in zzso and zzso calcium zzso There are seven zzso all of which have a zzso zzso zzso domain in their C zzso We now tested binding of zzso to zzso N zzso and show that only that of zzso binds zzso in a zzso zzso Four zzso zzso have been reported: a (also clone zzso b (also clone 17), zzso and zzso zzso responsible for zzso binding in zzso a and b are absent from the alpha and beta zzso The alpha and beta zzso of zzso were reported as alternative forms, when zzso of zzso a and b proved zzso Here we analyzed total zzso samples from brain and zzso for presence of zzso a and b and describe the zzso patterns responsible for their formation, as well as those leading to the alpha and beta forms of zzso We zzso existence of zzso zzso the zzso a and zzso zzso in 21 zzso with an zzso zzso in zzso 2 for zzso and in zzso 4 for zzso The analysis of alpha and beta zzso zzso indicates that although the zzso beta zzso may exist, the zzso alpha zzso is derived from an incompletely processed zzso zzso It includes in its presumed zzso zzso 713 zzso of zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso of an incompletely excised zzso While zzso an active channel in the zzso the human zzso appears to be a zzso We searched for the human gene in the data bank and located approximately one-half of it in a zzso region zzso to that of the zzso with similar zzso zzso We conclude that the human zzso gene may never have been an active gene because of incomplete ancestral zzso or, if it was complete at one point, that it became inactive upon loss of zzso zzso
