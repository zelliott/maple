zzso and zzso zzso receptors differ in their responses to a variety of zzso despite their relatively high primary sequence zzso We carried out a zzso study to identify zzso acids underlying these divergent zzso zzso clamp analysis of zzso zzso receptors indicated that several functionally dominant sites were localized to the zzso side of zzso All zzso zzso acids in the region between zzso and zzso of zzso were then individually zzso to their zzso zzso We found that a single zzso acid zzso in zzso controls both zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso in zzso slowed zzso zzso These functional effects were accompanied by zzso in binding zzso These results support a critical role for these zzso in zzso binding and gating zzso
