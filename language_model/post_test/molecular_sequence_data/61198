Natural competence in zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso mechanism consisting of a zzso zzso zzso its dedicated zzso apparatus zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso and a response regulator zzso In this report, we show that zzso is a zzso protein that acts zzso by binding to a region in its own zzso Two additional zzso binding sites were identified in the zzso zzso one in the promoter region of zzso and the other upstream of an ABC zzso of unknown zzso A comparison of the zzso sequences with the sequence motif previously found to be involved in the zzso expression of the late genes revealed that they are zzso These findings indicate that zzso activates zzso of the late genes zzso zzso via one or more intermediate zzso
