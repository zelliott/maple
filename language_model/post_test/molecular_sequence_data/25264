A synthetic zzso precursor analog containing the structural elements of zzso coli zzso was characterized as a zzso for zzso coli zzso P and for zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the synthetic precursor exhibited a zzso dependence quite similar to that of natural zzso precursors such as zzso coli zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoted processing of the zzso precursor at zzso zzso otherwise insufficient to support zzso very similar behavior was noted for zzso coli zzso As noted previously for natural zzso zzso the absence of the zzso CA sequence in the synthetic precursor diminished the facility of processing of this zzso by zzso P and zzso zzso A study of the zzso dependence of processing of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso provided unequivocal evidence for an zzso in the actual site of processing by zzso coli zzso P as a function of zzso zzso This property was subsequently demonstrated to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor containing a potential zzso base pair at the end of the zzso zzso
