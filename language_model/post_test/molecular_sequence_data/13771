The hallmark of all the zzso zzso zzso including zzso class I and zzso class II zzso et zzso 1992) zzso is their lack of zzso It is zzso therefore, that these zzso molecules must have a distinct zzso function in which zzso is not zzso In some cases this may involve presentation of a zzso zzso as has been demonstrated for human zzso It is possible that a zzso adapted to present bacterial lipids would remain relatively zzso because a zzso which is the end product of a complex zzso pathway, is likely to evolve less rapidly than a short stretch of zzso acid sequence containing a zzso zzso zzso the lack of zzso could reflect the presentation by these molecules of relatively zzso zzso such as those derived from heat shock zzso It also is possible that a zzso zzso could be selected for the presentation of modified zzso An example of this is the zzso zzso which can bind even short peptides as long as they have a zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Based upon their structural differences, we believe it is likely that the zzso zzso and zzso are likely to present different types of zzso The presence in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which in class I normally from hydrogen bonds with zzso suggests that the zzso zzso also can present zzso zzso A zzso zzso function also is suggested by the expression of the zzso zzso by at least one zzso cell type, the zzso cell of the zzso and by the ability of zzso T cells to recognize the zzso zzso While we favor the hypothesis that the zzso zzso presents zzso the data cited above do not constitute formal proof of any kind of zzso function, and it remains possible that the zzso zzso does something zzso As noted above, no attempts to zzso the structure of the zzso bound to the zzso zzso have so far succeeded, including the screening of zzso display libraries zzso zzso Miller, zzso zzso zzso unpublished zzso In contrast, our recent work has demonstrated that zzso presents relatively long peptides with a structured motif distinct from classical class I zzso This zzso zzso which is present in a wide range of zzso does not by itself provide a simple explanation for the lack of zzso zzso and, as noted above, it remains possible that the natural zzso for zzso is a zzso zzso Besides their lack of zzso the zzso zzso and zzso molecules share two additional features in common which might give insight into their their biological zzso First, their surface expression does not depend upon the presence of a functional TAP zzso and they probably can reach the cell surface as empty zzso Second, both molecules are expressed by zzso cells in the zzso This leads to the speculation that these two zzso class I molecules could be involved in sampling or zzso of zzso peptides for their ultimate presentation to cells of the systematic immune zzso For example, longer zzso peptides could be taken up by zzso and perhaps by the zzso zzso and then further processed to zzso for presentation by classical class I zzso They also could be transported across the zzso cell by the zzso zzso or zzso and subsequently presented by either class I or class II molecules expressed by cells in the zzso zzso This sampling or zzso zzso by either the zzso zzso or zzso could play a role in the induction of immune responses, or more likely perhaps, in the induction of systemic oral tolerance to zzso zzso zzso
