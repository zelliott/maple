The zzso zzso chain is mainly expressed at the skin, and its zzso G domain has a critical role in multiple biological zzso We screened for biologically active sites on the mouse zzso zzso chain G domain using 107 synthetic peptides on coated plates and zzso to zzso beads with zzso human zzso cells, zzso human skin zzso cells, and human zzso zzso zzso Eleven peptides exhibited cell attachment activity with respect to the zzso plates and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly binds to zzso zzso Four peptides promoted zzso cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited attachment of zzso to eight peptides on the coated zzso In contrast, zzso significantly inhibited attachment of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso but had no effect on the attachment of the other zzso zzso cells formed well-organized zzso stress fibers and focal contacts with zzso zzso on zzso Additionally, attachment of zzso to zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso promotes zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso exhibited cell attachment activity only in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso membrane promoted zzso attachment and spreading with well-organized zzso stress zzso The zzso zzso zzso partially inhibited attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso site is involved in zzso zzso cell zzso These active sites are likely important in the biological activities of the zzso zzso chain G domain and would be useful for the study of molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
