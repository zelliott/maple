We have previously provided evidence that zzso acid zzso within the zzso portion of the helper zzso zzso from tobacco vein zzso virus zzso in particular at zzso not only affect the zzso transmission activity of zzso but also have a significant effect on zzso zzso In the present study zzso acids which differ in their charge properties were zzso at position zzso A highly basic zzso was required to retain helper component activity and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso gene suggested that this zzso domain may be an essential element for zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso gene with that from another zzso zzso yellow mosaic virus, maintained zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso virus, although symptoms were zzso Our results suggest that, in addition to its importance in zzso transmission, the zzso gene may be of general importance in regulating zzso of zzso possibly by interaction of these sequences with the zzso
