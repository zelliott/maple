The opportunistic zzso pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso are very rarely isolated from patients and are resistant to zzso We collected 38 strains of the two zzso isolated from Europe and Japan, and compared the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso regions, zzso drug zzso and zzso zzso production as a potential zzso zzso While the zzso sequences of zzso zzso were not very divergent (more than zzso sequence similarity among the zzso those of zzso zzso showed remarkable diversity, and were divided into four zzso with three zzso In the ITS region, no variation was found in either zzso Since the sequence similarity of the two species is approximately zzso at the ITS region, they are closely related zzso zzso resistance was zzso for the two zzso but they were susceptible to zzso and zzso zzso No strain of either species zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results provide zzso information for accurate zzso which is of benefit to global molecular zzso studies and zzso our understanding of the medical zzso characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
