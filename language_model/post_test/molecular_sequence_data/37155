zzso a zzso neutral zzso acid zzso from zzso insect zzso differs from other members of the zzso zzso family zzso in two important ways: zzso it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso such as zzso acid zzso and zzso it accepts zzso as well as zzso as a zzso To determine whether the restoration of zzso zzso to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might abolish its zzso but not its zzso recognition site, we constructed a multiple zzso in which nine divergent zzso zzso were zzso back to the zzso form of the zzso To investigate the zzso site, we constructed several single zzso that had been identified in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was injected into zzso zzso and the effects of external zzso acids and zzso upon labeled zzso zzso and zzso currents were zzso The multiple zzso exhibited no zzso zzso indicating that one or more of the zzso zzso are crucial for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the first zzso zzso of zzso led to results equivalent to those observed in the corresponding zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso net inward current were severely zzso The zzso zzso zzso which zzso to a zzso zzso zzso that is thought to render zzso equivalent to zzso as a zzso zzso functioned no differently to zzso The effects of zzso zzso in the third zzso zzso of zzso were dramatically different from the equivalent zzso zzso in zzso Although kinetic zzso expression levels and plasma membrane zzso were all similar in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso exhibited a zzso increase in labeled zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso This increase is in sharp contrast to the complete loss of zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also differed from zzso in zzso selectivity and zzso spectrum, as revealed by zzso net inward currents that were measured with a zzso zzso zzso zzso currents induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed in both zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso current was zzso higher in zzso than in zzso whereas no zzso zzso currents above control levels were detected either in zzso or zzso These results suggest that transport of zzso the zzso zzso in insect zzso is tightly coupled to that of zzso acids in zzso in contrast to the independence of zzso and zzso acid transport in the closely related zzso zzso acid zzso channel, zzso
