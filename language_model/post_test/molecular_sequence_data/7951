The zzso the site of zzso zzso zzso synthesis and processing in zzso cells, contains a number of small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the processing of zzso zzso from larger precursors and contains a region complementary to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso which disrupt this base pairing potential are lethal and prevent synthesis of zzso zzso These zzso zzso show defects in processing which closely resemble the effects of genetic depletion of components of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which carry zzso zzso allows the zzso zzso to support viability and zzso zzso zzso at high zzso zzso processing steps which are blocked by the external transcribed zzso region zzso are largely restored by expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso processing therefore requires direct base pairing between zzso and the zzso Base pairing with the zzso is thus a common feature of small zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso
