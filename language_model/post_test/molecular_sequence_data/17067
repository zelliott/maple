We compared the zzso effect of original zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with that of a newly developed, synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso in zzso zzso in each zzso Using zzso by zzso zzso zzso cumulative administration of zzso and zzso caused zzso smooth muscle relaxation with similar zzso and maximum zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso analogue and the original zzso caused zzso relaxation with a similar maximum zzso effect and potency as zzso However, the onset and offset of action was markedly slower for the zzso analogue than for the original zzso zzso versus zzso of peak relaxation remaining 5 h after zzso zzso zzso by zzso (10 zzso and zzso (1 zzso significantly increased the maximum zzso effect and duration of action of zzso but not of the zzso zzso during the 3 h of observation in the human zzso We conclude that zzso zzso produces significant zzso and sustained zzso smooth muscle relaxation in zzso The sustained zzso effect is due, at least in part, to the synthetic zzso analogue being less susceptible to zzso by zzso than the original zzso zzso
