Exposure to various combinations of zzso and zzso zzso has been reported to increase NO production in vascular zzso zzso The molecular entity of the newly expressed zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso cells, however, has not yet been examined in zzso In this report, we carried out zzso zzso and molecular identification of zzso zzso expressed in zzso bovine zzso zzso cells zzso The increased zzso activity in tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso was localized mainly in the zzso fraction and zzso whereas that in zzso zzso was zzso in the membrane fraction and zzso suggesting that zzso increased an zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso increased an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the different responses to the zzso zzso were demonstrated in zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso specific for zzso or zzso that is, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso whereas zzso increased that of zzso zzso A nuclear zzso zzso zzso and an zzso experiment by zzso D indicated that the apparent increase of zzso in the zzso zzso was at least in part ascribed to the zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the amplified zzso products in zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso identical to the corresponding regions of human zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso These findings indicated that, in zzso zzso two zzso zzso whose molecular zzso were closely zzso to the conventional zzso of zzso and zzso were differently induced in response to distinct inflammatory zzso
