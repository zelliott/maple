An zzso based on reverse zzso coupled with the zzso chain reaction zzso was used for the detection of hog zzso virus zzso and bovine virus zzso virus zzso in cell zzso In this study, a zzso of the zzso derived from cell cultures infected with zzso and zzso was used in zzso zzso in place of extracted viral zzso Both zzso and zzso were performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The specificity of the zzso products was confirmed by zzso with a zzso DNA zzso The results not only show that the stage of zzso isolation can be bypassed, but also illustrate an easy and efficient means of obtaining templates suitable for identification and zzso of zzso and zzso in tissue culture by zzso
