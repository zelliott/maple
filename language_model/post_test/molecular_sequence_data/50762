Two clones zzso and zzso each containing the complete coding sequence for the bovine cardiac zzso zzso were obtained from a zzso zzso zzso library by screening with zzso zzso from the canine zzso The coding sequence of clone zzso was 92 and zzso identical to the canine zzso at the zzso and zzso acid levels, zzso Nine of the 21 zzso acid differences between the two zzso were found within the zzso acid signal zzso The zzso portions of the 3' untranslated regions of the cow and dog clones were zzso zzso zzso exchange activity was expressed in zzso zzso zzso injected with zzso from clone zzso and in zzso cells zzso with expression zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso proteins from zzso cells with an zzso against the zzso portion of the bovine zzso showed the presence of a zzso protein corresponding to the intact cardiac zzso The second bovine clone zzso did not express exchange activity in either of the above expression systems, presumably because it contained a zzso insert with multiple stop zzso which interrupted the coding zzso zzso of the zzso untranslated regions of zzso and zzso revealed a zzso segment in zzso that was apparently spliced out of zzso This segment contained a short open reading zzso A zzso zzso the zzso untranslated region of zzso and the coding sequence of zzso exhibited only a modest zzso increase in expressed exchange activity in zzso cells compared to zzso suggesting that the presence of the upstream open reading frame in zzso did not greatly reduce translation zzso The results suggest that alternate zzso mechanisms may be involved in processing zzso for the bovine cardiac zzso
