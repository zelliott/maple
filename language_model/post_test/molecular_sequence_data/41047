The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso and compared with that of zzso zzso zzso a crown zzso Several common gene clusters were identified and gene order, zzso and sequence similarity was assessed through comparisons with zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were present between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, major expansion has occurred in the zzso zzso zzso accounting for its larger zzso However, the key zzso genes are present and differ only in the absence of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso suggesting a high level of gene conservation within the zzso zzso Further comparisons with the zzso zzso of closely related green zzso zzso have provided additional support for the hypothesis that a zzso zzso was the zzso zzso donor via secondary zzso
