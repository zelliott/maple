zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein with a calculated relative molecular mass of more than 200 zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso receptors zzso at the zzso zzso This activity has been mapped to its zzso zzso In an attempt to identify the functions of the zzso end, we have now characterized full-length chick zzso We show that chick zzso zzso by a previously described zzso is not zzso from zzso zzso zzso is achieved with a construct that includes an additional 350 zzso derived from the zzso end of chick zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso of more than 400 zzso with zzso side chains attached only to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in tissue zzso also has an apparent molecular mass of zzso 400 zzso While the zzso acid sequence zzso by the zzso extension has no zzso to published rat zzso it includes a stretch of 15 zzso acids that is zzso identical to a previously identified bovine zzso The extension is required for binding of zzso to zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso that includes the extension are considerably smaller than those induced by zzso fragments, suggesting that binding of zzso to zzso zzso the size of zzso zzso In addition, we found a site zzso seven zzso acids at the zzso end of zzso that is alternatively zzso While motor zzso express the zzso zzso with the seven zzso acid long zzso muscle cells mainly zzso zzso that lack this zzso In conclusion, the zzso described here code for chick zzso that has all the characteristics previously allocated to zzso zzso
