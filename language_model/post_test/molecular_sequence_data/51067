It is investigated whether protein segments predicted to have a zzso zzso preference in the absence of zzso interactions are zzso in families of zzso zzso The prediction method follows the procedures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso paper in this zzso It uses a zzso force field that incorporates only local interactions along the sequence and identifies segments whose lowest energy structure displays a sizable energy gap relative to other zzso zzso In 13 of the protein families and zzso considered that are sufficiently zzso to have similar zzso structures, at least one region is consistently predicted as having the same preferred zzso in virtually all family zzso These regions are between 4 and 26 zzso zzso They are often located at chain ends and zzso primarily to segments of secondary structure heavily involved in interactions with the rest of the zzso suggesting that they could act as zzso around which other parts of the structure would zzso Experimental data on early folding zzso or on protein fragments with appreciable structure in zzso solution are available for more than half of the protein zzso zzso of our results with these data is quite zzso They reveal that each of the zzso identified early formed, or independently stable, zzso harbors at least one of the segments consistently predicted as having a preferred zzso by our zzso The implications of our findings for the conservation of folding pathways in zzso proteins are zzso
