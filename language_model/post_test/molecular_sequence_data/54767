The functions of some proteins zzso by human zzso zzso zzso genes have been zzso however, systematic analysis of the transcripts for this region is still zzso The results of both rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and zzso library screening in this study proved that 3' zzso of all transcripts in the zzso region were located approximately 20 zzso downstream from each potential zzso zzso zzso which were at the positions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso sequence of the H strain, zzso Thus, there were at least two large families of zzso transcripts in this gene zzso The first family of zzso transcripts contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the second one consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso characterization further confirmed that multiple uses of zzso signals were commonly used by zzso to zzso genetic zzso
