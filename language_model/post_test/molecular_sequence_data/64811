The coordination of zzso zzso with zzso modification is a central topic in gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso complex zzso bears multiple zzso motifs for zzso and zzso tail zzso Here, we identify and characterize zzso and show that it bears tandem essential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated, and were lethal in combination with zzso whereas combinations with zzso grew zzso zzso involving zzso of zzso zzso (the main target of zzso but not other zzso or zzso zzso zzso also zzso severe growth defects to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound an zzso tail zzso zzso at zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso did zzso Loss of particular zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso promotes gene zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso displayed defects in the zzso of genes involved in zzso acid zzso cell wall integrity, and other zzso Taken together, zzso bears essential tandem zzso that rely on zzso zzso zzso to assist zzso complex for gene zzso
