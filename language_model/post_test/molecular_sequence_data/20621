zzso initiation region of zzso T4 gene 25 contains three potential Shine and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis has predicted that an zzso zzso structure may include zzso and zzso bringing the most typical sequence zzso zzso to the initiation zzso Here, we report physical evidence demonstrating that previously predicted zzso zzso structure indeed exists in zzso during gene 25 expression in zzso zzso coli zzso The second zzso zzso structure is identified 14 zzso upstream of the zzso I, while the zzso zzso as well as the start zzso of the zzso are proved to be within an unfolded stretch of zzso zzso comparison of 38 zzso zzso reveals that the zzso and some zzso zzso evolve a similar structural strategy for the translation initiation of 25, while zzso zzso and zzso zzso use an alternative zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that a specific zzso fold forms the split zzso binding site at the gene zzso zzso zzso which is highly competent in the zzso zzso We conclude that this zzso binding site has evolved after zzso zzso from other zzso zzso Additionally, we determine that the zzso sequence zzso is most widespread in zzso
