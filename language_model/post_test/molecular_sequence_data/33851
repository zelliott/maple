We assessed the indigenous zzso zzso zzso zzso community structure from the roots and associated soil of zzso major zzso plants growing on sites zzso with trace metals zzso and on unpolluted zzso zzso and zzso sites containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected based on a survey of the TM concentration in zzso of community gardens in the City of zzso Total zzso DNA was extracted directly from these zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso by cloning and sequencing, as well as direct sequencing techniques, was all used to investigate zzso community zzso We found a decreased diversity of native zzso zzso by the number of zzso zzso in zzso and plant roots harvested from zzso zzso compared with unpolluted zzso We also found that community structure was modified by TM zzso Various species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most abundant zzso detected in unpolluted zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in both zzso and unpolluted soils, while zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were dominant in zzso zzso The predominance of zzso zzso in zzso sites suggests the tolerance of this species to TM stress, as well as its potential use for zzso These data are relevant for our understanding of how zzso microbial communities respond to natural environments that contain a broad variety of toxic zzso compounds and will substantially expand our knowledge of zzso ecology and zzso
