By means of deleting a zzso portion of the open reading frame of the zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso we have produced a protein corresponding to the first two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This protein that lacked the third zzso domain, the zzso region and most of the zzso zzso tail was detected in the medium of zzso virus infected zzso The properties of the truncated zzso zzso were further characterized by in zzso translation and zzso The molecular weight of the unmodified protein was found to be 27 zzso translation in the presence of dog zzso zzso led to an increase in molecular weights which we attribute to zzso Upon incubation with zzso at 37 degrees C, the zzso generated protein specifically reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso particles derived after incubation with the protein showed the induction of a slower zzso particle zzso Our experiments suggest that the two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in soluble form are sufficient for the conversion of zzso into a zzso zzso
