Banana fruit has become an important cause of fruit zzso in the recent zzso Among the five registered zzso zzso zzso a 1 and zzso a 2 have been characterized in zzso In this study, molecular characterization and evaluation of the zzso properties of zzso from banana zzso zzso zzso as zzso a 5, were zzso 

The gene of zzso a 5 was cloned and zzso The obtained zzso revealed a novel zzso a 5 zzso with an open reading frame zzso a protein of 340 zzso acids zzso a putative signal zzso of 28 zzso acid zzso By zzso analysis zzso a 5 isolated from banana fruit revealed a molecular mass of zzso Two zzso a 5 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso with an identical zzso zzso By mass zzso 76 and zzso of the primary structure was confirmed for the two mature zzso a 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso a 5 was found in zzso of patients zzso to banana zzso zzso of zzso zzso markers zzso and zzso was achieved with zzso a 5 in a zzso zzso 

zzso a 5 is a functional zzso and a candidate for the zzso zzso diagnosis of banana zzso
