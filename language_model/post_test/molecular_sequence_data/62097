Variations in the human zzso zzso gene have driven exploration of their zzso zzso and pathological zzso We investigated the existence of variations in the nonhuman zzso zzso zzso gene to determine whether nonhuman primates can model zzso associations of relevance to zzso Similar to the zzso single zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso a zzso discovered in the zzso monkey zzso zzso gene zzso alters an zzso acid in the zzso arm of the zzso zzso for zzso at position zzso Two zzso zzso coding regions isolated from a single zzso zzso zzso monkey brain were expressed in zzso cells and characterized in zzso zzso zzso the findings of increased affinity of zzso by the zzso zzso in the human, the zzso monkey zzso zzso protein derived from the zzso clone demonstrated a zzso greater affinity for zzso than the zzso derived from the zzso zzso An zzso developed to assess the zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso characterized cohort of zzso monkeys zzso indicated that zzso were zzso for zzso zzso 50% were zzso and zzso were zzso for zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso was associated with significantly lower zzso and zzso plasma cortisol levels zzso and zzso zzso and a significantly higher aggressive threat score zzso in zzso In a cohort of 20 zzso a trend towards an inverse correlation between aggressive threat and plasma cortisol levels was zzso The findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso in monkeys can contribute to individual zzso in stress response and related zzso The data support the use of nonhuman primates to investigate zzso zzso zzso relations of relevance to zzso
