Two zzso heavy chain zzso expressed in smooth muscle, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are derived from alternate zzso that results in different zzso acid sequences at their zzso zzso tail zzso These zzso are zzso regulated and zzso expressed in various smooth muscle zzso The functional role of zzso zzso differing at the zzso tail has been investigated both in zzso and in zzso zzso of the zzso tail of zzso by zzso activates the zzso of zzso at low zzso but does not change the maximum zzso zzso of zzso mimicking zzso tail regions specific to the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso coli smooth muscle fibers zzso maximum zzso zzso zzso and decreases zzso sensitivity but has no effect on maximum zzso The zzso of zzso by the zzso was not reversed on zzso whereas zzso zzso by the zzso is zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso specifically bound to zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso junction using zzso and zzso zzso at this site could have a direct effect on zzso zzso The relation between zzso zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso was examined using zzso administration to zzso rats to increase the relative expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso smooth zzso This increase in zzso was significantly correlated with an increase in zzso In contrast, the high zzso zzso zzso was decreased by administration of zzso to zzso zzso Thus, changes in zzso zzso distribution appear to affect zzso function in zzso We propose a mechanism zzso the interactions between the zzso tail of one zzso zzso and the zzso region of another in the thick filament can zzso zzso in an zzso specific zzso Further work is needed to unequivocally identify the function of smooth muscle zzso zzso However, our evidence suggests that the zzso heavy chain zzso may be important zzso of smooth muscle zzso
