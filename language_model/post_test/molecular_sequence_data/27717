We characterized zzso gene amplification in three human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso in long-range regions surrounding amplified zzso genes were examined by zzso gel zzso Since zzso zzso completely zzso DNA at the middle of the zzso zzso we were able to construct a physical map upstream and downstream of the zzso zzso zzso and to obtain information on restriction sites surrounding amplified zzso zzso This method enables us to zzso the organization of amplified units over a long zzso zzso patterns differed considerably among the zzso and the three cell lines, but were simple in each zzso We estimated that the minimal distance between neighboring zzso genes is at least several hundred zzso Our data suggest that amplification units contain several DNA fragments derived from different zzso but that they are zzso
