The majority of human pancreatic zzso display a zzso zzso experimental studies indicate that tumors with this zzso can arise from both zzso and zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso factor 1 zzso complex is required for gene zzso zzso zzso factor 1 is a zzso of zzso zzso and ubiquitous zzso and zzso basic zzso zzso We have examined the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso rat zzso tumors and zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso transplanted zzso zzso tumors express zzso whereas zzso cell lines, and the tumors induced by them, display a zzso zzso and lack zzso In human zzso cancer cell lines and zzso zzso is present in zzso tumors but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso did not activate the expression of zzso nor a reporter gene under the control of the rat zzso zzso In some cell lines, zzso was detected in the nucleus whereas in others it was zzso as in one human zzso zzso Together with prior work, our findings indicate that zzso is associated with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and it is necessary, but not zzso for the expression of the zzso zzso
