zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the reduction of zzso and zzso zzso and is present in virtually every zzso To study the regulation of its zzso the human zzso zzso gene and promoter were cloned and zzso The protein coding region consists of eight zzso with two additional upstream zzso separated by a large zzso of zzso zzso that code for the zzso untranslated region of the zzso Two zzso transcripts that zzso the same protein and that originate from alternative zzso were zzso The shorter transcript is the major form as shown by Northern blots and reverse zzso zzso Northern blots of multiple zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso is present in all zzso examined and is most abundant in zzso liver, and zzso which is consistent with the tissue zzso zzso The two zzso transcripts do not exhibit differential tissue zzso A construct containing a promoter region insert in a zzso zzso drives zzso of a zzso reporter gene and is zzso more active than a control zzso without insert in zzso zzso zzso The activity of the full promoter construct is comparable to that of a zzso zzso containing the zzso promoter with an zzso The promoter does not contain a zzso box, but contains multiple zzso islands and exhibits zzso activity in zzso zzso The major active promoter element was localized by zzso deletions and zzso to a DNA element zzso zzso to zzso that zzso binds the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene structure to all other characterized human genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and type I and type II zzso zzso indicates that it is more zzso related to these genes than they are among zzso
