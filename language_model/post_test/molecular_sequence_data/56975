The zzso zzso encodes the two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso is one of two terminal zzso in the zzso respiratory chain of zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that expression of the zzso zzso is zzso regulated by oxygen via both the zzso and zzso gene zzso Whereas zzso clearly serves as a positive regulator at low oxygen tension, there is no consensus concerning the role of the zzso gene product zzso In this paper, the zzso start site of the zzso zzso is identified at position zzso with respect to the zzso zzso This is located 53 zzso downstream from the center of zzso symmetry of the putative zzso recognition zzso
