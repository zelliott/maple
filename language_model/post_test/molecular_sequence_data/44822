zzso editing changes zzso single zzso in zzso zzso Although much work has been done on zzso and functional aspects of zzso editing, little is known about evolutionary aspects of this zzso processing zzso To gain a better understanding of the evolution of zzso editing in zzso we have investigated the editing patterns in zzso and zzso transcripts from various species zzso all major groups of land zzso Our results indicate that zzso editing occurs in zzso of zzso zzso allies, true zzso zzso and zzso Both editing zzso and editing patterns show a remarkable degree of zzso zzso Furthermore, we have found that neither zzso editing zzso nor the editing pattern of a specific transcript correlate with the zzso tree of the plant zzso The poor evolutionary conservation of editing sites among closely related species as well as the occurrence of single zzso editing sites suggest that the differences in the editing patterns and editing zzso are probably due both to independent loss and to gain of editing zzso In addition, our results indicate that zzso editing is a relatively ancient process that probably predates the evolution of land zzso This supposition is in good agreement with the zzso data obtained for plant zzso zzso editing, thus providing additional evidence for common evolutionary roots of the two plant zzso editing zzso
