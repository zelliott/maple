zzso is an essential, zzso small regulatory protein in zzso zzso It zzso zzso a wide variety of targeted proteins in the forms of zzso and zzso altering the zzso and binding properties of the proteins and thus regulating zzso delivery, protein activities and zzso Mass zzso has emerged as an indispensable tool for in-depth characterization of protein zzso zzso proteins in cell zzso are usually enriched by affinity zzso and subsequently analyzed by mass zzso for identification and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso can be determined by unique mass shift caused by the zzso Moreover, the complex structure of zzso chains on zzso can be dissected by bottom-up and zzso mass zzso approaches, revealing potential novel functions of zzso zzso Here I review the advances and zzso of these strategies, emphasizing caution in the validation of zzso proteins and in the interpretation of raw zzso
