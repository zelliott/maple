zzso have recently emerged as key regulators of zzso zzso located on zzso is one of zzso zzso in zzso but the function and molecular mechanisms of zzso in determining the zzso zzso of human zzso are zzso This study therefore was conducted to investigate the role of zzso in biological behaviors of human zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and its molecular zzso 

Nine patients with zzso were analyzed for the expression of zzso by quantitative zzso zzso zzso was established by zzso zzso precursor into zzso and zzso cells, and its effects on cell proliferation were studied using zzso zzso zzso growth ability zzso colony formation zzso zzso labeling and zzso effects of zzso on cell cycle were studied by flow zzso The target of zzso was determined by zzso zzso The regulation of zzso on zzso zzso was determined by western zzso 

The zzso was identified as the target of zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso transition in zzso and zzso cell lines, dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and the ability of colony zzso zzso significantly decreased the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso but the expression of zzso was zzso cell growth was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may inhibit cell proliferation in human zzso cells through regulating zzso suppression of zzso zzso
