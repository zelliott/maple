zzso is a bacterial zzso zzso involved in intimate attachment of zzso and zzso zzso coli to zzso host zzso zzso targets the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is exported by the bacteria and integrated into the host cell plasma zzso In this study we localized the zzso region of zzso to the zzso 190 zzso acids zzso We have also determined the region's high-resolution solution structure, which comprises an zzso domain that is intimately coupled to a novel zzso zzso zzso This fragment, which is necessary and sufficient for zzso interaction, defines a new super domain in zzso that exhibits striking structural similarity to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso portion of zzso comprises an articulated rod of zzso zzso extending from the zzso surface, conveying a highly accessible zzso zzso to the target zzso The interpretation of zzso and zzso data has enabled us to zzso for the first time, the binding site for zzso which is located at the zzso of the zzso zzso
