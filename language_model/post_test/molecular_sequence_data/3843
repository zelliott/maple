zzso zzso and its zzso zzso represent novel therapeutic targets for management of a variety of cardiovascular zzso To test such hypothesis, it will be necessary to develop experimental animal models for the manipulation of zzso zzso zzso The goal of this study was to clone mouse and zzso zzso and zzso for pharmacological zzso Monkey and mouse zzso genes were identified to zzso 123 and 125 zzso zzso Monkey and mouse zzso receptors were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso organization of mouse genes showed that the zzso has four zzso while the zzso zzso has one zzso Although initially viewed by many exclusively as cardiovascular targets, the present study demonstrates expression of mouse and monkey zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue including zzso zzso skeletal muscle, kidney and zzso zzso binding studies showed that zzso zzso bound to a single sites to the cloned receptors in a zzso affinity manner zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for mouse and monkey zzso zzso zzso Competition binding analysis demonstrated zzso high affinity binding of numerous zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to these receptors zzso - 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso cells expressing mouse or monkey zzso zzso confirming cell surface expression of zzso zzso zzso Exposure of these cells to human zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for mouse and monkey zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formation zzso zzso and zzso zzso for mouse and monkey zzso zzso zzso consistent with the primary zzso zzso for zzso zzso involving zzso C zzso
