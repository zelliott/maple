Several components in the machinery zzso the import of zzso zzso precursor proteins have been zzso One of the zzso zzso is an outer membrane protein and is zzso at its mature size in the zzso without a distinguishable zzso zzso To address the question of how components in the transport machinery are imported to zzso themselves, we first identified the zzso outer zzso signal of zzso Using an zzso zzso of the originally isolated pea zzso we show that the outer zzso signal of zzso is located within a zzso acid zzso core of the zzso membrane zzso Interestingly, this signal can target a passenger protein to the zzso outer membrane no matter whether it is placed at the N or C zzso of a passenger zzso Proper zzso of fusion proteins into the outer membrane requires in addition the zzso zzso region following the zzso zzso Furthermore, passenger proteins fused to the C zzso of the zzso signal were most likely imported into the zzso space of the zzso
