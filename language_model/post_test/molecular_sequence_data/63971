When populations or species have recently separated they often share genetic zzso However, it can be difficult to determine whether shared zzso are the result of gene flow, the result of the persistence of variation in both populations since the time of common zzso or both of these zzso We have developed an empirical protocol for using zzso that include unique nuclear DNA sequence zzso together with linked zzso or short tandem repeats zzso These zzso offer the potentially high resolution associated with the high zzso rate of zzso together with the advantages of low zzso of unique sequence zzso We also describe a new procedure for zzso the likelihood of zzso data under an Isolation with zzso zzso An example using zzso zzso from Lake Malawi is zzso The analysis suggests that the species have been exchanging genes since the time they began to zzso
