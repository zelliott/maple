Mice bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso express a disease syndrome characterized by zzso dysfunction, zzso and increased sensitivity to the killing effects of zzso radiation relative to normal zzso zzso and to parental control mice zzso zzso and zzso Many of these zzso evident as early as 21 days of age, have been localized to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two-dimensional gel zzso patterns of proteins from zzso and control mouse zzso revealed that an zzso protein with a molecular mass of approximately 30 zzso was consistently expressed at lower levels in wasted mice than in zzso zzso of this protein revealed a sequence of 19 zzso zzso acids identical to the sequence of zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses of zzso expression in zzso and zzso demonstrated lower zzso of zzso transcripts in wasted mice compared with that in zzso Because zzso expression is associated with cell cycle zzso the percentages of zzso and zzso cells in each stage of the cell cycle were zzso there were no differences in the cell stage distribution of zzso freshly isolated from wasted mice compared with zzso or parental zzso After zzso with zzso A, however, zzso from zzso mice showed a lower percentage of cells in S phase compared with that in zzso Southern blots with zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso from the wasted mice and their normal zzso have the same restriction zzso While differences in zzso chain reaction zzso zzso were zzso these could be attributed to zzso differences in mouse zzso zzso These results suggest the presence of an zzso in the zzso leading to zzso expression in zzso zzso of wasted zzso
