zzso of the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involves the sequential action of two zzso activities: zzso zzso which zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso from zzso and free zzso and zzso zzso which subsequently zzso zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were derived from a human infant zzso sequence tag zzso zzso a portion of zzso zzso Using these zzso reverse zzso chain reaction was performed on zzso from zzso normal mice resulting in amplification of a zzso DNA zzso This zzso was subsequently used to screen a mouse brain zzso zzso zzso library, yielding a zzso zzso zzso were designed from the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso amplification of zzso ends was used to obtain the translation start zzso zzso from the overlapping clones was assembled into a zzso composite zzso which contains a single open reading frame that translates into a zzso zzso acid zzso Northern blots of total zzso from zzso mice yielded a single message species at approximately zzso zzso Southern zzso of zzso DNA zzso with several restriction zzso suggested the gene is present as a single zzso zzso against sequence data bases suggested the composite sequence was a fused zzso product, since the deduced zzso acid sequence showed extensive zzso to known separate sequences of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso from several zzso The first 199 zzso acids corresponded to zzso zzso zzso followed by 37 distinct zzso zzso which did not match any known zzso followed by 388 zzso acids that are highly zzso to known zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells exhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
