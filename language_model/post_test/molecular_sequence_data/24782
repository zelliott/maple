The zzso 12 zzso protein in red zzso zzso II zzso functions to minimize the zzso and calcium requirement of zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to identify functional zzso of the 12 zzso zzso we prepared the 12 zzso protein lacking zzso peptides or zzso peptides or both by limited zzso and directed zzso The resulting 12 zzso protein fragments were examined for their binding and functional properties by zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of the 12 zzso protein was prepared by zzso zzso This zzso rebound to zzso completely, and it zzso oxygen evolution partially in the absence of zzso and zzso zzso but significantly in the presence of zzso zzso zzso A zzso from zzso to zzso was obtained by zzso zzso This zzso rebound to zzso zzso but the zzso did not restore oxygen evolution in both the absence and presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two zzso zzso one lacking five zzso and the other lacking nine zzso of the zzso were able to bind to zzso zzso Recovery of oxygen evolution by their binding was almost the same as that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso proteins lacking ten, seven or three zzso of the zzso effectively rebound to zzso but their binding did not result in recovery of the oxygen zzso In contrast, zzso with a zzso protein lacking one zzso of the zzso showed the same high restoration of oxygen evolution as zzso with the full-length 12 zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that two zzso from zzso of the zzso of the 12 zzso protein constitute an important domain for minimizing the zzso and calcium requirement of oxygen zzso In addition, the zzso of the zzso at least five zzso has a secondary function for the zzso zzso
