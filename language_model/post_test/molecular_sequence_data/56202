The zzso of zzso plants with zzso zzso possess a family of single and zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso that replicate in a zzso manner typical of zzso zzso We have determined the sequence of the smallest and most abundant member of this family, a zzso zzso termed zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of zzso b lacks open reading frames of significant zzso zzso complementary to the determined zzso strand sequence identified two larger zzso species of 2900 and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the smaller of which zzso to a previously identified member of the zzso zzso family designated zzso zzso These zzso also unexpectedly identified a low abundance form of zzso b in zzso zzso zzso zzso strand zzso identified corresponding zzso strand forms in S zzso that likely represent components of replication zzso zzso extension experiments demonstrated that zzso b is an internally deleted form of the larger zzso zzso zzso zzso and that it has a discrete and homogeneous zzso zzso The zzso of zzso b in 2 zzso as well as structural zzso studies indicated that it has a very high degree of secondary zzso Analysis of specific zzso products generated by treatment of zzso zzso duplexes with zzso H indicated that the only identifiable forms of zzso b were linear molecules with relatively homogeneous 3' zzso no circular forms were zzso zzso b was found to share a 13 zzso sequence with the circular zzso zzso 11 of these zzso fall within the central zzso region of zzso zzso In addition, zzso b shares certain structural similarities with zzso Q beta and zzso zzso that serve as in zzso templates for the Q beta zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso b is a zzso member of an zzso family representing a new and apparently distinct class of zzso zzso
