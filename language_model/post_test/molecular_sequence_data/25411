To investigate the intrinsic zzso of DNA at sites where proteins zzso we analyzed zzso gene zzso protein zzso binding sites and various operators from the viewpoint of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso data indicate that zzso of zzso is highly zzso and zzso Certain zzso prefer to bend into the major groove zzso and others prefer to bend into the minor groove zzso zzso From these data we considered zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso and zzso and zzso as zzso zzso Analysis of 31 zzso binding sites has identified strong zzso tendencies zzso base pairs zzso away from the zzso In addition, we found zzso zzso tracts extending 4-5 zzso away from the proposed zzso zzso Finally, to analyze the central regions we followed the lead of zzso and classified the DNA sites by their zzso lengths zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso zzso In this way, we identified two zzso of zzso binding sites: one with 6 zzso between the zzso consensus boxes zzso and one with 8 central zzso zzso We discovered that the zzso at the center of an zzso site was usually zzso whereas at the center of an zzso site more often zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso operators revealed similar zzso In conclusion, our data show that zzso binding sites have zzso and zzso zzso at specific zzso the location of these zzso may facilitate wrapping of DNA around zzso A similar pattern is seen in zzso
