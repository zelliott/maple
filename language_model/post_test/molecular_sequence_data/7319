The zzso response to injury is characterized by a short period of increased proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, followed by an extended period of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso growth zzso zzso has been implicated as a zzso factor in the formation of zzso zzso in this process, which leads to progressive zzso of the zzso known as zzso zzso In zzso analysis of vascular smooth muscle cells harvested from normal rat zzso and from zzso injured 14 days earlier showed that both types of cells attached equally well to culture dishes but that the initial spreading of the cells was increased in cells derived from injured zzso zzso from the injured arteries produced more zzso and zzso into the culture medium than the cells from normal arteries and contained more zzso 1 zzso zzso 1 increased zzso synthesis by normal smooth muscle cells, and the presence of a zzso zzso 1 zzso reduced zzso synthesis by the cells from injured arteries in zzso zzso synthesis was not altered by these zzso These results indicate that the zzso of zzso zzso components in zzso zzso is at least partially caused by zzso zzso activity in vascular smooth muscle zzso
