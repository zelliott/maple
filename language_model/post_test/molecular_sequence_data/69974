The transition from zzso zzso precursor to committed zzso and its differentiation into a mature zzso involve molecular events that enable the cell to activate zzso zzso Among the participants in this process is the zzso zzso factor 2 zzso family of zzso zzso zzso These factors, which share a highly zzso zzso domain including a zzso box, are essential for the expression of multiple muscle genes with zzso target zzso sites in zzso We report here a new human zzso factor, zzso which is unique among the members of this family in that it is present not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso even before the appearance of zzso zzso comprises several alternatively spliced products of a single zzso one of which is the human zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso Like its relatives, cloned zzso is capable of zzso zzso via zzso binding to the zzso site, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, while zzso zzso are zzso the protein is highly restricted to those cell types that contain this activity, implicating zzso mechanisms in the regulation of zzso zzso Alternative zzso may be important in this process: two alternative zzso zzso at least one of which is specifically included during zzso zzso also correlate precisely with zzso zzso zzso These findings provide compelling evidence that zzso is an integral link in the regulatory network for muscle gene zzso Its presence in zzso zzso further suggests that it may be a zzso of commitment in the zzso zzso
