A putative zinc finger in zzso large zzso was zzso We were unable to demonstrate unequivocally a requirement for zinc in specific zzso using the zzso agent 1, zzso An involvement of the putative zinc finger in specific zzso was nevertheless suggested by the properties of a zzso protein with a zzso replacement in the finger zzso Probably as a result of the defective zzso the zzso protein had lost its activity in initiation of viral zzso and in negative regulation of viral early zzso However, the zzso of the viral late promoter was zzso The analysis also revealed a previously zzso activity of large zzso The zzso protein zzso the viral early zzso In the zzso protein this activity is probably concealed by the separate, negative regulatory zzso
