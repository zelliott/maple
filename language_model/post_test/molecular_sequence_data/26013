The most abundant soluble protein of bovine zzso zzso 54 zzso zzso zzso molecular weight 54 zzso was isolated and zzso under both limited and complete zzso conditions with zzso zzso zzso zzso The fragments resulting from limited zzso were separated by one-dimensional sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso transferred to a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso Blue zzso cut out, and submitted to zzso protein sequence zzso Complete zzso fragments were separated on a zzso zzso zzso zzso collected, and concentrated prior to zzso Using this method, we obtained zzso acid sequence data from three internal zzso zzso derived fragments of zzso 54 and a number of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso acid zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso 54 zzso to those sequences contained within release 22 of the National zzso Research Foundation zzso Identification Resource revealed no extended sequence similarity of known proteins to zzso
