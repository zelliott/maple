We previously isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso with two zzso zzso zzso of its zzso is induced by zzso zzso zzso treatment, zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the protein has a role in zzso In that it possesses two zzso zzso zzso resembles the precursor of zzso zzso zzso but unlike that zzso zzso retains its zzso zzso domain after zzso zzso To explore the properties of zzso zzso we have expressed zzso zzso and two zzso which lack one zzso or both zzso zzso zzso as zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed apparent molecular masses on zzso larger than zzso and could be zzso using zzso zzso zzso without the zzso zzso region containing predicted zzso sites, did not appear to be processed by zzso zzso ability to zzso rabbit zzso is unique among known zzso Both zzso zzso are essential for zzso this property is absent in zzso zzso and zzso To identify potential zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the largest effect, exhibiting zzso of zzso specific zzso zzso and zzso resulted in considerable zzso activity loss, zzso these charged zzso are also important in zzso zzso showed zzso retention of activity and substitution zzso zzso The least affected zzso were zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso and zzso are possibly involved in zzso binding rather than zzso
