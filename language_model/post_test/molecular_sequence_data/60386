zzso zzso zzso the zzso that zzso the final step of testosterone zzso in the zzso was cloned from a rat zzso cell complementary DNA library to gain insights into the functional requirements, zzso mechanisms, and molecular zzso The zzso complementary DNA zzso zzso zzso acids zzso mass of zzso zzso and displayed zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence zzso to the human and mouse zzso type III zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed a single zzso zzso zzso zzso species in rat zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso was detected only by zzso zzso The cloned zzso expressed in zzso cell lines specifically zzso the reductive reaction in zzso formation with zzso as the preferred zzso This reaction was significantly reduced in the absence of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in rat zzso cells was inhibited by a single dose of zzso in zzso with maximum reduction of steady state zzso levels at 24 h and recovery at 9 zzso Such zzso zzso of zzso zzso which preceded the marked reduction of zzso zzso resulted from changes at the zzso level and was accompanied by loss of zzso zzso These studies have demonstrated a zzso requirement for optimal activity of the zzso in zzso and for a role of zzso in regulating the expression of zzso gene in zzso Cloning of the zzso type III zzso from rat zzso cells will facilitate further investigation of the molecular regulation of its activity in the zzso
