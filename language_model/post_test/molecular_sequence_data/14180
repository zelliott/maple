In this study, we examine the zzso pattern of colony appearance during zzso experiments, and whether this pattern could inform on zzso the process of microbial zzso In a series of long-term zzso experiments, we observed an expected gradual increase over time of the total number of microbial zzso culminating in a zzso colony count increase at 18 zzso Conventional thought suggests that long-term zzso result in a culture collection enriched with species that are slow growing or rare, may be unavailable from short-term experiments, and likely are zzso However, after we examined the zzso novelty of the zzso as a function of the time of their isolation, we found no correlation between the zzso The probability of discovering either a new or rare species late in the incubation matched that of species isolated zzso These outcomes are especially notable because of their zzso observations were essentially identical for marine and soil bacteria as well as for spore zzso and zzso zzso These findings are consistent with the idea of the zzso awakening of dormant cells, thus lending support to the scout zzso The process of microbial discovery is central to the study of environmental zzso and the human zzso While long-term incubation does not appear to increase the probability of discovering novel species, the technology enabling such zzso zzso zzso zzso may still be the method of zzso While it does not necessarily allow more species to grow from a given zzso it zzso the overall isolation effort and supplies zzso
