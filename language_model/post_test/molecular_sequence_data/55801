zzso factor zzso zzso from zzso zzso binds both the internal control region of the zzso zzso zzso genes and the zzso zzso transcript zzso The zzso acid binding domain of zzso contains nine zzso repeated zinc finger zzso A series of precisely truncated forms of this protein have been constructed and zzso for zzso zzso and DNA zzso Different sets of zinc fingers were found to be responsible for high affinity interactions with zzso and with zzso These results explain how a single protein can exhibit equal affinities for these two very different zzso zzso
