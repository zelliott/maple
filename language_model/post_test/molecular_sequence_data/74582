The zzso transit peptides of zzso zzso proteins are necessary and sufficient for their import into zzso but the information zzso by these transit peptides remains zzso as they have a high sequence diversity and lack consensus sequences or common sequence zzso Here, we investigated the sequence information contained in transit zzso zzso zzso on transit peptides of 208 zzso proteins showed that the transit zzso sequences are grouped to multiple sequence zzso We selected representative proteins from seven of these multiple zzso and confirmed that their transit zzso sequences are highly zzso zzso import experiments revealed that each protein contained transit zzso sequence motifs critical for protein import into zzso zzso analysis identified sequence motifs that were zzso among members of the identified zzso The sequence motifs identified by the two independent approaches were nearly identical or significantly zzso Furthermore, the accuracy of predicting a zzso protein was greatly increased by grouping the transit peptides into multiple sequence zzso Based on these data, we propose that the transit peptides are composed of multiple sequence zzso that contain distinctive sequence motifs for zzso zzso
