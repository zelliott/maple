Although zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso common zzso development of more specific and controlled therapeutic methods should be zzso In this study, we describe a novel approach to zzso therapy that is based on zzso zzso replacement of zzso specific zzso We have developed a specific zzso that can target and replace human zzso zzso zzso which is highly expressed in zzso with new transcript exerting therapeutic activity selectively in zzso liver cancer zzso The zzso replacement was employed via a zzso zzso reaction with the targeted zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso could selectively deliver activity of suicide zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso into the liver cancer cells expressing the zzso zzso and thereby specifically and effectively retarded the survival of these cells with zzso zzso zzso with the specific induction of therapeutic gene activity, the zzso reduced expression level of the targeted zzso zzso in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a useful genetic agent for zzso efficient gene zzso
