Despite the considerable amount of interest in zzso zzso patterns of zzso in zzso and behavioral data have received only limited attention to date, whereas the patterns of zzso in molecular data are relatively well zzso First, because the number of alternative molecular character states is strictly limited zzso for zzso sequence zzso higher rates of substitution generate higher levels of zzso Second, depending on the relative proportions of constrained and zzso sites, each molecular data set has a time frame of zzso outside of which resolution becomes zzso There is good evidence to suggest that numbers of alternative character states for zzso and even behavioral data may be similarly limited and that higher rates of evolution are often linked to higher rates of zzso Like molecular data sets, zzso and behavioral data sets contain rapidly evolving characters as well as more conservative zzso zzso and behaviors related to sexual recognition and reproduction show low levels of zzso variation, but high levels of zzso between species, making them crucial for species identification but often poor as markers of relationship at greater time zzso The organization theory of zzso derived by Carson is a model based on zzso zzso and it predicts exactly this window of zzso for characters related to sexual zzso zzso characters related to environmental adaptation should be zzso at greater zzso zzso A better understanding of patterns of zzso enables a more sophisticated approach to the assessment of the relative zzso of alternative tree zzso
