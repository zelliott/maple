We have determined the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso DNA zzso II from zzso zzso Using zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso acid sequences of other zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso chain reaction zzso zzso This zzso was used as a probe to screen a zzso zzso zzso A partial zzso clone was isolated that was truncated at the 3' zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso was employed to isolate the remaining portion of the zzso The complete sequence of zzso zzso contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso that codes for zzso zzso acid zzso with a theoretical molecular weight of 167 zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence shares similarity with those of other zzso and shows the highest degree of identity with the zzso of zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain very rich in zzso and zzso whose function is zzso zzso both a zzso targeting sequence and a nuclear zzso signal were predicted respectively in the zzso and zzso of the zzso as in the case of human zzso III zzso At the zzso zzso level, the zzso II gene encompasses a region of about 16 zzso suggesting a large proportion of zzso zzso an unusual situation for a gene of a lower zzso often free of zzso Finally, expression of zzso II zzso does not appear significantly dependent on the zzso cycle stage, possibly due to the lack of zzso phase or zzso to a zzso zzso of the zzso
