Our purpose was to investigate the safety of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso The European zzso zzso of Safety zzso evaluation approach was applied to the zzso We determined the zzso zzso resistance, verified it at the genetic level, and determined whether it could be transferred to zzso zzso Of 14 antibiotics tested, 11 showed zzso within the limits of the zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso were two, four, and eight times, respectively, the zzso zzso suggested by the European Scientific Committee on Animal zzso and the zzso of zzso was eight times the zzso zzso suggested by the European Scientific Panel on zzso and Products or Substances Used in Animal zzso Using analysis of zzso zzso we found no known zzso zzso for zzso or zzso resistance, and we found no zzso in the zzso zzso regions of the genes zzso zzso or zzso for zzso resistance associated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso These data were confirmed by using zzso zzso specific for the respective zzso We assessed the zzso of the resistance traits in zzso experiments with zzso and obtained no zzso strongly suggesting that the resistance traits were not zzso This study demonstrated that the zzso resistance observed in zzso zzso zzso was due not to dedicated mechanisms but to intrinsic zzso According to the zzso criteria, these results provide safety assurance for the ongoing use of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso
