zzso joint zzso arthritis is a common cause of zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso effects of zzso receptors zzso and zzso were investigated in zzso arthritis zzso Male zzso rats received an zzso injection of zzso zzso in the zzso and mechanical zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ) were administered before arthritis zzso zzso zzso was promoted by feeding rats a synthetic zzso diet for 9 d before injection of zzso The zzso induced mechanical zzso that lasted for 120 zzso zzso inhibited this zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso and altered the zzso threshold in the absence of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and induced spontaneous zzso zzso zzso arthritis increased the expression of zzso for all zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased expression of both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso behavior and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The present results may lead to a better understanding of central processing in the zzso zzso zzso and the development of new approaches to treat zzso pain with a zzso zzso
