The zzso tuberculosis zzso includes the large family of zzso zzso whose functions are zzso Because of zzso in other pathogens in which gene families showing high sequence variation are involved in zzso variation, a similar role has been proposed for the zzso zzso However, the impact of immune selection on zzso genes has not been zzso Here, we zzso 27 zzso genes in 94 clinical strains from five zzso lineages of the zzso tuberculosis complex zzso We found that zzso genes were overall more diverse than the remainder of the zzso zzso but individual members of the family varied widely in their zzso diversity and zzso zzso zzso some were more, and others were much less, diverse than the zzso zzso Individual zzso genes also differed in the ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso suggesting that different selection pressures act on individual zzso zzso Using zzso methods, we tested whether sequence diversity in zzso genes might be selected by human T cell recognition, the major mechanism of zzso immunity to zzso We found that the large majority of predicted human T cell zzso were confined to the zzso zzso domain and zzso confirmed the zzso of this domain in tuberculosis zzso In contrast, despite being genetically diverse, the zzso zzso zzso few predicted T cell zzso These results indicate that human T cell recognition is not a significant force driving sequence diversity in zzso zzso which is consistent with the previously reported conservation of human T cell zzso in the zzso 

zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso by T zzso is known to be important for immune protection against zzso but it is unclear whether human T cell recognition drives zzso variation in zzso zzso We previously discovered that the known human T cell zzso in the zzso tuberculosis complex are highly zzso but we hypothesized that undiscovered zzso with naturally occurring sequence zzso might zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined the zzso zzso a large family of genes that has been proposed to function in immune evasion by zzso zzso We found that the zzso genes exhibit considerable sequence variation, but the regions containing T cell zzso and the regions of variation are zzso These findings confirm that the majority of human T cell zzso of zzso tuberculosis are highly zzso and indicate that selection forces other than T cell recognition drive sequence variation in the zzso zzso
