zzso is a zzso factor that zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso by zzso the assembly of multiple proteins into a higher order zzso zzso The function of zzso is dependent, in part, on the zzso domain that zzso a sharp bend in the DNA zzso and on an zzso domain that stimulates zzso only in a specific context of other zzso zzso With the aim of gaining insight into the function of zzso zzso zzso we cloned zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso nuclear protein that specifically associates with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is another protein component of the zzso alpha zzso zzso In addition, zzso can increase DNA binding by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso stimulates the activity of the zzso alpha zzso complex zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso by zzso zzso virtually eliminates zzso alpha zzso activity in T zzso Similar to zzso zzso can stimulate zzso in the context of the zzso alpha zzso but apparently not when zzso to DNA through an zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso by zzso the functional collaboration of multiple proteins in the zzso alpha zzso zzso
