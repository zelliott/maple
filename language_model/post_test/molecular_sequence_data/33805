zzso channel, an influenza virus zzso zzso serves as an important target for zzso drug zzso There are still zzso concerning the role of some zzso involved in zzso transfer as well as the mechanism of zzso by commercial zzso The viral zzso proteins show high zzso about 3/4 of the positions are occupied by one zzso in over zzso Nine zzso proteins from the zzso strain and possibly two proteins from zzso strains make a zzso cluster closely related to zzso The zzso range is limited to 4 zzso with one zzso The zzso protein stands out by the presence of 2 zzso at the positions 19 and 50, which are in most other zzso proteins occupied by zzso The study of correlated zzso shows that there are several positions with significant zzso correlation that have not been described so far as functionally zzso That there are 5 more zzso potentially involved in the zzso mechanism of zzso The original software used in this work zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is freely accessible as zzso zzso applications upon request to the zzso The other software used in this work is freely available online for noncommercial purposes at public services on zzso such as zzso or zzso The study on zzso zzso evolutionary relationship, and correlated zzso presented in this paper is a potential way to explain more completely the role of significant factors in zzso channel action and to clarify the zzso mechanism by specific zzso
