zzso zzso recognized by zzso T cells in the context of zzso class I are thought to play a crucial role in protection against zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate the induction of zzso zzso T cell responses against six new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within an zzso and highly zzso zzso of zzso the heat shock protein 65 zzso One of these zzso zzso is identical in a large number of zzso bacteria, and is recognized in a zzso zzso zzso could be presented by either zzso zzso target cells or zzso zzso Interestingly, T cells specific for this zzso did not recognize the corresponding human zzso zzso probably due to structural differences as revealed by modeling zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso zzso analyses show that, whereas the zzso zzso zzso is efficiently generated, the human zzso zzso is not, thus avoiding the induction of zzso zzso these findings describe zzso zzso class zzso zzso that are naturally processed and are recognized efficiently by zzso class zzso zzso T cells, providing a rational basis for the development of zzso vaccine strategies against tuberculosis and other zzso infectious zzso
