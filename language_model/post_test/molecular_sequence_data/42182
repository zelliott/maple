zzso in the rat zzso of immediate early genes belonging to the zzso and zzso families was investigated at various time points following an zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso was rapidly and zzso zzso exhibiting zzso intensity 2 h zzso and was principally located in zzso zzso situated around the periphery of the zzso zzso in regions that subsequently show little, if any, zzso zzso zzso was additionally expressed throughout the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso which remained zzso for 12 h after the zzso reached its zzso intensity 24 h zzso at which time it was most densely distributed in zzso zzso found within the central zzso areas of the zzso In zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso confirmed this spatial and zzso separation between zzso and zzso expression within the zzso and extended it further, showing that, whilst zzso zzso displayed very similar expression characteristics to those of zzso zzso both zzso B zzso and zzso D zzso exhibited induction patterns closely resembling those of zzso zzso These results clearly suggest that two distinct zzso of immediate early gene expression can be induced in zzso The rapid (2 zzso and transient induction of zzso B may well be a response to zzso zzso zzso whereas the molecular signal for the late (24 zzso and sustained induction of zzso zzso D is currently a focus for our zzso
