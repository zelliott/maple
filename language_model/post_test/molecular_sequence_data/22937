Two mechanisms are thought to be involved in the natural drug resistance of zzso the zzso cell wall zzso barrier and active zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso drug zzso zzso have been isolated from several zzso zzso These proteins transport zzso zzso zzso and other zzso Recent reports have suggested that zzso pumps may also be involved in transporting zzso one of the main drugs used to treat zzso This review highlights recent advances in our understanding of zzso drug resistance in zzso including the distribution of zzso systems in these organisms, their zzso profiles and their contribution to drug zzso The balance between the drug transport into the cell and drug zzso is not yet clearly zzso and further studies are required in zzso
