zzso freshwater stingrays zzso zzso host a diverse zzso fauna, including zzso Both zzso and their stingray hosts are zzso but the zzso of this zzso system is poorly zzso 

zzso and molecular zzso zzso I) data were used to investigate diversity in freshwater lineages of the zzso zzso zzso Linton, zzso zzso were based on a zzso hypothesis for 74 zzso sequences and zzso analysis of over 400 zzso zzso studied were obtained from zzso individual zzso representing 14 recognized and 18 potentially zzso species from most river systems of South zzso 

zzso species boundaries were based mainly on zzso characters observed with scanning electron zzso and were supported by zzso zzso Four species were zzso including two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two newly described zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso 2009 is considered a junior synonym of zzso zzso because the zzso features of the two species overlap zzso The diagnosis of zzso Linton, 1890 is zzso to accommodate the presence of marginal zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of host specificity and distribution ranged from use of few host species in few river zzso to use of as many as eight host species in multiple river zzso 

The level of zzso zzso variation observed in features such as total length and number of zzso is unparalleled among other zzso zzso This is attributed to the large representation of host and zzso zzso It is unclear whether the zzso zzso variation observed is unique to this freshwater zzso Nonetheless, caution is urged when using zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso species because the amount of variation encountered is highly dependent on sample size and/or zzso zzso
