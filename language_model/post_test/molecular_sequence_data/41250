The zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso patients, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have not been zzso The aim of this study was to investigate these genes and the association of those and the clinical outcomes in zzso zzso 

Eighty zzso zzso cases were obtained from zzso patients, representing both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The diversity of zzso genes was examined by zzso chain reaction and DNA zzso zzso analysis of zzso was determined using the maximum zzso zzso 

The zzso + zzso zzso and zzso genes were the most zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes were found significantly more frequently in patients with zzso than those with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso positive samples were the zzso zzso and showed that almost all of the detected sequences in Thai zzso and Thai gastric cancer patients were classified in the same cluster but separated from the cluster of Japan and other zzso 

The zzso and zzso genes may be associated in the zzso of zzso diseases, especially of zzso Besides the bacterial variation, other host factors may be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso
