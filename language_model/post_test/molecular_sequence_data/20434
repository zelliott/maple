Major zzso complex class II zzso molecules accumulate in zzso zzso called zzso which are zzso by zzso presenting zzso These zzso are released following the fusion of zzso bodies zzso with the plasma zzso The molecular mechanisms regulating cargo selection remain to be fully zzso As zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tail has recently been demonstrated in various cell types, we sought to determine if this zzso modification is required for the incorporation of zzso molecules into zzso First, we zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso tail is replaced by zzso Western zzso analysis did not indicate preferential shedding of these zzso molecules into zzso Next, we forced the zzso of zzso in class II zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the almost complete zzso of zzso from the plasma zzso these molecules were not enriched in zzso Finally, zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso on zzso did not prevent inclusion into these zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso of zzso is not a prerequisite for incorporation into zzso
