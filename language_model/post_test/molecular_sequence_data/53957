zzso production of zzso zzso zzso family 11 1, zzso was achieved in zzso zzso The zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso was placed under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso yields up to 60 zzso were obtained in synthetic zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to zzso using a zzso zzso protocol and found to be identical to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso with respect to size, zzso and zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso protein indicated that the zzso zzso signal zzso was correctly processed in zzso zzso The zzso protein has a molecular weight of zzso zzso in excellent agreement with the calculated mass, and appears as one single band on zzso focusing with zzso value around zzso zzso zzso mass zzso confirmed the presence of one major zzso produced by zzso zzso and the absence of zzso The zzso zzso was further characterized in terms of specific activity, pH profile, kinetic zzso and zzso toward zzso zzso as zzso and compared with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso Both zzso exhibit a pH optimum at zzso and zzso activity at 50 degrees zzso The zzso activity follows normal zzso zzso with zzso and zzso values similar for both zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso in high yields that can be obtained readily as a single zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first microbial zzso efficiently zzso and correctly processed by zzso zzso
