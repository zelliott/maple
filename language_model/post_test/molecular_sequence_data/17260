Finding zzso for a given protein plays a major role in predicting the zzso structure and zzso However, it is still difficult to find remote zzso with low sequence zzso even with advanced sequence search zzso We propose a simple filtering method that uses predicted structural information, pertaining to secondary structures and zzso zzso It filters the more promising zzso from the many candidate proteins obtained by zzso with a less stringent threshold zzso The final decision is made by a simple linear discrimination method, considering the zzso of zzso and the statistical significance scores of structural zzso An in-house neural network program is used for the prediction of secondary structures and zzso zzso for both the query and library zzso The performance of our filtering method was evaluated by the zzso method, using the zzso zzso relationship as the correct zzso zzso plots show that our filtering method clearly improves the performance of zzso The secondary structure improves zzso better than the zzso zzso but the combination of these two features with zzso leads to the best zzso The advantage of our method is its easy zzso with fewer parameters to be tuned and faster zzso We also discuss its performance with predicted and observed secondary zzso
