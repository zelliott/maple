zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso requires a signal zzso in its zzso tail zzso zzso of zzso results in rapid transit of zzso to the zzso Isolation of zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso previously identified three zzso zzso zzso cloned by zzso of a zzso zzso encodes a novel, zzso zzso protein with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso existed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso impaired zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a fusion protein containing the zzso of zzso and also caused zzso of zzso Y and accelerated zzso degradation of the zzso sorting zzso zzso of zzso improved retention of zzso zzso in the zzso processing compartment but, unlike the original zzso zzso did not increase the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso functions at two steps in the cycling of zzso and other proteins between the zzso and zzso compartment zzso This hypothesis was confirmed in several zzso zzso was shown to be required for optimal function of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso was shown to be caused by zzso of a second signal zzso in the zzso zzso zzso delayed exit of zzso from the zzso whereas zzso did not affect this zzso We propose that zzso promotes cycling of zzso membrane proteins between the zzso and zzso by zzso a zzso retention signal zzso and zzso the function of a retrieval signal zzso that acts at the zzso
