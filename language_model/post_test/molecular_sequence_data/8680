Currently available zzso tests for zzso zzso zzso zzso in domestic zzso are hampered by their low zzso because of zzso with zzso zzso The use of zzso major zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso for zzso was zzso Overlapping fragments of the zzso protein were expressed in zzso coli and were reacted with zzso from sheep infected with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Two zzso regions on the zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso reacted only with zzso zzso zzso An indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso was further developed and validated with zzso from animals zzso infected with zzso zzso or several zzso zzso zzso raised in zzso zzso and zzso against nine zzso of zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso with zzso was limited to zzso zzso and zzso zzso two zzso which do not zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso which do zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not react with zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso from zzso infected zzso zzso and sheep were zzso for 50 to 200 days zzso Further validation of the zzso zzso zzso was done with zzso obtained from sheep raised in zzso areas in Zimbabwe and from several Caribbean zzso A total of 159 of 169 samples which were considered to be false positive by zzso or indirect zzso did not react with zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso may be a suitable zzso for a sensitive zzso test for zzso with dramatically improved zzso
