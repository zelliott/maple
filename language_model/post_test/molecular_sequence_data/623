zzso zzso protein zzso is a basic zzso zzso zzso factor family member, and can be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequential zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso on zzso by zzso and these zzso are required for the acquisition of DNA binding activity of zzso Here we show that zzso is modified by zzso a dynamic single sugar modification found on zzso zzso The zzso sites are zzso and zzso which are in the regulation domain and are very close to the zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso required for the gain of DNA binding zzso Both in zzso and ex zzso experiments demonstrate that zzso on zzso and zzso prevents zzso on zzso zzso and zzso as indicated by the decreased relative zzso and DNA binding activity of zzso delayed the zzso differentiation zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso to Ala significantly increase the zzso activity of zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates both the zzso and DNA binding activity of zzso
