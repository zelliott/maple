Using in zzso approaches and zzso we cloned a full length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long and the deduced zzso consists of 140 zzso acids of which 73 are zzso The zzso sequence spans approximately 79 zzso on mouse zzso 7 and the gene is composed of four zzso Standard and real-time zzso analyses of several mouse zzso showed that the gene is exclusively expressed in the brain and is not detected in embryonic zzso Within the brain, it is expressed throughout the zzso region with zzso expression in the zzso and zzso bulb and very low levels in the zzso and zzso
