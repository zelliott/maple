zzso zzso zzso zzso contain alpha and/or beta zzso Their activities have been found in the mouse and rat zzso The cloned zzso for the mouse alpha zzso of zzso A zzso cloned zzso for the mouse alpha zzso of zzso A zzso zzso was used here to survey zzso expression in kidney of different mouse strains and in various zzso of mice and zzso A single message of zzso zzso was found in kidney of random bred zzso and zzso mice zzso zzso that contain high zzso A activity and in zzso rat zzso The alpha zzso message was zzso in the kidney of zzso and zzso mice, zzso strains that do not express zzso A zzso zzso zzso A activity in the kidney of mouse strains zzso with the amount of alpha zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso message was also detected in the small zzso of the rat but not in zzso No message was detected in brain, heart, skeletal muscle, liver, zzso or zzso of mice or zzso zzso chain reaction amplification or Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA revealed that the gene for the alpha zzso is present in all mouse strains as well as in human, zzso zzso zzso dog, zzso zzso and chicken, but it was not detected in zzso There is one gene copy present in the mouse zzso The gene was localized to mouse zzso 17 zzso to the major zzso complex zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso to zzso the gene previously found to regulate the expression of zzso A activity in mice, supports the proposal that zzso is the structural gene for the alpha zzso
