zzso hormones and zzso zzso are generated from zzso precursors by specific zzso reactions which take place principally at sites formed by single or paired basic zzso Not all the possible zzso sites are zzso however, and the degree of processing of many zzso has been found to vary according to the tissue of zzso The restricted nature of processing reactions could point to the existence of a series of zzso with stringent zzso zzso regions of structure in addition to the single or paired basic zzso zzso the action of processing zzso may be directed by zzso of the zzso which could focus the action of a zzso onto or away from a particular zzso In addition certain zzso modifications such as zzso or zzso may influence the accessibility of a site to the approach of a processing zzso In this review we describe recent advances that have been made in the zzso of zzso processing zzso we examine the relevance of the various factors that could account for restricted processing and discuss new approaches that may lead to better understanding of the mechanisms zzso
