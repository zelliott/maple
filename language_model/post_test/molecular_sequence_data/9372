Human zzso zzso zzso viral zzso factor zzso is essential for viral replication because of its ability to eliminate the zzso zzso response to zzso that is zzso by the zzso family of cellular zzso zzso zzso targets these zzso including zzso for zzso and subsequent zzso degradation via the formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso how the cellular components of this zzso zzso complex interact with zzso is critical to the intelligent design of new zzso zzso However, structural studies of zzso both alone and in complex with cellular partners, have been hampered by an inability to express soluble full-length zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that a newly identified host regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso including various zzso and a truncated form of this zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso lacking the zzso and zzso box motifs were sufficient for zzso zzso Furthermore, association of zzso with zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso greatly increased the zzso of full-length zzso Finally, a stable complex containing zzso was zzso in large quantity and shown to bind zzso zzso zzso This efficient strategy for zzso zzso complexes will facilitate future structural and zzso studies of zzso function and may provide the basis for useful screening approaches for identifying novel zzso drug zzso
