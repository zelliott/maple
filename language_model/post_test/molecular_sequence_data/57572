From zzso zzso of potato zzso zzso zzso zzso it had been concluded earlier that the formation of a zzso zzso structure containing hairpin II zzso zzso is critical for zzso In order to differentiate between structural and sequence effects, in the present work base pairs in zzso II were exchanged by zzso double zzso without significant zzso in the native zzso structure of zzso The zzso were viable and genetically stable in the first generation, but one of the two zzso reverted to the zzso zzso in the second zzso zzso zzso in the stem of zzso II, which had been described as zzso to the zzso sequence earlier, were zzso with respect to the time course of zzso and the sequence variation during zzso All replicating sequence zzso were separated by gel zzso techniques and the sequences and their relative zzso were zzso From both types of studies it can be concluded zzso that zzso II is a functional element in the zzso replication zzso generated due to sequential folding during zzso and that it is essential for template activity of zzso zzso zzso that zzso pairs are tolerated zzso in zzso zzso zzso the lower stability of such a zzso II is compensated by additional zzso outside zzso II which suppress the competition of a zzso zzso and zzso that the zzso are generated spontaneously during zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso structure of zzso II is the essential element for short term replication of zzso but the exact sequence of the zzso proves to be superior with regard to fitness and zzso of zzso
