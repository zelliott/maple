The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces two classes of zzso zzso toxins commonly referred to as the zzso and zzso Members of the zzso class are zzso zzso that act by promoting passive zzso zzso zzso In this study, we test the hypothesis that zzso forms zzso and zzso likewise function as zzso zzso and are similar in activity to zzso in artificial and plant zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso in a manner indicative of zzso channel zzso In tobacco zzso zzso zzso forms zzso and zzso were equivalent in activity causing zzso of zzso and measurable zzso influx at a threshold concentration of 50 zzso A mixture of three forms of zzso did not show zzso activity appreciably different from that of zzso or zzso in tobacco zzso zzso Both forms of zzso also displayed potent zzso properties demonstrated by lowering of the zzso tension of zzso liquid zzso water to 36 and zzso zzso zzso the critical zzso concentration was zzso zzso for both forms of zzso These results demonstrate that both classes of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso to plant cells at zzso zzso and cause necrosis by forming zzso channels that are freely permeable to zzso zzso
