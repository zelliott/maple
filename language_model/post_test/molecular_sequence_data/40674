The zzso has recently developed a protocol for systematic comparisons of high-quality crystal and zzso structures of zzso In this paper, the extent to which this approach can provide zzso information on the two functionally zzso proteins zzso a zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso is zzso The zzso structures of the two proteins have been determined in solution at 313 and zzso respectively, using the current zzso protocol based on the software package zzso for extensive zzso The corresponding crystal structures were solved by the zzso at zzso and zzso resolution and at zzso and zzso resolution, zzso The zzso and crystal structures of the two proteins share the same overall molecular zzso However, the precision of the structure determination along the zzso sequence varies over a significantly wider range in the zzso structures than in the crystal zzso zzso in each of the two zzso structures about zzso of the zzso have zzso below the average and in both proteins the less well ordered zzso include large parts of the active sites, in addition to some highly zzso surface zzso Whereas the latter show increased disorder in the crystal and in solution, the zzso regions display increased zzso only in the zzso structures, where they undergo local zzso exchange on the zzso time scale that appears to be frozen in the zzso These observations suggest that a search for molecular regions showing increased structural disorder and slow dynamic processes in solution while being well ordered in the corresponding crystal structure might be a valid initial step in the challenge of identifying putative active sites in functionally zzso proteins with known three-dimensional zzso
