zzso zzso has traditionally been assumed to play an essential role in energy generation during growth on zzso zzso However, this assumption has not yet been zzso tested in zzso zzso In this study, a zzso analysis approach was used to identify three different zzso zzso systems in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose expression is affected by either zzso or zzso A complete set of single, zzso and triple zzso was generated, and their zzso were zzso The growth zzso of the zzso suggest that any one of the three zzso zzso is sufficient to sustain growth of zzso zzso zzso on zzso while surprisingly, none is required for growth on methanol or zzso Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the fate of zzso revealed that while cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as cells of all the single and the double zzso continuously produced zzso and zzso cells of the triple zzso accumulated zzso zzso Further studies of the triple zzso showed that zzso was not produced zzso and was consumed later in zzso These results demonstrated that all three zzso zzso systems must be zzso in order to disrupt the zzso capacity of the zzso but that an alternative zzso capacity exists in the triple zzso
