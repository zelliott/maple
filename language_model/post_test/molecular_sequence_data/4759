zzso an zzso zzso antibiotic, binds to a single site on the small zzso zzso of bacteria, but this site has not yet been defined zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso coli 16 S zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and protects a set of bases in the decoding region against zzso zzso zzso The binding studies were performed in a high zzso strength buffer containing 20 zzso zzso The pattern of protection in the decoding region was similar to that observed when zzso binds to the 30 S zzso However, zzso also protects the zzso region of 16 S zzso within the 30 S zzso whereas it did not protect the zzso region of the naked 16 S zzso The interaction of zzso with 16 S zzso was further defined by using two fragments that zzso to the 3' minor domain of 16 S zzso and to the decoding zzso a portion of this domain encompassing the decoding zzso In the presence of zzso the pattern of protection against zzso zzso attack for the two fragments was similar to that seen with the full-length 16 S zzso This indicates that the 3' minor domain as well as the decoding analog contain the recognition signals for the binding of zzso However, zzso could not bind to the decoding analog in the absence of zzso This contrasts with zzso another zzso zzso antibiotic, that binds to the decoding analog in the absence of zzso but not at 20 zzso zzso Our results suggest that both zzso and zzso interact with the decoding center, but recognize alternative zzso of this zzso
