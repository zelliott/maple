zzso zzso zzso is a frequent complication of zzso zzso disease zzso that has been associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in the loss of important proteins due to the zzso nature of current zzso Although whole zzso can potentially be used to zzso specificity to zzso removal from blood, zzso variable region zzso zzso fragments could potentially offer several advantages as zzso zzso due to their size, genetic definition, ability to be expressed by zzso and zzso for in zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso was constructed from the zzso zzso and expressed by a zzso display zzso The binding affinity of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and immobilized onto zzso zzso The binding capacity of the zzso was measured by zzso samples with zzso quantities of fluorescent zzso in zzso 

The displayed zzso possessed a zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso exhibited an zzso site density of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso settled zzso Under zzso conditions, the mass ratio of zzso zzso to immobilized zzso is zzso greater than any previous literature report for whole zzso zzso specificity experiments suggest that the zzso zzso is specific toward human zzso 

zzso DNA technology was successfully used to engineer an zzso zzso Use of immobilized zzso during zzso may minimize loss of valuable proteins and facilitate the removal of zzso that are significantly larger than the molecular weight zzso of the zzso
