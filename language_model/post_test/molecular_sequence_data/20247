The fish pathogen zzso zzso is the zzso agent of a fatal zzso zzso in zzso zzso Many zzso zzso strains harbors a 65 zzso zzso zzso zzso an iron zzso system essential for zzso The genes involved in the zzso of the indigenous zzso zzso are zzso by both the zzso zzso and the zzso while those involved in the transport of the zzso complex, including the outer membrane zzso are zzso This work describes the role of specific zzso acid zzso of the outer membrane zzso zzso in the mechanism of transport of zzso zzso modeling indicated that this protein has a 22 stranded zzso blocked by the plug domain, the latter being formed by zzso zzso zzso of the plug domain resulted in a zzso unable to act as an open channel for the transport of the zzso zzso zzso
