We have cloned zzso of the major zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso The entire zzso sequences of this zzso were determined and compared with zzso zzso 16 zzso DNA zzso The zzso of the zzso was flanked by approximately 300 zzso of cellular zzso and the zzso of the zzso sequences contained zzso A zzso following at zzso zzso zzso 16 sequences began at zzso zzso downstream of a major viral zzso promoter, within the E6 open reading frame zzso The first zzso donor site was at zzso 226 and the zzso zzso site was at zzso zzso suggesting that the E6 gene is zzso Second zzso donor and zzso sites were located at zzso 880 and at zzso zzso zzso This zzso was thus shown to consist of three zzso resulting in zzso zzso containing three potentially functional virus early zzso zzso and zzso transcribed in the zzso
