The purpose of this study was the characterization of eight new dominant cataract zzso 

zzso of zzso mice were described zzso and zzso Each zzso was mapped by linkage zzso The candidate genes (the zzso gene cluster and the closely linked zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso analysis confirmed all zzso in zzso zzso Five zzso lead to zzso acid exchanges, two are due to premature stop zzso and one is a zzso deletion in the zzso zzso zzso zzso carriers expressed zzso zzso ranging from diffuse zzso zzso zzso and zzso to dense nuclear and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to dense nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso analyses correlate well with the severity of lens zzso ranging from zzso in the process of secondary fiber nucleus degradation to lens zzso fiber zzso and disruption of the lens zzso 

In total, 20 zzso have been described that affect the zzso gene zzso Nine zzso affect the zzso zzso but only one affects the zzso or zzso zzso No zzso was observed in the closely linked zzso Two zzso occur at the same site in the zzso and zzso genes zzso The unequal distribution of zzso suggests hot spots in the zzso zzso The overall high number of zzso in these genes demonstrates their central role in the maintenance of lens zzso
