A zzso microbial consortium was enriched in an zzso zzso zzso sequencing batch reactor zzso fed with a mineral zzso medium containing methanol as the sole carbon source and nitrate as the electron zzso The zzso was zzso with sludge from a biological zzso removal activated sludge plant exhibiting good zzso The zzso zzso rate improved from less than zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso volatile suspended zzso zzso zzso to a zzso value of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso over a zzso operational zzso At this time, the enriched microbial community was subjected to zzso probing zzso with zzso to zzso the DNA of the zzso The extracted zzso and zzso from the zzso experiment were separately subjected to zzso zzso zzso The dominant zzso zzso gene zzso zzso A zzso in the zzso clone library was closely related to those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the order zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso sequence zzso while the most abundant clone groups in the zzso clone library mostly belonged to the family zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso for use in zzso in zzso zzso zzso were designed to specifically target the group A clones and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso clones zzso zzso Application of these zzso to the zzso biomass over the enrichment period demonstrated a strong correlation between the level of zzso zzso and relative abundance of zzso bacteria in the zzso zzso By contrast, there was no correlation between the zzso rate and the relative zzso of the well-known zzso zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso clones zzso by FISH in the zzso zzso FISH combined with zzso independently confirmed that the zzso cells were the dominant bacterial group capable of zzso zzso zzso in the enriched zzso The well-known zzso lag period in the zzso zzso was shown to coincide with a lag phase in growth of the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso bacteria are the dominant zzso in our zzso system and likely are important zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
