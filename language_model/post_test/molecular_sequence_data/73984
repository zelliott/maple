zzso zzso DNA zzso sequences were determined for the five species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the single species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso With the exception of zzso zzso the zzso form a coherent zzso cluster which is related to the zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso revealed that this zzso is an zzso and a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso falls within the radiation of the zzso zzso and zzso can be considered a member of this zzso The results of the zzso analyses are consistent with zzso zzso On the basis of our data, zzso zzso is transferred to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso the description of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso zzso is transferred to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso The description of the family zzso is zzso to include organisms with zzso cells, and a set of zzso zzso signature zzso is designated for this zzso On the basis of the distinct zzso position of the zzso lineage and a set of zzso zzso signature zzso the order zzso zzso zzso is zzso
