zzso zzso is the principal protein component of zzso with very low, zzso and low zzso The interaction of zzso with low density zzso zzso receptors is responsible for the zzso of LDL into zzso An zzso zzso region is located adjacent to the 3' end of the zzso zzso It consists of a variable number of zzso repeated sequences zzso Two approaches were used to analyze this zzso In both, the region harboring the zzso was amplified with the zzso chain reaction zzso In the first method, zzso labeled zzso were used in the zzso reactions and products were separated in zzso gels by means of an automated fluorescent zzso zzso In the second method, zzso products were analyzed in zzso zzso gels and detected with silver zzso Even in the highly sophisticated automated system, zzso gel zzso did not always enable unequivocal assignment of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso gel zzso made it possible to distinguish the 15 zzso differences between the zzso zzso in a precise and simple zzso The zzso zzso was typed in 234 zzso Among these were 136 patients with coronary artery disease and 74 healthy zzso Thirteen zzso could be zzso The zzso containing 49 repeats zzso was found in zzso of the coronary artery disease patients and in zzso of the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso increases relative coronary risk by about zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso zzso is a potentially useful genetic zzso Since zzso gel zzso may lead to ambiguous results, we prefer typing by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
