Although both zzso and zzso are required for all steps of zzso zzso little is known about the specific contribution of either protein to these zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso zzso acids that are thought to coordinate zzso metal zzso To search for additional zzso zzso acids and to better define the functional anatomy of zzso we zzso all 86 zzso basic zzso acids to zzso and evaluated the zzso proteins for DNA zzso zzso hairpin formation, and zzso We found several zzso acids outside of the zzso zzso domain that are critical for DNA zzso several step arrest zzso with defects in zzso or hairpin formation, and four zzso zzso defective specifically for zzso Analysis of coding zzso formed by some of these zzso revealed excessive zzso frequent use of short sequence zzso and unusually long zzso zzso zzso known as P zzso that result from zzso hairpin zzso These features characterize junctions found in zzso mice, which are deficient for the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso proteins and zzso perform overlapping functions in coding joint zzso Interestingly, the zzso acids that are altered in 12 of our zzso are also zzso in human inherited zzso zzso Our analysis of these zzso provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying these zzso
