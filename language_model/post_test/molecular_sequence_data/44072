The zzso group B zzso zzso zzso mimics a unique protective zzso on the surface of group B zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso Using a series of zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine it was demonstrated that zzso having zzso for both extended and conventional short segments of the zzso were formed, but only the former were zzso and/or gave passive protection against live challenge by zzso The failure of zzso specific for short zzso to protect was further established when zzso was used as the zzso Of all the zzso produced that were specific for short internal segments of the zzso none were zzso despite the fact that most of them zzso with the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, most of the protective zzso produced by zzso zzso did not recognize the group B zzso zzso zzso unless it was present in its zzso high molecular weight zzso The zzso zzso zzso by the zzso was shown to be ubiquitous in the capsule of both zzso and zzso coli zzso using zzso labeling techniques and, because of its unique properties, its identification could be significant in the development of a comprehensive zzso vaccine against group B zzso zzso This is because most known human zzso acid zzso can be zzso in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso which is roughly equivalent to an zzso length of the zzso It has been hypothesized that the formation of the protective zzso on the surface of zzso is due to the interaction of zzso segments of the zzso with another zzso and that the protective zzso is zzso by the zzso Support for the above hypothesis is provided by the fact that the protective zzso zzso has a similar unusual length dependency to that of the zzso zzso
