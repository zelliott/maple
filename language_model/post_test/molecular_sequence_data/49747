zzso zzso ranks among the most common zzso in Southeast Asia and South zzso Although there are many zzso of treatment, the recurrence and zzso rates are high, and the prognosis is zzso zzso a recently found zzso is a promising target for drug therapy because it is zzso in all studied zzso zzso zzso contains six zzso repeats and interacts with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the 26 S zzso In this study, a zzso zzso screen with zzso has identified zzso as another interacting zzso The interaction, zzso by the zzso half of zzso was reproduced in zzso zzso The interaction was specific to zzso because other zzso family proteins structurally similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not bind to zzso zzso partially suppressed both zzso growth in zzso and tumor formation in zzso mice of zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to interact with zzso correlated with the ability to suppress the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso binds to zzso and suppresses its zzso zzso So far, the major focus of studies on the zzso proteins has been on their potential for cancer zzso Our results may also shed light on novel functions for zzso zzso
