The cell wall zzso of zzso species is a complex zzso zzso with a zzso chain containing predominantly an zzso zzso backbone with zzso zzso A minor zzso component is attached to the branches either via a zzso bond zzso stable zzso or a zzso bond zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the cell wall zzso do not afford protective zzso while the zzso portion is a protective zzso and has become an attractive target as the key zzso of a zzso zzso We report the first synthesis of a zzso 1 consisting of a zzso zzso linked via a zzso to zzso zzso This encompasses the attachment site of the acid zzso zzso to the zzso component of the cell wall zzso The zzso was formed by an zzso process to first create a zzso linkage and then zzso the zzso center via an zzso zzso The zzso zzso linkage was zzso via an zzso zzso The binding of zzso zzso 1 with the protective zzso zzso has been evaluated and compared with a zzso in zzso zzso zzso The observed activities are rationalized with a model for zzso in the binding site of zzso
