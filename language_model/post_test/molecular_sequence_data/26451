A novel approach to study the zzso of consensus sites of regulatory regions of DNA is zzso The overall strategy includes chemical synthesis of representative series of all possible DNA structures under investigation, cloning and screening according to their zzso The zzso synthesis of a complete library of zzso DNA duplexes, corresponding to the model zzso promoter and differing in zzso segments at zzso region, is zzso
