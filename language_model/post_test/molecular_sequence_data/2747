zzso VIII of zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso exists in at least two zzso because different but related zzso have been identified in zzso isolated from liver and heart of both beef and zzso We have isolated a full length zzso specifying zzso VIII of human zzso from a human liver zzso zzso zzso zzso to this zzso are present at only one site, the zzso zzso on human zzso zzso The deduced human zzso is zzso identical with zzso VIII isolated from beef liver, but only 38% identical with zzso VIII isolated from beef zzso zzso analysis shows that an zzso identical with the isolated zzso is present in abundant amounts not only in human and monkey liver zzso but in heart and skeletal muscle as well, zzso not known previously to contain this zzso Since the only zzso VIII zzso found in human heart agrees zzso with the zzso deduced from this zzso zzso it may well be that, in distinction to other zzso only one form of zzso VIII exists in zzso
