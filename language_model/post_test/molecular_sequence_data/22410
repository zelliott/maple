To investigate the possibility of structural assignment based on zzso tandem zzso zzso mass spectral matching, four zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso or zzso zzso acid on zzso or zzso zzso were analyzed using zzso liquid zzso zzso trap zzso mass zzso zzso The negative zzso zzso is observed predominantly in the zzso zzso without the loss of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso derived from it are sufficiently zzso that zzso spectral matching based on correlation zzso can be applied to the assignment of these zzso The zzso containing a zzso acid on zzso or zzso antennae can be distinguished by zzso spectral matching, but the zzso and zzso linkage types of zzso acid cannot be distinguished by their zzso zzso However, zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso containing a zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso clearly differentiate the zzso and zzso linkage types of zzso acid in their zzso spectral zzso This difference might be rationalized in terms of a zzso transfer from the zzso zzso to the zzso charged zzso zzso These two zzso are very close in the structural zzso of the precursor zzso zzso zzso of zzso linkage type, as predicted by molecular mechanics zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 3) spectral matching was demonstrated to be useful for the structural assignment of these four zzso PA zzso zzso
