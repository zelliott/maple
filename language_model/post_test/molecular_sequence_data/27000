A zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso stream in zzso zzso The strain was zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed a zzso growth cycle, exhibited white opaque colonies on complex media and showed zzso markers that were consistent with its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis, based on zzso zzso gene sequencing, also showed that strain zzso belonged to the zzso zzso sharing the highest levels of sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and forming a separate lineage within this zzso Combined zzso and zzso data supported the conclusion that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
