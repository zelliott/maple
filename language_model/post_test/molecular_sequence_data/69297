The regulation of the zzso fatty acid zzso pathways located in the zzso and the zzso zzso is not fully zzso Although both zzso zzso fatty zzso which are poorly zzso in zzso and zzso fatty acid zzso induce zzso zzso and liver fatty zzso protein zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty zzso which are rapidly zzso and zzso do zzso To establish whether impaired zzso and, zzso sustained zzso levels of zzso zzso fatty acids increase their efficacy as zzso the effect of zzso acid on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso of zzso zzso was zzso In primary zzso cultures, zzso acid had no inducing effect, but in the presence of zzso acid zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso I, it induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso was also noted in the presence of zzso another inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso to zzso for 1 h led to an expected decrease in incorporation of zzso from zzso into CO2 and zzso zzso In contrast, long-term exposure to zzso increased incorporation of zzso into zzso products, most likely due to an zzso induction of zzso zzso Both acute and long-term exposure of zzso to zzso decreased incorporation of zzso acid into zzso an effect that may have contributed to the zzso zzso of fatty zzso These results provide support for a mechanism by which zzso fatty acids or specific zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso act as signals in the induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso under conditions in which zzso fatty acids accumulate due to impaired entry into the zzso zzso zzso
