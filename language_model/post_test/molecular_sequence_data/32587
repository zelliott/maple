zzso that cause tuberculosis in animals and humans belong to the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso for conventional diagnosis are time-consuming and do not differentiate between different strains belonging to the zzso tuberculosis zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate a multiplex zzso zzso zzso to zzso in culture with the capacity to differentiate different strains belonging to the zzso tuberculosis complex in a reference zzso zzso based on zzso regions of difference zzso consisting in DNA segments that are present in zzso zzso but zzso deleted in several members of zzso tuberculosis complex were used in a zzso zzso The test was applied to 86 clinical zzso of zzso The pattern of amplification allowed zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso This zzso multiplex zzso may be used in a zzso Laboratory of zzso Diagnosis as a complementary test to differentiate zzso strains belonging to the zzso tuberculosis zzso This test significantly reduces the time period between culture and strain zzso and thus for could favor the adoption of better strain specific zzso regimens as well as identification of zzso transmission of zzso zzso to zzso
