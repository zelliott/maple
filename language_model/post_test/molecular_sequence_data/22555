zzso zzso are zzso produced zzso agents that zzso zzso trafficking and stimulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby promoting the resolution of zzso Previous data suggest a role for altered protein zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso but the exact mechanisms remain zzso In this study we examine the effects of zzso on the protein zzso pattern of zzso cells differentiated into a zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso (1 zzso exhibit zzso of a zzso zzso Using mass zzso this protein was identified as zzso a zzso zzso H chain II zzso A, which is involved in zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso adopt a polarized zzso with activated zzso localized toward the leading edge and zzso localized at the cell zzso zzso distribution of zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso a recently described zzso for the zzso zzso also stimulates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that zzso stimulates the zzso of key polarity organization zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso activity with specific zzso prevented zzso zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso highlighting a potential use for zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulted in an increase in zzso similar to that of zzso These data highlight an integrated mechanism zzso zzso regulates zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso
