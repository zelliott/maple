Without habitual exercise, bone is lost from the zzso zzso between the effects of loading of bone and other zzso influences are thought to regulate bone zzso In an attempt to identify potential targets for therapeutic manipulation of bone mass, we used differential zzso display to investigate early changes in zzso gene expression following mechanical loading of rat bone in zzso One gene found to be zzso by loading had high zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso previously identified only the zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso targeted to the coding region of the published zzso sequence amplified identical products from bone and brain (but not a range of other zzso The zzso were zzso and found to be identical to the published zzso zzso zzso Northern analysis confirmed expression of zzso zzso in bone and brain, but not other zzso In zzso zzso localized zzso zzso expression in rat bone to zzso and zzso A zzso zzso localized high levels of protein expression to zzso and newly incorporated zzso Interestingly, older zzso also expressed zzso levels of zzso Another neural zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso region of zzso bone zzso cells, while a further zzso to the zzso zzso failed to bind to bone zzso Five days after zzso zzso protein expression was zzso in zzso of loaded bone but present in control zzso zzso confirming the zzso detected by differential zzso On zzso zzso surfaces, zzso expression was almost zzso while on surfaces where loading had induced cellular proliferation and bone formation, zzso protein expression was zzso In the zzso the expression of zzso zzso on zzso zzso is associated with zzso of released zzso at zzso where they have a role in the termination of zzso zzso In this study, we describe for the first time, the expression of zzso (and zzso in bone, raising the possibility that zzso zzso acids may have a role in zzso zzso communication in zzso zzso of bone cell function by zzso of zzso action could therefore provide novel treatments for bone diseases such as zzso
