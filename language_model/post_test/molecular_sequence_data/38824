zzso zzso exchange factors zzso are responsible for zzso cell surface receptors to Ras protein zzso Here we describe the characterization of a novel family of zzso expressed zzso identified by database sequence zzso zzso These molecules share the core zzso domain of other Ras family zzso but lack the zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso region zzso domain that is believed to contribute to zzso zzso In zzso binding and in zzso zzso exchange zzso indicate that these zzso specifically catalyze the zzso loading of the Ral zzso when zzso in zzso zzso A central zzso motif associated with the zzso zzso zzso adapter proteins zzso and zzso in zzso whereas a zzso zzso zzso domain was located at the zzso C zzso We refer to these zzso as zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso with zzso domain and zzso binding zzso The zzso domain was required for in zzso zzso activity and could be functionally replaced by the zzso C zzso suggesting a role in membrane zzso In the absence of the zzso domain zzso zzso cooperated with zzso to promote Ral zzso indicating that zzso domain interaction also contributes to zzso zzso In contrast to the Ral zzso zzso zzso zzso family of Ral zzso the zzso proteins do not possess a zzso domain, suggesting that they are activated in a zzso zzso
