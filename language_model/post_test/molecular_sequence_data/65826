zzso zzso and Respiratory zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of the ongoing zzso high fever zzso in China, is capable of genetic and zzso zzso at high zzso How to design vaccine rationally to keep up with the ever-changing prevalent zzso zzso is of great zzso We developed an infectious zzso clone of an attenuated strain of Type II zzso and further manipulated the infectious zzso clone by inserting zzso between zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso The zzso was generated from the zzso virus strain, zzso via zzso and followed by zzso sequencing and molecular zzso The full-length of the zzso zzso zzso was determined as zzso zzso in length excluding zzso tail, which has a zzso zzso identity with that of zzso zzso strain, also a vaccine zzso Based on the zzso sequencing results, the full-length zzso clone was assembled in zzso zzso under the control of zzso promoter at the immediate zzso zzso of zzso To discern the rescued viruses from that of parental virus, a zzso I restriction site was engineered into zzso coding zzso Upon zzso of the in zzso transcripts of both the original and zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells, typical zzso zzso effects were zzso The rescued viruses from the full-length zzso clones displayed the same zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted to separate the coding regions between zzso zzso zzso zzso and structural zzso zzso The synthetic zzso of such zzso zzso zzso was infectious and the rescued virus shared similar properties with that of the parental zzso This study provided a valuable tool for development of zzso zzso as vaccine candidate offering zzso to various genetically diversified zzso zzso and a platform for further development of zzso as a gene expression zzso for zzso vaccines against other significant zzso zzso
