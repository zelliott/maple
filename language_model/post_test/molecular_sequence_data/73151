Class I zzso T cell responses have been shown to be critical for the development of immune resistance to zzso zzso in zzso However, to date, no zzso targets of this zzso response have been zzso We have analyzed the characteristics of potential zzso zzso zzso target molecules by expression of the model zzso target zzso chicken zzso in different cellular compartments of zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso was expressed as a zzso zzso zzso or zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso Host cells infected with zzso zzso zzso that zzso or released zzso but not those producing zzso or zzso forms of zzso could process and present zzso zzso via the class I zzso pathway, as indicated by the stimulation of zzso zzso T cell zzso and the zzso of host cells infected with zzso zzso by zzso zzso In addition, infection of mice with zzso zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso These studies demonstrate the ability to target proteins to specific cellular compartments in zzso zzso using either zzso or zzso signal zzso Furthermore, these results suggest that proteins zzso or released by zzso zzso in infected cells are a major source of peptides for zzso class I presentation and for the generation of zzso zzso
