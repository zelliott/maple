zzso is the main zzso involved in nicotine metabolism in zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in individuals of zzso descent and investigated its impact on zzso activity and association with smoking zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso acid changes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso The effect of zzso in zzso was examined in individuals of zzso descent given 4 zzso oral zzso 

zzso occurred at an zzso frequency of zzso in individuals of zzso descent zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and was not detected in Caucasians zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso or Japanese zzso zzso In zzso zzso had greatly reduced activity toward nicotine zzso similar to zzso as well as reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso did not differ in activity compared with the zzso zzso The zzso to zzso ratio, a zzso measure of zzso activity in zzso was lower in zzso and zzso individuals zzso adjusted ratio of zzso zzso compared with zzso individuals zzso adjusted ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toward a higher zzso frequency in nonsmokers zzso zzso zzso compared with smokers zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso function in zzso and in zzso and trends toward an association with lower risk of zzso
