A zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was constructed in zzso coli using a cloning zzso not designed for zzso gene zzso One positive clone exhibiting acquired zzso zzso activity was directly detected by an in zzso plate zzso using a colony zzso procedure with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso isolated from the clone contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and a full-length zzso coding sequence could be zzso zzso of the active zzso zzso in zzso coli was independent of zzso and of the kind of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso gene was controlled by fortuitous zzso sequences present in its own zzso zzso region, not by the bacterial zzso promoter or other serendipitous zzso zzso The zzso partially zzso by zzso of the host proteins at high temperature and gel exclusion zzso showed a zzso structure with a zzso of molecular mass of 32 zzso which was in perfect agreement with that deduced from the cloned zzso The same protein was revealed in zzso zzso cell zzso thus demonstrating its functional occurrence in zzso under the cell culture conditions zzso The zzso zzso exhibited high zzso activity and zzso with optimal activity between pH zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of fatty acids (from zzso to zzso allowed the zzso to be classified as a short length zzso zzso
