An extremely zzso and zzso zzso was isolated previously from zzso zzso collected at a depth of zzso m on the zzso zzso The strain, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso of zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso at pH zzso The optimum concentration of zzso for growth was zzso at both pH zzso and zzso The zzso content of its DNA was zzso Low level zzso of zzso zzso between strain zzso and the species of these zzso was found, indicating that zzso could not be classified as a member of a new species belonging to known zzso Based on zzso analysis using zzso zzso sequencing, zzso and the physiology of strain zzso it is proposed that this zzso is a member of a new species in a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso
