zzso zzso are zzso regulatory zzso that function via the degradation of target zzso and zzso of zzso They are found widely in higher zzso organisms, and in several species that have been closely zzso hundreds of zzso have thus far been discovered with mechanistically zzso yet functionally diverse, roles necessary for the proper development, zzso and metabolism of the zzso zzso cells produce zzso in a zzso manner and zzso them to regulate unique zzso of genes expressed in the host zzso This rule also appears to apply to the zzso embryonic stem cells, according to several recent studies that reported identification of specifically expressed zzso zzso interest in these zzso stems in part from the possibility that they are one of the zzso of the salient characteristics of these zzso zzso capacity and zzso As functional data supporting this hypothesis are beginning to zzso it can be envisioned that zzso may be useful as molecular tools for manipulating zzso This review focuses on the recent discovery and functional characterization of zzso in human and mouse zzso and provides perspectives on future research zzso
