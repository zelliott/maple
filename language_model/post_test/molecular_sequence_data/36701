A highly sensitive zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method was evaluated for detection of human zzso virus type 1 zzso DNA in clinical zzso The product resulting from the first amplification reaction is used as the template for the second zzso with an internal zzso primer zzso Even when starting from a single copy of zzso DNA, the double zzso product was readily detected by direct zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of minute amounts of zzso DNA was successful in a considerable excess of zzso negative DNA than reported zzso All of 85 zzso individuals were zzso with at least two of the three sets of zzso used, 252 of 255 zzso allowing zzso zzso of a unique DNA zzso of the expected zzso The zzso amplification protocol is simple and rapid and fulfills the requirements of sensitivity and specificity for use in a clinical zzso
