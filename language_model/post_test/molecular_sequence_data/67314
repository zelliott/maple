A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zone of a zzso spring in zzso zzso zzso at the zzso interface deposited at the zzso zzso The cells of strain zzso were short, thin zzso zzso with one polar zzso dividing by zzso zzso The optimal values and ranges for pH and temperature were pH zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso was capable of zzso zzso and zzso growth with zzso as an electron zzso The zzso chain was zzso zzso of zzso was coupled to reduction of zzso - to zzso - or of zzso O to zzso , as well as under zzso conditions, with zzso as an electron zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso According to the results of zzso analysis, the strain was zzso remote from the closest relatives, members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso Based on its zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with the results of zzso analysis, strain zzso is described as a member of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type species zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
