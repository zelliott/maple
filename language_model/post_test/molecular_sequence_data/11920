An zzso coli zzso zzso has been identified and cloned based on its ability to suppress the zzso zzso of a resident, zzso zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which was localized to zzso zzso on the zzso coli zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso led to an increase in zzso zzso levels and modest enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso with its in zzso effect, zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso in zzso and facilitated zzso zzso and strand exchange with model zzso These results suggest that zzso promotes zzso of the zzso by binding zzso zzso resolving zzso precursor molecules and zzso association of critical base pair zzso Furthermore, zzso K treatment of zzso precursors prior to the initiation of the zzso reaction still resulted in zzso enhancement, indicating that zzso is not required for the zzso step, unlike the zzso zzso zzso zzso whose presence was necessary for zzso to zzso Together these results suggest that zzso has zzso activity in zzso with the property of promoting assembly of the precursors into an active zzso in contrast to zzso zzso that stabilize the zzso active zzso zzso
