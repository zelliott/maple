zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso are derived from two zzso genes and the functional zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso have been zzso Here, we report about the isolation of zzso of zzso transcripts from rat anterior zzso which are generated by alternative zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2 and zzso of fragments from zzso 1 and 2 accounted for formation of three misplaced zzso whereas the zzso of a zzso from zzso 6 resulted in generation of a functional plasma membrane zzso termed zzso In this zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequence of zzso was zzso with a shorter zzso zzso resulting in zzso of the putative zzso responsible for zzso to zzso and zzso proteins and the zzso recycling, as well as in deletion of the predicted protein zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso The zzso transcripts for zzso were identified in normal and immortalized zzso cells and several other zzso The pharmacological profiles of zzso zzso and zzso were highly comparable, but the zzso of zzso to the zzso signaling zzso was zzso causing a rightward shift in the potency for zzso Furthermore, the efficacy of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso signaling zzso and to zzso was significantly zzso These results indicate for the first time the presence of a novel zzso zzso zzso which could contribute to the functional zzso among zzso zzso cell zzso
