We report the cloning and sequencing from human zzso of zzso coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein zzso molecular mass zzso identical with human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso By using full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to probe human zzso zzso zzso the location of the human zzso gene was mapped to zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso detected bands at zzso 43 zzso and zzso 37 zzso in both normal zzso and zzso zzso red blood cell zzso ghost zzso In SS zzso and in ghosts from a patient with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the amount of zzso was increased compared with AA zzso suggesting that the expression or membrane assembly of zzso is cell zzso zzso scanning zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso largely to the zzso zzso The increased zzso intensity of zzso in a zzso AA zzso zzso fraction is consistent with a dependence of zzso membrane content on cell zzso zzso and zzso form stable complexes in zzso demonstrated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction of ghost zzso which results in the extraction of the zzso zzso also results in the extraction of zzso consistent with the possibility for the association of these proteins in zzso in zzso The results presented here establish the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and raises the possibility that this protein has a role in zzso zzso transport and volume regulation in young zzso zzso the association of zzso zzso with zzso offers a model in which to test interactions between zzso zzso channels and the zzso
