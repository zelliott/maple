A novel strategy is described for the preparation of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso protected zzso groups are introduced as side chains on zzso These can, in a later stage, be converted into zzso zzso zzso by reaction with zzso zzso A zzso zzso is then easily formed by reaction with a zzso group of a zzso side zzso The zzso linkage between zzso and the model zzso reduced zzso and zzso remains intact, even after 24 h of incubation at 37 degrees C in zzso
