Bone zzso protein 4 zzso is a potent growth factor that is involved in many important biological zzso zzso of the level of zzso mature zzso determines the biological effects of zzso on cells in the local zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso a member of DAN family zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso we report a novel zzso regulatory mechanism by which zzso interacts with zzso zzso prevents zzso of mature zzso and therefore zzso zzso activity more zzso Furthermore, we also defined a zzso acid zzso sequence within the zzso DAN domain that is essential for zzso zzso This novel zzso zzso zzso regulatory mechanism implies that the level of zzso zzso expression does not truly reflect zzso activity when zzso and zzso are zzso within the same zzso Similar regulatory mechanisms may be zzso by other DAN family zzso
