Identification of expressed sequences within zzso DNA is a hurdle in the characterization of complex zzso We developed an zzso zzso scheme that provides a positive selection for zzso zzso zzso A copy of the trapped zzso sequence is obtained by zzso zzso The technique detects valid terminal zzso without interference from partial zzso or zzso zzso including simple human repeated zzso Application to random human zzso yielded one unique trapped terminal zzso per zzso on zzso Because zzso terminal zzso average zzso zzso in zzso the technique provides transcribed sequences of sufficient length to assist further mapping zzso
