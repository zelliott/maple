zzso zzso class zzso zzso mice were created and their zzso potential evaluated in response to zzso B DNA zzso Every single zzso mouse developed zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cell responses directed at the same zzso zzso as those identified in naturally infected or vaccinated zzso These mice were specifically protected against a zzso zzso zzso virus infection with a zzso or more reduction of the virus load at day 4 zzso These mice represent a unique in zzso experimental model for human immune function studies without any interference with mouse zzso response which dwarfed the prediction of human zzso Furthermore, they enable the complete monitoring of immune zzso responses for zzso screening of candidate zzso
