The current pace of structural biology now means that protein three-dimensional structure can be known before protein function, making methods for assigning zzso via structure comparison of growing zzso Previous research has suggested that sequence similarity after zzso alignment is one of the best zzso of zzso and often functional zzso Here, we exploit this zzso together with a merger of protein structure and sequence databases, to predict distant zzso zzso We use the zzso zzso of zzso zzso database to link sequence alignments from the SMART and zzso zzso We thus provide new alignments that could not be constructed easily in the absence of known three-dimensional zzso We then extend the method of zzso zzso to assign statistical significance to sequence identities found after structural alignment and thus suggest the best link between diverse sequence zzso We find that several zzso related protein sequence families can be linked with confidence, showing the approach to be a means for zzso zzso relationships and thus possible functions when proteins are of known structure but of unknown zzso The analysis also finds several new potential zzso where inspection of the associated alignments and zzso reveals conservation of unusual structural features or zzso of zzso zzso acids and bound zzso We discuss implications for zzso zzso initiatives and for improvements to sequence comparison zzso
