We report, for the first time, the presence in zzso zzso of an zzso zzso that, like zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso and the corresponding organic zzso The finding of an zzso zzso in zzso zzso was unexpected as this zzso has only previously been described in bacteria of environmental zzso or water) zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso is very similar zzso zzso to the other two zzso zzso zzso one from zzso zzso and one from zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was measured as the release of zzso by zzso crude extracts from zzso zzso strains and from zzso zzso coli strains zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso specificity was zzso with crude extracts from zzso zzso cells grown in zzso the best zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of an internal zzso sequence was obtained with each of 45 different zzso zzso clinical zzso suggesting that zzso is common to all zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying an interrupted zzso gene was constructed by zzso zzso No zzso activity could be detected in zzso In a zzso negative zzso zzso activity was two- to zzso higher than in the parental strain zzso Crude extracts of strain zzso slowly zzso zzso This activity was affected in neither the zzso negative strain zzso nor a double zzso strain deficient in both zzso and zzso activities, suggesting the presence of an independent discrete zzso in zzso zzso The existence of an zzso zzso a correlation between the zzso and zzso activities and the possible presence of a zzso indicates that zzso zzso has a large range of possibilities for zzso zzso zzso
