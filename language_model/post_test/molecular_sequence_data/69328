The zzso zzso gene zzso is zzso to play an important role in the process of cellular commitment in the zzso zzso based upon its zzso zzso expression pattern in the adult zzso We have isolated and zzso both zzso and zzso clones in order to understand how this expression pattern is regulated and to determine the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso Our studies show that the zzso gene contains 3 zzso and 2 zzso and encodes a zzso acid protein which is translated from a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso some 30 base pairs downstream from a typical zzso box which, together with the zzso end of the zzso is located within a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have shown three regions which regulate zzso gene zzso These include a typical zzso element at zzso to zzso an element at zzso to zzso which blocks the effect of the zzso and a positive element at zzso to zzso the only one which shows zzso cell zzso Using gel shift and zzso zzso we have detected proteins in nuclear extracts prepared from zzso zzso cells which bind to the zzso zzso These initial results suggest that zzso gene expression is regulated by multiple positive and negative zzso zzso
