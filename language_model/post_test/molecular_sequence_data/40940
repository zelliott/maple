A zzso zzso zzso strain zzso capable of utilizing zzso zzso zzso as a sole carbon source at a high concentration (up to zzso was isolated from zzso storage site by selective enrichment zzso The zzso characterization with zzso zzso gene sequencing zzso identified zzso as a member of zzso zzso It was studied for the degradation of zzso and a range of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The shake zzso experiments demonstrated fast degradation of zzso (up to zzso at zzso within zzso zzso with the addition of small quantity zzso of zzso zzso The relative degradation profile by the isolate was in the order of zzso Further, the zzso characterization of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso techniques demonstrated that the degradation proceeded via formation of zzso zzso to form zzso zzso It was the major zzso formed, associated with profound increase in degradation zzso in presence of appropriate zzso
