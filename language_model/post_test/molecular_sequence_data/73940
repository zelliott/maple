The zzso expressed zzso zzso is representative of a newly identified group of zzso zzso zzso whose functions are currently zzso We have begun to address the cellular function of zzso by examining its zzso distribution and its zzso zzso binding zzso Using zzso electron zzso and zzso zzso zzso was localized predominantly to the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso 7 zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso experiments, zzso of discrete zzso structures on the periphery of the zzso zzso was also zzso Using zzso thin layer zzso the zzso zzso that zzso to zzso zzso in both control and zzso zzso cells, were zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the protein was in an active zzso A zzso zzso protein was created that had no zzso zzso zzso and in both zzso zzso and zzso fluorescent protein fusion studies, this zzso also localized to the zzso zzso These results suggested that the zzso binding status of zzso is independent of its capacity to zzso to the zzso zzso Given these results, we propose that zzso is representative of a new family of zzso zzso zzso that may be involved in protein processing or zzso
