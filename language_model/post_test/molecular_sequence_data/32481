Some proteins of zzso zzso bind to zzso probably contributing to the replication of viral zzso However, little is known about whether any protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso could bind to zzso In this study, we cloned the zzso of segment 9 zzso of zzso zzso 14, into zzso for the generation and zzso of zzso binding protein zzso fused protein zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso properties of zzso revealed that zzso but not zzso alone, bound to zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso activities of zzso were significantly inhibited or completely eliminated by protein zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso the formation of zzso was only competitively inhibited by a heavy dose of competitive zzso zzso or zzso but not by zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso bound to both zzso and zzso but not zzso Moreover, the characterization of different zzso of zzso revealed that the regions zzso zzso and zzso but not region zzso may be crucial for the zzso ability of zzso zzso the sensitivity of zzso to zzso and the zzso effect of different regions suggest that the zzso ability of zzso may be zzso Thus, our findings provide new insights into understanding the zzso function of zzso
