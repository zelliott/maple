The human zzso gene was originally isolated through its involvement with a constitutional zzso zzso in a patient with stage zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that zzso is a zzso protein in zzso cells, which zzso to the zzso during late zzso of zzso zzso of its function leads to incomplete cell division and the formation of zzso zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso zzso zzso motif located in the zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso domain have been shown in some cases to act as zzso proteins zzso and function through the interaction with zzso small G zzso Despite the identification of over 50 zzso zzso and over 70 zzso zzso only three combinations have been shown to have zzso activity to zzso In this study, using linear zzso trap mass zzso we have demonstrated that zzso exists in a protein complex with zzso Further, using a specific zzso zzso we have shown that zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso form of zzso and in a GAP activity zzso we have confirmed that zzso functions as a GAP for the zzso zzso
