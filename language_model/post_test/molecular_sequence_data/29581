Since the identification of the first zzso gene in 1991, the zzso family has expanded dramatically, and over 25 zzso genes have now been identified in zzso The focus of studies on the zzso proteins has been their potential for cancer zzso as a result of the finding that peptides derived from zzso gene products are bound by major zzso complexes and presented on the cell surface of cancer zzso However, the normal zzso role of zzso proteins has remained a zzso Recent studies are now beginning to provide insights into zzso gene zzso zzso acts as a cell cycle regulatory protein and plays a key role in the zzso of zzso syndrome, a zzso zzso zzso identified as a binding partner for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso blocks cell cycle progression and enhances zzso This review provides an overview of the human zzso genes and zzso summarizes recent findings on their cellular roles, and provides a baseline for future studies on this intriguing gene zzso
