While zzso zzso changes are considered by some to have been a major factor promoting zzso within the zzso others suggest that much of the zzso species diversity originated before the zzso Using zzso and nuclear sequence data, we evaluate the relative importance of zzso and zzso events within the evolutionary history of the Mexican zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso support the existence of cryptic lineages with strong zzso divergence zzso zzso among zzso Some of these lineages form zones of secondary zzso with one of them zzso with zzso zzso zzso network analyses reveal the oldest populations of zzso zzso to be those of the northern and southern Mexican coastal zzso Inland and zzso coastal populations are younger in age as a consequence of a history of local extinction within these regions followed by zzso zzso divergence times suggest that zzso zzso originated during the zzso whereas geographically distinct zzso DNA lineages first started to diverge during the zzso with subsequent divergence continuing through the zzso Our results highlight the influence of both zzso and zzso events in shaping the geographical distribution of genetic variation within zzso zzso zzso Areas of high genetic diversity in southern Mexico were zzso this finding plus the high levels of genetic diversity within zzso zzso have implications for the conservation of this threatened zzso
