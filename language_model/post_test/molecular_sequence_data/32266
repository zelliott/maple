zzso zzso zzso is a cardiac disease characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso patients are sporadic cases, but a certain population of zzso patients can be familial cases caused by zzso in genes for zzso components including zzso However, zzso zzso could be identified only in a part of the familial zzso patients, suggesting that there should be other disease causing genes for zzso To explore a novel disease gene for zzso we searched for zzso in zzso zzso for four and half zzso protein 2 zzso in zzso patients, because zzso is known to associate with zzso A zzso zzso zzso was identified in a patient with familial zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso affected the binding to zzso Because zzso protein is known to zzso zzso zzso to zzso these observations suggest that the zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso via impaired recruitment of zzso zzso to the zzso
