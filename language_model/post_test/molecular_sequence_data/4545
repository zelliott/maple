The zzso of the vitamin zzso proteins contain a zzso recognition site that is required for zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso is sufficient to direct zzso two zzso zzso species were expressed and characterized with regard to zzso zzso A double point zzso in which zzso zzso for zzso 17 and 22 disrupted a zzso loop formed by a zzso bond, was fully zzso when expressed in Chinese zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso constructed by deleting the zzso aromatic zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso of zzso has the signal zzso and zzso juxtaposed to a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso zzso Of the 8 zzso acid zzso contained within the first 40 zzso of the zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso at least seven were fully zzso as demonstrated by direct zzso acid analysis of the alkaline hydrolysate and by zzso sequence zzso These results indicate that the zzso recognition site within the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso protein is sufficient to direct zzso zzso of adjacent zzso acid zzso in a zzso region of zzso that is not normally zzso Furthermore, the zzso loop in the zzso domain of zzso is not required for complete zzso
