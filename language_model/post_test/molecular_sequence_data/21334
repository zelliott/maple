How zzso factors affect zzso structure to regulate gene expression in response to changes in environmental conditions is poorly understood in the green zzso To shed light on this issue, we used zzso zzso and zzso isolation of regulatory elements to investigate the zzso structure at target genes of zzso and zzso key zzso regulators of the heat shock and copper zzso responses, respectively, in the zzso green zzso zzso zzso Generally, we detected lower zzso occupancy, higher levels of zzso zzso zzso and lower levels of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso at promoter regions of active genes compared with inactive promoters and transcribed and zzso zzso Specifically, we find that activated zzso and zzso zzso factors mediate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso By this, zzso and zzso quite individually zzso and activate target promoters that may be inactive and embedded into closed zzso zzso or zzso active and embedded into partially opened zzso or completely opened zzso zzso We also observed zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso promoter after heat zzso suggesting interplay of specific and presumably more generally acting factors to adapt gene expression to the new requirements of a changing zzso
