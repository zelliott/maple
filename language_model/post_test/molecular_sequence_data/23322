The zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of two molecules of zzso and one zzso of the unusual zzso acid zzso zzso which are zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso has zzso zzso and zzso properties and possesses a zzso bond, which is very rare in natural zzso Previously zzso zzso and middle regions of the zzso zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso zzso were isolated and zzso The boundaries of the gene cluster were identified by gene zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso searches led to the completion of the gene zzso which consists of 24 zzso Four of these were identified as zzso genes coding for proteins that are probably involved in zzso early steps of zzso zzso or in providing precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, or zzso The involvement of the genes zzso and zzso and of the regulatory gene zzso in zzso zzso was analyzed by gene zzso and zzso zzso Insight into the regulation of zzso was gained by determining the zzso start sites of the zzso and zzso zzso A previously zzso regulatory gene involved in zzso differentiation in zzso was identified outside of the left boundary of the zzso zzso gene zzso
