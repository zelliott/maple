The process of cellular zzso is highly zzso in zzso and is dependent upon the function of proteins that are centrally involved in zzso of the cell zzso The human zzso of invasion clone 10 zzso protein was identified from a zzso cell library based on its ability to promote zzso zzso invasion and zzso Through zzso zzso the zzso zzso B1 and an zzso zzso zzso were isolated as zzso zzso zzso of the zzso divergent zzso finger motif zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding and zzso sites alter zzso zzso zzso including delay in zzso zzso In zzso the addition of zzso zzso nuclear envelope breakdown and zzso entry in zzso egg zzso zzso zzso expression reduces zzso B levels in cycling zzso eggs and reduces levels of the zzso B zzso zzso in zzso zzso is itself a specific in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso motif as primary zzso zzso Finally, zzso is itself zzso in egg extracts and is also zzso in zzso These and other points lead to a model in which zzso defines a divergent class of zzso zzso zzso functioning in progression through zzso
