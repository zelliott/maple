A number of zzso zzso zzso recovered from zzso zzso zzso of an AIDS patient during a prolonged treatment with zzso zzso have been studied at the molecular zzso All of them were highly resistant to zzso zzso and shown to be virtually deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was demonstrated to be due to the production of truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso as shown in one zzso was caused by a zzso zzso that originated from a zzso deletion at position 520 of the zzso open reading zzso This zzso generated a zzso stop zzso 27 zzso zzso An additional isolate was also recovered following zzso zzso and after a cycle of treatment with zzso This isolate had lost the zzso trait and was characterized by a wild type zzso sequence and by the production of a functional zzso Data presented confirm that a prolonged treatment with zzso can easily select zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso caused by a zzso zzso Although recovered from zzso zzso of different zzso these zzso may belong to the same strain that has undergone multiple cycles of zzso and has possibly zzso during its zzso route to the zzso
