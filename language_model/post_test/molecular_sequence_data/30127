The reaction of zzso zzso the inactive zzso of the zzso drug zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution at 37 degrees C was monitored by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso follows zzso reaction zzso with a rate constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso shown to be zzso zzso in which Pt is coordinated to the zzso zzso positions, were trapped with zzso and identified by zzso degradation zzso These zzso zzso and a third, less abundant, one are rapidly removed from the DNA by zzso under mild zzso When allowed to react further, the zzso zzso formed a single main product that was characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso positions decreases the zzso at zzso and leads to zzso of the intervening zzso zzso The zzso zzso and unmodified zzso were obtained by zzso the complementary strand to the corresponding single strands and then studied by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding does not induce large changes in the zzso bond or zzso angles of the zzso linkages in the duplex, nor does it significantly alter the zzso melting zzso zzso binding does, however, cause the zzso zzso of the zzso duplex to exchange rapidly with zzso by 50 degrees C, a phenomenon that occurs at 65 degrees C for the unmodified zzso A structural model for the zzso zzso zzso was generated through molecular dynamics zzso This model reveals that the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso within the double zzso with minimal distortion of the zzso angles and only local disruption of base pairing and zzso of the zzso zzso The model also predicts hydrogen bond formation involving coordinated zzso zzso that bridge the two zzso
