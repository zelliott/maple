To determine whether zzso zzso by zzso zzso occurs in patients at risk of zzso zzso zzso to determine whether screening zzso specimens by zzso chain reaction zzso increases detection of C zzso compared with isolation and the immune dot zzso zzso and to correlate the detection of C zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso with a history of zzso zzso 

Thirteen zzso and 11 heterosexuals were included in the zzso zzso and zzso specimens were tested for C zzso and N zzso using standard clinical diagnostic zzso Two different zzso zzso were also used to detect C zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were correlated with the mode of sexual zzso 

zzso sexual contact was zzso by zzso zzso of heterosexuals in addition to zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso of all patients did not use any form of barrier zzso Of those who admitted to zzso sexual zzso zzso of patients with a zzso zzso infection and zzso of those with zzso zzso also had zzso zzso zzso C zzso was detected in three of 124 zzso zzso specimens by zzso which were reported as negative by zzso culture; one was positive by the immune dot zzso zzso 

The majority of patients zzso unprotected zzso contact and significant zzso zzso by C zzso and N zzso occurred if zzso infection was zzso Despite the use of zzso in a population at high risk of sexually transmitted disease, the prevalence of zzso in the zzso was very zzso This indicates that transmission of C zzso to the zzso does not pose a serious health risk and that screening of patients for zzso C zzso is not zzso
