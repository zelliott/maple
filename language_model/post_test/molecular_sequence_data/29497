zzso is an zzso zzso channel close to a zzso zzso Both channels show a prominent zzso cumulative zzso The cumulative zzso of zzso but not of zzso was enhanced by the patch zzso To gain structural information about the phenomenon, we examined zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso pore domain displayed enhanced cumulative zzso after patch zzso In the pore domain, eight zzso acids are different between the two zzso zzso therefore, constructed eight zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the sequence zzso All the zzso showed a similar zzso current zzso suggesting that zzso zzso was not zzso The patch zzso failed to enhance the cumulative zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso deletion zzso zzso N) became slower in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Internal application of the zzso zzso from the zzso channel zzso a zzso block of Delta zzso By contrast, the block was not frequency dependent in Delta zzso Delta zzso and Delta zzso The results suggest that the positions zzso zzso zzso and perhaps zzso in the zzso backbone are involved in the stability of zzso zzso and the cumulative zzso of zzso zzso
