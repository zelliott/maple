The presence of zzso to the zzso human and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and inflamed zzso zzso of zzso patients was zzso In order to obtain the zzso zzso plasmids carrying human zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes were constructed and expressed as zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins were confirmed by zzso specific to zzso zzso and zzso with both zzso and bacterial zzso Western zzso analysis clearly demonstrated that the number of zzso patients showing a positive response to zzso zzso zzso was higher than the number of zzso healthy zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in all samples of zzso tissue zzso For human zzso a higher frequency of zzso was found in the zzso patients than in the healthy zzso In addition, the zzso patients demonstrated stronger zzso compared with the healthy zzso zzso analysis of serum zzso by zzso also demonstrated that the levels of zzso in the zzso of patients were significantly higher than those of control zzso In the zzso tissue zzso seven out of 10 patients demonstrated a positive response to human zzso and zzso of these demonstrated strong zzso zzso serum zzso to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso from selected patients reacted with zzso zzso zzso and human zzso respectively, suggesting zzso of zzso These results suggest that molecular mimicry between zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso may play some role in immune mechanisms in zzso
