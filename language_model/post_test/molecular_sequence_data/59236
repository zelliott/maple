Having identified two zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso that induced patient peripheral blood zzso cells to produce zzso zzso zzso in zzso we assessed the role these zzso zzso play in inducing zzso zzso switching zzso 4 and zzso in the absence of T zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso B cells were cultured with either of these zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and human zzso Both zzso and zzso signals delivered by zzso (or zzso were necessary for the induction of specific zzso zzso To assess the role played by zzso produced by B zzso in zzso selection of the gamma 4 or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used in zzso While zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso production, zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso zzso significantly inhibited the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso appeared to zzso zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso had no effect on specific zzso zzso they zzso specific zzso zzso a finding paralleled by zzso zzso These data suggest that certain zzso zzso zzso responses can be zzso regulated and that certain zzso produced molecules from B zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso a significant role in the induction of specific zzso of zzso zzso
