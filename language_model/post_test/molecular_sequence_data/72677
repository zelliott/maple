A number of DNA zzso genes zzso have been identified in zzso zzso In the present study we describe isolation of a novel zzso zzso the expression of which is induced by exposure of cells to zzso light, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The DNA sequence of zzso was zzso By comparison of the predicted zzso zzso acid sequence with those in databases we found that it belongs to a family of proteins which includes zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All these proteins are endowed with DNA zzso activity and are known to play an important function in DNA zzso The strongest zzso to zzso was found with the zzso protein of zzso zzso the function of which is essentially zzso The expression of the zzso gene was studied in detail using a zzso fusion integrated into a zzso We show that the expression level of zzso rises during zzso at a time nearly zzso with commitment to zzso No zzso of zzso was found after treatment with zzso agents of cells bearing the zzso zzso Surprisingly, a high zzso level of zzso expression was found in strains in which the zzso gene was zzso by zzso zzso We suggest that a form of zzso may be a negative regulator of the zzso gene zzso
