Many bacteria form zzso and zzso by conversion of the zzso zzso and zzso species zzso by the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and an zzso donor zzso or zzso Here, we report the crystal structures of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso formed zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso in line with the equally facile use by the zzso of these zzso acids as zzso donors in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso channel is open throughout the length of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso active site to the zzso zzso pocket in the zzso A zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contacts and the zzso zzso Judged from sequence conservation in the known zzso zzso the zzso binding motif was likely present in the primordial zzso but became lost in certain lineages zzso zzso zzso zzso Two zzso metal binding sites, one permanent and the other zzso are present in the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso zzso The two sites enable zzso to first zzso the zzso zzso zzso and then zzso the activated intermediate to form the zzso products, zzso or zzso
