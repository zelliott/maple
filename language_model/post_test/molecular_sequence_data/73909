zzso known to be the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso Several studies have revealed a correlation between depletion of zzso T zzso increased serum levels of zzso and the evolution of AIDS in infected zzso We show that in human B and T cell lines, irrespective of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso is inhibited by zzso soluble zzso envelope zzso zzso and by zzso infectious zzso zzso an zzso zzso which zzso the binding of zzso to zzso and blocks viral infection, did not affect zzso of zzso zzso binding to zzso by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso directed against the zzso loop and the zzso region of zzso abolished completely the zzso zzso Overlapping synthetic peptides covering the entire zzso sequence were tested to map the region in zzso responsible for zzso binding zzso Only peptides in the zzso region significantly inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso These results provide indirect evidence for the interaction of zzso with zzso and indicate that a specific function of zzso is the zzso of zzso binding to zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso zzso leads to severe combined zzso syndrome, it remains possible that zzso zzso blockade of zzso interaction may have significant consequences in the zzso of zzso
