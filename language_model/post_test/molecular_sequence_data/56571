Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of the zzso gene is zzso by dietary zzso in zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso gene of a zzso related species, zzso zzso is also subject to zzso zzso Moreover, the cloned zzso gene of zzso zzso is shown to be zzso zzso when it is zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso This zzso functional conservation is zzso by a zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the promoter elements required for zzso repression are zzso between zzso related zzso zzso A sequence comparison between the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows that the promoter sequences diverge to a much greater degree than the coding zzso The zzso promoters of the two species do, however, share small clusters of sequence zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso elements are sufficient to control the zzso expression of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso
