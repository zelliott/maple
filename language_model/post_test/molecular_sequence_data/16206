With a view to identifying proteins that regulate the expression of the zzso zzso gene we have zzso its zzso upstream element zzso and determined the binding sites for embryonic nuclear proteins within this region by in zzso zzso zzso We find that greater than 50% of this element is bound by nuclear zzso By zzso and zzso studies in embryonic extracts from different zzso zzso we have zzso a number of zzso complexes whose nature alters in concert with changes in the zzso expression pattern, suggesting that these zzso proteins may be involved in the regulation of gene zzso In some cases this suggestion is substantiated by the observation that the protected DNA sequences show zzso to the binding sites for zzso regulating zzso proteins such as the zzso gene product zzso
