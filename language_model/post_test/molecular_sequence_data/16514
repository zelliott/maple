zzso are a class of zzso peptides isolated from fish zzso zzso zzso physically interact with cell zzso by forming pores or zzso zzso channels that disrupt cellular zzso Here we report the high-resolution structure of synthetic zzso zzso in sodium zzso zzso as determined by zzso solution zzso zzso The zzso adopts a zzso motif with an angle between the two structure zzso of 122 zzso 9 degrees , making this structure substantially different from the one previously determined in organic zzso In addition, zzso solution zzso experiments on zzso in zzso reveal that except for the C zzso the zzso is not zzso These results are zzso by solid-state zzso experiments on zzso in zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso echo zzso experiments in zzso zzso support the zzso zzso of the zzso segment, whereas zzso zzso experiments show that the zzso zzso considerable disorder in both the zzso and the zzso core of the zzso These solid-state zzso studies indicate that the zzso zzso has a zzso orientation in zzso zzso whereas in zzso zzso this domain is zzso oriented on the zzso surface and zzso slow motion on the zzso time zzso These new data help explain how the zzso interactions of zzso with zzso zzso induce a stable secondary structure and provide an atomic view of the membrane zzso process of zzso
