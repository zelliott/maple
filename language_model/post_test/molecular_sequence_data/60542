zzso and zzso zzso have long served as the model compounds for zzso zzso and clinical studies of the drugs that bind in the DNA minor zzso However, the results presented in this investigation clearly show that zzso zzso zzso is superior to both of these drugs at zzso the effects of intrinsic DNA zzso and zzso zzso as measured by zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso was more effective than zzso and zzso zzso at zzso the assembly of zzso onto synthetic and natural sequences that have multiple closely spaced zzso sequences that serve as drug binding zzso Since these effects may be related to the biological action of the drugs, it was of interest to determine the mechanism that was responsible for the enhanced action of zzso The possibility that the differential drug zzso resulted from differential overall affinities of the zzso for zzso molecules was considered, but drug binding studies suggested that this was not the zzso It is also unlikely that the differential drug effects resulted from the binding of the drugs to different DNA sites since the zzso zzso binding sites for zzso and zzso were centered on the same zzso positions as revealed by zzso studies using zzso III, zzso I, and zzso zzso However, the zzso studies with zzso I did uncover a potentially important difference between the zzso zzso protected only the AT zzso in the binding sites, while zzso and zzso protected these zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso These results permitted us to advance a preliminary model for the enhanced action zzso According to the model, the short length of zzso and its absolute specificity for zzso zzso with narrow minor grooves ensures that only particularly minor grooves that give rise to zzso and zzso zzso are occupied by the zzso zzso each zzso zzso induced by an zzso in the absence of the drug is countered by an opposite zzso induced by zzso zzso thus effectively zzso intrinsic zzso and zzso into the minor zzso
