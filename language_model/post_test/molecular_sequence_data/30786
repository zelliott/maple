We recently described the characterization and cloning of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso contains six zzso zzso and five zzso type III zzso and shows strong sequence zzso to the mouse neural cell zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso gene generates at least two different protein products by zzso alternative zzso The two protein forms differ in their zzso zzso The long form is restricted to the surface of zzso in the zzso and zzso and some support cells in the zzso in contrast, the short form is expressed on a wide range of other cells and zzso Thus, whereas the mouse zzso gene appears to zzso only one protein that functions largely as a neural cell zzso zzso its zzso zzso the zzso zzso encodes at least two protein forms that may play two different roles, one as a neural cell zzso zzso and the other as a more general cell zzso zzso involved in other zzso and zzso disc zzso
