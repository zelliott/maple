The aim of the present study was to purify and identify a plasma protein fraction zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and to explore its capacity to process plasma zzso zzso was obtained from plasma as a single zzso band by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso activities of zzso were zzso as was its zzso zzso acid zzso zzso kidney extract or plasma zzso or previously treated with acid to pH zzso were incubated with zzso for 15 minutes at 37 degrees zzso zzso concentration was measured by incubation with zzso zzso The same protocol was repeated with samples activated by zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso which had a zzso of zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso The zzso concentration in rat kidney extract was zzso zzso of zzso I zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso After zzso or zzso treatments, zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The plasma zzso concentration in normal plasma was zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and no significant difference was observed after zzso zzso However, a significant increase zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found after zzso zzso The isolated zzso acts on zzso zzso but not on plasma zzso These results suggest that active zzso is processed in the kidney by a circulating zzso that may have a role in the regulation of circulating zzso
