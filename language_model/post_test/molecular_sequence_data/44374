In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso involved in zzso zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that these zzso are induced when zzso zzso is grown in the presence of zzso which is converted to zzso and that zzso a zzso regulator, is required for this zzso The zzso zzso is believed to have evolved from the zzso zzso zzso which encodes zzso that zzso zzso and is regulated by zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso is an intermediate of the zzso pathway, zzso In this study, we demonstrate by the use of in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso that the analogous intermediate of the zzso pathway, zzso is the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso I zzso of zzso with and without zzso were also zzso An extended region of the promoter from zzso to zzso was occupied in the absence of zzso but the zzso region was zzso When zzso was added to the binding zzso the footprint contracted approximately 4 zzso at the zzso end of the promoter, and the zzso region was zzso It is interesting to note that zzso actually extends its footprint 14 zzso on the zzso promoter in response to its zzso Although zzso and zzso change their zzso protection patterns in different manners when exposed to their respective zzso their final zzso resemble each zzso zzso it is possible that their zzso zzso mechanisms may be zzso zzso
