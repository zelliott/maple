The human zzso contains thousands of zzso sequences that are often more zzso between zzso species than zzso zzso These highly zzso zzso elements zzso are associated with genes that coordinate development, and have been proposed to act as zzso zzso Despite their extreme sequence conservation in zzso sequences zzso to zzso have not been identified in zzso 

Here we report that zzso zzso contain an alternative set of zzso that share sequence zzso but not identity, with their zzso zzso zzso thus represent a very unusual class of sequences that are extremely zzso within specific animal lineages yet are highly divergent between zzso zzso zzso are also associated with zzso regulatory zzso and include zzso enhancers and zzso factor binding sites, supporting the proposed function of zzso as zzso zzso Most zzso 40 of 156 human zzso genes with zzso zzso are also associated with zzso in both worms and zzso 

A core set of genes that regulate development is associated with zzso across three animal groups zzso flies and zzso We propose that these zzso reflect the parallel evolution of alternative enhancers for a common set of zzso regulatory genes in different animal zzso This zzso of gene regulatory networks containing key zzso coordinators was probably a driving force during the evolution of animal body zzso zzso may, therefore, represent the zzso traces of these zzso core gene regulatory networks that specify the development of each alternative animal body zzso
