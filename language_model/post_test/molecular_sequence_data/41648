zzso acid zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 zzso is an important constituent of soybean zzso Since zzso acid and its mineral zzso zzso are almost zzso for zzso their abundance in grain zzso causes nutritional and environmental zzso interest in breeding low zzso acid has therefore increased zzso Based on gene mapping and the characteristics of zzso zzso profile in the seeds of a soybean zzso line zzso the soybean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso into zzso acid, was first hypothesized as the candidate gene responsible for the low zzso acid zzso in zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso was then identified in the mapped region on zzso zzso zzso revealed a G zzso A point zzso in the zzso DNA sequence and the exclusion of the entire fifth zzso in the zzso sequence of zzso in zzso compared with its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The excluded zzso encodes 37 zzso acids that spread across two zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, complete zzso of low zzso acid zzso with the G zzso A zzso was observed in the zzso population of zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 (a zzso zzso Put together, the G zzso A point zzso affected the zzso zzso and resulted in the exclusion of the fifth zzso of zzso which is expected to disrupt the zzso zzso leading to low zzso acid level in zzso zzso would be a good zzso source in low zzso acid soybean zzso
