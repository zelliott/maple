The zzso protein zzso has been shown to be a regulator of the zzso factor zzso zzso associates with zzso via its pocket region and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we provide evidence for a novel interaction between zzso and the zzso factor zzso We show that zzso can be found zzso associated with zzso in the extracts of several different cell zzso Moreover, in transient zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso This repression of zzso zzso does not require the zzso domain of zzso zzso driven by a zzso protein containing the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso Interestingly, unlike the repression of zzso transcription, the repression of zzso zzso does not depend on an intact pocket zzso We show that distinct regions of zzso are involved in the control of zzso and zzso
