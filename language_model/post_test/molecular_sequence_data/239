Eight strains of an unknown zzso zzso species were isolated from the zzso contents of rabbits zzso zzso All strains were initially identified as belonging to the zzso zzso by means of zzso zzso but none were identified using zzso zzso for known zzso zzso zzso were spiral shaped with bipolar zzso zzso with no zzso zzso and appeared zzso after zzso days of zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences revealed that all strains formed a robust zzso that was very distinct from recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso comparisons of strain zzso with the type strains of other zzso species revealed that the nearest zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso % zzso The uniqueness of these rabbit zzso was confirmed by zzso protein zzso Taken together, these data indicate that the strains belong to a novel zzso species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
