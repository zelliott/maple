Faithful zzso of the genetic material requires that replication origins fire only once per cell zzso Central to this control is the tightly regulated formation of zzso complexes zzso at future origins of DNA zzso In all zzso zzso this zzso loading by zzso of the zzso zzso next to the origin recognition complex zzso More recently, another factor, named zzso was shown to be essential for zzso loading in zzso zzso and zzso as well as for DNA replication in zzso and zzso Surprisingly, no zzso zzso was found in budding zzso despite the zzso nature of origin zzso Here we identify zzso previously isolated through interactions with zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso as an zzso of zzso We show that zzso zzso lose zzso in an zzso zzso manner, consistent with zzso being involved in origin zzso zzso cells partially depleted of zzso replicate DNA from fewer origins, whereas fully depleted cells fail to load zzso on zzso and fail to initiate but not zzso DNA zzso We conclude that origin licensing depends in zzso zzso as in other zzso on both zzso and zzso
