zzso represents one of the most highly zzso families of proteins in zzso The work presented here describes the molecular characterization of the mouse smooth muscle zzso zzso gene zzso It represents the largest zzso gene characterized to date, measuring over 23,000 zzso from the zzso start site to the zzso zzso The gene is divided into nine zzso and encodes a mature zzso protein of 374 zzso zzso zzso regulatory elements are noted as well as regions of the gene that have the potential to form non-B DNA zzso that may influence gene zzso
