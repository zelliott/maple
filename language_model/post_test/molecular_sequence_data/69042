To define the structural basis of zzso for the zzso and zzso of zzso we have attempted to identify the zzso acids in the zzso of the zzso that are involved in zzso zzso We predicted that the last 10 zzso acids form a zzso structure exposing on one side a zzso and on the other side a continuous zzso zzso The relative importance of the two zzso in assembly was zzso by introducing point zzso in either domain of zzso beta zzso and by testing the ability of these zzso to stabilize newly zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso and to form functional zzso complexes at the plasma zzso All single and double zzso with changes at zzso and/or zzso to either zzso or zzso charged zzso acids associated with zzso zzso and increased the number of zzso binding sites and zzso zzso into zzso On the other hand, zzso affecting the zzso zzso acids influenced the assembly efficiency with zzso to a variable zzso The single zzso zzso and zzso did not influence and the zzso zzso slightly affected the assembly zzso On the other hand, the cellular zzso of zzso and the expression of functional zzso pumps was considerably reduced with the zzso zzso and totally abolished with the double zzso zzso Finally, replacement of zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso with the less zzso zzso also significantly decreased zzso zzso which was no longer zzso after replacement of all four zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
