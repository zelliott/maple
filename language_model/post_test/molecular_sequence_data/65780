zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso is closely related to chick zzso protein 2 and rat zzso which are involved in zzso transport and zzso of zzso and zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein that has been implicated in zzso regulation, zzso alternative zzso and zzso zzso More specifically, zzso is an essential factor for targeting zzso zzso zzso to the zzso We report here that zzso is zzso zzso and interacts with the Tudor domain of zzso the zzso gene for spinal muscular zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso These two proteins zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso is required for normal zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso this interaction is zzso by zzso Tudor domain zzso found in human patients affected with severe Type I zzso a strong indication of its functional significance to the zzso of the zzso We also report for the first time that zzso and zzso Tudor zzso behave similarly to the previously characterized zzso zzso and cause loss of Tudor interactions with several cellular zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso is zzso in the absence of zzso and this correlated with increased zzso stability of its zzso target, zzso in spinal zzso of mild zzso model zzso Our results suggest zzso can act as a molecular zzso for zzso proteins involved in zzso metabolism and provide new insights into the zzso of zzso
