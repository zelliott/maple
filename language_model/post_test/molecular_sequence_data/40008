The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso of zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso that do not recognize zzso as their zzso A functional study of two zzso zzso versions that improved the tolerance of a zzso zzso zzso sensitive strain to high zzso concentration of zzso identified two polar zzso zzso zzso in the fifth zzso domain, zzso and zzso as being involved in zzso recognition and transport in zzso zzso zzso A zzso substitution of zzso zzso with a zzso group at these positions, zzso or zzso produced a broadened zzso selectivity of the zzso for zzso in addition to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that while the replacement of zzso with a small zzso zzso or zzso charged zzso zzso acid did not produce a significant change in zzso zzso zzso the introduction of a positive charge at this position stopped the activity of the zzso This data demonstrates that the zzso composition of the fifth zzso domain, mainly the presence of zzso acids containing zzso groups in this part of the zzso is critical for the recognition and transport of zzso and could participate in zzso movements during the binding and/or zzso transport cycle in zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso
