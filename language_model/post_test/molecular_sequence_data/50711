There is increasing evidence that the zzso system zzso zzso cardiovascular function through both zzso and zzso zzso The existence of a local zzso has been proposed in the heart based on zzso and molecular biological studies that identify zzso and zzso We conducted the present study to determine the chamber zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso rat heart and whether these components could be identified in cultured zzso and zzso obtained from zzso rat zzso zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso indicated that whole hearts obtained from zzso rats contained both zzso and zzso zzso With the use of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were localized both in the zzso and zzso of zzso rat zzso Relative signal strengths for zzso were highest in the left and right zzso In contrast, zzso signal strength was overall much lower and zzso localized in the left zzso To investigate the cellular source of zzso and zzso cultured zzso heart zzso and zzso zzso were screened for zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein using zzso and indirect zzso zzso zzso These experiments demonstrated that both cell types produce transcripts and the respective translation products for zzso and zzso These data suggest that the site of zzso II synthesis can occur at the level of the individual zzso and zzso where it may serve to directly and/or indirectly regulate cardiac rate, force, growth, and development in the zzso
