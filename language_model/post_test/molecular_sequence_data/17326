zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso which have been implicated in zzso processes and stress responses in higher zzso An ancestral zzso gene appears to have been duplicated at the origin of the zzso family, thus yielding two zzso in the derived zzso zzso gene structure was investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso a geographically isolated zzso species that is endemic from the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits several zzso and zzso adaptations related to this cold and harsh environment, including high levels of zzso which is unusual in higher plants, and especially high levels of zzso the product of the zzso zzso Various zzso clones were obtained from zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that all these clones fitted with the presence of two zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso during zzso development and response to zzso Whereas zzso was expressed at both zzso and mature zzso zzso transcripts were hardly detected during early development and were significantly expressed in mature zzso Moreover, zzso but not zzso expression was zzso in response to chilling and salt stress at zzso zzso Analysis of zzso regulatory regions of these zzso genes revealed several differences in putative zzso zzso which could be associated with specific expression zzso These results were compared to zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and are discussed in the evolutionary context of genetic diversity resulting from gene zzso
