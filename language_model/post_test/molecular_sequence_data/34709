Although zzso protein zzso zzso has been reported to be a marker of germ cell tumors of the zzso its relationship to zzso alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein expression in zzso germ cell zzso zzso has not been directly zzso In this study, zzso of zzso in 30 cases of zzso was examined and compared with that of zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso were positive in 29 zzso of 30 cases, whereas zzso was expressed in zzso All 3 markers were negative in normal zzso zzso of 11 zzso DNA binding sites in the promoter region zzso in the zzso and zzso genes might explain the zzso of protein zzso
