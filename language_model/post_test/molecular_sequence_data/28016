The complete zzso size and distribution pattern in the gene for the alpha 1 chain of human type IV collagen was zzso zzso covering 145 zzso zzso of zzso DNA including 100 zzso of the gene itself as well as 25 zzso upstream and 20 zzso downstream of the gene zzso respectively, were isolated from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The overall gene structure was determined by zzso restriction mapping and zzso analyses and all zzso sizes by zzso zzso The characterized clones contained all the coding sequences except for zzso 2 whose sequence was determined after its amplification by the zzso chain zzso There were four gaps in the zzso zzso the exact size of the gene is zzso The entire gene is at least 100 zzso in size and contains 52 zzso whose size distribution is completely different from that of the genes for zzso zzso In the zzso coding region there are three zzso of 99, 90, and 45 base pairs zzso each and two zzso of 27, 36, 42, 51, 54, 63, and 84 zzso zzso The rest of the zzso have sizes between 71 and 192 zzso in the zzso zzso About one-half of the zzso repeat coding zzso start with the second base for the zzso of zzso whereas the other half starts (with two zzso with a complete zzso zzso The distribution of split versus zzso zzso is uneven in that the first 19 zzso of the gene start with a complete zzso The gene contains repetitive sequences in several zzso A zzso segment containing 40 copies of zzso flanked by zzso and zzso sequences was shown to be located adjacent to an zzso The gene has previously been shown to be located head-to-head to the alpha zzso collagen gene at the zzso end of the long arm of zzso 13, such that the first zzso of the two genes are separated by as little as 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the human alpha zzso collagen gene has a structure distinctly different from the genes for zzso zzso and also that it is considerably larger than any collagen gene characterized to zzso
