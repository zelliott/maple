zzso are a class of small proteins that play a key role in regulating many cellular zzso zzso We report here the characterization of the first member of the zzso family in zzso that is mainly associated with zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso that is expressed in zzso zzso sensory zzso and to some extent also in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is active at reducing protein zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso strain carrying a zzso zzso of the zzso gene displays a zzso decrease in both mean and maximum lifespan when compared to zzso The identification and characterization of zzso zzso the way to use zzso zzso as an in zzso model to study the role of zzso in lifespan and nervous system physiology and zzso
