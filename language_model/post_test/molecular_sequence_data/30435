The primary structure of G proteins as deduced from zzso proteins and cloned zzso is zzso When known, their functions are discussed, as are recent data on direct regulation of zzso channels by G zzso zzso on expression of alpha zzso either in bacteria or by in zzso translation of zzso zzso from zzso are presented as tools for definitive assignment of function to a given G zzso The dynamics of G zzso signal zzso are zzso Key points include the existence of two superimposed regulatory cycles in which upon zzso by zzso G proteins zzso into alpha and beta gamma and their zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso The action of receptors to catalyze rather than regulate by zzso the zzso of G proteins by zzso is emphasized, as is the role of zzso zzso without which receptors could not act as zzso To facilitate the reading of this review, we have presented the various zzso of this rapidly expanding field in sections zzso each of which is organized as a self-contained zzso that can be read independently of the zzso
