zzso zzso using mobility shift zzso gel zzso revealed the presence of a protein that specifically bound to a restriction zzso zzso to zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start point of zzso a regulatory gene for zzso zzso in zzso zzso The binding site corresponded to an upstream zzso sequence predicted from the results of in zzso promoter zzso The binding was greatly enhanced by 5 zzso zzso This binding was detected with the protein source only from the zzso strain and not from an zzso zzso zzso The zzso supplementation of zzso to the zzso zzso strain caused the appearance of the protein in the zzso zzso A synthetic zzso 52 zzso in length zzso from zzso to zzso which was zzso on the basis of data obtained from both zzso zzso with dissected DNA fragments and in zzso promoter zzso was retarded by the zzso zzso In addition to this zzso zzso at least three proteins with different recognition site affinities capable of binding to the upstream region of the zzso promoter were zzso The binding of one of these proteins to both sides of the upstream zzso sequence bound by the zzso protein was completely abolished in the presence of zzso and zzso in the incubation zzso The region bound by these proteins showed anomalous zzso mobility, like that of a bent DNA zzso which is probably caused by the presence of many blocks consisting of A and zzso The region bound by these proteins was found to be transcribed in the orientation opposite to that of zzso
