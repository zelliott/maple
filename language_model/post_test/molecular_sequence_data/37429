Unlike most DNA zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso are capable of strand displacement DNA synthesis in zzso zzso by other zzso While human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso has been shown to possess this rare ability, the structural zzso responsible are zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies have indicated that the zzso hairpin of the fingers zzso of zzso zzso contains key contacts for the incoming template zzso In order to assess the possible role of the fingers zzso in strand displacement zzso a set of zzso was created at the highly zzso zzso zzso which is thought to contact the template strand immediately ahead of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso displayed altered degrees of strand displacement synthesis on zzso and gapped duplex DNA templates with the relative order being: zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to verify that the effects on strand displacement synthesis were not an indirect effect of zzso in zzso all zzso zzso were tested for zzso zzso While the strand displacement activity of zzso zzso zzso was affected zzso it displayed a zzso zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso zzso despite showing enhanced strand displacement zzso displayed reduced zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso which had displayed nearly zzso strand displacement zzso was affected zzso These results showed that the effects of zzso zzso on strand displacement are not due to global changes in zzso zzso Analysis of pause sites during DNA zzso on zzso templates revealed that the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso interact with the template quite zzso Modeling a 5 zzso duplex DNA ahead of the zzso site of zzso zzso suggested a correlation between the ability of the zzso of the zzso acid zzso at position 61 to stabilize the first zzso of the DNA duplex to be melted and the degree of strand displacement zzso Our results confirm a role for zzso zzso in zzso synthesis and indicate that the fingers zzso harbors a structural zzso of strand displacement synthesis by zzso zzso
