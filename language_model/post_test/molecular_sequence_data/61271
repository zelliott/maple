zzso zzso by protein zzso is essential for the biological function of a number of zzso zzso many of which are involved in signal zzso and zzso traffic zzso zzso similarity searches reveal that the zzso of protein zzso zzso is a member of the zzso repeat zzso zzso This finding makes the three-dimensional structure of the rat protein zzso the first structural model of a zzso protein interacting with its protein zzso zzso comparison of the two zzso zzso in protein zzso and protein zzso 5 indicates that variation in zzso consensus zzso may affect protein binding specificity through altering the overall shape of the zzso zzso A general approach to evolutionary analysis of proteins with repetitive sequence motifs has been developed and applied to the protein zzso and other zzso zzso The results suggest that all members in zzso family originated from a common zzso zzso while the common zzso of zzso and other members of zzso zzso is likely to be a single repeat zzso
