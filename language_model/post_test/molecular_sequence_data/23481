The zzso ring proteins zzso and zzso are distinguished from other zzso regulators by the presence of a zzso zinc finger zzso zzso zzso are divided into two known zzso zzso zzso that specifically bind to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso region of zzso zzso including the zzso domain and its associated zzso bundle at zzso A zzso The structure reveals a cramped zzso binding pocket and a blunted membrane zzso zzso These structural features indicate that the domain is not zzso to bind to zzso or insert into zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain thus defines a third zzso of zzso zzso that are functionally and structurally zzso zzso analyses provide insights into the possible function of this unique zzso of zzso zzso
