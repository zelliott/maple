zzso the most common zzso tumor in childhood, has a wide spectrum of clinical and biological zzso The loss of zzso within the zzso region has been reported as a zzso zzso Two tumor zzso genes located in this region, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso play a critical role in cell cycle progression and are considered to be targets for tumor zzso We analyzed zzso and zzso gene zzso in 11 patients, who ranged in age from 4 months to 13 years zzso ratio was zzso The most frequent stage of the tumor was stage IV zzso followed by stages II and III zzso and stage I zzso The samples were submitted to the multiplex zzso technique for zzso deletion analysis and to zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing for zzso zzso All zzso of both genes were zzso but no deletion was zzso One sample exhibited shift mobility specific for zzso 2 in the zzso zzso not confirmed by DNA zzso zzso deletions and zzso are not involved in the zzso mechanism of the zzso and zzso genes in zzso however, these two abnormalities do not exclude other zzso zzso Recent evidence has shown that the expression of these genes is altered in this zzso zzso other mechanisms of zzso such as zzso of promoter region and zzso function of zzso may be considered in order to estimate the real contribution of these genes to zzso genesis or disease zzso
