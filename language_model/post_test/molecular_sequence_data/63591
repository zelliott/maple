zzso is comprised of a series of highly regulated zzso changes that transform the precursor germ cell into a highly specialized zzso The last phase of zzso termed zzso involves dramatic zzso change including formation of the zzso zzso and zzso of the nucleus, formation of the zzso and disposal of unnecessary zzso A prominent zzso component of the developing zzso is the zzso a unique zzso structure that surrounds the nucleus of the developing zzso and is thought to assist in both the zzso of the nucleus and zzso of zzso zzso Although the molecular motor zzso has been shown to associate with the zzso its precise role in function of the zzso and the identity of its zzso specific protein partners are zzso The purpose of this study was to identify proteins in the zzso that interact with zzso using a zzso 2 hybrid screen of a zzso zzso zzso 

Thirty percent of the interacting clones identified in our screen contain an identical zzso zzso a 40 zzso zzso This interacting protein has 4 zzso repeats in its zzso terminal half and is expressed primarily in the zzso therefore we have named this protein zzso zzso repeat protein or zzso zzso was also found to associate tightly with the zzso targeting domain using affinity zzso In addition to the zzso repeats, zzso contains a zzso site for protein zzso zzso zzso using a zzso specific zzso demonstrates that this protein is found near the zzso of developing zzso 

We have identified a previously zzso zzso repeat protein that is expressed abundantly in the zzso and associates with the zzso of developing zzso possibly through its interaction with the zzso molecular zzso zzso is zzso to a class of regulatory zzso for zzso a central zzso in the zzso zzso of proteins that is key to zzso of many zzso zzso zzso may serve to target this important signaling zzso near the nucleus of developing zzso in order to control the cellular zzso of zzso
