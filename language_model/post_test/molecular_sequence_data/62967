The excessive zzso response triggered by microbial zzso has been implicated in the zzso of a wide range of human diseases but has been most clearly defined for the zzso and zzso toxic shock zzso Because zzso class II presentation of zzso to T cells is not zzso the possibility that zzso zzso could influence zzso and thus clinical zzso to the toxicity of individual zzso has received little zzso In this study, we demonstrate that binding of zzso and zzso zzso to zzso class II is influenced by zzso differences in class zzso For the zzso zzso zzso zzso A, class II binding is dependent on zzso zzso zzso such that zzso zzso show greater binding than zzso zzso The functional implications of differential binding on T cell zzso were investigated in various experimental systems using human T cells and zzso zzso transgenic cells as zzso These studies showed quantitative and qualitative differences resulting from differential zzso zzso We observed changes in T cell proliferation and zzso production, and in the zzso specific changes in T cell repertoire that have zzso been regarded as a defining feature of an individual zzso Our observations reveal a mechanism for the different outcomes seen following infection by zzso zzso
