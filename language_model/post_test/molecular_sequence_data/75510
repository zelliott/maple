zzso coding for zzso zzso a precursor protein of zzso zzso beta zzso was cloned and the zzso sequence has been zzso The sequence covers the whole coding region zzso base zzso with zzso and 3' zzso region (30 and 214 base pairs, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso beta consists of a zzso zzso signal zzso preceding the zzso gamma zzso region zzso zzso zzso and the subsequent basic delta region zzso zzso zzso The site for zzso zzso of the precursor zzso to make the gamma and delta chains is estimated to be located between the zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid of the gamma chain of mature zzso zzso beta zzso was reported to be blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Plant Cell zzso 21, zzso It was shown that the blocked zzso zzso acid is coded as a zzso zzso The derived zzso acid sequence was also compared with those of precursor proteins of other zzso zzso such as soybean zzso cotton beta zzso pea zzso and rape zzso zzso by dot zzso zzso
