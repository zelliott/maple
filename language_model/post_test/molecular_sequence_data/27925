Genes zzso the 2 zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been identified and cloned by their similarity to the corresponding genes in zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences were confirmed by comparison with regions zzso earlier by protein zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences are zzso identical for the beta zzso and zzso identical for the alpha zzso These sequences are compared to those of zzso zzso where the structure is known from X-ray zzso Although zzso acid conservation drops to zzso and zzso for the beta and alpha zzso only 3 single zzso gaps are required to maintain alignment throughout and most of the zzso identified as important for zzso or zzso binding are zzso The 23 zzso surrounding the beta chain zzso that enters into a Schiff base linkage with the zzso zzso zzso are compared in 13 species, including representatives from the zzso and both zzso zzso appreciable conservation is zzso The approximately 100 base pairs separating the zzso gene from its zzso transcribed zzso gene are similar in the 2 zzso but do not resemble those of any other zzso or fungus studied to zzso
