To study the molecular characteristics of zzso strain isolated from mosquitoes in Yunnan Province and define its zzso 

The S segment of zzso strain was amplified and zzso by 2 different sets of zzso The zzso tree of S zzso was constructed by zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of N and zzso proteins were also zzso 

zzso strain could be amplified by 2 sets of zzso respectively, S segment showed a highest zzso with zzso virus zzso reached zzso the zzso of protein N and zzso zzso sequence with zzso virus was zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso strain belongs to zzso virus, this is the first report of molecular biological identification of zzso virus in zzso
