zzso zzso a toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso alcohol in human zzso This reaction is controlled by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To further investigate the primary structure and expression of zzso we screened a library of human liver zzso cloned in the expression zzso zzso zzso and isolated an 800 zzso zzso that directed synthesis of a fusion protein recognized by zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso as a probe, we screened two human liver zzso libraries and found several zzso zzso which would code for a zzso with 308 zzso zzso zzso However, a similar full-length zzso possibly the transcript of a zzso contained an zzso nonsense zzso The deduced protein sequence of zzso showed zzso similarity to the primary structure of human liver zzso zzso and zzso similarity to the zzso protein sequence of rat lens zzso zzso A search of zzso revealed significant zzso similarity to a zzso coding for bovine lung zzso f zzso and to a partial zzso coding for zzso lens zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA displayed between 45 and 65 zzso of DNA zzso to zzso zzso and demonstrated several restriction zzso length zzso among 26 zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from human, zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso disclosed zzso with zzso zzso only for the first three zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
