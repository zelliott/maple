Identification of specific protein markers for zzso cancer zzso could provide a basis for its early diagnosis and zzso as well as clues to the molecular mechanisms governing cancer zzso In the present study, zzso zzso coupled with zzso was used to screen for zzso candidates in the serum zzso of ten human zzso samples and ten healthy control zzso After pooling identical amounts of serum proteins (based on total protein zzso zzso was depleted under partially zzso zzso zzso the serum samples were labeled with three different zzso and separated by zzso zzso After analysis with the biological variation analysis module of the zzso software, only three spots were found to be significantly elevated in all patient groups (with ratios from zzso to zzso whereas five spots were significantly zzso in patients (with ratios from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Finally, two potential zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso were chosen for validation and analysis by zzso with the serum of 30 zzso patients and 30 healthy zzso The serum levels of the two proteins correlated well with the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso approaches show great promise for zzso discovery in zzso
