zzso type C1 zzso disease is caused by defects in the zzso zzso which result in zzso of zzso cholesterol zzso To identify related proteins that may be involved in zzso cholesterol trafficking, the expressed sequence tag zzso database was searched to find zzso of human zzso A short, zzso similar zzso was identified and used to obtain a full-length human zzso of about 5 zzso and two alternatively spliced zzso The zzso named zzso was mapped to zzso zzso contained 20 zzso including an unusually large zzso zzso 2, and spanned approximately 29 zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso putative promoter region contained a zzso zzso The predicted protein shared zzso identity and 51% similarity with zzso Interestingly, zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the putative zzso domain, providing strong evidence that it is related to human zzso and suggesting that these may comprise a new family of zzso zzso However, the two differ with respect to their putative zzso targeting zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso and zzso form part of a family of related proteins that may have similar functions at different zzso locations, perhaps at sequential steps of the same cholesterol transport zzso
