The zzso zzso contains a family of genes that are related to zzso the zzso sex determining zzso The zzso is restricted to the region of zzso that encodes a DNA binding motif of the zzso zzso These genes have been named zzso genes zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and zzso zzso a member of the human zzso gene zzso zzso maps to the X zzso in the region zzso A mentally retarded male patient with zzso B is deleted for both the Factor IX gene and zzso This suggests that zzso is not essential for zzso zzso The zzso of the patient and the expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso raises the possibility that this gene is a candidate gene for zzso an zzso mental zzso zzso
