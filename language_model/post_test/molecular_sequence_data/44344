A primer extension zzso zzso was used to monitor selection by zzso of the first versus the second zzso zzso as a function of introducing zzso on the 3' side zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the first zzso zzso Six different zzso zzso starting with G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly zzso selection of zzso when compared with matched zzso that had A or C instead of G in position zzso zzso by G in position zzso failed only when it was combined with U in position zzso as in the sequence zzso In contrast with the usual enhancing effect of introducing G in position zzso most zzso in position zzso had no discernible effect, as shown with the series zzso (where N zzso C, A, G or zzso and the series zzso zzso zzso recognition was also unaffected by zzso in position zzso as shown by testing four zzso that had zzso as the start zzso Thus the primary sequence context that zzso the recognition of zzso start zzso does not appear generally to extend beyond G in position zzso When the zzso zzso was used with zzso that initiate translation at zzso instead of zzso zzso was not recognized better than zzso contradicting the hypothesis that initiation at zzso zzso might be favored by A instead of G in position zzso
