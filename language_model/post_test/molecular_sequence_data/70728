Huntington disease zzso is an zzso dominant neurodegenerative disorder associated with expansions of an unstable zzso zzso repeat in zzso 1 of the zzso zzso In normal individuals, zzso contains up to 35 zzso repeats, while in affected the repeat length is zzso zzso chain reaction zzso is used to estimate the number of zzso repeats but may be inefficient in long repeats because of the high zzso content of the HD zzso We present a novel zzso approach for the diagnosis of zzso which permits direct zzso of the amplified products on zzso zzso using zzso zzso It is based on the zzso conversion of C zzso to U by zzso treatment of zzso DNA and subsequent amplification of the sense strand with specific zzso The zzso treatment dramatically reduces the C + G content of the zzso thus, the high zzso and stable secondary structures are no longer obstacles to zzso In both normal and affected individuals, zzso repeats zzso zzso before zzso zzso in the sense strand can easily be amplified and zzso on a gel by zzso zzso zzso The method has considerable advantages compared with other described zzso diagnostic tests for zzso
