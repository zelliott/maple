To zzso the molecular properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from thoroughbred horse skeletal muscle and hair roots, zzso The full-length zzso and zzso zzso consist of 2,320 and zzso zzso respectively, containing a zzso zzso open reading zzso The zzso were mapped to zzso zzso 1, and the zzso zzso zzso M zzso gene consists of twelve zzso zzso 9 of zzso and zzso 10 of zzso were further investigated in five zzso zzso Out of 55 zzso acids zzso by zzso 9 in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso in all zzso zzso among other zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and His zzso Also, the zzso regulatory zzso which have potential for involvement in alternative zzso between these zzso were completely zzso among the zzso In zzso zzso analysis, strong expression of both zzso and zzso zzso was found in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain of thoroughbred zzso In addition, the authors made the novel finding that zzso derived from hair roots has a zzso start site different from that of other zzso and is more specific in its zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may have kinetic properties and zzso regulatory mechanisms different from those of other zzso
