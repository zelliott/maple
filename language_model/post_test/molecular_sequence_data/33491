zzso zzso and folding in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso involves two distinct zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both proteins have the characteristic domain structure of the zzso family consisting of a zzso zzso zzso binding domain and a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whose zzso binding activity is regulated by zzso that promote either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso and was previously shown to function as a zzso exchange factor zzso for zzso Here we show that in addition to this zzso activity, zzso can function as a zzso that prevents protein zzso in zzso Analysis of the zzso requirement of these functions demonstrates that zzso binding to zzso stimulates the interaction with zzso and is essential for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso activity is zzso and unaffected by zzso that interfere with zzso binding and zzso zzso In zzso these zzso show severe protein zzso defects and are unable to support growth despite the presence of a second zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso exchange activity is vital for zzso protein zzso in zzso
