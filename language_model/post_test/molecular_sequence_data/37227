We have isolated a novel zzso zzso gene coding for two distinct proteins via alternative zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we have identified another gene in the zzso zzso zzso a second zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso as well as many putative zzso zzso from different species, all contain, in addition to the zzso and zzso zzso several zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are zzso expressed at various stages of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso also zzso with zzso zzso Both zzso further zzso zzso zzso in insect and zzso zzso zzso raised either against zzso or zzso both zzso zzso as well as several zzso zzso binding zzso factors zzso Moreover, following zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso combined with gel zzso of zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso were detected in zzso with an apparent molecular mass of about zzso zzso whereas zzso was found in zzso corresponding to masses of at least 2 zzso together with zzso and several zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso the two zzso proteins showed different zzso on zzso X zzso These results, taken together, suggest that the two zzso zzso zzso are present in distinct zzso zzso zzso
