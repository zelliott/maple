Alzheimer's disease zzso is thought to depend on the deleterious action of zzso zzso or zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso Out of various known zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso occurs at highest zzso inside the brains of zzso zzso Its zzso properties critically depend on zzso and it was thus proposed that lipids could play a major role in zzso To better understand their possible effects on the structure of zzso and on the ability of this zzso to form potentially zzso zzso structures, we here analyze the interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso has served, due to its controlled properties, as a major model system for studying general zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso of 8 zzso or higher exert dramatic effects on the zzso of soluble zzso zzso and induce the formation of zzso structure at high zzso By contrast, we find that zzso zzso well below the critical zzso concentration present no discernible effect on the zzso of soluble zzso although they substantially affect the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data imply that subtle zzso interactions suffice in controlling the overall zzso properties and drastically accelerate, or zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso buffer zzso
