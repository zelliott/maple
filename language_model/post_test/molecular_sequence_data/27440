zzso zzso is a common airborne zzso pathogen for zzso It frequently causes an invasive zzso zzso in zzso patients with poor zzso zzso zzso drugs are very expensive and cause serious adverse zzso Their correct application requires an early and specific diagnosis of zzso which is still not properly zzso This work aims to a specific detection of zzso zzso by zzso and the generation of zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso by zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a human patient with proven zzso It is a novel zzso of a group of surface proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which belong to the zzso zzso Single chain zzso variables zzso were obtained by zzso display from a human zzso zzso gene library and an immune zzso gene library generated from a zzso zzso with zzso zzso Two different selection strategies were performed and shown to influence the selection of zzso recognizing the zzso zzso in its native zzso Using these zzso zzso was localized in growing zzso of zzso zzso but not in zzso In addition, the zzso allowed differentiation between zzso zzso and related zzso species or zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso clones were further characterized for their zzso the nature of their zzso their serum stability and their detection limit of zzso in human zzso 

zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso offer a novel approach for the early zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso
