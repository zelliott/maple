We isolated 12 groups of zzso clones that contained zzso regions from a zzso library constructed from an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are located within the zzso zzso zzso were included in these zzso The promoter regions of zzso and zzso were completely identical for at least 200 zzso upstream from their respective initiation zzso zzso The five sequence elements zzso I to zzso that are zzso in the promoters of zzso and zzso genes were also found in the zzso and zzso zzso However, one zzso element zzso zzso unexpectedly lacked 7 of 11 zzso although box III has been considered necessary for expression in zzso The other ten groups of zzso clones were classified into six zzso groups and four zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes form a large zzso family in zzso zzso
