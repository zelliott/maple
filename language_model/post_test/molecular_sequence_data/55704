The concentration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is moderately regulated by the carbon source as is the case for zzso its zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is induced about twofold in zzso This induction is due to zzso The zzso gene product binds to a zzso binding site in the zzso promoter and moderately activates zzso in response to zzso above a zzso zzso As for the zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso is inhibited in the presence of zzso This zzso of induction is a prerequisite for zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, induced zzso levels are required for optimal growth on zzso since mutating the zzso binding site in the zzso promoter resulted in poor growth and reduced expression of zzso zzso Thus, in addition to the zzso regulation by zzso interaction, the regulation of zzso gene expression is an important zzso in determining carbon source control of the zzso zzso Although the mode of control is different, the pattern of zzso gene regulation resembles that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso being lower in zzso and zzso than in zzso
