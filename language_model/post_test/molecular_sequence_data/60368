The role of zzso in affinity maturation was investigated by determining the affinity of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and serum zzso in transgenic mice that zzso a zzso of zzso zzso in the B cell zzso Although transgenic animals briefly expressed higher numbers of zzso zzso after zzso the zzso zzso did not increase the number or size of zzso centers zzso alter the levels of serum zzso or change the frequency of zzso zzso zzso Nonetheless, the zzso zzso product, in addition to zzso zzso reduced zzso in zzso B cells and resulted in the expansion of B zzso bearing zzso zzso that are usually rare in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing these zzso zzso were frequent in the bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with low affinity for zzso The abundance of zzso cells lowered the average affinity of zzso zzso and serum zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso influence zzso zzso for affinity zzso
