zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso produced upon tissue zzso zzso DNA clones covering the entire sequence of the alpha zzso gene were isolated and characterized by restriction zzso Southern zzso and zzso DNA zzso The rat alpha zzso gene is zzso 50 zzso in length and consists of 36 zzso ranging in size from 21 to 229 zzso Two functional zzso a bait region and a zzso zzso site, are zzso by the zzso 18 and 24, zzso Several possible regulatory signals such as a zzso zzso core, an zzso zzso zzso alternative stretches and viral zzso core sequences were zzso Several zzso DNA clones which zzso with the alpha zzso zzso probe were also zzso zzso analysis showed that they possessed sequences identical to a part of the rat alpha zzso III zzso and that they had a zzso similar zzso organization to the alpha zzso zzso
