The human zzso gene encodes one of the bacterial zzso zzso that is associated with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso One of the interesting features of the zzso gene is that it is part of a multiple gene family which is localized on zzso bands zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we report four newly identified zzso zzso zzso All four novel members of the zzso gene family zzso relatively short zzso composed of the zzso portion of zzso and are expressed zzso except in the zzso To clarify whether the zzso zzso contribute to the DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso through an interaction with zzso we have performed a zzso zzso zzso and an zzso study using an zzso zzso cell line, zzso Our results clearly indicate that zzso does not interact with two representative zzso whereas the zzso portion of zzso not the zzso portion, does interact with zzso Thus, zzso are not likely to participate in the zzso zzso through association with zzso they must play some other roles in the living zzso
