We isolated and identified functional groups of bacteria in the rumen of Creole zzso involved in zzso zzso of native forage zzso The functional bacterial groups were evaluated by comparing the total viable, total zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacterial counts in the samples taken from zzso zzso fed native forage diet zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hay and corn were used as control zzso The roll tubes method increased the possibility of zzso and zzso zzso gene sequencing allowed definitive identification of bacterial species involved in the zzso zzso The starch and fiber contents of the diets influenced the number of total zzso bacteria and zzso and zzso functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the main species isolated and zzso The identification of bacterial strains involved in the rumen zzso helps to explain the ability of these animals to digest fiber plant cell wall contained in native forage zzso
