Occupational zzso exposure can be demonstrated in zzso of zzso zzso A possible role of zzso virus 40 zzso in the zzso of zzso was raised because several studies reported the presence and expression of zzso DNA sequences in human zzso It is also known that expression of zzso large T zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso might render infected cells more susceptible to zzso zzso The zzso sequences are suggested to have arisen from contaminated polio zzso Millions of people in the United States and most European countries were zzso with zzso polio vaccine in zzso However, in Finland, where polio vaccination started in 1957, no zzso vaccine was zzso We used a zzso chain zzso method to test for the presence of zzso sequences in DNA extracted from the frozen tumor zzso of 49 Finnish zzso patients, most of whom had been zzso exposed to zzso All of the Finnish tumor zzso tested negative for zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso sequences detected in zzso tissue in some previous studies may indeed originate from zzso polio zzso It is a matter of speculation whether the absence of zzso infection has contributed to the relatively low zzso of zzso in Finland zzso in zzso
