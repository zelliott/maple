zzso DNA zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by screening a zzso zzso library with zzso zzso The primary structure of the protein was deduced from the DNA sequence zzso the protein contains zzso zzso acids with a putative signal zzso of 27 zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests the existence of seven zzso zzso that show zzso with the corresponding regions of other G zzso zzso Three other types of clones corresponding to shorter proteins were observed, in which the putative zzso domain was zzso These probably arose through alternative zzso zzso zzso analysis showed similar patterns in zzso and zzso with a major zzso of zzso zzso and several minor zzso The zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells, yielding a protein that bound zzso with the same affinity as the zzso zzso
