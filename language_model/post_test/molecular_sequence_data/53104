zzso zzso zzso zzso can be subdivided into six zzso zzso based on different combinations of four major bands zzso zzso 540 and 800 zzso obtained by zzso chain reaction zzso zzso using the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify specific zzso able to amplify these zzso A modified zzso sequencing strategy was adopted to overcome the limitations of using zzso as a single cycle sequencing zzso The original bands, made up of zzso with two terminal zzso zzso were zzso with five restriction zzso zzso products yielding two or three fragments were zzso Each zzso was expected to have no more than one terminal zzso zzso making cycle sequencing zzso zzso were zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso New zzso specific for each of the four major bands were then designed and the remaining regions were zzso using both zzso bands and zzso products as zzso These zzso were used to amplify the zzso DNA of 12 zzso zzso strains and five strains of other zzso zzso The new zzso used as separate pairs or in a mixture of all pairs, amplified the expected bands only in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming the species specificity of the bands selected for molecular typing of this zzso
