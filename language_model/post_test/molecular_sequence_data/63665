The zzso zzso zzso encodes four clusters of genes expressed immediately after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The general function of these genes is associated with zzso of cellular mechanisms of zzso zzso Although several biological processes have been mapped onto specific gene products, the knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their activity remains zzso Here, we report the application of protein structure prediction methods in assigning the function to a zzso domain zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso The discerned similarity clearly points out that this domain represents a novel type of a major zzso complex zzso zzso and consequently may play a central role in an additional mechanism of escape from zzso zzso
