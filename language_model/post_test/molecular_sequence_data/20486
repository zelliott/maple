The zzso protein responds to cellular stress and regulates genes involved in cell cycle, zzso and DNA zzso Under normal conditions, zzso levels are kept low through zzso zzso and zzso zzso In search for novel proteins that participate in this regulatory loop, we performed an zzso zzso pull-down zzso and mass zzso to screen for potential interacting partners of zzso We identified zzso protein zzso zzso whose interaction with zzso and notably zzso was further established by His and zzso pull-down zzso zzso resonance energy transfer and an in zzso proximity zzso zzso Additionally, in cells exposed to zzso stress, zzso levels increased slightly over zzso whereas zzso levels declined after zzso exposure, but rose over the next zzso of zzso zzso in cells exposed to zzso stress and harboring zzso to zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso levels and loss of the zzso zzso zzso domain possessed by zzso were zzso DNA pull-down zzso using a zzso duplex zzso as a zzso found that zzso acted as a scaffold for the additional binding of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso interacts with important proteins involved in maintaining zzso zzso
