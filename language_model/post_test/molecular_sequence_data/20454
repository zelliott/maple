Application of trans protein zzso has been limited both by zzso problems and by the zzso of native zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Here, we report two simple methods for overcoming these problems and increasing the yield and activity of the spliced zzso First, low zzso was alleviated by adding zzso to the reaction buffer and zzso the zzso reaction zzso The protocol was demonstrated in the context of a Green Fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and the final yield was increased by zzso compared to control experiments performed under the same conditions but without addition of zzso Second, the zzso of zzso was overcome by zzso instead of zzso a minimal number of zzso in the target protein to zzso acids required for the zzso zzso We identified optimal zzso sites that conserve as much as possible the prerequisite zzso As a result, the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso to the reportedly minimal required zzso zzso zzso spliced using this strategy had no zzso zzso and a zzso activity six times stronger than a control zzso with five zzso inserted at the zzso site zzso zzso In principle, the present protocol zzso can be applied to any target zzso even when no sequence similarity to zzso is present, though it will introduce up to five zzso at the zzso zzso
