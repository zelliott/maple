A gene zzso a putative zzso zzso factor 3 zzso on the zzso of Chlorella virus zzso has been cloned and zzso It encodes for a predicted zzso of 1120 zzso acids zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The overall zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso identity and zzso similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including two sets of zzso motifs were extremely well zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso identity and zzso similarity in total zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the zzso gene was transcribed in the host cells early, at 20 zzso zzso zzso as well as late, zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analyses with zzso zzso detected the 120 zzso zzso protein product after 40 zzso zzso It was present until the final stages of infection but absent in the zzso The zzso gene was highly zzso among all Chlorella viruses isolated in zzso
