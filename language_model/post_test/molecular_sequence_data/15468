A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from a zzso egg mass that was sampled in a waste stabilization pond in northern zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that the isolate should be placed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strain zzso and the type strains of recognized zzso species were zzso % or zzso The dominant cellular fatty acids of strain zzso were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso which are typical of members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso degrees C, in the presence of zzso % zzso and at pH zzso zzso zzso acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso acid in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso system consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The novel isolate was able to grow in medium containing 18 zzso zzso On the basis of zzso properties and zzso zzso strain zzso is considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
