DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso fragment, which is located upstream of zzso in zzso zzso zzso region A, revealed the presence of ten open reading zzso With the exception of zzso and zzso which zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso the deduced products of these coding regions exhibited no significant zzso to known zzso Analysis of defined zzso and deletion zzso demonstrated that six of these genes were required for nitrogen zzso zzso we propose to call these genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso nitrogen zzso Secondary structure predictions suggested that the zzso genes zzso four potential membrane proteins and two putative zzso zzso which contain zzso motifs zzso typical for zzso zzso zzso of the in zzso and in zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso suggested that the products zzso by these genes are involved in electron transport to zzso In addition, these zzso were shown to contain significantly reduced amounts of zzso The hypothesis that this new class of nitrogen fixation genes encodes components of an electron transfer system to zzso was zzso by zzso the effect of zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso had higher growth yields in the presence of zzso than the wild type, suggesting that these zzso contained lower amounts of reduced zzso
