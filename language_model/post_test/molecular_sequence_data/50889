zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso with tumor but not normal adult zzso offer great potential for diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso Two targets for specific zzso zzso were chosen for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity of isolated zzso zzso was determined with zzso defined zzso zzso All zzso are zzso zzso of 14 zzso specimens and 31 frozen sections of primary zzso zzso revealed zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which exhibit a restricted zzso expression pattern and are not zzso in adult human brain, are present in zzso primary zzso zzso and in zzso human zzso zzso as detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the second target, have unique zzso acid spans resulting from gene deletion in the amplified zzso gene present in zzso of zzso human zzso zzso against zzso zzso Type III show highly restricted activity with a subset of zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso These zzso should be useful for in zzso and in zzso diagnosis and, zzso for treatment of zzso brain zzso
