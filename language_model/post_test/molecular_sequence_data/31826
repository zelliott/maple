zzso of zzso zzso function has emerged as a crucial mechanism in the control of zzso trafficking processes in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso exchange factor for zzso zzso interacting protein zzso zzso a protein that has previously be shown to act as a zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso for zzso zzso and zzso is also a binding partner for zzso and zzso but not the closely related zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso and zzso shift zzso distribution from the zzso onto zzso We find that the zzso region of zzso lies within its zzso a region distinct from its zzso domain and zzso zzso Finally, we describe a zzso deletion zzso zzso that is deficient in zzso zzso These data identify zzso as a dual zzso protein that could potentially link zzso and zzso and/or zzso and zzso zzso trafficking zzso
