zzso zzso zzso produces zzso required for growth, but it also responds to external zzso signals from alfalfa plants through the zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso increases zzso zzso extends stationary phase in the presence of zzso and zzso competitive growth in the presence of zzso New data supporting the relevance of this gene to zzso interactions show that a zzso reporter fusion is expressed by bacteria on plant roots, by bacteria in alfalfa root zzso and more generally by any zzso bacterial cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected at 50 zzso zzso and a zzso induction was measured in zzso cells with 1 zzso zzso A positive zzso of zzso is suggested by the fact that, in the presence of 10 zzso zzso a zzso fusion in zzso cells was transcribed at more than twice the rate of the same reporter fusion in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of primer extension products and expression studies with three different zzso promoter zzso defined major characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli resulted in the production of a zzso zzso protein with characteristics of an zzso zzso Those traits included a deduced zzso acid sequence containing possible zzso zzso structures and three zzso motifs upstream from the zzso zzso A regulatory role for zzso protein was supported by tests showing that a zzso DNA zzso containing the zzso promoter altered the zzso mobility of zzso zzso and of a corresponding band in protein extracts from zzso zzso zzso The absence in zzso of any significant zzso to known zzso acid sequences was consistent with the fact that DNA zzso tests with seven zzso of bacteria detected zzso only in zzso
