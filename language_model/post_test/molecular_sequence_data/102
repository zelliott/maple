zzso or zzso of myostatin in zzso has been demonstrated to markedly increase muscle mass by zzso zzso or a combination of zzso Despite a remarkably high degree of conservation with the zzso zzso the function of myostatin remains unknown in fish, many species of which continue muscle growth throughout the zzso by zzso zzso rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the more zzso zzso of myostatin, were produced to investigate the effect of this protein on muscle development and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in muscle tissue exhibited increased zzso and zzso zzso similar to that observed in zzso cattle and myostatin zzso zzso The zzso zzso generated a zzso reminiscent of well-developed zzso zzso and zzso muscles in humans and was dubbed zzso zzso Body zzso of the transgenic animals was markedly altered, as measured by condition factor, and total muscle surface area zzso The increased zzso was due almost exclusively to zzso as evidenced by a higher number of fibers per unit area and increases in the percentage of smaller fibers and the number of total zzso In several individuals, zzso zzso was observed, but no changes in mobility or behavior of zzso fish were zzso The findings indicate that zzso of zzso in trout, a species with indeterminate growth rate, enhances muscle zzso It remains to be determined whether the double zzso in trout is due to zzso of myostatin, other growth factors, or zzso
