We report the identification and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso 139 required for zzso zzso zzso This report is the first genetic work on zzso production in zzso To investigate the gene cluster involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed to zzso chain reaction amplify an internal zzso of the zzso zzso gene that zzso the first step in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso library of zzso zzso 139 with this zzso chain reaction product as probe allowed the isolation of a zzso gene cluster containing 22 open reading frames similar to zzso zzso genes of other bacterial zzso zzso of the zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso 139 to generate zzso zzso
