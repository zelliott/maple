zzso of additional zzso to outer membrane proteins can lead to display of the hybrid protein on the bacterial outer zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso and forms zzso pores which function in zzso of zzso and zzso through the zzso zzso is present in all zzso zzso 01 and zzso zzso Each zzso zzso the membrane 18 times and has thus 9 zzso facing the outside zzso We have developed an zzso based system where foreign zzso can be inserted in one of its surface accessible zzso leading to production of a hybrid protein which still has the normal zzso folding and zzso The zzso peptides tested as zzso hybrids include the zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso These hybrids can be detected with zzso zzso on the bacterial cell zzso zzso hybrid proteins carrying 38, 76 or 115 zzso of the zzso binding zzso repeats of zzso of zzso zzso have been tested for binding zzso
