During in zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso express 3 classes of zzso zzso the major surface zzso zzso zzso that can be distinguished by their unique 3' untranslated zzso Here we show that the three classes zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by a family of at least 4 tandem stationary genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by twelve or more zzso genes zzso zzso one zzso gene zzso and a final stationary gene zzso Some of the stationary genes can be distinguished from each other by groups of zzso differences within the coding regions that result in localized zzso acid zzso Northern blots confirm that zzso from the individual stationary genes are present in zzso but not zzso phase zzso Western blots using zzso directed against synthetic peptides indicate that zzso zzso zzso proteins are expressed in zzso zzso zzso A zzso region upstream of all three zzso gene classes is zzso except for a variable number of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso coding regions are highly zzso zzso sequences that include the 3' untranslated regions and extend past the zzso site for 65 zzso zzso 345 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These sequence features zzso the zzso coding regions are likely important in the growth zzso expression of the three zzso zzso zzso
