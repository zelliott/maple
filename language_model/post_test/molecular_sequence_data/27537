The early retinal genes zzso zzso eyes absent zzso and sine zzso zzso are key regulators of adult eye development in zzso zzso data zzso zzso of all three zzso factor genes in zzso eye zzso However, functional confirmation has thus far only been reported for so zzso We therefore investigated expression and function of these genes in the red flour zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso so and zzso are essential for both zzso and adult eye zzso Moreover, widespread zzso and indistinguishable zzso zzso suggests zzso interaction with so in many zzso zzso zzso by contrast, zzso with zzso and so only in select zzso which, however, includes the zzso of zzso and adult zzso zzso zzso zzso has no zzso effect on zzso eye development and causes strong but incomplete adult eye zzso In a parallel study, we show that zzso is essential for adult eye development in combination with the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and twin of zzso zzso Taken together, our data reveal conservation but also evolutionary plasticity of the zzso retinal determination gene network in zzso
