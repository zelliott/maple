zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso releasing zzso We present the X-ray structure at zzso resolution of zzso from zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso family 32, solved by single zzso replacement with the anomalous scattering method using the zzso sites derived from a quick zzso zzso The zzso structure of this zzso folds into two zzso the zzso zzso domain of an unusual zzso zzso fold and the zzso domain folded into a zzso zzso Its structural architecture is very similar to that of another member of zzso zzso family 32, zzso zzso from zzso zzso determined recently by X-ray zzso The zzso is a zzso containing five zzso zzso Two crystal forms obtained under similar zzso conditions differ by the degree of protein zzso The X-ray structure of the zzso complex, at a resolution of zzso reveals two zzso important zzso zzso and zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The distance between the zzso of these zzso is consistent with a double displacement mechanism of zzso zzso which is part of the zzso zzso provides hydrogen bonds important for zzso zzso
