With zzso zzso gel zzso analysis, two bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso region zzso zzso and zzso were detected in association with the crushed spores of the zzso zzso fungus zzso margarita zzso Becker & zzso Hall 1976 zzso DNA sequencing and zzso analysis revealed that zzso was mostly related to the documented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso margarita, but zzso could not be confidently assigned to a known zzso Further characterization of zzso was conducted by obtaining its almost complete zzso zzso gene sequence via zzso amplification and zzso zzso search indicates that the zzso zzso gene sequence did not match any identified species sequences in the zzso zzso Further detection revealed that zzso was also associated with the clean zzso margarita zzso spores that were obtained by the zzso method or dual culture with zzso zzso transformed carrot zzso Many zzso or zzso zzso organisms were clustered in layer 3 of the zzso spore wall by transmission electron zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso represents a novel bacterial population associated with zzso margarita zzso spores, and its doubtless location zzso or zzso remains unclear based on the present zzso
