zzso a zzso protein structurally related to the large family of zzso carriers, was isolated from the rat zzso In the present study, zzso the zzso of zzso was isolated from human zzso zzso zzso of their respective zzso sequences revealed a zzso conservation between zzso and zzso zzso mapping with human zzso radiation hybrids allowed the location of the gene coding for zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso on a portion of zzso zzso which spans over 7 zzso or 118 zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso ( approximately zzso zzso is expressed in the human brain but not in peripheral zzso The zzso of zzso was determined with zzso raised against the zzso of zzso zzso is concentrated in the cerebral cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appearing as a diffuse or a zzso labeling at the light microscope zzso This regional and cellular distribution suggests that zzso as its rat zzso could be present in zzso terminals of zzso zzso The high pressure of selection exerted upon this zzso its strategic anatomical and zzso zzso suggest that this orphan zzso could be involved in critical functions in the central nervous zzso
