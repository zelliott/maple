A strictly zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from the production water of the zzso zzso zzso The cells were zzso rods zzso zzso that stained zzso and possessed polar zzso zzso zzso obtained energy from the reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso sulfur and zzso zzso in the presence of a wide range of electron donors, including a variety of organic zzso zzso biological extracts and zzso zzso zzso was incapable of zzso zzso The novel isolate grew zzso at 40 degrees C zzso range for growth, zzso degrees zzso and at pH 7 zzso range, zzso with 2 % zzso zzso zzso range, zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso was a member of the order zzso within the class zzso and most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and zzso differences, the novel strain is proposed to represent a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
