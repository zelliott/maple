The preparation and melting of a 16 zzso duplex DNA linked on both ends by zzso zzso chains is zzso zzso vs temperature zzso zzso melting zzso were measured for the zzso zzso and the same duplex zzso linked on the ends instead by T4 zzso zzso melting zzso of both molecules were measured in 25, 55, and 85 zzso zzso and revealed, regardless of zzso the duplex linked by zzso zzso is more stable by at least 6 degrees C than the same duplex linked by T4 zzso Experimental zzso in each salt environment were analyzed in terms of the two-state and multistate theoretical zzso In the zzso or zzso zzso analysis, the melting transition is assumed to occur in an zzso zzso Thus, the only possible states accessible to the zzso throughout the melting transition are the completely intact duplex and the completely melted duplex or zzso In the multistate analysis no assumptions regarding the melting transition are required and the statistical occurrence of every possible partially melted state of the duplex is explicitly zzso zzso of the analysis revealed the melting transitions of both the zzso zzso and the zzso with T4 end zzso are essentially two state in 25 and 55 zzso zzso In contrast, significant zzso from two-state behavior were observed in 85 zzso zzso From our previously published melting data of DNA zzso with zzso end zzso where zzso zzso 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso and the zzso with T4 end zzso of this study, a plot of zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso of this data to zzso zzso 1 zzso with the value of d zzso zzso zzso obtained for the zzso zzso suggesting the zzso stability of the zzso zzso behaves as though the duplex of this zzso were linked by end zzso comprised of a single T zzso
