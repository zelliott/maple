The zzso family zzso is an enigmatic zzso of uncertain limits and uncertain zzso Various zzso hypotheses have been proposed for the family, but these hypotheses have never been tested with a robust zzso zzso The existence of similar zzso and New World zzso the possibility of zzso convergence associated with extreme zzso and the apparent paucity of zzso zzso characters, have all clouded generic relationships in this zzso We used fragments from two nuclear zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso to test the zzso and zzso position of the zzso The analyses incorporated 50 zzso zzso species, including 23 zzso species and representatives from 14 other zzso zzso zzso zzso secondary structures were zzso for the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso II of the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a new zzso spider, together with notes on zzso remains from a recently discovered cave in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These secondary structures were used to guide multiple sequence zzso and determine the position and nature of zzso in different zzso Secondary structure information was also incorporated into a structurally zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso zzso using a zzso model of zzso zzso This structurally zzso zzso analysis provided a less resolved but more conservative and zzso estimate of zzso than an otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso With the exception of the Chilean species zzso zzso zzso zzso Forster, zzso zzso On zzso an American zzso of the zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the family zzso was found to be zzso with three zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso never grouped with the other zzso zzso and could not be assigned to any family group with zzso
