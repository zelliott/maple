Fifteen sequences belonging to the Chinese zzso zzso were isolated from a library of sequences zzso binding to the nuclear zzso zzso attachment regions, zzso zzso and zzso Fourteen of the 15 sequences zzso zzso bound to the nuclear zzso with affinities zzso times higher than those of control DNA fragments containing no zzso One clone displayed a considerable zzso to the zzso region of the mouse LINE zzso Such zzso within LINE repeats may considerably alter the activities of some genes and the zzso status of zzso zzso upon the LINE repeat propagation in the zzso over the course of zzso
