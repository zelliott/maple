zzso has been implicated in the zzso of neurodegenerative zzso Several zzso zzso zzso located in two separate zzso blocks of zzso have shown associations with zzso disease zzso and Parkinson's disease, but zzso zzso have not been zzso One zzso zzso was located in a highly zzso 233 zzso region of zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is located in an alternative zzso we performed zzso from zzso 3 and discovered multiple new transcripts that initiated from a common novel promoter located 587 zzso upstream of zzso 2, but did not contain the zzso region harboring zzso Using real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso protection zzso and northern zzso we show that the majority of these transcripts are brain specific and are at least equally or perhaps more abundant than the reference sequence zzso transcripts in whole zzso Two main transcripts containing independent zzso start zzso zzso full-length zzso zzso proteins that differ only at their zzso zzso from zzso zzso by the reference zzso Additional truncated zzso containing these zzso that are similar to zzso zzso Other transcripts may zzso potential dominant negative forms, as they are predicted to lack the second zzso motif that serves as an interaction site for several nuclear zzso Furthermore, we show that the new promoter is active in zzso cell lines and describe zzso encompassing this region that are associated with HD age of zzso The discovery of such a large zzso zzso locus and multiple zzso in brain warrants further functional studies and may provide new zzso targets for treating neurodegenerative zzso
