zzso regions are usually less subject to natural selection than coding regions and so may be more useful for studying human zzso The recent surveys of worldwide DNA variation in four zzso zzso regions revealed many interesting but also some zzso zzso Here we studied another zzso zzso region, which is in zzso zzso zzso zzso were found among the 122 worldwide human zzso resulting in 46 zzso from which 48 zzso were zzso The distribution patterns of DNA variation, zzso and zzso suggest rapid population expansion in relatively recent zzso The levels of zzso within human populations and divergence between humans and chimpanzees at this locus were generally similar to those for the other four zzso zzso zzso and zzso tests rejected the neutrality assumption in the total sample and in the African sample but zzso test did not reject zzso A detailed examination of the contributions of various types of zzso to the parameters used in the neutrality tests clarified the zzso between these test zzso The age estimates suggest a relatively young history in this zzso Combining three zzso zzso regions, we estimated the long-term effective population size of humans to be 11,000 zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and the age of the most recent common zzso to be zzso zzso zzso years zzso
