In an effort to isolate genes that change expression at the zzso level during treatment of zzso zzso zzso with zzso we performed a differential display zzso Here, we report the isolation of a zzso clone corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso species that is reduced in zzso after culture with zzso zzso analysis revealed the 211 zzso length zzso clone to be identical to the zzso 125 zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was confirmed by Northern zzso analysis as well as competitive zzso zzso express 1 zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 50% as compared to zzso Our results add a new finding to the zzso functions described for zzso in zzso zzso
