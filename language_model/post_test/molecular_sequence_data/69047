zzso modeled on a proposed zzso domain in the zzso region of the zzso group I zzso have been characterized by zzso The zzso data indicate that zzso zzso in this domain are in the minor groove of an adjacent zzso within hydrogen bonding distance of zzso groups in an interaction we term a zzso zzso zzso containing the two most frequently occurring sequences among group I zzso in the zzso region formed zzso zzso in the minor groove, whereas zzso containing sequences which are not zzso did not form zzso Surprisingly, the structures of the zzso zzso in the zzso containing the two most frequently occurring sequences are zzso If this difference were maintained in the context of the whole zzso it would suggest that the zzso are not directly involved in zzso but rather that the zzso zzso function by aligning the zzso zzso within the zzso core of the zzso
