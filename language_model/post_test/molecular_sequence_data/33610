zzso zzso is a key player in the regulation of zzso II zzso zzso zzso was considered as a highly zzso zzso zzso The discovery of poorly zzso zzso in several insects and zzso however, implies a much earlier evolutionary zzso The mechanism of zzso function requires interaction with the proteins zzso and zzso protein zzso Here, we present a comprehensive zzso analysis of these two proteins in zzso and we extend the collection of zzso zzso by several additional zzso In particular, we describe zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we derive an improved secondary structure model of zzso zzso which shows that the structure is quite zzso across animal zzso despite the extreme divergence at sequence zzso
