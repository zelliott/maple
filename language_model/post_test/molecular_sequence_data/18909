zzso zzso and zzso were studied zzso in an emergent outbreak of beak and feather disease virus zzso infection in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso health monitoring and the small population size zzso zzso of this critically endangered bird provided an opportunity to zzso track viral replication and zzso events occurring in a zzso zzso DNA virus over a period of four years within a novel bottleneck zzso zzso zzso was used with different combinations of zzso primer walking, direct zzso sequencing and sequencing of cloned zzso to analyze zzso zzso zzso Analysis of complete viral zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences zzso revealed that the outbreak was associated with zzso in functionally important regions of the normally zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso gene with a high evolutionary rate zzso zzso approaching that for zzso zzso simultaneously we observed significant evidence of zzso hotspots between two distinct zzso zzso within zzso parrots indicating early zzso of zzso in the zzso Multiple zzso zzso were also demonstrated with at least 13 zzso zzso identified in four different individual birds, with one containing up to seven genetic zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso was also zzso Our findings suggest that the high degree of genetic variation within the zzso species as a whole is reflected in evolutionary dynamics within individually infected birds as zzso variation, particularly when zzso jumps from one host species to zzso
