Four of 15 zzso human zzso zzso factors zzso derived from zzso B cells of patients with zzso arthritis showed positive zzso reactions with human beta zzso These findings were different from those previously noted using zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso or the zzso components of mixed zzso and resembled the zzso 2 zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with overlapping zzso of beta zzso sequence indicated major regions of positive zzso at positions zzso and zzso which were maintained in the presence of high salt zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution of each zzso within zzso beta zzso regions indicated that zzso at position 60 and 95, zzso at 58, zzso at 62, zzso at 93 and zzso at 97 constituted important single zzso acids for the zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso restricted human zzso zzso derived from diseased zzso of patients with zzso show zzso zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso from the same zzso This particular fine specificity is not present in zzso zzso derived from patients with zzso or mixed zzso showing zzso zzso
