zzso nuclear zzso of zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso is required for the zzso of downstream target genes zzso the zzso of immune and inflammatory zzso To inhibit this zzso signaling to the nucleus, we designed a zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso motif and a zzso form of the nuclear zzso sequence for the zzso zzso of zzso When delivered into cultured zzso treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was a more efficient inhibitor of zzso nuclear import than its linear zzso When delivered into mice challenged with zzso zzso zzso blocked the production of zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha and zzso zzso and significantly reduced the zzso associated with ensuing zzso zzso Based on specificity studies conducted with a zzso form of zzso a functional nuclear zzso motif is required for this protective zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrate effective targeting of a zzso zzso that zzso zzso signaling in zzso This new class of biological response zzso may be zzso to the control of systemic inflammatory zzso
