A zzso of the plasma zzso inhibitor alpha zzso zzso zzso is usually a consequence of the zzso zzso zzso is another zzso zzso which, like Z alpha zzso is associated with zzso inclusions and impaired zzso We report here the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso deletion coding for one of two adjacent zzso zzso zzso acid 51 or 52 of the mature zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso chain zzso DNA, we have demonstrated zzso of the zzso zzso protein and the zzso deletion in the family in which this zzso was originally described and in three other, unrelated zzso This deletion is found exclusively in zzso zzso zzso and not in the normal zzso zzso from which, to judge on the basis of zzso data, the zzso zzso must have been zzso In zzso zzso focusing zzso gels, the zzso point of zzso is only slightly more zzso than zzso a finding consistent with the loss of a single zzso zzso zzso To judge on the basis of X-ray zzso data for the normal alpha zzso zzso the deletion of zzso zzso would shorten one strand of the beta sheet, zzso apparently preventing normal processing and zzso
