Since zzso is the only zzso zzso for the NO zzso reaction, regulation of zzso availability could determine the cellular rate of NO zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso treatment in zzso would alter tissue expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the net action of which is to convert zzso to zzso zzso with the induction of NO zzso zzso injection of zzso into the rats zzso an increase in AS and zzso zzso levels in the zzso In contrast with modest increases in the abundance of AS and zzso zzso in lung and heart, a marked increase in levels of AS and zzso zzso in the kidney zzso The liver, whether or not treated with zzso contained high levels of zzso for AS and zzso which are components of the zzso zzso zzso suggest that an increase in the zzso capacity to convert zzso to zzso could play a key role in NO formation in zzso when zzso becomes zzso
