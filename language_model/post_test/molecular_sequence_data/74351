zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has several zzso types, which are controlled by zzso multiple zzso at a single zzso Of these types, zzso and zzso are zzso types, and there are nine differences in zzso acids between zzso and zzso Recently, an intermediate transitional type zzso between them was zzso However, other transitional types have not been detected despite surveys of many cultivated and wild zzso One of the reasons why other transitional zzso have not been found is zzso to be due to the difficulty of the detection of zzso protein zzso by zzso gel zzso zzso To detect novel zzso of zzso zzso sequence analysis in addition to PAGE was carried zzso Four new zzso were found from many Japanese wild zzso Of these zzso three zzso as zzso zzso zzso were detected through gene sequence analysis on wild soybeans having the same zzso mobility as zzso and one zzso was detected through zzso The zzso zzso showed a slightly lower zzso mobility than zzso The zzso sequences of zzso were identical to those of zzso except for one zzso transitional zzso at position zzso The sequences of zzso and zzso genes were identical to those of zzso with the exception of a zzso zzso at position zzso and a zzso zzso at zzso zzso The sequence of zzso differed from zzso by three zzso zzso at position zzso zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso Of the three zzso changes, two were common to zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso is an intermediate transitional type between zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso type has been differentiated through a series of zzso from zzso before the zzso of cultivated zzso
