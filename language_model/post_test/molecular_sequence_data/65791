We have described an zzso against zzso zzso a region of zzso zzso zzso that is zzso It zzso zzso fragmentation in the absence of complement via zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to release zzso oxygen species, which destroy zzso To study the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso we screened a human single chain zzso zzso library with the zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso were identified that were capable of binding to zzso Surprisingly, binding zzso for zzso did not correlate with activity of induction of zzso zzso We therefore investigated the requirements for zzso zzso zzso were introduced into the heavy chain zzso zzso of clones 11, 43, and 54 by zzso zzso The capability of these clones to induce zzso fragmentation or bind to zzso subsequently zzso zzso modeling of these clones with their zzso revealed that the ability to induce zzso fragmentation is affected by the side chain orientation of positively charged zzso acids in the heavy chain of zzso zzso Thus, a structural change in the zzso of zzso zzso contributes to its binding to the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso fragmentation and zzso zzso
