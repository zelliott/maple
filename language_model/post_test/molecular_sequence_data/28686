The zzso zzso is essential for production of a plethora of aromatic compounds in plants, bacteria, and zzso Seven zzso of the zzso zzso catalyze sequential conversion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso is then used as a zzso for other pathways that culminate in production of zzso zzso zzso and the aromatic zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso is absent from animals and present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso is effective in controlling growth of these zzso These findings emphasize the potential benefits of developing additional effective zzso of the zzso zzso Such zzso may function as zzso zzso agents that are effective against bacterial and zzso pathogens and zzso zzso
