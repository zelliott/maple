zzso of the water supply by zzso often causes outbreaks of zzso and zzso The goals of the present study was to investigate the level of zzso and zzso zzso in wastewater from wastewater treatment plants in zzso China, and to understand the endemic transmission characteristics of zzso and zzso Forty-eight domestic wastewater specimens from the two wastewater treatment plants in zzso City were collected from April 2009 to March zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In total, 15 wastewater specimens were zzso positive for zzso and 23 were zzso positive for zzso zzso The prevalence of contamination with zzso zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso zzso identification showed the presence of two zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso and one belonging to zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso (18 belonging to zzso zzso and six belonging to zzso zzso In addition, eight specimens contained both zzso and zzso zzso and one zzso contained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggested humans might be the primary source of zzso zzso contamination in wastewater in the studied zzso In contrast, a low prevalence of zzso zzso suggested a reduced risk of human zzso caused by zzso zzso via zzso zzso This work provides basic experimental data needed for local wastewater treatment plants to develop protective strategies for water safety and to eliminate zzso zzso
