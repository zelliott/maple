We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso and show that it encodes zzso 2 zzso of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S zzso zzso is an essential zzso and we show that loss of this zzso causes cells to arrest in zzso illustrating the importance of zzso for zzso The zzso protein is zzso identical to zzso of the human 26 S zzso and the lethal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can be rescued by the human zzso zzso zzso We provide genetic and physical evidence to suggest that the zzso protein interacts with the product of the zzso zzso an zzso which has previously been shown to be zzso 4 of the 26 S zzso
