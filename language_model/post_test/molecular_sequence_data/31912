Many zzso bacteria deliver their zzso factors into host cells through a zzso zzso Those factors, called zzso zzso are involved in the zzso in host cells by interfering with various cellular zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso uses a type III zzso system to inject its zzso but the functional roles of these proteins remain largely zzso Here, we determined a crystal structure of zzso an zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and performed a functional zzso We determined that zzso is similar in sequence to zzso outer protein zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso is zzso to that of zzso including a zzso site, but differs in its zzso state and active site zzso Further analysis indicated that zzso zzso commonly found in zzso adjacent to the active site loop are replaced in zzso with a short loop, causing the active site loop to adopt a zzso distinct from that of zzso Thus, the zzso zzso emanating from the respective active site loop of zzso are absent in the putative active site of zzso zzso with these structural features, a functional zzso indicated that zzso does not exhibit zzso activity and possibly zzso yet unknown zzso
