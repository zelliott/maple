The zzso protein expressed by zzso cells can evoke an zzso zzso zzso response in both animal studies and zzso zzso However, the locations within the zzso protein of the immune zzso remains zzso In this study, we determined the nature of any immune responses generated by peptides corresponding to the zzso region 1 zzso and zzso region 2 zzso sequences of zzso heavy chain variable region zzso to identify the clinical potential of the peptides for zzso of zzso We found that a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso sequence contains a functional zzso zzso able to evoke a major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso response and zzso release without direct zzso for zzso target or fresh zzso zzso zzso Although a zzso corresponding to zzso was able to generate zzso class I and class II dependent zzso zzso responses and zzso release, zzso zzso within the zzso were cryptic in the context of intact zzso zzso Our results therefore suggest that the zzso sequence could be used for the immune targeting of zzso
