A fascinating question in biology is how molecular changes in zzso pathways lead to zzso changes in zzso zzso in zzso zzso genes have long been suggested as potential causes of zzso evolution, and there is abundant evidence that some changes in zzso expression patterns correlate with transitions in animal zzso zzso A major zzso transition in zzso occurred about 400 million years ago, when zzso insects zzso from zzso zzso ancestors with multiple zzso In zzso zzso and other insects, the zzso zzso and abdominal A zzso also zzso zzso proteins are expressed largely in the abdominal zzso where they can suppress zzso leg development during zzso In a zzso zzso zzso proteins are expressed in both zzso and abdomen, including the limb zzso but do not repress zzso Previous studies led us to propose that gain and loss of zzso zzso and repression functions in zzso proteins was a plausible mechanism to diversify zzso during animal zzso Here we show that naturally selected zzso of the zzso protein is linked to the evolutionary transition to zzso limb zzso
