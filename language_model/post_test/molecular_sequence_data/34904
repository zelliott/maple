The crystal structure of zzso the putative zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was determined in a zzso zzso The crystal belongs to the zzso space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, beta zzso zzso zzso The structure was solved by the zzso anomalous zzso method at zzso A and refined to an R factor of zzso zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure includes two protein molecules in the zzso zzso Each zzso consists of eight zzso and seven zzso A zzso search revealed similarity between the zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and putative zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
