A molecular marker for germ cells of the giant freshwater zzso zzso zzso was zzso A zzso zzso zzso from the zzso was isolated and characterized by a reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso A full-length sequence was obtained by the rapid amplification of zzso end zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence revealed that zzso comprises zzso zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains four zzso motifs and eight zzso motifs belonging to the zzso protein zzso The zzso sequence shows high similarity to zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the adult zzso the zzso transcripts were specifically detected in the germ zzso In zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was also detected in the zzso of mature zzso In the zzso the zzso transcript was detected in the zzso of zzso and primary zzso but was detected in the zzso of secondary zzso and zzso zzso similarity and specific zzso in the germ cells suggest that zzso is the prawn zzso zzso of the zzso gene and can be used as a molecular marker for prawn germ zzso
