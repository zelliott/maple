In zzso zzso and translation reactions have become popular for a bottom-up approach to synthetic zzso zzso of the zzso intermediate are rarely determined, although knowledge of synthesis and degradation rates could facilitate rational engineering of in zzso zzso We designed zzso zzso to measure zzso dynamics during zzso protein synthesis by zzso resonance energy zzso We tested different zzso zzso and show that the location and sequence environment of the probe target sites are important parameters for probe association zzso and output zzso Best suited for sensitive real-time zzso of zzso was a target site located in the 3' untranslated region, which we designed to reduce secondary zzso We used this zzso pair to refine our knowledge of zzso dynamics in the commercially available zzso zzso protein synthesis system and characterized the effect of zzso zzso on zzso synthesis rates from a zzso zzso
