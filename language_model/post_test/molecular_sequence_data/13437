We investigated zzso within the presumed zzso zzso domain of the DNA zzso from zzso zzso virus type zzso The zzso sites zzso to zzso in DNA zzso I zzso zzso which bind two metal zzso that are required for zzso zzso To evaluate the effect of the zzso zzso on zzso activity, we zzso the zzso DNA zzso and one zzso zzso using a zzso expression zzso Both proteins exhibited DNA zzso activity after partial zzso but the zzso protein was drastically deficient in zzso zzso This finding suggests that the zzso zzso may zzso the same zzso mechanism employed by DNA zzso zzso We also attempted to transfer each of the zzso into the zzso zzso using a marker rescue zzso Although zzso sequences could be transferred zzso zzso viruses carrying zzso sequences were not zzso We discuss the possibility that the zzso are lethal and suggest mechanisms by which a zzso in zzso zzso might cause loss of zzso
