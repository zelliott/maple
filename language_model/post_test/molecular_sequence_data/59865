zzso of zzso zzso zzso involves the processing of zzso by limited zzso To study the processing mechanism we zzso different point zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso Here we show that the presence of the intact zzso consensus motif and zzso are essential for correct zzso zzso of zzso the active site zzso in mature zzso or of zzso results in complete zzso of processing at the consensus zzso In addition, zzso processing in zzso of zzso zzso incorporated in immature zzso precursor complexes, can be blocked by a zzso zzso While the processing of zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso the zzso zzso of zzso results in processing zzso carrying an extension of 8-10 zzso preceding zzso suggesting an additional zzso event within the zzso Furthermore, exchange of zzso zzso interferes with processing efficiency and suggests zzso zzso Based on our data we propose a model for zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso zzso serves as zzso and zzso as zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso processing of zzso zzso proceeds via a novel ordered zzso mechanism involving zzso
