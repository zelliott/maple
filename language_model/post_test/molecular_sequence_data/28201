We have studied the binding of the zzso protein to an 18 base pair zzso promoter sequence zzso the core of the zzso recognition zzso zzso binding of this sequence was established by competition binding zzso and comparison of the relative affinities of a number of zzso promoter, zzso operator, and unspecific sequences of different zzso The effect of the binding of zzso to the 18 base pair promoter sequence and, for comparison, to an 18 base pair zzso operator and an zzso of unrelated sequence have been studied by zzso zzso zzso of zzso does not bring about any changes in the chemical shift values of the zzso zzso zzso of the DNA, but causes the selective line broadening of two of the zzso The comparison of these data with results of gel zzso zzso published previously zzso allows the identification and zzso of a zzso induced in the DNA by the zzso binding to its specific site on the zzso zzso
