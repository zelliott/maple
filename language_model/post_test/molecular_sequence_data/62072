zzso is the working zzso of the cell, and evolution is the hallmark of zzso It is important to understand how protein folding and evolution influence each zzso Several studies zzso experimental measurement of zzso participation in folding nucleus and sequence conservation have reached different zzso These studies are based on assessment of sequence conservation at folding nucleus sites using zzso or relative zzso measurement derived from multiple sequence zzso Here we report analysis of conservation of folding nucleus using an evolutionary model alternative to zzso zzso We employ a continuous time zzso model of zzso substitution to distinguish zzso fixed by evolution and zzso fixed by zzso This model takes into account bias in zzso frequency, zzso transition over zzso as well as explicit zzso zzso We measure selection pressure using the ratio omega of synonymous versus zzso substitution at individual zzso zzso The zzso are estimated using the zzso method, a zzso zzso Our results show that there is little correlation between the extent of kinetic participation in protein folding nucleus as measured by experimental zzso and selection pressure as measured by zzso In addition, two zzso tests failed to show that folding nucleus zzso are significantly more zzso than the whole zzso or the median omega value of all zzso in the zzso These results suggest that at the level of zzso zzso there is no indication that folding nucleus zzso are significantly more zzso than other zzso We further reconstruct candidate ancestral zzso of the folding nucleus and suggest possible test tube zzso studies for testing folding behavior of ancient folding zzso
