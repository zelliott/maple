zzso production by zzso tissue has been implicated in the zzso of such human zzso as zzso and breast zzso zzso production by zzso cells is subject to complex zzso regulation by a number of growth factors and zzso including those produced by breast cancer zzso In order to understand the mechanisms responsible for zzso regulation, the structural gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from human zzso zzso The gene spans at least 70 zzso and is comprised of 10 zzso the first of which is zzso DNA sequence analysis indicates that the gene has a putative zzso zzso sequence at zzso zzso and putative zzso binding sequences beginning at zzso zzso and zzso zzso that constitute a promoter region responsible for expression in zzso However, this promoter does not appear to be responsible for expression in zzso which may therefore be under the control of another, zzso zzso Use of zzso zzso zzso zzso technology has allowed for determination of expression of zzso in samples of breast zzso zzso results indicate that expression is highest in the upper lateral region, similar to the site of most frequent zzso of zzso
