zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso with zzso acid of the zzso zzso of a number of cellular and viral zzso Most of the in zzso zzso activity zzso in zzso cell zzso of human zzso leukemia zzso zzso and zzso and cervical zzso zzso zzso cells was shown to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso by differential zzso Also found in the zzso zzso was a approximately zzso protein that was specifically zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This approximately zzso protein was stable in the presence of zzso zzso zzso but was gradually converted into a approximately zzso species when stored in the absence of zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso of the zzso fraction resulted in the zzso activity zzso exactly zzso with the 260 zzso zzso profile and exhibiting zzso zzso ratios zzso indicating an association of zzso with putative zzso zzso The zzso targeting of zzso was also examined by zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells zzso with plasmids containing zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding either to the originally assigned zzso gene or to an alternative open reading frame initiated from an zzso start site upstream from the assumed zzso start zzso zzso zzso of cells zzso with a zzso containing the larger insert revealed zzso primarily in the zzso fraction with an apparent molecular mass similar to the approximately zzso native zzso In contrast, zzso of cells zzso with a zzso containing the smaller insert identified a approximately zzso zzso predominantly in the zzso zzso An analysis of zzso of zzso zzso and serial zzso of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the approximately zzso zzso binds zzso with higher affinity than the approximately zzso zzso These in zzso and in zzso zzso targeting and zzso expression experiments identify a native zzso that is zzso zzso larger than the zzso predicted by the originally assigned zzso gene and which is apparently translated from an alternative zzso start zzso The data also indicate that although the unique zzso zzso zzso by this larger open reading frame are not required for in zzso zzso activity, they do provide zzso involved in targeting zzso to the zzso zzso fraction where zzso zzso zzso
