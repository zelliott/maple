We have cloned zzso zzso two zzso of a human novel zzso zzso They zzso sequences of 260 and zzso zzso zzso and both showed significant zzso to mouse zzso Mouse zzso has been reported to be involved in zzso zzso therefore we designated the proteins as type 1 and type 2 zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the two types of human zzso were zzso except that type 2 carried an insert of 45 zzso acids at the zzso of the leader zzso The essential three zzso acids in the active site zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the single putative zzso site were zzso in human and mouse zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso DNA spanning the region zzso the zzso sequence revealed that two zzso were generated in human brain by alternative zzso However, the mouse zzso sequence did not conserve the 3' zzso consensus sequence at the corresponding position, suggesting that type 2 zzso was a zzso zzso zzso When the open reading frames of human zzso were expressed in insect cells, both types of zzso were detected in the zzso media by western zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction showed zzso expression of type 1 zzso in zzso Type 2 zzso was zzso expressed in human adult brain and zzso although both types were expressed in fetal brain and zzso in comparable zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was expressed in various regions of adult brain, including the zzso and cerebral cortex, and also in various fetal zzso These results suggest that human type 2 zzso may be important to the adult brain zzso although both types may be necessary for the development of the nervous zzso
