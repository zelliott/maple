zzso zzso virus zzso and human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso proteins are related regulatory proteins that share several functions, including the ability to zzso class I major zzso complex zzso and zzso expression on the cell surface and to alter zzso signal zzso in T zzso We compared the mechanisms used by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso class I zzso and found that the ability of zzso zzso to zzso class I zzso requires a unique zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is not found in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso motif in zzso zzso unlike in zzso zzso does not affect class I zzso zzso We also found that zzso of class I zzso by zzso zzso requires a zzso zzso in the zzso domain of the class I zzso heavy chain and involves accelerated zzso of class I complexes, as previously found with zzso zzso Thus, while zzso and zzso zzso proteins use a similar mechanism to zzso class I zzso zzso they have evolved different surfaces for molecular interactions with cell factors that regulate class I zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso selectively disrupt class I zzso zzso having no zzso effect on other functions of zzso such as the zzso of zzso and zzso surface zzso the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and the induction of zzso replication from T cells infected in the absence of zzso The resulting zzso will be useful zzso for studying the importance of class I zzso zzso for zzso replication and AIDS zzso in infected zzso zzso
