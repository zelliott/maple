We analyzed plasma zzso from 27 zzso zzso Ugandan zzso Previous zzso analysis of zzso and gag sequences from these samples identified zzso A, C, D, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso were obtained with a commercial zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso sequences differed from gag zzso for 5 of 27 samples, demonstrating a high rate of zzso between the gag and pol zzso zzso and zzso sequences were analyzed for the presence of zzso acid zzso at positions that are sites of previously characterized drug resistance zzso At those sites, frequent zzso were detected at positions 36 and 69 in zzso and positions zzso zzso and 214 in zzso zzso zzso acid motifs were identified in zzso Most of the zzso A sequences had the zzso acids zzso at positions 35, 57, 69, and 89, whereas most zzso D sequences had the zzso acids zzso at those zzso zzso of those zzso may provide a useful approach for rapid identification of zzso A and D zzso in zzso This analysis significantly increases the number of Ugandan zzso and zzso sequences characterized to date and demonstrates successful use of a commercial zzso zzso system for analysis of diverse non-B zzso zzso
