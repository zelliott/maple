zzso zzso zzso is an acute respiratory disease caused by infectious zzso virus zzso The complete zzso sequences of five attenuated zzso vaccine strains and six virulent zzso strains as well as two Australian zzso field strains have been published in Australia and the USA so zzso To provide the complete zzso sequence information of zzso from different geographic regions, the whole zzso of zzso zzso isolated in China was zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and contained 79 zzso Most of the zzso had high sequence identity with zzso zzso of reference zzso There was a large zzso deletion within the zzso region of unique long region zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso Though the origin binding protein of zzso zzso existed, there was no zzso region in strain zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences revealed seven zzso at zzso acids 71 zzso zzso zzso 116 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso B, 155 zzso zzso zzso and 376 zzso zzso zzso on zzso D and 8 zzso on zzso L of zzso zzso compared to those of virulent strain zzso as zzso zzso did not grow on chicken zzso zzso suggesting the role of the key seven zzso acids in determination of the cell zzso of zzso zzso This is the first complete zzso sequence of the virulent strain of zzso in Asia using the conventional zzso method, which will help to facilitate the future molecular biological research of zzso
