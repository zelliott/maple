zzso and zzso are zzso shell proteins which are responsible for zzso zzso formation and stabilization within the zzso layer of the Pacific red zzso zzso zzso It is known that the zzso zzso mineral modification zzso of both proteins zzso zzso possess identical zzso zzso capabilities within in zzso zzso but differ in terms of rate zzso with zzso zzso zzso In this report, we identify previously zzso molecular features of zzso and contrast the lowest energy zzso backbone structures of zzso zzso zzso with that of zzso zzso paper zzso zzso using zzso data and simulated zzso molecular dynamics structure zzso Like zzso we find that zzso possesses an unfolded zzso can zzso zzso and other zzso metal zzso can zzso onto or within zzso zzso and possesses zzso and zzso zzso zzso regions on its molecular zzso However, zzso has some unique features: greater zzso responsiveness to zzso the tendency to form a more zzso backbone zzso and longer zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso We conclude that the presence of unfolded zzso zzso zzso surface pockets, and interactive sequence zzso zzso both zzso and zzso with similar features that lead to comparable effects on crystal zzso and zzso However, zzso possesses longer zzso and zzso sequence clusters and exhibits a tendency to adopt a more zzso backbone zzso than zzso zzso We believe that these features facilitate zzso zzso or water cluster zzso thereby enhancing the zzso zzso of zzso over zzso
