Two receptors for zzso designated zzso and zzso have been zzso Both are members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is structurally similar to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is capable of inducing zzso In contrast, zzso does not promote cell zzso zzso is highly zzso and is membrane bound via a putative zzso zzso The extended structure of zzso is due to the presence of multiple zzso zzso zzso and zzso repeats zzso zzso zzso shows a broad tissue distribution, whereas the expression of zzso is restricted to peripheral blood zzso zzso and skeletal zzso All three TRAIL receptors bind TRAIL with similar zzso suggesting a complex regulation of zzso zzso
