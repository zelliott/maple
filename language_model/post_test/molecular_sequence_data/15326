The zzso zzso zzso has evolved within the past 50 years to catalyze the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It is of wide research interest for two reasons: first, zzso improvement of the zzso would facilitate its application in zzso and second, because of its recent evolution, it presents a rare opportunity to examine the early stages in the acquisition of new zzso zzso Using a structural model of the zzso complex, a region of the zzso pocket was targeted for zzso zzso Identification of improved zzso through this process informed the construction of a zzso zzso zzso with zzso improvement in its zzso value compared with that of the zzso zzso The reduction in zzso observed in the zzso zzso has allowed the full kinetic profile for the zzso zzso of zzso to be determined for the first time, revealing the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Since zzso zzso is common among zzso which are the closest structural zzso of zzso it is possible that this phenomenon is a remnant of the zzso activity of the evolutionary zzso of zzso A zzso mechanism that suggests a plausible zzso route for the evolution of zzso activity in zzso from an ancestral zzso is zzso
