The mechanism underlying the delivery of zzso zzso to the zzso is poorly zzso zzso is a putative zzso zzso for this process because it interacts with zzso chains through its zzso motifs zzso and with the zzso through a zzso element zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso motif of zzso also binds zzso an zzso zzso essential for zzso chain assembly onto its zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso alter its interactions with zzso and the zzso and impair its function in the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso compete for the binding of zzso suggesting that zzso forms separate complexes with zzso zzso we also find that the ability of other zzso proteins to associate with zzso zzso with their differential involvement in the zzso pathway, suggesting that zzso interactions may contribute to the zzso specificity of these zzso We propose that the zzso zzso a zzso interaction zzso may be used to facilitate zzso between zzso zzso and delivery, and to ensure the orderly handoff of the zzso from the zzso machinery to the zzso
