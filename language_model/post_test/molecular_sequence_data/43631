Certain receptors belonging to the LDL zzso zzso gene family appear to constitute a newly identified branch whose members are expressed in brain, in addition to other zzso In support of this concept, we have now discovered the expression and delineated the molecular structures of a representative of this emerging branch from two such diverse species as human and zzso This membrane zzso called zzso and thus far only known to exist in the zzso is a complex zzso mosaic protein zzso among other structural zzso a cluster of 11 zzso zzso repeats and a domain with zzso to zzso a zzso zzso for zzso protein zzso zzso signature sequences define the zzso as competent for zzso The most striking properties of zzso are their zzso high degree of structural conservation zzso identity among zzso and zzso with zzso identity in the zzso and zzso zzso of rabbit and zzso zzso lack of regulation by cholesterol and zzso and zzso expression in zzso The features of zzso suggest important roles in zzso and zzso zzso transport zzso some of which it may share with other zzso zzso family zzso
