zzso zzso zzso play a central role in cellular immunity against zzso We have revealed the characteristics of zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso repertoire, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso repertoire analyses and zzso size zzso were performed using peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and tissue specimens of gastric or zzso zzso surgically zzso from 11 zzso The zzso expression was measured by real-time quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso zzso were similar among multiple tissue specimens from different sites of the same zzso Similar peak patterns of zzso size zzso were observed among these tumor zzso but not in normal zzso or zzso In addition, identical zzso were detected in multiple specimens of the same zzso The ratio of the levels of zzso to that of zzso is significantly higher for tumor zzso compared with zzso These results suggested that a limited number of zzso locally expand in response to tumor zzso zzso within gastric or zzso zzso and local zzso production of the T helper zzso zzso 1 type zzso may affect the zzso immune response of zzso
