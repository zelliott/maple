A new method for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso peptides has been developed by combining solid phase zzso synthesis zzso with solution zzso A sequence from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was chosen as a model zzso The precursor for the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso on a solid phase followed by zzso salt formation on the zzso The resulting zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso with liquid zzso The zzso zzso zzso precursor zzso was subjected to zzso in solution zzso by zzso zzso in zzso The final product, zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso by mass zzso and zzso zzso zzso The stability of the model zzso under zzso neutral and basic conditions has been zzso
