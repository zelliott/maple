Comparisons of closely related species are needed to understand the zzso dynamics of zzso evolution in flowering zzso zzso this goal, we classified the long terminal repeat zzso zzso from six zzso and one zzso species of zzso The study species are the zzso zzso zzso zzso (as an zzso and six closely related zzso species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso All major plant zzso zzso zzso could be identified, and appear to be inherited from a common zzso Species of zzso but not zzso are enriched in zzso zzso due to a diversification of zzso especially zzso This is particularly striking in zzso where zzso seems to have contributed to the zzso enrichment and led to the emergence of seven large zzso families of zzso The preferential zzso of zzso in zzso via their zzso might have favored their diversification and zzso Our zzso analyses of zzso zzso from zzso also revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso elements are much more widely distributed among zzso than previously zzso
