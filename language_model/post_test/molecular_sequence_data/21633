The zzso zzso zzso is a variable constituent of the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso nature of zzso within a species is usually first defined zzso and the current zzso scheme for zzso zzso consists of 21 O zzso of which 15 have been characterized genetically and zzso Here, we present the structure and DNA sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso The O unit consists of one zzso each of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso This structure is very similar to that shared by zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso zzso The gene cluster sequences of these zzso however, have only low levels of similarity to that of zzso zzso zzso although there is significant conservation of gene zzso Within zzso zzso the zzso structure is most closely related to the zzso and zzso zzso
