The complete three-dimensional structure in methanol of an zzso zzso zzso that has been designed by taking into account the three-dimensional structures of small zzso zzso secondary structure prediction zzso and the well documented literature on zzso stabilizing factors, has been zzso by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso various two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso and zzso allowed the complete sequence specific assignment of all signals in the zzso zzso zzso trial structures were generated which were then subjected to molecular dynamics simulations using 121 zzso distances and 25 zzso zzso constant values as structural restraints to give a final set of calculated zzso These structures are in complete agreement with the results of a circular zzso study and reveal that the zzso adopted a highly ordered zzso zzso Details of the structure which throw light on future zzso design are zzso
