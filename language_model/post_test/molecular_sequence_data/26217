zzso is the most highly zzso of the five zzso zzso It is associated with zzso by an extensive zzso interaction, which is disrupted immediately prior to the first zzso step of zzso It has been proposed that this event activates zzso by zzso zzso Using a combination of doped synthesis and zzso zzso to generate point zzso in zzso we have now identified 12 positions, in three zzso at which single zzso zzso or deletions result in lethal or zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that most of these zzso retain the ability to assemble into zzso and zzso zzso zzso although zzso at three positions in zzso that zzso with zzso are zzso zzso in the complementary zzso in zzso are fully zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso that restore zzso fail to suppress the zzso of the zzso zzso This demonstrates a function for zzso independent of its role in zzso zzso two of the three essential regions in zzso identified genetically zzso to zzso zzso points in two zzso zzso A zzso zzso at one of these sites is defective in the second step of zzso in zzso
