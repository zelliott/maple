zzso is a zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso Its function is to assist the assembly of major zzso complex class I zzso The chicken zzso gene includes 8 zzso and is localized inside the major zzso complex between the 2 class zzso zzso The aim of the current study was the zzso of single zzso zzso frequency within the avian zzso zzso The zzso gene sequence from zzso 5 to zzso 6 was amplified for the chicken, zzso and zzso and sequences of different lengths were zzso The sequence analysis based on zzso identified 25 putative single zzso zzso sites when the 3 species were zzso The coding sequences were further translated and analyzed to identify zzso acid zzso The results indicated that zzso within this region of the gene was mainly observed in the zzso zzso The level of conservation of the zzso gene sequence among species is likely to be related to the functional importance of the zzso
