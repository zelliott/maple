A quantitative and qualitative comparison of zzso virus zzso promoter activity in zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso late promoter was used to express zzso from the zzso coli zzso gene in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Time courses of zzso zzso expression in chicken zzso skin zzso cells demonstrated zzso regulation of the zzso promoter with maximum zzso activity zzso and zzso lower than those obtained in zzso infected zzso and zzso cells, zzso The level of zzso activity per zzso DNA gene copy was determined for each zzso and found to be greater for zzso than zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter was used to express the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed early zzso zzso transcripts to be of defined zzso zzso size zzso mapped the termination sites to regions containing sequences associated with zzso early transcript zzso providing supportive evidence for a common zzso early transcript termination zzso Late zzso and zzso transcripts were zzso in zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso of early and late zzso zzso transcripts produced by zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso initiation occurred at the same sites in both zzso and corresponded to the regions previously identified as the early and late start sites of the zzso zzso These results would indicate a high level of conservation in the expression and regulation of genes by zzso
