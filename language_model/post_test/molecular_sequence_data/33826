Since first being proposed as a tandem gene family in 2001, the zzso of the 5 zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has predominantly depended on arguments involving shared zzso properties as well as zzso protein zzso properties zzso zzso and zzso and specific zzso motifs zzso zzso and zzso zzso This report discusses the evidence that an ancient zzso gene underwent a simple zzso in the common zzso of zzso and zzso and then separately evolved into zzso zzso in the 2 zzso zzso sequence analyses show that different copies of the original zzso zzso process were selected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso classes to acquire genetically different but zzso similar zzso repeat zzso by zzso zzso zzso for example, expanded zzso motifs zzso exclusively using motifs containing zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso repeats also used zzso zzso zzso A similar analysis of the origins of the other 4 zzso will require even more detailed analysis as zzso sequences of various fish and zzso become zzso
