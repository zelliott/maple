The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a zzso process controlled genetically by over 20 zzso In this study, we report the identification and characterization of the zzso zzso which was found to be involved in the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso a copy of zzso gene was also cloned from a zzso producing strain zzso zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene cloned from zzso zzso restored the ability of the zzso to convert zzso to zzso and to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that a single zzso acid replacement from zzso acid to zzso disabled the function of the zzso in the zzso strain zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was identified to be a zzso of previously zzso but functionally zzso transcript, zzso in zzso zzso based on sequence zzso at both zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso In addition to zzso another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for an zzso involved in the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to be highly zzso to zzso from zzso zzso which has been reported earlier to be involved in a similar zzso step for the zzso formation in that zzso zzso data demonstrated that both the zzso and zzso as well as zzso genes in zzso zzso were expressed only in the zzso zzso An analysis of the degrees of zzso for the two reported genes between the zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso
