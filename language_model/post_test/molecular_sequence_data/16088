zzso liver, and brain zzso zzso in zzso comprise a family of closely related zzso that are zzso expressed in a wide variety of cell zzso zzso obtaining a better understanding of the mechanisms governing the zzso control of expression of this zzso family, we used an zzso generated against bovine liver zzso to obtain quantitative estimates of the zzso of the three zzso in rat zzso by Western zzso zzso This analysis indicated that expression of these zzso at the protein level, although zzso was zzso and each zzso exhibited variations in expression throughout the zzso where it was zzso We also began a preliminary analysis of the evolution of the genes zzso these three zzso zzso this end, we isolated and zzso a partial zzso to the rat brain zzso that zzso the coding region from zzso acids zzso to zzso Using known zzso gene zzso we reconstructed a zzso spanning three zzso This zzso indicated that brain and muscle zzso are more closely related to each other than to the liver zzso and that gene zzso that give rise to the family zzso the zzso zzso zzso in the relative rates of change of the three zzso were observed and this may reflect different constraints on their evolution perhaps related to their functional roles and zzso zzso zzso
