zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso model of energy zzso zzso a bulk zzso zzso zzso zzso as the sole driving force for zzso zzso synthesis via zzso zzso zzso and for other zzso zzso Two properties of zzso zzso by zzso zzso species pose a challenge to this zzso robust zzso synthesis at pH zzso that does not correlate with the magnitude of the zzso and the failure of artificially imposed zzso to substitute for zzso zzso in energizing zzso synthesis at high pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, zzso Here we show that these properties, in zzso zzso zzso zzso depend upon zzso features in the zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes were made in six such features to the corresponding sequence in zzso zzso which reflects the consensus sequence for zzso zzso Five of the six single zzso assembled an active zzso zzso and four of these zzso exhibited a specific zzso in zzso growth at high zzso Most of these zzso lost the ability to generate the high zzso zzso at low bulk zzso that are characteristic of zzso The zzso and zzso zzso that are predicted to be in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were specifically implicated in zzso restriction of zzso flux through the zzso zzso to and from the bulk zzso The evidence included greatly enhanced zzso synthesis in response to an artificially imposed potential at high zzso The findings demonstrate that the zzso zzso of extreme zzso has special features that are required for zzso growth and zzso at high zzso
