The checkpoint zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in cell cycle checkpoint responses with functions in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and induction of zzso Proper regulation of zzso is essential for appropriate cellular responses to zzso zzso While the zzso zzso has been shown to be important in the regulation of human zzso zzso here we report that the zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso play more significant roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Under normal cell cycle conditions, zzso zzso zzso associates with a zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso with this complex does not require a functional zzso zzso domain but does require a putative zzso binding region that is found in zzso In response to zzso DNA ends, the zzso zzso of zzso is rapidly zzso in a sequential zzso First zzso zzso zzso 39, a site not previously recognized as important in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso then zzso three consensus zzso zzso Together, these zzso have the dual function of inducing zzso from the zzso complex and independently promoting the full zzso of zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of zzso requires zzso by multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
