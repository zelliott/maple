zzso zzso an important food-borne human zzso is increasingly resistant to zzso Natural transformation is considered to be a main mechanism for zzso the transfer of genetic materials zzso zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso but direct evidence for this notion is still zzso In this study, we determined the role of zzso in natural transformation and in the development of zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished natural transformation in zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso strains carrying either zzso or zzso resistance markers demonstrated the development of zzso that were resistant to both zzso indicating that the horizontal transfer of zzso resistance zzso actively occurs in mixed zzso zzso A zzso of zzso or the addition of zzso I in culture media completely inhibited the formation of zzso that were resistant to both zzso indicating that the horizontal transfer of the resistance zzso is zzso by natural zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso also reduced the frequency of emergence of spontaneous zzso that were resistant to zzso zzso and zzso but did not affect the outcome of zzso resistance development under zzso treatment, suggesting that natural transformation does not play a major role in the emergence of zzso zzso strains during treatment with zzso zzso These results define zzso as a competence factor in zzso prove the role of natural transformation in the horizontal transfer of zzso resistance zzso in zzso and provide new insights into the mechanism underlying the development of zzso zzso zzso
