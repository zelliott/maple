Blue zzso zzso zzso proteins form a zzso of blue light zzso are found in many bacteria and algae, and are further classified according to their zzso For one type of zzso zzso zzso zzso the central axes of its two zzso zzso are perpendicular to the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso For another type, zzso zzso the central axes of its two zzso zzso are parallel to its zzso domain zzso However, the functional significance of the different zzso with respect to zzso is not zzso For the study reported zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso containing the core of the zzso zzso domain and the zzso region of zzso including the two zzso and characterized its zzso and zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso detected similar zzso zzso changes in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso interacts with and activates the zzso zzso zzso demonstrating the functionality of zzso These results provide direct evidence that the zzso zzso zzso function as an zzso that accepts the zzso blue light signal and zzso it downstream during zzso
