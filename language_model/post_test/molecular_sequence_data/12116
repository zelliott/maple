The zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the corpus zzso of rabbits zzso to a zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 36 zzso This zzso was zzso from zzso zzso on day 12 of zzso with a zzso zzso The main zzso step was affinity zzso using Red zzso zzso The efficiency of this column was improved by zzso with 1 zzso zzso prior to zzso of the active zzso with 1 zzso zzso zzso acid sequence data demonstrate that the rabbit zzso zzso zzso has to be classified as a member of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso revealed a wide zzso specificity zzso the reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso kinetic zzso were determined using zzso zzso and zzso as zzso The fully zzso zzso showed two zzso activities of particular zzso zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso The competitive zzso of 20 zzso activity by zzso indicates that zzso and zzso are zzso for the same zzso From these results, we conclude that zzso and steroid metabolism are tightly linked to each zzso For this reason the zzso zzso could be a key zzso in the cascade of events leading to the zzso of the corpus zzso in the zzso
