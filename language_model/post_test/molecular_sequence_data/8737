Recently zzso with a wide range of binding zzso have been isolated from large zzso of zzso fragments displayed on zzso zzso including those that are difficult to raise by zzso We have used this approach to isolate an zzso zzso against chicken very low density zzso zzso zzso It binds to the zzso with good affinity zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso surface zzso and competes for binding of natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso also binds to other members of the low density zzso zzso zzso family including rat LDL zzso and human and rat low density zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and it competes for binding of zzso protein to zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso infection of human zzso deficient in zzso but expressing zzso zzso by human zzso zzso of the zzso is abolished upon reduction of the receptors and is strictly zzso zzso The zzso zzso thus recognizes the zzso binding zzso of several members of the LDL zzso family, in contrast to zzso produced by zzso zzso
