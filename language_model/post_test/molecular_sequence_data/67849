BET zzso and extra terminal zzso family proteins are unique among zzso proteins in that they not only associate with zzso zzso in zzso but also remain attached to zzso during zzso Although the two tandem zzso are essential to display this zzso they do not zzso In this work we report that a small zzso domain, motif B, is also zzso A deletion zzso of this domain zzso from zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso association with zzso is not restricted to zzso Interestingly, our results indicate that motif B constitutes a surface for zzso and zzso between BET zzso Finally, linked to the prominent role BET proteins play in cell zzso we report that zzso expression of the family member zzso interferes with zzso differentiation in zzso cells and in the zzso neural tube, probably because of preservation of adequate levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, a deletion zzso of motif B fails to perform in this way, highlighting the relevance of this domain for zzso zzso
