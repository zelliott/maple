The biological activities of zzso hormone zzso on bone are quite complex as demonstrated by its zzso and anabolic activities on the zzso Although there have been many reports describing genes that are regulated by zzso in zzso cells, the goal of this study was to zzso a well-established in zzso zzso anabolic treatment regimen to identify genes that mediate bone anabolic effects of zzso We identified a gene we named zzso anabolic induced gene in bone zzso that has been reported as brain and acute leukemia zzso zzso zzso using the latter zzso we have discovered that zzso is a zzso gene whose zzso expression was selectively induced in rat zzso nearly zzso zzso by a zzso zzso anabolic treatment regimen in a zzso zzso Although zzso is broadly zzso zzso did not regulate zzso expression in other zzso zzso expressing zzso and we find that the regulation of zzso protein by zzso in zzso is confined to mature zzso Further in zzso studies using rat zzso zzso cells show that zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso expression zzso by 4 h while the protein was induced by 8 zzso In addition to being regulated by zzso zzso zzso expression can also be induced by other bone forming factors including zzso and zzso zzso vitamin zzso We determined that zzso is regulated by zzso predominantly through the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate in zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso regulates markers of zzso zzso including zzso alkaline zzso and zzso expression while inducing zzso zzso We also demonstrate that these zzso responses zzso by zzso are similar to the responses zzso by zzso zzso These data, showing zzso zzso can mimic the effect of zzso on markers of zzso zzso along with the observations that zzso is induced selectively with a bone anabolic treatment regimen of zzso (not a zzso treatment zzso suggest that zzso may be an important zzso of the zzso anabolic action on bone cell zzso
