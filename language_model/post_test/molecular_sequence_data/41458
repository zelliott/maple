The quest for therapeutic applications of zzso zzso as a first step, the determination of its zzso solution structure and the relationship between this structure and the biological activity of zzso On this basis, we have employed a combination of circular zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and modeling techniques to determine the solution structure of human zzso zzso Other zzso including human zzso zzso zzso and the zzso peptides zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have also been zzso These studies have been performed in a zzso environment to mimic the cell membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso relationship studies have been performed by assessing the in zzso zzso capabilities of these peptides in the human retinal pigmented zzso cell line zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso Our findings emphasize the importance of both the primary structure zzso and zzso and particular segments of the zzso zzso that posses significant zzso zzso Additionally, details of a zzso role for zzso have also been hypothesized by comparing human and mouse zzso (1 and 6, zzso at both the structural and zzso zzso
