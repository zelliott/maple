Using the zzso chain reaction with zzso zzso derived from zzso motifs within the zzso zzso domain of protein zzso zzso and zzso extracted from embryonic stem cells, sequences that zzso a segment of the zzso domain of several potentially novel zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso One of these was selected for further study because in Northern analysis it zzso to zzso from zzso zzso cell lines, but not from lines representative of zzso zzso A zzso for this zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and encodes a protein with structural similarities to zzso Together these receptors form a new class of zzso zzso is expressed in a number of human zzso cell lines, and in the blasts of 6 of 11 patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso The structure of zzso suggests that it may function as a cell zzso zzso and mediate zzso or zzso interactions between zzso cells and their respective zzso
