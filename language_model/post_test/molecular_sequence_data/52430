Light and electron microscopic zzso methods were used to verify the possibility that zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso sensory zzso of cats contain substance zzso At the light microscopic level, substance zzso zzso accounted for about zzso of all cortical zzso and the vast majority were zzso zzso However, zzso of substance zzso zzso had a large zzso cell body, a prominent zzso zzso directed toward the zzso and zzso zzso thus suggesting they are zzso zzso These zzso were in layers III and zzso At the electron microscopic level, the majority of zzso zzso terminals formed zzso zzso but some substance zzso zzso terminals made zzso zzso zzso zzso spines were also zzso Combined retrograde zzso experiments were also carried out to study whether substance zzso zzso are projection zzso zzso zzso wheat germ zzso zzso to zzso inactive zzso zzso was injected either in the first zzso sensory zzso or in the zzso column zzso In the zzso sensory zzso zzso to the injection sites, a few substance zzso zzso in layers III and V also contained black zzso indicative of retrograde zzso This indicates that some substance zzso zzso project to cortical and zzso zzso We have therefore identified a zzso of substance zzso zzso that have most of the features of zzso zzso are the probable source of zzso zzso terminals forming zzso zzso on zzso zzso and project to the zzso zzso sensory zzso and zzso column zzso These characteristics fulfill the criteria required for zzso a cortical zzso as zzso
