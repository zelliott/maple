Transformation of zzso cells by the zzso zzso zzso appears to require the expression of a functional zzso zzso suggesting that simultaneous targeting of zzso and zzso might be a rational strategy for attempting treatment of zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, severe combined zzso mice injected with Philadelphia zzso cells were treated zzso with equal doses of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or with both zzso in zzso Compared with the mice treated with individual agents, the disease process was much slower in the group treated with both zzso as revealed by flow zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction analysis to detect zzso cells in mouse tissue cell suspensions, and by zzso of liver zzso The zzso of the disease process was positively correlated with a markedly increased survival of zzso mice treated with both zzso These data demonstrate the therapeutic potential of targeting multiple cooperating zzso
