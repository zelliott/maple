Previous findings on structural zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the only zzso zzso in the zzso family, zzso were attributed to its zzso life style, but without proper comparison to related zzso members of the zzso Before molecular evolutionary questions regarding zzso evolution can be answered, the zzso problems within the family need to be zzso However, the zzso position of zzso zzso and their precise relationship to zzso relatives are difficult to zzso zzso are encountered with both zzso and molecular zzso zzso data have been used in numerous studies to zzso relationships of zzso zzso despite accelerated rates of sequence zzso To address the question of the position of the zzso zzso within zzso we generated a new molecular data set consisting of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso and analyzed these data together with an existing zzso data zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to which an additional zzso gene zzso was zzso This data set was analyzed with an array of zzso methods, including zzso analysis, maximum likelihood, and maximum zzso Further exploration of data was done by using methods of zzso hypothesis zzso At least two zzso lineages are shown to diverge within the zzso before zzso However, the exact sister group of zzso could not be zzso even though many alternatives were rejected with zzso zzso is therefore warranted when interpreting the causes of molecular evolution in zzso zzso comparisons with zzso zzso are necessary before firm conclusions can be reached regarding the effects of the zzso mode of life on patterns of molecular evolution in zzso
