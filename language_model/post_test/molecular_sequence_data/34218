Human proteins zzso and zzso are components of the major zzso zzso zzso and of the minor zzso zzso zzso The two proteins bind to related zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in a strictly sequential zzso The primary binding zzso protein binds at zzso that exhibit identical sequences in the two zzso However, zzso sequences contacted by the secondary binding zzso differ in zzso and zzso zzso and the mechanism by which zzso achieves its dual specificity is presently zzso We show by crystal structure analysis that the capping zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso adopt different structures in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso a zzso base pair forms across the zzso based on which the zzso establishes more intimate interactions with zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso base pair at the base of the zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilizing principles known from the zzso and zzso families of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the importance of the zzso base pair and the zzso zzso interactions for complex zzso The more extensive zzso zzso interactions are in line with a higher stability of the zzso compared with the zzso zzso complex seen in zzso zzso which may explain how zzso zzso can compete with the more abundant zzso zzso for the same protein partners in zzso
