zzso could specifically bind to zzso zzso and play crucial roles in innate immune responses of zzso and zzso In this study, the zzso of a zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso was cloned from pearl oyster zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso was zzso long and consisted of a zzso region zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso with two zzso zzso instability motifs zzso and an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso a zzso of 555 zzso acids with an estimated molecular mass of zzso and a theoretical zzso point of zzso zzso contained four zzso each zzso of zzso all had the zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso zzso shared zzso and zzso identity to those of bay zzso and eastern zzso respectively, which were only two zzso with four zzso The zzso analysis revealed that all zzso with four zzso formed a single zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in all detected zzso and the expression level of zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso after zzso zzso zzso The expression profile analysis showed that the expression level of zzso zzso was significantly zzso at 4, 8 and zzso after zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso was a zzso and zzso zzso protein that perhaps involved in innate immune response of pearl zzso
