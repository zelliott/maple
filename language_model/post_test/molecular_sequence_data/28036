A zzso zzso from the zzso region of the human zzso gene extending from zzso to zzso relative to the cap site regulates expression of a zzso reporter gene in a zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso analyses of zzso and internal deletions indicate that sequences located between zzso and zzso are essential for zzso expression in cooperation with the zzso core zzso A zzso pair zzso containing these sequences zzso to zzso enhances expression from zzso core promoter elements in a manner that is independent of its orientation and position relative to the cap zzso When linked to the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso promoter, this zzso pair zzso of the zzso gene also enhances expression in differentiated zzso but not in zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequences within the region that is essential for enhancing activity zzso to zzso are zzso in other zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and resemble sequences within control regions of other genes that are expressed selectively in zzso zzso These data indicate that the zzso region of the human zzso gene contains an zzso element that is important for zzso zzso during zzso zzso
