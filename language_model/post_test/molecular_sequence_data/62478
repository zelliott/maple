Identification of zzso markers for rapid detection of zzso zzso is difficult because significant zzso zzso exists among zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We evaluated the bacterial zzso gene as a potential zzso marker for zzso zzso A real-time zzso zzso was developed for the detection of zzso zzso After analysis of the unique zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a fluorescent 3' minor groove binding probe was tested with zzso organisms from 29 zzso of bacteria, including 102 zzso zzso The zzso was found to be specific for all 43 strains of zzso zzso zzso In addition, a test panel of 105 samples was analyzed to evaluate the potential diagnostic capability of the zzso The zzso showed zzso zzso demonstrating the usefulness of the zzso gene as a specific zzso marker for zzso zzso
