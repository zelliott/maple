We previously detected in zzso zzso zzso of the medicinal zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso activity, zzso zzso which zzso zzso bonds formed by zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso group of zzso Such zzso bonds, either within or between protein zzso chains are formed in many biological zzso However, before we started our work no zzso were known to be capable of specifically splitting zzso bonds in zzso The zzso activity we detected was specific for zzso zzso The zzso was termed zzso Here we report the first zzso of zzso part of its zzso acid sequence isolation and sequencing of two related zzso derived from the gene family that encodes zzso zzso and the detection of zzso activity zzso by one of these zzso cloned in a zzso expression zzso The deduced mature protein products of these zzso contain 115 and 116 zzso acid zzso including 14 highly zzso zzso zzso and are formed from precursors containing specific leader zzso No zzso sequences were found in public zzso
