zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso is the zzso zzso exchange factor for protein synthesis initiation factor 2 zzso zzso of five zzso it converts zzso from a zzso form to the active zzso zzso This is a regulatory step of translation zzso In zzso zzso zzso function can be provided by the largest zzso zzso alone zzso This activity is zzso by complex formation with the other zzso zzso We have analyzed the roles of different regions of zzso in zzso in zzso complex formation, and in binding to zzso by characterizing zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso that impair the essential function of zzso Our analysis of nonsense zzso indicates that the C zzso of zzso zzso 518 to zzso is required for both zzso activity and interaction with zzso In addition, zzso zzso within this region impair the zzso activity of zzso without affecting its ability to bind zzso zzso zzso deletions within the zzso half of zzso disrupt zzso complex formation without affecting the zzso exchange activity of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso identified within this region do not affect the zzso activity of zzso alone or its interactions with the other zzso zzso or with zzso Instead, these zzso zzso act indirectly by zzso the enhancement of the rate of zzso exchange that results from complex formation between zzso and the other zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso region of zzso is an zzso domain that responds to zzso complex zzso
