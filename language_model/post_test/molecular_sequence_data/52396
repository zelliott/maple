zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared using the solution phase synthesis method and characterized by mass zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were individually immobilized on zzso 15 resulting in two affinity columns called zzso and zzso zzso A third affinity column was obtained by zzso the zzso zzso in column zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or rat plasma zzso almost zzso bind to either zzso or A3 affinity zzso Under zzso conditions, more than zzso of zzso bound to both columns zzso and zzso At a lower zzso strength and higher zzso zzso of rat plasma zzso bound to the same zzso zzso of both zzso was achieved using mild conditions at near neutral pH and in the presence of a small amount of zzso Both zzso were identified and characterized by zzso liquid zzso sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and by their zzso specificity and zzso zzso A single zzso zzso zzso step using either column zzso or A3 allowed the preparation of pure zzso from commercial zzso Starting from rat plasma partially zzso by a zzso zzso column, zzso on the zzso column allowed approximately an zzso zzso of rat plasma zzso However, serial zzso of rat plasma zzso on column zzso followed by column A3 resulted in a zzso factor of about zzso
