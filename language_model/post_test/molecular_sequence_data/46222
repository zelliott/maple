zzso high affinity zzso zzso plays an important role in triggering type I allergic zzso In this study, we have investigated the ability of four synthetic and zzso zzso interfering zzso zzso zzso to reduce the expression of zzso gene in zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Only zzso out of four zzso specifically inhibited the zzso gene expression and the dose response zzso revealed that zzso was capable of specific zzso of target zzso expression over a linear concentration range without affecting the expression of house keeping genes such as zzso zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso zzso interfering zzso can be effectively used to silence the expression of key genes like zzso high affinity zzso that are involved in chronic inflammatory zzso
