zzso zzso is a member of the zzso a family of small, zzso zzso zzso that include zzso These viruses have an zzso zzso associated with approximately 12 copies of an H pilot protein and 60 copies of a small J zzso zzso The surrounding zzso consists of 60 F coat proteins decorated with 12 zzso spikes of G zzso Assembly proceeds via a zzso empty zzso that requires the external D and internal B scaffolding proteins for its zzso The zzso zzso zzso structural intermediate was determined to zzso resolution by zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso and the infectious zzso the zzso open zzso has zzso wide pores at the zzso zzso and zzso wide gaps between F zzso as a result of the zzso of two zzso in the F zzso zzso The large pores are probably used for DNA entry and internal scaffolding protein exit during DNA zzso zzso of the B scaffolding protein are located at the zzso axes under the spike and in the zzso pocket on the inner surface of the zzso zzso B appears to have zzso activity that zzso at an zzso motif and probably zzso the removal of the protein through the zzso wide zzso The structure of the zzso mature zzso was solved to zzso resolution by X-ray zzso and was used to interpret the open zzso zzso zzso The main differences between the zzso and zzso zzso structures are in the spike and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso spikes have a rotation of zzso degrees compared to those of zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is shorter by 13 zzso acid zzso at its zzso end when compared to the zzso J zzso retains its zzso site on the internal surface of the zzso zzso The zzso ordered structural component of the zzso appears to be substantially increased in zzso compared to zzso allowing the building of about zzso of the zzso zzso
