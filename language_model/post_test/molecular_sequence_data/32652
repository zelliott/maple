The zzso zzso zzso binds to and mediates the zzso functions of the zzso tumor zzso zzso Both proteins consist of independently folded zzso linked by zzso zzso zzso A well studied short sequence of the zzso zzso domain, zzso binds zzso to four folded zzso of zzso zzso region 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in the 100 zzso zzso However, we found that a longer zzso zzso domain construct zzso bound tightly to each zzso zzso zzso had the greatest affinity zzso zzso 27 zzso and competes with the zzso domain of zzso for the zzso N zzso zzso thus can protect the N zzso of zzso against the binding of other zzso zzso of zzso that abrogate zzso zzso zzso greatly weakened binding to each zzso domain, linking zzso defects to weakened zzso zzso We propose a complex between zzso zzso and zzso in which four zzso of zzso wrap around the four zzso zzso of zzso
