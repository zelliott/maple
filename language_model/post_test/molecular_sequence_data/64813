zzso is a molecular zzso essential for the zzso and assembly of many key zzso zzso and regulatory zzso zzso is assisted and regulated by zzso that participate in an ordered series of dynamic zzso complexes, linked to zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso bind to zzso and stimulate its zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that this activity is dependent on the zzso domain of zzso which interacts with the central segment of zzso The structural basis for this interaction is revealed by the crystal structure of the zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso to the whole of zzso in complex with the middle segment of zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso show that binding of zzso promotes a zzso switch in the zzso zzso loop zzso of zzso that releases the zzso zzso 380 and enables its interaction with zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso
