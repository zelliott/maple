zzso of zzso with special traits and the construction of zzso libraries by direct cloning of environmental DNA have great potential for identifying genes and gene products for zzso zzso We have combined these techniques to isolate novel genes zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso or reduction of the corresponding zzso In order to favor the growth of zzso containing the targeted zzso samples collected from four different environments were incubated in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso the DNA was extracted from the four samples and used to construct complex zzso zzso zzso 100,000 zzso coli strains of each library per test zzso were screened for the production of zzso from zzso on indicator zzso zzso positive zzso coli clones were obtained during the initial zzso Sixteen of them contained a zzso zzso to zzso which zzso a stable zzso zzso Eight of the positive clones exhibited zzso alcohol zzso activity with zzso or zzso as the zzso in crude zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso 36 complete and 17 incomplete zzso zzso zzso Fifty of these genes showed similarity to zzso genes from a broad collection of different zzso The genes responsible for the zzso formation of zzso coli were identified for nine of the plasmids zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences deduced from these genes revealed that three zzso zzso and zzso zzso novel alcohol zzso of different types, four zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso novel putative zzso belonging to groups distinct from alcohol zzso one zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso and one zzso zzso a protein which showed no similarity to any other known gene zzso
