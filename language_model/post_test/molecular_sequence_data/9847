The zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso in mice of an unknown zzso which zzso total zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that the lack of zzso tissue may be due to abnormalities of zzso traffic into these zzso zzso we analyzed the expression of various zzso molecules associated with zzso zzso Among the zzso molecules zzso all were normally expressed except the zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice zzso was absent in the zzso at zzso and protein levels, but was normally expressed in the zzso zzso The FISH analysis and linkage analysis using zzso markers demonstrated that the zzso gene is located on zzso 10, indicating that zzso is not zzso by the zzso zzso which is located on zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso expression of zzso is not the direct cause of zzso zzso but rather a secondary zzso
