zzso zzso the zzso agents of zzso adhere to components of the zzso zzso a pivotal role for colonization of host zzso during zzso Previously, we and others have shown that zzso zzso proteins zzso of zzso zzso bind to zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we report that zzso can be immobilized by human zzso zzso or zzso from different zzso including zzso skin, and blood vessels, and that zzso proteins can bind to zzso or zzso Moreover, both zzso and zzso bind to the same zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and competition zzso The zzso zzso domain binds to the 17th to 27th zzso of zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso and zzso was further confirmed by steady state zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the binding was zzso and affected by environmental zzso indicating it is a zzso zzso The binding affinity of zzso to zzso was zzso less than that of wild type zzso In zzso we show that zzso proteins of zzso zzso interact with zzso and zzso and we conclude this interaction may contribute to zzso zzso to host zzso during zzso
