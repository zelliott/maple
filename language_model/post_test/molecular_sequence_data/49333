The frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso infants developing acute respiratory syndromes has recently been evaluated and has been shown to be close to zzso Until now, there have been no data on the zzso characteristics of the fungus in these patients, while molecular typing of zzso zzso organisms was mostly performed with samples from zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso pneumonia zzso The present report describes the zzso of zzso zzso organisms in 26 zzso infants developing a mild zzso infection zzso with an episode of zzso The typing was based on sequence analysis of internal transcribed zzso zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso zzso followed by the use of two typing zzso By use of the first score, 11 zzso zzso ITS types were zzso 10 were previously reported in zzso patients with zzso while 1 was newly zzso By use of the second score, 13 types were identified, of which 2 were newly zzso The most frequent type was identified as type zzso zzso zzso which zzso to type zzso zzso zzso Mixed infections were diagnosed in three zzso The occurrence of such diversity of zzso zzso ITS types, an identical main type, and mixed infections has previously been reported in zzso patients with zzso Thus, the zzso zzso ITS zzso detected in zzso infants and zzso patients developing different forms of zzso infection share zzso suggesting that both groups of individuals make up a common human zzso for the zzso Finally, the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso infants with acute respiratory syndromes and the zzso results provide evidence that this infant population is an important zzso for the zzso
