The zzso X-ray structures of the zzso zzso complex from zzso zzso and zzso zzso obtained in the presence of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso are very zzso A difference occurs in the zzso binding position of zzso In zzso zzso binds in the zzso mode, as previously found for zzso in X-ray structures of the zzso zzso zzso In this mode, the zzso zzso ring zzso of the zzso bound in the zzso niche is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and its 13 carbon tail extends through a portal to the large zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso binds in an zzso oriented zzso mode, with the tail inserted toward the zzso niche through the portal and the ring caught in the zzso cavity that is zzso away from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that might determine zzso binding was performed with the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The following changes in the sensitivity of electron transport activity to zzso and zzso were zzso zzso little effect of zzso zzso in zzso zzso which is zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso almost complete loss of sensitivity by zzso zzso in the zzso cluster binding region, which is close to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a ten and zzso increase associated with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso It was zzso that only the zzso binding mode, in which the ring interacts with zzso near the zzso is zzso and that zzso 81 of zzso IV, which resides at the immediate entrance to the zzso zzso controls the relative binding affinity of inhibitor at the two different binding zzso
