The zzso protein from influenza A virus forms zzso channels that are essential to viral function and are the target of the drug zzso zzso scanning was used to generate a series of zzso with successive zzso in the zzso segment of the zzso and the zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso on reversal potential, zzso zzso and zzso resistance were zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso consistent with a zzso coiled zzso or zzso zzso A three-dimensional model of this structure suggests a possible mechanism for the zzso selectivity of the zzso channel of influenza zzso
