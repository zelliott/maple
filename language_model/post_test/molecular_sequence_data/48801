The putative zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso code zzso was expressed as an zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso coli and zzso by affinity and zzso zzso The expression and zzso of zzso enabled characterization of the zzso zzso properties of the zzso The optimal activity temperature and pH of the zzso protein were zzso K and pH 7, zzso zzso maintained over zzso activity in the zzso range zzso zzso thereby suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso exhibits maximum activity towards the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso results revealed that zzso has a highly zzso zzso zzso in the active site consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was successfully zzso using the zzso zzso method and a complete zzso data set was collected to zzso zzso resolution using zzso radiation on the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
