Major zzso complex zzso class II molecules are zzso zzso on the surface of zzso presenting cells zzso that bind the T cell zzso initiating a cascade of interactions that results in zzso zzso of zzso populations of T zzso The zzso zzso cell recognition zzso of rat zzso class II zzso and zzso zzso were expressed as a single zzso for structural and functional zzso These zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately 200 zzso acid zzso were designed using the structural backbone of zzso class II molecules as template, and have been produced in zzso coli with and without zzso extensions containing zzso zzso zzso characterization using circular zzso predicted that these molecules retained the zzso zzso platform and zzso zzso observed in the native zzso class II zzso The proteins exhibited a cooperative two-state zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules with a zzso linked zzso zzso showed increased stability to zzso unfolding relative to the empty zzso zzso This new class of small soluble zzso provides a template for designing and refining human zzso useful in detecting and regulating zzso T zzso
