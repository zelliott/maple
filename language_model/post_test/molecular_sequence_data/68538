A functional zzso clone coding for the human zzso E zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a human zzso cell zzso library zzso by zzso zzso using a zzso chain reaction zzso of the human zzso zzso The human zzso zzso is comprised of 402 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso and has the topography common to all zzso receptors with seven predicted zzso spanning zzso zzso zzso zzso challenge of zzso zzso injected with zzso zzso resulted in an increase in zzso zzso In addition, the rank order of potency for zzso in competition for zzso specific binding to zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were more potent than the zzso zzso zzso zzso in these competition binding zzso In zzso therefore, we have cloned the human zzso zzso zzso which is functionally coupled to an increase in zzso zzso
