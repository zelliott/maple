An overview is given about the current knowledge and research activities on the molecular analysis of zzso deletions in the zzso part of the long arm of the human Y zzso zzso These zzso are associated with the male specific zzso of zzso and severe zzso The fact is stressed that only zzso zzso zzso in zzso are of any diagnostic value in the zzso clinic because numerous zzso deletion events in zzso have also been zzso Three different zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with male zzso are now found repeatedly zzso zzso in more than 700 zzso They strongly support the presence of at least three zzso zzso in zzso They have been designated as zzso zzso and zzso Each of them should contain at least one Y gene functional in zzso and, if zzso it should induce the same sterile zzso as the corresponding zzso zzso These genes have not yet been zzso However, some candidate genes zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso It is remarkable that all three zzso zzso specific zzso binding proteins with a similar sequence zzso Their structure and potential relationship is zzso
