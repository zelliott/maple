In addition to conventional zzso zzso fish have evolved a distinctive type of zzso designated as zzso which lacks the light zzso chains and is composed entirely by heavy zzso zzso molecules can be manipulated by molecular engineering to produce the variable domain of a single heavy chain zzso zzso zzso together with the zzso camel zzso constitute the smallest naturally occurring zzso able to recognize an zzso Their special features, such as small size, long extended zzso zzso and zzso and chemical stability, make them suitable candidates for zzso zzso Here we describe the generation of two mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that both specifically react with zzso zzso of the horn shark zzso zzso While the former recognizes a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso the latter is more zzso zzso zzso zzso a single band from whole shark serum, which was identified as zzso by mass zzso Additionally, we used zzso zzso to follow the zzso immune response of zzso during zzso protocols with two different zzso zzso cells and a zzso zzso thus corroborating that zzso zzso recognizes both isolated zzso zzso and whole zzso zzso Both zzso represent an affordable zzso zzso and zzso tool in the field of shark zzso zzso
