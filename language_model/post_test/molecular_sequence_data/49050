The zzso and zzso are biologically active zzso derived from zzso zzso Their diverse and potent actions are associated with specific zzso Recent molecular techniques have established the zzso and zzso acid sequences and confirmed the evidence that suggested the existence of different zzso receptors for these zzso zzso The nomenclature for these receptors has now been established for the zzso BLT receptors are activated by zzso zzso and related zzso and this class of receptors can be subdivided into zzso and zzso The zzso zzso activate another group called zzso zzso which are referred to as zzso and zzso A provisional nomenclature for the zzso zzso has also been zzso zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso and zzso may also activate another putative zzso However this latter zzso has not been zzso The aim of this review is to provide the molecular evidence as well as the properties and significance of the zzso and zzso zzso which has lead to the present zzso
