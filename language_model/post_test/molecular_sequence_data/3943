The 26 S zzso a complex between the 20 S zzso and 19 S regulatory units, zzso zzso degradation of unfolded and zzso proteins in zzso We have identified previously 20 S and activated 20 S zzso in zzso zzso but not 26 S zzso However, the presence of 26 S zzso in zzso zzso was suggested by the zzso of zzso by cell zzso a process that requires zzso but is inhibited by zzso and the zzso turnover of zzso proteins in the intact zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the six zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso Five of the six zzso zzso zzso zzso except for zzso were capable of functionally zzso the corresponding zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed the presence in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which zzso with the zzso 19 S zzso complex by gel zzso and localized in the 19 S fraction of a zzso zzso All the zzso and putative 19 S zzso zzso proteins were zzso from zzso zzso zzso by individual zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with a chemical zzso resulted in zzso of 20 S zzso with all the zzso and zzso proteins that zzso in a zzso zzso to the position of 26 S zzso These data demonstrate the presence of 26 S zzso in zzso zzso cells, which apparently zzso into 19 S and 20 S complexes upon cell zzso zzso interference to block selectively the expression of zzso 20 S core and zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso proteins accompanied by zzso of cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso cells could not rescue the lethal zzso thus confirming the zzso between the two zzso The zzso zzso 11 S regulator zzso zzso interference cells grew zzso suggesting the zzso of activated 20 S zzso in zzso zzso
