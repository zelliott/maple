Two zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso predominantly exists as a zzso the zzso potential of the beta zzso of human and mouse zzso is less than that of the alpha zzso The 16 zzso acid zzso located in the zzso zzso acid region of the zzso zzso domain should be responsible for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Y, zzso M, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was performed to define the zzso acid zzso that cause the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that among the 16 zzso zzso the conversion from zzso of zzso to zzso of zzso and that from zzso of zzso to zzso of zzso most efficiently reversed the zzso interaction, and that the inverse changes from those of zzso to zzso primarily explained the zzso zzso of zzso We conclude that taken together, the conversion of zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso is primarily responsible for zzso zzso of zzso
