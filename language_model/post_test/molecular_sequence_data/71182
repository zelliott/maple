zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by a variety of cellular or environmental zzso Proper regulation of the zzso zzso may be critical for cell survival or death under various zzso In this study, we report the molecular cloning of novel zzso of zzso which harbor a putative zzso interaction domain and a zzso domain, as well as an zzso zzso region in the C zzso Northern analysis indicates that zzso zzso zzso is expressed in brain and kidney and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are specifically expressed in zzso In zzso zzso data showed that the zzso zzso messages were heavily concentrated in adult brain, and were particularly enriched in the cerebral zzso and zzso the brain regions vulnerable to pathological states such as zzso zzso and Alzheimer's zzso All the deduced protein products of the zzso zzso zzso appear to have a similar property in that they inhibit the zzso stimulation when zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of the novel zzso zzso resulted in suppression of zzso cell death in a zzso cell line, zzso These findings suggest that zzso may play an important role in regulation of the zzso zzso that is involved in zzso cellular zzso
