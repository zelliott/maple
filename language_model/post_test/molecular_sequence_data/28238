We have identified two discrete zzso zzso within the mouse zzso zzso whose relative activities vary according to the target zzso One domain lies within the zzso region and is active in the absence of zzso The second domain is contained within the zzso portion of the protein and depends upon zzso binding for its zzso The location and zzso dependence of this domain has been confirmed using zzso receptors containing the Lex A DNA binding zzso Although zzso by the zzso domain is dependent upon zzso binding the analysis of zzso deletion zzso has demonstrated that these two functions are not entirely zzso
