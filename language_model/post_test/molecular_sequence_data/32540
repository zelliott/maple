The zzso signal zzso system from zzso tuberculosis bears a unique zzso system zzso of two putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one response regulator zzso By sequence analysis, zzso is found to be an zzso zzso zzso binding zzso similar to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a unique zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso is expected to interact with and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso binds zzso zzso zzso zzso salt and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso in the presence of zzso was measured, and zzso experiments suggested that zzso acts as a functional zzso and zzso zzso by interacting with zzso Further zzso studies showed transfer of a zzso group from zzso to the response regulator zzso These results indicate a new mode of interaction for zzso between the zzso system proteins in zzso
