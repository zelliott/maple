A method of window exchange umbrella sampling molecular dynamics simulation is employed for zzso zzso zzso An zzso expression for the average acceptance probability between neighboring windows is derived and combined with the first passage time zzso method to zzso a zzso set in an optimal zzso With the zzso set, the method provides a substantially more efficient sampling of zzso zzso together with the potential of mean force along the zzso distance of a zzso zzso model, compared to the umbrella sampling zzso
