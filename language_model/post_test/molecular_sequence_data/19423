zzso processing, including zzso end zzso zzso and 3' end zzso are events coordinated by zzso that can influence the subsequent export and translation of zzso zzso of zzso processing is crucial in zzso such as zzso where inefficient zzso and the export of zzso zzso are required for expression of the full complement of viral zzso zzso processing can be affected by both viral and cellular zzso and in this study we demonstrate that a member of the zzso E family of proteins can zzso zzso zzso metabolism and zzso We show that zzso zzso are able to interact with the zzso element of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 3 of zzso and that zzso of zzso E1 expression alters zzso structural protein zzso zzso of zzso E1 leads to a reduction in zzso achieved in part through a decrease in rev zzso zzso However, the reduction in Rev levels cannot fully account for the effect of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso E1 might also act to suppress viral zzso zzso zzso zzso determined that the zzso end of zzso E1 was required for the reduction in Rev expression and that replacing this portion of zzso E1 with that of zzso zzso despite the high degree of zzso could not rescue the loss of zzso
