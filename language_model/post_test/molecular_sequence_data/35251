zzso global climate change is expected to cause severe range zzso among zzso zzso Alpine areas in the Mediterranean region are of special concern because of the high abundance of endemic species with narrow zzso This study combined species distribution models, population structure analyses and zzso skyline plots to trace the past and future distribution and diversity of zzso zzso an endangered narrow endemic species that inhabits zzso of Sierra Nevada zzso The results showed that: zzso the habitat of this zzso species in Sierra Nevada suffered little changes during glacial and zzso stages of late zzso zzso zzso zzso in the last millennium zzso Warm Period and Little Ice zzso moderately affected the demographic trends of zzso zzso future warming conditions will cause severe range zzso and zzso genetic diversity will not diminish at the same pace as the distribution zzso As a consequence of the low population structure of this species, genetic zzso in the zzso zones of Sierra Nevada should be limited during range zzso We conclude that maintenance of large effective population sizes via high zzso rates and high levels of gene flow may promote the resilience of zzso plant species when confronted with global zzso
