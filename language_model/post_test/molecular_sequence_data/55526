zzso bacteria zzso zzso unique zzso the zzso which are zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso involves the zzso of large amounts of zzso However, the iron metabolism of zzso is not well zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso contains two zzso iron transport zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein was reported to be responsible mainly for the transport of zzso iron and to play an accessory role in zzso zzso To determine the role of zzso we constructed an zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso double deletion zzso zzso zzso The single zzso zzso did not affect zzso crystal zzso zzso zzso had a significantly lower average zzso number per cell zzso than zzso zzso indicating that zzso plays a role in zzso formation when the zzso gene is zzso Our findings showed that zzso has a greater zzso iron transport ability than zzso and revealed the differential roles of zzso and zzso in zzso iron zzso Interestingly, compared to the wild type, the zzso zzso showed increased sensitivity to zzso stress and lower activities of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso proteins help protect bacterial cells from zzso zzso
