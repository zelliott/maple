zzso a protein zzso gene from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned utilizing zzso zzso The gene encodes a protein of a predicted length of zzso zzso zzso and within this zzso acid sequence all the zzso regions characteristic of protein zzso can be zzso The zzso zzso domain possesses highest identities zzso with zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso protein zzso There are two zzso zzso in zzso located at positions common to zzso zzso The first insert separates zzso zzso IV and VI by 559 zzso zzso and the second zzso zzso and VIII by 41 zzso zzso Both zzso are larger than their zzso in zzso zzso The sequence of zzso has one putative zzso zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, zzso a synthetic zzso representing a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are inhibited by zzso Thus zzso appears to be the first zzso protein zzso related to zzso zzso and might be the first zzso zzso zzso Western blots indicated that the protein is expressed as major forms of 80 and 90 zzso Whereas the 80 zzso form is present throughout the zzso development and in zzso the two 90 zzso forms are only found in mature zzso One of the latter is also present in the membrane fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected the protein distributed throughout the zzso whereas it was found in discrete zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 83 zzso zzso membrane zzso at the zzso complex in zzso and zzso but does not zzso with zzso zzso
