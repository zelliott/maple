zzso observations of animal cell zzso have shown that the onset of zzso is delayed when zzso attachment to the zzso is spontaneously retarded or zzso zzso This report demonstrates that a zzso DNA zzso zzso carried on a single zzso can induce a cell cycle delay observed as retarded zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso deletion within zzso DNA element II zzso delta 31) that causes zzso zzso in only zzso of cell division zzso a dramatic zzso delay zzso Other zzso DNA zzso including zzso in zzso DNA elements I and III, similarly delayed zzso Single division pedigree analysis of strains containing the zzso delta 31 zzso zzso indicated that most (and possibly all) cells experienced delay in each cell cycle and that the delay was not due to increased zzso copy zzso Furthermore, a zzso population of cells containing the zzso delta 31 zzso underwent DNA synthesis on schedule with zzso zzso but subsequently exhibited late zzso separation and zzso late cell zzso We speculate that this delay in cell cycle progression before the onset of zzso provides a mechanism for the stabilization of zzso with defective zzso zzso Further, we suggest that the delay may be zzso by surveillance at a cell cycle checkpoint that monitors the completion of zzso attachment to the zzso
