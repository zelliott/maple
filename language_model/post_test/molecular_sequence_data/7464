The two zzso zzso A zzso and zzso exert their major therapeutic effect by zzso zzso zzso It is believed that the drugs first bind to their cellular zzso known as zzso and then target the protein zzso zzso for zzso The zzso activity of zzso is regulated by its zzso domain zzso and by the zzso proteins zzso B zzso and zzso We have used the zzso zzso system to show that zzso zzso and zzso can only bind to a truncated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso devoid of zzso but not to full-length zzso Both zzso and zzso cause disruption of the zzso zzso interaction, whereas their presence permits zzso delta to bind more strongly to zzso In contrast, the binding of zzso delta to zzso is unaffected by the zzso zzso in the absence of its zzso zzso zzso neither zzso nor zzso zzso or stimulates the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These in zzso observations not only provide supportive evidence for the mechanism by which zzso complexes could zzso zzso activity but also unveil the possibility of identifying novel zzso zzso zzso which may disturb the association of zzso delta to zzso
