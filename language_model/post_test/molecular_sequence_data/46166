zzso libraries offer an attractive approach towards exploring protein zzso structure and zzso Although several strategies introduce sequence diversity, the likelihood of identifying proteins with novel functions is increased when the library of genes encodes for folded and soluble zzso Here we present the first application of the zzso patterning approach of zzso protein library design to the unique central zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that this high-quality approach translates very well to the zzso protein zzso all library members zzso and are functionally diverse, having a range of zzso in the presence and absence of calcium as determined by circular zzso zzso zzso these data support that the zzso patterning approach, when applied to the zzso protein fold, can yield large collections of zzso soluble and zzso zzso
