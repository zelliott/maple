zzso zzso modifications play key roles in gene regulation, development, and zzso but their dynamics in living organisms remain almost completely zzso To address this problem, we developed a genetically zzso system for tracking zzso modifications by generating fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso that can be expressed in zzso To zzso an zzso zzso 9 zzso specific zzso zzso was engineered and zzso expressed in human zzso In good agreement with the zzso of its target zzso zzso was enriched in zzso and its zzso measurably changed upon treatment with a zzso zzso zzso We also generated transgenic fruit fly and zzso zzso expressing zzso for in zzso zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso during zzso zzso could highlight enhanced zzso at the start of zzso zzso around zzso cycle zzso Together, this work demonstrates the broad potential of zzso and lays the foundation for zzso analysis in zzso
