zzso protein represents a novel ancillary factor of zzso zzso zzso We have investigated import and processing of this factor in human cells using zzso and zzso forms of zzso and specific zzso zzso is zzso as a zzso precursor protein that is processed to a zzso mature zzso zzso detection of zzso showed zzso zzso with zzso Red and zzso zzso Western zzso of zzso zzso revealed the highest signal of zzso in isolated zzso and zzso location was confirmed by mass zzso zzso Based on analysis of zzso zzso zzso appears to be located in the inner zzso zzso in accordance with predicated zzso regions in the central part of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis did not show direct interaction of zzso with assembled zzso zzso but indicated the presence of zzso form of zzso No zzso protein could be found in cells and isolated zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso thus confirming that zzso zzso is prevented in these zzso
