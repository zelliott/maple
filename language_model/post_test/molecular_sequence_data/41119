zzso elements zzso make up a large part of zzso zzso Due to their repetitive nature and to the fact that they zzso regulatory signals, zzso can be responsible for zzso zzso movement of gene sequences and evolution of gene regulation and zzso zzso ubiquity raises the question about their function in zzso and most are zzso inactive due to zzso that compromise their zzso However, the activity of zzso is currently considered to have been one of the major processes in zzso zzso 

We report on the characterization of a zzso active zzso zzso (named zzso from zzso zzso in a comparative and quantitative study of expression levels in different zzso and distinct zzso stages through zzso We observed zzso differential zzso levels in all the zzso zzso 

These results document that zzso zzso levels are not zzso Nevertheless, they depend upon the zzso stage, the tissue zzso and the potential occurring events during an zzso life zzso This zzso brought upon by different zzso and environmental influences suggests an involvement of zzso in stress response and during zzso
