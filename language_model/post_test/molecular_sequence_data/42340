The zzso carrier has recently been zzso from rat liver zzso by three distinct scientific groups using different zzso A zzso protein has been prepared by zzso gel 60 zzso by our group zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The specific zzso transport activity of this preparation is not significantly different from that measured in zzso and it is zzso by zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso have reported the isolation of a zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso and zzso group zzso et zzso zzso have isolated a zzso protein by zzso Orange, zzso Blue, and zzso zzso zzso mapping has failed to support any structural zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso zzso The peptides obtained by several zzso procedures have been partially zzso Their sequence information has been used to obtain different zzso clones by a dual approach, the zzso chain reaction and screening of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The largest zzso which could be isolated is 2,986 zzso in length and contains a zzso open reading frame and an unusually long 3' untranslated region, both of which have been completely zzso The protein sequence of the carrier from the first zzso zzso is zzso zzso acids in length and exhibits a molecular mass of zzso zzso of the protein sequence to the sequences of the four members of the zzso carrier protein family zzso carrier, zzso carrier, zzso carrier, and zzso zzso does not reveal significant similarity zzso Walker et zzso zzso A zzso internal zzso which is a characteristic of these zzso is not present in the sequence of the zzso carrier zzso The zzso for the zzso carrier is expressed in rat liver and brain, but not in rat zzso
