Numerous studies, mostly performed on zzso cell cultures, have implicated the zzso family of small zzso proteins in cell cycle control zzso and/or engagement in the zzso zzso We report here the zzso zzso expression pattern and functional zzso in embryonic development of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Its expression pattern, notably in the developing brain zzso zzso strongly suggests that it is involved in cell cycle zzso zzso experiments (through zzso zzso slowed down early development, and produced zzso clearly reduced in size, while zzso zzso resulted in small zzso zzso to DNA damage zzso zzso We further demonstrated that, following zzso zzso cells are zzso before both zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso while in the zzso zzso experiments cells are engaged in zzso rather than prevented from zzso These results show that zzso is likely to play an important role in zzso cell fate decisions during zzso they also demonstrate that the zzso is a promising model to zzso in zzso the zzso control of the cell zzso
