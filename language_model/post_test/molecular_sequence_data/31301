The zzso binding specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from extracts of their bulbs by affinity zzso on immobilized zzso was studied by quantitative zzso sugar zzso zzso and affinity zzso on the immobilized zzso These zzso gave strong zzso reactions with several zzso zzso but did not zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, both zzso reacted strongly with zzso zzso having multiple zzso terminal zzso groups, a synthetic linear zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of the linear zzso with zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso group, did not reduce its zzso with zzso or zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that zzso and zzso react not only with terminal but also with internal zzso zzso Sugar zzso zzso studies showed these zzso to possess the greatest specific activity for zzso units whereas zzso and zzso did not inhibit either zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso tested, the best inhibitor of zzso interaction was zzso zzso which was twice as good an inhibitor as Man alpha zzso zzso and 10 times better than zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso containing either zzso or zzso zzso units were good zzso of the zzso zzso system zzso to zzso more active than zzso These results indicate that both zzso appear to possess an extended binding zzso complementary to at least three zzso zzso zzso Various zzso zzso which contain zzso units were retarded on the immobilized zzso zzso On the other hand, those containing either zzso or zzso zzso were retarded on the immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso two Man alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso with hybrid type zzso chains were not retarded on either zzso These two new zzso which differ in their fine sugar binding specificity from each other, and also from the zzso zzso should prove to be useful zzso for the detection and preliminary characterization of zzso on cell surfaces and in zzso
