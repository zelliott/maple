The recently discovered zzso snow flea zzso protein zzso has no sequence zzso with any known zzso No experimental structure has been reported for this interesting protein zzso Here we report the total chemical synthesis of the mirror image forms of zzso zzso zzso the native zzso and zzso the native zzso zzso The predicted 81 zzso acid zzso zzso chain of zzso contains zzso zzso at positions 1, 13, 28, and 43 and was prepared from four synthetic zzso segments by sequential native chemical zzso After zzso the full-length synthetic zzso was folded at 4 degrees C to form the zzso protein containing two zzso zzso zzso zzso had the expected zzso activity in an ice zzso zzso zzso zzso image zzso protein was prepared by the same synthetic strategy, using zzso segments made from zzso zzso and had an identical but zzso CD zzso As expected, zzso displays the same zzso properties as zzso because ice presents an zzso surface for zzso zzso zzso synthetic access to zzso will enable determination of its molecular structure and systematic zzso of the molecular basis of the zzso properties of this unique zzso
