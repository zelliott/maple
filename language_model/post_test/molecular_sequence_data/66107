A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from a zzso species zzso zzso by using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso analysis of 22 zzso genes from zzso as well as the new zzso gene indicate that zzso genes shared a great degree of zzso regardless of their zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was induced by zzso and peaked at 400 zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes in rice enhanced their tolerance to salt zzso However, there is no significant difference in salt tolerance among the transgenic rice plants zzso the zzso genes from either zzso or zzso zzso The zzso content of both the wild type zzso and transgenic plants increased when exposed to 50 and 100 zzso zzso and the zzso concentration in transgenic plants was marginally higher than that of zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso of the zzso gene from either zzso or zzso species resulted in the enhanced tolerance to salt stress at a similar level, suggesting that zzso gene per zzso might not be the reason accounting for the difference in salt tolerance between zzso and zzso
