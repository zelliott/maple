zzso zzso shares several zzso features with zzso Thus, it is presumed that some molecular mechanisms that are critical for zzso development may also act in the early development of zzso Here, we investigated expression of the zzso zzso group zzso gene zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso restricted expression pattern along the zzso zzso which is remarkably similar to that of the zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso however, was exclusively in zzso of zzso origin unlike its zzso zzso Exposure of the zzso to zzso M zzso zzso acid induced a zzso zzso with elimination of the zzso structures, the zzso In this zzso the level of zzso expression was enhanced and zzso expression was observed at the anterior terminal zzso where the zzso are otherwise zzso These observations suggest that there are some zzso mechanisms in the spatial regulation of expression of zzso group genes in zzso of zzso and zzso
