A zzso designated zzso was isolated by differential screening of zzso libraries made from the zzso and zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso This zzso zzso to a gene zzso expressed in most human cells which is induced to higher levels upon serum stimulation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the abundance of the zzso transcript is approximately zzso higher in transformed as compared to zzso cells after zzso h of serum zzso In the zzso leukemia cell line zzso induced to differentiate the level of zzso zzso starts to decrease between 48 and 72 h following zzso During this period, which represents the commitment phase of zzso zzso cells cease to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, higher levels of zzso gene expression are correlated with cell zzso The zzso zzso codes for a zzso zzso devoid of known consensus zzso and shares zzso zzso with a zzso gene product zzso that is zzso expressed in zzso cells during the early period of cell zzso In addition, the zzso gene product shares approximately 50% identity with a zzso surface zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Distant relationship was also found with other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to multiple sequences within human and other zzso zzso and to fewer sequences in chicken and zzso zzso Although a true relationship between zzso and zzso genes is difficult to zzso the conservation of zzso gene sequences throughout zzso rather suggests that the zzso locus belongs to a new class of genes zzso highly zzso zzso
