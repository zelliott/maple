Increased amounts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso bands have long been recognized as a hallmark of multiple sclerosis zzso B cells and plasma cells are components of the inflammatory infiltrates in both active and chronic zzso zzso and increased numbers of these cells are present in zzso zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze both the zzso B cell and zzso plasma cell populations in zzso of two patients with clinically zzso zzso and of one zzso patient whose zzso was obtained after a clinically isolated syndrome, but before the second zzso zzso analysis of amplified zzso V region sequences identified the rearranged zzso zzso extent of zzso zzso and zzso relationships within and between the two cell populations in the three zzso zzso Expanded B cell and plasma cell clones were detected in each zzso zzso and in all three patients the zzso zzso repertoire was more zzso However, little if any significant sequence overlap was observed between the zzso and zzso zzso of each zzso zzso of plasma cell clones by zzso zzso will facilitate the in zzso production of zzso zzso useful in identifying zzso zzso
