To identify the gene underlying zzso anemia zzso zzso group I we studied zzso zzso families by a zzso linkage analysis, which resulted in 4 candidate regions together encompassing zzso zzso Candidates were selected via zzso and data mining on the basis of their resemblance to other zzso zzso acting in the zzso pathway, such zzso degree of evolutionary zzso presence of nuclear zzso signals and pattern of zzso zzso We found a candidate, zzso on zzso zzso to be zzso in 8 affected individuals previously assigned to zzso group zzso Western blots of zzso zzso indicated that functionally active zzso protein is lacking in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso in zzso cells caused excessive zzso breakage induced by zzso C, a hallmark of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of a zzso cell line was associated with a secondary genetic zzso at the zzso zzso These data add up to two zzso First, zzso is a zzso zzso Second, this gene is identical to zzso since the patient cell lines found zzso in this study included the reference cell line for group I, zzso
