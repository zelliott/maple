The zzso zzso zzso was found to be specific for the beta 1 zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with this zzso induced a vigorous zzso zzso that had similar zzso conditions as zzso induced by a zzso zzso specific for the alpha 4 zzso zzso of a beta 1 zzso on the cell surface was not sufficient for zzso zzso zzso to occur, since cells of the zzso zzso line failed to respond even though they expressed the beta 1 zzso and the zzso zzso However, after zzso with zzso zzso the alpha 4 zzso zzso cells acquired the ability to zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso blocked cell binding to the zzso surface protein vascular cell zzso zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso These results suggest that the beta 1 zzso defined by zzso zzso may play a novel role in regulating zzso adhesive zzso
