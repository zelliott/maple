Previously we found that replacement of seven zzso acid zzso in a loop region markedly shifted the zzso specificity of zzso zzso from zzso toward zzso In the present study, we replaced the seven zzso acid zzso in the corresponding region of an zzso zzso zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso and examined the zzso specificity of the resulting zzso zzso zzso specificity was significantly shifted by zzso toward zzso when k zzso was used as the measure of zzso zzso The effect of the replacements on zzso specificity is discussed based on in zzso simulation of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso
