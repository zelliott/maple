Many insular zzso possess extraordinary abilities to disperse but may differ in their abilities to diversify and zzso While some zzso are widespread across zzso others have zzso zzso zzso These types of zzso exemplified in the literature by selections of unrelated zzso have been interpreted as representing a zzso of expansions and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we use molecular data of 35 out of 40 species of the avian zzso zzso (including 54 out of 66 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess the zzso evolution of the zzso We also include data on species zzso zzso habitat and zzso ranges to test a number of predictions associated with the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso species persist on the largest and highest islands across the zzso whereas recent zzso expansions resulted in colonization of all islands in a zzso For zzso island zzso the earliest colonists generally inhabit the interior and highest parts of an island, with little spatial overlap with later zzso zzso our data support the idea that zzso continuously pass through zzso of expansions and zzso zzso zzso zzso
