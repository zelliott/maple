The zzso region of the zzso zzso in human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso contains a zzso zzso motif that was first described in 1992, but the importance of this motif for zzso function has not yet been zzso Our characterization of the zzso acids surrounding this motif in zzso zzso indicated that the region is critical for zzso zzso In particular, zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be important for the zzso degradation and suppression of cellular zzso zzso However, zzso of these zzso had little effect on the zzso suppression of zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that these four zzso are not important for zzso assembly with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or protein folding in zzso The zzso portion of the zzso zzso motif was found to be required for optimal suppression of zzso zzso or zzso Thus, the zzso motif and surrounding zzso acids represent an important functional domain in the zzso defense against zzso In particular, the positively charged zzso of zzso zzso is invariably zzso within the zzso motif of zzso zzso molecules and was the most critical zzso for zzso zzso A patch of positively charged and zzso zzso zzso and a cluster of zzso zzso zzso were both involved in zzso binding and zzso These structural motifs in zzso zzso represent attractive targets for the development of lead zzso to combat zzso zzso
