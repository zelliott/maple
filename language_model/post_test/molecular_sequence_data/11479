zzso zzso zzso zzso and a synthetic zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso function in the induction of zzso 6 zzso production, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of several proteins in human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso A and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso markedly inhibited zzso production, gene zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso An inactive analog of synthetic zzso replaced zzso to zzso at position 69 in zzso zzso exhibited an zzso effect on the zzso production induced by the zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso functions as an agent in inflammatory reactions and immune responses in the inflamed zzso and zzso zzso in which the participation of protein zzso by zzso zzso and zzso in signal zzso may be zzso
