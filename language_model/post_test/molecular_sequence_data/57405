Human zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso degradation to two major fragments of zzso 40,000 and zzso zzso zzso sequence data and investigation of the zzso specificity of the fragments demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso domain, whereas the zzso zzso shows no zzso zzso The activity profile of the zzso zzso is comparable with the specificity of the intact active zzso zzso zzso but the ability to cleave collagen was zzso The zzso activity of this zzso can be inhibited by either tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The zzso part of the zzso zzso zzso important for the binding reaction with collagen zzso is involved in zzso
