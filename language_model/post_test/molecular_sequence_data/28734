zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso 1) are associated with chronic zzso After zzso screening of a cohort of patients with zzso chronic zzso we report three novel zzso of the zzso zzso and the clinical characteristics of the zzso 

The coding region of the zzso 2 and 3 of the CT gene of 523 patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso patients with suspected zzso zzso zzso and 415 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 82 controls was analyzed after zzso chain reaction zzso Clinical characteristics were obtained by questioning the patients and their relatives and zzso zzso was suspected when two members of a family had chronic zzso A restriction zzso was used to analyze the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was found in 21 index patients, zzso in six index patients, and zzso and zzso in one index patient, all from zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was found in two index patients with a family history of zzso In three patients, the novel point zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso A clear zzso dominant inheritance of chronic zzso was not present in these zzso In 75 index patients from zzso families zzso no zzso could be zzso The zzso zzso zzso was detected in only one patient carrying a CT zzso and was found in 68 zzso of patients with zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso of CT are the most common zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso of zzso I is the most frequent genetic risk factor associated with zzso The CT gene carries several variations that could be associated with chronic zzso To avoid overestimating the zzso impact of novel zzso zzso a detailed clinical characterization of all patients with early onset chronic zzso is zzso
