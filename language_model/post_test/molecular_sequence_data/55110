zzso zzso is a kind of zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso Family zzso In the presence of an zzso zzso in zzso AS is able to catalyze the synthesis of an zzso zzso composed of only zzso using zzso as the only energy zzso Unlike zzso other zzso responsible for the synthesis of such zzso zzso require the addition of expensive zzso zzso These properties make AS an interesting zzso for industrial zzso In this work, the structures and zzso of the two AS were thoroughly investigated for the sake of explaining the reason why zzso zzso zzso zzso is more stable than zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on our results, there are two main factors that contribute to the superior zzso of zzso On the one hand, zzso holds some good structural features that may make positive contributions to the zzso On the other hand, the contacts among zzso of zzso are thought to be zzso more compact than those of zzso Furthermore, the dynamics and unfolding properties of the two AS were also explored by the zzso network model zzso and the zzso network model zzso According to the results of zzso and zzso we have found that the two AS could exhibit a zzso motion, which is probably associated with their zzso What is more, with the discovery of the unfolding zzso of the two zzso we can focus on the weak regions, and hence designing more appropriate zzso for the sake of zzso zzso Taking the results on structure, dynamics and unfolding properties of the two AS into consideration, we have predicted some novel zzso whose zzso is possibly zzso and hopefully these discoveries can be used as guides for our future work on rational zzso
