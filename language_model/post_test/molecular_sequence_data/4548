The zzso zzso zzso exists in two forms zzso zzso and two zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a single zzso Recent data suggest that the zzso zzso at two zzso We zzso selected zzso zzso to zzso the zzso sites in the zzso All 23 receptors zzso in the estimated vicinity of the upstream site zzso into two zzso as determined by zzso zzso to intact zzso In contrast, in a series of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso the downstream zzso zzso site localized to three zzso acids zzso zzso group substitution of these zzso but not substitution of individual zzso abolished zzso Moreover, the zzso that prevented zzso zzso zzso a motif zzso that is zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso after substitution of zzso with other triplets zzso zzso and zzso was consistent with a role for zzso zzso at this zzso In zzso our data zzso support the concept that the zzso zzso at two sites, zzso relate zzso zzso zzso to zzso at the second, downstream site, and zzso suggest that zzso or zzso at site two is related to zzso zzso These findings provide new insight into the evolutionary divergence of two closely related zzso
