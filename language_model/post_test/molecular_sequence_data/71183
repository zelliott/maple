A zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that has been identified in zzso zzso salmon zzso zzso was characterized by zzso and molecular biological zzso zzso is a zzso and the intact molecular mass is estimated as approximately zzso zzso by gel zzso Furthermore, zzso was located only in the zzso fraction of the zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso salmon zzso was isolated and zzso This zzso contained a coding region zzso 216 zzso acid zzso and the molecular mass of this protein is calculated to be zzso The protein and zzso sequencing demonstrates the existence of a remarkable zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class zzso zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso zzso with a length of 950 bases is expressed in zzso zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed strong zzso signals for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso binding activity in zzso zzso column zzso The present study describes for the first time zzso cloning of zzso in fish zzso zzso
