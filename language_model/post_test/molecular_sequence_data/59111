zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso forming the highly active zzso zzso zzso The main difference between these two zzso is a zzso extension of about 30 zzso acid zzso of zzso We present zzso clones for a zzso zzso protein from zzso spinach and zzso which we have named zzso The mature protein consists of only 74, 75 and 76 zzso acid zzso respectively and contains two zzso with significant zzso to the zzso extension of zzso zzso zzso approaches reveal also a specific interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that zzso is, like zzso zzso expressed in green and also in zzso zzso Further zzso is observed between zzso and zzso an open reading frame located in the zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso This gene cluster encodes the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose therefore a common evolutionary origin of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
