A novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from a natural cave in zzso Republic of Korea, using a dilution method and was subjected to characterization using zzso zzso A zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that the zzso belonged to the zzso cluster of the zzso zzso and was most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso % zzso zzso The main zzso properties of strain zzso such as the principal zzso acid of the zzso the zzso zzso and the polar zzso profile, supported zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso was readily differentiated from zzso species with zzso published names on the basis of a broad range of zzso zzso Thus the isolate represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
