zzso a member of the zzso dependent protein zzso family, regulates the activities of other zzso through zzso on their zzso segment, and hence contributes to control of the zzso cell zzso zzso is itself zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but only zzso and zzso can zzso zzso and none of them is able to zzso The zzso segments of the zzso are very similar in zzso Their specificity does not appear to be dictated by the sequences surrounding the zzso sites but by structural zzso at remote zzso Through zzso studies, we have identified regions in zzso responsible for its interaction with zzso A model has been built that explains the molecular basis for the specificity observed in zzso zzso The two zzso are arranged in a zzso zzso arrangement in which the zzso lobe from one zzso zzso against the zzso lobe from the other zzso and the zzso segments are within reach of the opposite zzso zzso Further experiments demonstrate that zzso A zzso pocket is not a recruitment site for zzso
