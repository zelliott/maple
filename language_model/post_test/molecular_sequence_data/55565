zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned into zzso coli and one of the genes obtained using zzso was zzso From zzso and putative zzso acid sequences zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso designated as zzso zzso the gene was found to have closest zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso family 86 zzso The putative protein appears to be a zzso protein because of the absence of a signal zzso The zzso protein was zzso with zzso exchange and gel zzso columns after ammonium zzso zzso and the molecular mass (79 zzso determined by zzso and subsequent zzso agreed with the estimated value, suggesting that the zzso is zzso The optimal pH and temperature for zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and zzso degrees C, and the zzso was stable under 40 degrees zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed production of a zzso and a zzso with a small amount of a zzso during zzso of zzso indicating that the zzso is a zzso
