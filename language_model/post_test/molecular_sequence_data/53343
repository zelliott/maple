We examine the zzso basis of zzso zzso of B cell zzso on a zzso zzso A model zzso zzso containing a single zzso B cell zzso was zzso The primary zzso response to this zzso included zzso directed against diverse zzso presented by the zzso Interestingly, affinity of individual zzso zzso zzso zzso around zzso recognized and was independent of their zzso zzso Furthermore, affinity of zzso directed against the zzso zzso were markedly higher than that of the alternate zzso These studies suggested that the affinity of an zzso primary response, and variations zzso may be determined by the chemical composition of zzso This zzso was supported by zzso analyses of zzso zzso binding to zzso which revealed that this interaction occurs at the expense of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding required compensation by net zzso zzso Finally, the correlation between chemical composition of an zzso the zzso affinity of the early primary zzso response, and its eventual influence on relative zzso could be zzso zzso This was achieved by examining the effect of various zzso zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Such experiments permitted zzso of a hierarchy of individual zzso acid zzso based on their zzso which correlated well with calculated zzso energy changes that individual zzso side chains were expected to contribute in a binding zzso Thus, maturation of a zzso zzso response is initiated by a step that is under zzso zzso
