Growth factors such as insulin regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in many types of zzso However, the mechanism by which the insulin signal is transmitted to the zzso zzso remains largely zzso zzso zzso screening revealed that the zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with protein zzso N zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso potentially implicated in a variety of cellular events, including zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in intact cells, and this interaction was zzso by the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso In addition to a direct interaction, zzso also zzso zzso in the zzso loop and activated zzso zzso treatment or zzso expression of the zzso zzso or zzso but not protein zzso zzso induced zzso zzso reorganization and membrane zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells that zzso express the insulin zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso reorganization in zzso cells was prevented by expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso by zzso appears to be necessary for zzso to zzso signals from the insulin zzso to the zzso zzso
