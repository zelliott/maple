zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulting in zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso have been found to be specific molecular markers for zzso zzso zzso and can be identified in approximately zzso zzso As the prognosis of zzso is worse than that of zzso zzso zzso it is important to accurately distinguish between these 2 zzso This distinction may be difficult on the basis of zzso zzso To detect the genetic zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso have been used in most studies so zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso gene zzso FISH probe, which can detect both of the zzso involving the zzso zzso and tested 20 cases of zzso zzso including 6 cases of zzso 8 zzso 1 zzso type, 5 not otherwise specified zzso and 10 zzso zzso A zzso zzso that could detect both zzso and zzso was also zzso Four zzso independently reviewed all zzso and a consensus diagnosis was also reached in zzso zzso zzso and molecular findings were correlated with clinical outcomes with an average of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by FISH was positive in 4 of 6 zzso zzso and 2 of 5 zzso zzso zzso All other cases, including all zzso were zzso zzso zzso confirmed all FISH zzso While 2 of 6 zzso zzso patients with a zzso zzso died of the disease, there were no deaths among the patients with negative zzso The zzso gene zzso FISH probe is a simple and accurate tool to detect the zzso associated with zzso As characteristic genetic zzso of zzso can be identified in zzso of zzso cases in our study, the FISH zzso would provide an additional useful tool in the diagnosis and prognosis of zzso and an alternative to zzso
