The zzso zzso transcribed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso are zzso controlled by zzso zzso binding to operators that overlap the zzso promoter zzso Using zzso I zzso three additional operators zzso were identified at positions zzso to zzso within the zzso coding zzso To assess a potential regulatory role for these remote operators in zzso a zzso zzso fusion containing all of the zzso and zzso operators was zzso The response of this fusion to the zzso zzso was compared to fusion zzso in which zzso and zzso were zzso either by deletion or by zzso zzso It was found that repression of zzso zzso by binding of zzso zzso to zzso operators was increased about three- to fourfold upon introduction of the remote zzso zzso In addition, two integration host factor zzso binding sites were identified downstream of the zzso zzso start site at positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso A regulatory role for zzso was demonstrated by showing that repression of zzso zzso by zzso was decreased about twofold in strains deficient in zzso and that zzso in zzso and/or zzso decreased repression about two- to zzso The effect of zzso was apparent only when the remote operators were zzso All of the results are consistent with a model of repression involving zzso binding simultaneously to the zzso and remote zzso operators, with intervening DNA forming a zzso
