Recent studies have identified a new family of zzso zzso sequences in many higher zzso zzso zzso of one member of this family, from zzso zzso revealed the zzso to be a zzso zzso This zzso zzso gene designated zzso was identified as the zzso zzso responsible for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso was used to disrupt the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, this had no effect on cell zzso indicating that zzso may not be crucial for normal zzso zzso zzso This observation has implications for our understanding of the role of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso in lower zzso
