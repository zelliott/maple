zzso reactions of zzso zzso peptides generated by zzso laser zzso were studied using zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso mass zzso Several zzso and zzso sample preparation methods were evaluated for high-intensity zzso currents that could last for the entire zzso zzso A triple zzso sample preparation procedure with zzso acid as the zzso was found to yield abundant zzso zzso signals of the zzso zzso zzso The principal zzso product of these zzso zzso is the zzso + Na + zzso zzso which provides an zzso identification of the zzso zzso of a zzso In some zzso the loss of a second zzso from the zzso is also zzso No other zzso zzso were zzso
