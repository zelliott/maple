zzso zzso zzso protein is an integral part of the zzso zzso where it coats the zzso zzso zzso Due to its zzso acid binding and zzso activities, NC protein directs the zzso of the zzso primer to the primer binding site and greatly zzso minus strand DNA zzso and transfer while protecting the zzso acids against zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso in viral DNA zzso we examined the influence of zzso on zzso versus zzso reverse zzso The results show that zzso zzso can extensively inhibit zzso reverse zzso of viral and cellular zzso while promoting zzso synthesis of zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso the presence of zzso in the viral DNA during minus strand zzso was zzso zzso zzso the zzso between a zzso primer containing one to five consecutive errors and an zzso representing the 3' end of the zzso The ability of reverse zzso zzso in the presence of zzso to subsequently extend the zzso zzso depended upon the position of the mismatch within the zzso zzso When the zzso were at the zzso site, primer extension by zzso in the presence of zzso was very high, about zzso for one mismatch and zzso for five consecutive zzso zzso within the DNA primer or at its zzso end had little effect on the extension of viral DNA by zzso Taken together these results indicate that zzso plays major roles in zzso DNA synthesis within the zzso core due to its ability to promote zzso zzso DNA synthesis while zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso of viral and cellular zzso Moreover, the observation that zzso enhances the incorporation of zzso during minus strand DNA zzso zzso the notion that zzso is a factor contributing to the high zzso rate of zzso
