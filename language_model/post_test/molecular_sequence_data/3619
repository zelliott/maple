The coronavirus membrane zzso protein is the most abundant zzso protein and the key component in viral assembly and zzso The M protein of mouse zzso virus zzso is an integral membrane protein with a short zzso three zzso zzso and a large zzso zzso facing the interior of the viral zzso The zzso zzso of zzso M has previously been shown to be extremely sensitive to zzso both in a zzso particle expression system and in the intact zzso We have constructed a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso of the M protein that was previously thought to be zzso This zzso was isolated by means of targeted zzso zzso with a powerful host zzso selection allowed by the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso containing the zzso of the zzso infectious zzso virus S zzso Analysis of multiple zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has revealed changes in regions of both the M protein and the zzso zzso protein that can compensate for the loss of the last two zzso of the M zzso Our data thus provide the first genetic evidence for a structural interaction between the zzso zzso of the M and N proteins of zzso In addition, this work demonstrates the efficacy of targeted zzso with zzso for the systematic genetic analysis of coronavirus structural protein zzso
