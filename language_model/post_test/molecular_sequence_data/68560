We used the zzso zzso zzso for the expression of zzso zzso of zzso toxin II zzso The zzso zzso of the genes that code for either the zzso or zzso zzso was genetically fused to the 3' zzso of the gene coding for the zzso zzso zzso which serves as a carrier in this expression zzso The zzso genes were constructed zzso by zzso chain reaction, with appropriate restriction sites to permit zzso downstream zzso of the zzso The resulting plasmids containing the A and B zzso genes were designated zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli laboratory strains harboring zzso with zzso zzso yielding only small quantities of zzso fusion zzso Since zzso induction was lethal for cells harboring zzso we constructed the zzso zzso zzso which contained a zzso zzso of zzso but without the zzso signal zzso With this construct we were able to express very large quantities of a zzso fusion zzso which was zzso by affinity zzso on immobilized zzso and used as an zzso in zzso zzso zzso serum against native zzso as well as all of 12 serum samples with high zzso activity against zzso reacted with zzso zzso from an zzso coli zzso expression system, whereas only 3 of 208 human serum samples with low zzso zzso and none of 54 serum samples with no zzso capability zzso Failure of specific zzso with the zzso fusion protein in the majority of human serum samples with low zzso activity suggests that serum factors other than zzso may be responsible for zzso activity in these zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso as the zzso can be recommended for use in a diagnostic setting as a simple and reliable approach to detect specific human serum zzso to zzso
