An zzso zzso shuttle zzso zzso containing a zzso reporter zzso was constructed and used to zzso the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso A zzso zzso region immediately upstream of zzso promoted expression of the zzso gene in zzso coli and zzso zzso A smaller promoter zzso zzso zzso promoted expression with equal efficiency, and was used in all further zzso Two zzso start sites were mapped by primer extension analysis to 47 and 56 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso promoters associated with these show similarity to previously identified zzso zzso zzso in the promoter fragment, introduced with zzso zzso and restriction zzso revealed that a region between 559 and zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation zzso designated the upstream zzso region zzso is essential for promoter activity in zzso coli, and is required for optimal activity in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also able to increase expression from the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso in zzso coli and zzso in zzso zzso An alternative promoter is active in deletion zzso in which either the zzso or the zzso promoters identified here are zzso zzso from the zzso promoter zzso during late exponential phase, and declines during stationary zzso The promoter is induced by zzso acid, and is zzso by oxygen limitation and growth at elevated zzso The promoter zzso exhibited similar activities in zzso zzso zzso as they did in zzso zzso
