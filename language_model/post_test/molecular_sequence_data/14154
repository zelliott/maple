For genetic analysis of zzso zzso we have modified the zzso method to use zzso with G + C contents of zzso In zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso generated twice the number of both amplification products per primer and zzso among zzso as compared to the standard zzso G + C zzso With respect to segregation and genetic zzso zzso markers generated by the zzso zzso behaved as do zzso markers produced by the standard zzso These zzso zzso also yielded increased numbers of amplification products in zzso on the zzso of a broad range of other zzso
