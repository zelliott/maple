zzso are a group of zzso proteins responsible for cohesion between zzso sister zzso during zzso and zzso and which are implicated in zzso break repair and zzso zzso We describe here the identification and zzso of an zzso gene - zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is essential for zzso zzso zzso Five independent zzso of the zzso gene were isolated by zzso zzso and the zzso show complete male and female zzso zzso mother cells zzso of zzso zzso show multiple zzso defects which are represented by zzso zzso and zzso fragmentation at zzso I, and zzso fragments and zzso bridges in zzso I and zzso zzso zzso segregation is strongly affected, resulting in zzso products of uneven size, shape and of variable zzso The similarities in zzso and the sequence zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso suggests that zzso function is largely zzso between zzso and highlights the essential role zzso play in plant zzso
