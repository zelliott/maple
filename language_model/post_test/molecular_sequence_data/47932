zzso such as zzso and zzso play a central role in cellular metabolism and zzso communication between zzso Essential to these roles is their rapid transport across the plasma zzso which is zzso by a recently identified family of zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine zzso sequences have so far been identified in zzso each having a different tissue distribution, whereas six related proteins can be recognized in zzso zzso and 4 in zzso zzso zzso demonstration of zzso zzso and zzso transport has been demonstrated for zzso zzso but only for zzso and zzso have detailed analyses of zzso and inhibitor zzso been described following zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso but is especially prominent in heart and red muscle, where it is zzso in response to increased work, suggesting a special role in zzso acid zzso By contrast, zzso is most evident in white muscle and other cells with a high zzso rate, such as zzso cells and white blood cells, suggesting it is expressed where zzso acid zzso zzso zzso has a zzso higher affinity for zzso than zzso and zzso and is found in cells where rapid zzso at low zzso zzso may be required, including the zzso kidney zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is uniquely expressed in the retinal zzso zzso The mechanisms involved in regulating the expression of different zzso zzso remain to be zzso However, there is evidence for alternative zzso of the zzso and zzso regions and the use of alternative promoters for some zzso In addition, zzso and zzso have been shown to interact specifically with zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso with a single zzso zzso This interaction appears to assist zzso expression at the cell zzso There is still much work to be done to characterize the properties of the different zzso and their regulation, which may have wide-ranging implications for health and zzso In the future it will be interesting to explore the linkage of genetic diseases to particular zzso through their zzso zzso
