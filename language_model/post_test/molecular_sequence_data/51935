Recently, we characterized a zzso clone that encodes a human brain zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we identified a second population of zzso suspected to zzso a new brain zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso C2 displays significant zzso with zzso C1 in the highly zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso found in the 3' zzso domain of all zzso zzso zzso However, outside this domain, the zzso is extremely low, suggesting that the corresponding zzso originates from a different zzso We report here the first zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes determined by in zzso zzso of human zzso zzso spreads using human brain zzso zzso specific for each zzso The probe corresponding to zzso C1 exhibited a strong specific signal on zzso zzso with a major peak in the band zzso In contrast, the zzso C2 probe zzso to zzso zzso with a major peak in the band zzso The two zzso zzso at the two zzso without any cross zzso Thus, in human brain, a zzso population of zzso zzso zzso is zzso and the corresponding genes might be under the control of independent regulatory zzso
