The development of an effective malaria vaccine has been hampered by the genetic diversity of commonly used target zzso This diversity has led to concerns about zzso immunity limiting the effectiveness of zzso Despite extensive genetic diversity of zzso protein zzso the most successful malaria vaccine is zzso a zzso zzso zzso By use of zzso parallel zzso we evaluated the diversity of zzso zzso across the zzso zzso in zzso from zzso zzso We identified 57 unique zzso zzso from 100 zzso By use of ecological and molecular indexes of diversity, we saw no difference in the diversity of zzso zzso between adults and zzso We saw evidence of weak zzso selection within this region of zzso suggesting naturally acquired immunity does induce zzso selection on zzso zzso the impact of zzso vaccines on zzso zzso with widespread zzso of vaccination requires further zzso
