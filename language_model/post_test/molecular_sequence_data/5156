zzso zzso are unusually rich in zzso fatty zzso a property that zzso them to the deleterious effects of oxygen free zzso Mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso oxygen free zzso In the zzso zzso there is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that specifically protects membrane zzso against zzso zzso is present, primarily, in zzso where its zzso activity seems to be present only after zzso In order to clarify this question we zzso total zzso from rat zzso liver and lung to carry out zzso synthesis and the following zzso amplification of zzso products by using specific zzso of rat liver zzso zzso products of the expected size for zzso zzso zzso were obtained from the three zzso At last, these fragments were submitted to sequencing zzso Here we demonstrate that the sequence analysis of rat zzso zzso coding region is identical to that of rat liver and zzso however zzso influences the expression pattern of rat zzso zzso In fact Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from normal and zzso zzso rats demonstrates the absence of a specific zzso zzso in total zzso from zzso zzso rat zzso on the other hand this specific transcript is present in both normal rat zzso and liver and in zzso zzso rat zzso zzso pattern of zzso is very low in lung both in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Therefore zzso could regulate zzso transcript in rat zzso
