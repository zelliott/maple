The zzso River is strongly affected by the zzso from the zzso wastewater treatment plant zzso downstream of the city of zzso We have shown that the zzso introduce large amounts of zzso and inoculate the receiving medium with zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the diversity of the zzso bacterial population by identifying zzso bacteria from upstream and/or zzso zzso bacteria from the zzso zzso zzso of potential zzso activity, competitive zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA fragments specific to zzso bacteria zzso were used to explore the succession and shifts of the zzso community in the lower zzso River and to analyze the zzso and spatial functioning of the system at several different sampling zzso A major revelation was the stability of the zzso The zzso zzso used in this study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Stephen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1997) were shown not to be completely specific to zzso of the beta zzso of zzso We further demonstrated that when zzso patterns are zzso all the different bands must be zzso as one major zzso band proved to be affiliated with a group of zzso in the beta zzso of zzso The majority of zzso (75 to zzso present in the lower zzso river downstream of the zzso output belong to lineage zzso represented by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This dominant lineage was represented by three bands on the zzso zzso The major zzso zzso species, introduced by the zzso zzso survived and might have grown in the receiving medium far zzso in the zzso it represented about zzso of the whole zzso zzso The other two species belonging to lineage zzso seem to be zzso zzso One of them developed a few kilometers downstream of the zzso zzso input in an zzso environment, and the other appeared in the freshwater part of the zzso and was apparently more adapted to zzso conditions, zzso an increase in the amount of suspended matter, a low zzso zzso and high turnover of organic zzso The rest of the zzso population was represented in equal proportions by zzso and zzso zzso zzso
