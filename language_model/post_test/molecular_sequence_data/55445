The zzso Human zzso Project zzso has produced several hundred zzso data sets, allowing studies of the many functional elements in zzso microbial zzso Here, we survey the distribution of oral zzso implicated in dental diseases in normal human individuals, using zzso sites associated with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso taking advantage of the multiple copies of the zzso zzso sites zzso in the zzso and using a targeted assembly approach that we have zzso We find that zzso zzso species are present in zzso of the normal human subjects included in the zzso Further, we are able to de zzso assemble the zzso gene zzso using our constrained assembly approach, which employs a unique application of the de zzso graph assembly zzso most of these cassette genes were not assembled in zzso zzso and could not be identified by mapping sequencing reads onto the known reference zzso zzso due to the dynamic nature of zzso gene zzso Our study significantly zzso the gene pool known to be carried by zzso zzso zzso totaling 826 zzso zzso zzso zzso We characterize the functions of these gene zzso many of these genes have unknown zzso The zzso gene cassette zzso found in the human zzso are extraordinarily zzso with different microbial communities sharing only a small number of common zzso
