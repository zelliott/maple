A zzso containing the multiple drug resistance zzso zzso was used to zzso cultures of zzso selected human zzso cells, on zzso zzso in the presence of zzso growth factors zzso and zzso following collection from patients recently recovered from zzso zzso In one experiment, these zzso selected cells were grown in Dexter cultures for 35 days or more following zzso zzso and then zzso in zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of colonies picked after 10-14 days of zzso culture, using a set of zzso that are specific for the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso showed that the long-term culture initiating cells zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso Analysis of the colonies from the zzso selected zzso zzso cells, with a reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso that could distinguish viral zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso showed that the viral zzso zzso levels were much higher than that of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso gene in the zzso zzso selected zzso Fluorescence activated cell sorting zzso analysis of the zzso selected zzso zzso cells within 48 h after the zzso using the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso showed that the zzso frequency under these conditions varied from 7 to zzso zzso zzso studies showed that this additional zzso was functional and that the frequency of cells with high zzso levels was higher in the zzso cells than in the zzso zzso The resistance to zzso of the zzso selected zzso cells, as judged by the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso cells derived from these cells by growth in zzso supplemented with zzso was much higher in the zzso cells than in zzso zzso In order to test the zzso of the zzso frequency of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso viral producer cells on zzso selected cells, the virus produced from 12 different lots of zzso from the zzso zzso producer cell line was used to zzso zzso selected zzso cells from four different patients, and to zzso the peripheral blood cells of two additional patients collected following zzso zzso The zzso lots used for these zzso experiments were tested by zzso Associates zzso MD, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and amplification tests in the zzso and found to be negative for zzso zzso and later approved for human use by the Food and Drug zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
