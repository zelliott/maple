DAN gene is shown to be localized at human zzso zzso which resides within the consensus deletion observed in zzso In the present study, we have isolated the zzso DNA containing the entire human DAN gene and determined its zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that DAN gene is composed of four zzso and spans approximately 15 zzso Its overall structure was basically the same as that of rat DAN zzso Two distinct zzso initiation sites zzso and zzso were identified by the primer extension zzso zzso zzso and zzso elements are present 38 and zzso zzso upstream from the major zzso start site, respectively, however, no apparent zzso sequence was found in the upstream region of the minor zzso start zzso The zzso region immediately upstream from the major zzso initiation site was strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern experiments demonstrated that the zzso loss of DAN gene might occur in zzso Interestingly, there exist two zzso repeats, zzso and zzso in the first zzso of DAN zzso raising the possibility to distinguish two zzso of DAN gene in some of the cancer zzso
