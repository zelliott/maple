The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the TM domain of zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso of the zzso family is linked to zzso the most common form of human zzso The molecular mechanism of pathology induction is under debate, and two different mechanisms have been proposed to contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilization and zzso slow zzso of the activated zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso does not alter the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso or in zzso zzso This result indicates that zzso in zzso cannot be explained simply by a higher zzso propensity of the zzso zzso TM domain, thus highlighting the importance of the observed slow zzso in zzso zzso
