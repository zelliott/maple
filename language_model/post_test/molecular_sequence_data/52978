The human zzso gene is expressed in the zzso layer during the late stages of the zzso zzso The zzso promoter region of the gene zzso high levels of zzso zzso via interactions with zzso zzso Here we provide evidence for another level of complexity in the regulation of the zzso promoter zzso The zzso domain proteins zzso zzso and zzso which are abundantly expressed in the zzso cells, act to both stimulate and repress zzso in a general and a cell zzso zzso While binding to specific recognition elements within the promoter region, they exert their effects by either stimulating or zzso the zzso activity of the zzso The response of the promoter to forced expression of the zzso domain proteins reflects the effect of these zzso factors on the zzso zzso zzso synthesis and suggests that the latter requires a fine balance in the amounts and the activities of the individual zzso protein 1 and zzso domain zzso
