zzso zzso zzso zzso is a human pathogen with a broad host zzso Following the sequencing of zzso zzso of the estimated zzso zzso zzso zzso simple sequence repeats zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of four such repeats from various human and animal zzso zzso zzso identified extensive sequence zzso and enabled the development of a zzso zzso method to study the epidemiology of this zzso We zzso zzso zzso DNA extracted from 197 zzso samples originating from children with zzso who were residing in zzso zzso Three newly identified zzso markers and the internal transcribed zzso were zzso zzso and multiple cloned zzso for each marker were zzso from each zzso Most zzso sequences were unique to the Ugandan zzso zzso zzso not only was present among zzso but was also found within zzso This observation suggests that infections with zzso zzso zzso populations are common in this zzso However, the data do not exclude that some of the zzso originates from divergent zzso within the zzso The frequent occurrence of multiple sequences within an isolate precluded the identification of zzso zzso This observation raises the possibility that in a region in which the prevalence of zzso zzso is high, sequencing of zzso zzso products may not be adequate for zzso zzso
