A zzso molecular cascade involving zzso signaling that patterns the zzso of the lateral zzso in zzso has been extensively zzso but processes involved in the initial break of zzso zzso symmetry are just beginning to be zzso Here we report that zzso zzso and zzso function upstream of zzso signaling to regulate zzso patterning in zzso zzso down zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso cells zzso which are precursors of zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to disrupt zzso gene expression in the lateral plate zzso and zzso the placement of internal zzso indicating that the activity of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso is crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments show that zzso zzso are immobile and the directional fluid flow in zzso is abolished in zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting their essential role in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso levels are elevated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that the defects in zzso zzso zzso fluid flow and placement of internal zzso induced by their zzso could be suppressed by zzso the activity of zzso protein zzso zzso Together, our data demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso patterning by modulating zzso calcium levels in zzso and by influencing zzso function, revealing a previously zzso role for calcium signaling in zzso zzso
