The role of zzso was addressed by down regulating its expression using an zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso clones displayed a decrease in zzso level down to zzso of zzso The reduction in zzso expression dramatically slowed down the zzso of cell zzso zzso cells, spread out onto zzso exhibited large peripheral zzso zzso In contrast, cells with reduced zzso expression showed smaller focal contacts localized all over the zzso face, and displayed a marked decrease in the number of stress zzso zzso experiments carried out with a zzso zzso on zzso zzso indicated a shift in the mobility for both alpha 5 and beta 1 zzso Surprisingly, beta 1 zzso chains could not be detected by indirect zzso using zzso zzso in zzso deficient zzso Western zzso analysis indicated the presence of two forms of beta zzso We analyzed the processing of beta 1 in normal and zzso deficient cells using pulse chase zzso zzso cells required a minimum of 5 hours for the processing of mature beta 1, while the zzso deficient zzso clone showed that the beta 1 precursor was slowly converted into a very low molecular mass zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso plays a central role in the establishment of zzso zzso In addition, down regulation of zzso zzso the folding and processing of beta 1 zzso
