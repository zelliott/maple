A zzso sequence close to the 3' end of the internal zzso of a model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was replaced by a random zzso resulting in a pool of zzso which, like the initial zzso zzso were spliced in zzso by a zzso leading to zzso skipping of the internal zzso The zzso zzso were subjected to a selection zzso resulting in a pool enriched in zzso that efficiently included the internal zzso Isolation and sequencing of a number of clones corresponding to the selected zzso showed that two classes of sequences were selected from the initial zzso Most abundant among these were sequences with zzso tracts similar to those in the recently identified zzso enhancers while a smaller class included sequences lacking discernible zzso tracts within the zzso zzso zzso of selected zzso showed that the zzso tracts vary in their ability to promote zzso inclusion and, more important, that sequences lacking zzso tracts stimulate inclusion of the internal zzso as efficiently as their zzso zzso The latter result indicates the existence of a novel class of zzso recognition sequences or zzso zzso
