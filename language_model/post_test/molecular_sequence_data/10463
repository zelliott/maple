zzso zzso DNA zzso molecules consist of zzso DNA zzso linked to zzso Such molecules are zzso by genetic elements called zzso Unlike other zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso coli 161 produces zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso at zzso where the slash indicates the zzso zzso In order to investigate factors responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was treated with zzso and colonies were screened for zzso zzso We isolated three zzso which were defective in zzso zzso and produced zzso zzso They were all affected in zzso a gene for zzso with a base substitution at the bottom part of the zzso zzso In contrast, base substitution at and around the zzso site has no marked effect on zzso synthesis or its zzso From these results, we concluded that the zzso at the bottom of the zzso zzso but not the zzso at the zzso site, play a major role in the recognition and zzso of zzso zzso
