It is well known that the bone zzso contains proteins which can induce zzso zzso bone formation in zzso One class of these proteins is the bone zzso protein zzso In order to investigate the zzso function of the zzso its zzso was attempted from an extract of zzso bone zzso and its actions on the zzso cell line were zzso To isolate the zzso a zzso bone zzso was extracted with zzso zzso A zzso fraction zzso was separated from the zzso bone extract by dialysis against distilled water and zzso The zzso was zzso from zzso by gel zzso on zzso zzso HR, zzso exchange with zzso zzso affinity column and finally by zzso reverse phase zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that the zzso zzso fraction contained zzso reported by zzso et zzso zzso In order to investigate its function, the zzso was applied to the rat zzso zzso cell line zzso The zzso inhibited the growth of the zzso cells and enhanced the alkaline zzso activity in a zzso zzso
