T cells and natural killer zzso cells perform complementary roles in the cellular immune zzso T cells identify infected cells directly through recognition of zzso peptides that are displayed at the target cell surface by the classical major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso cells monitor the target cell surface for malfunction of this display system, zzso potentially infected cells that might otherwise evade recognition by the T zzso Human killer cell zzso receptors zzso control this process by either zzso or zzso the zzso activity of zzso cells via specific binding to zzso class I molecules on the target zzso 

We report the crystal structure of the zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso which is specific for the human zzso class I zzso zzso and related zzso The structure shows the predicted zzso of two tandem zzso zzso but comparison with the previously reported structure of the related zzso zzso reveals an unexpected change of 23 degrees in the relative orientation of these zzso 

The altered orientation of the zzso zzso maintains an unusually acute zzso elbow angle, which therefore appears to be a distinctive feature of the zzso The putative zzso class I binding site is located on the outer surface of the elbow, spanning both zzso The unexpected observation that this binding site can be modulated by differences in the relative domain zzso has implications for the general mechanism of zzso class I complex zzso
