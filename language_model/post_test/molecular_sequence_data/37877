zzso 1 zzso is a common zzso disorder with a wide range of neurological zzso The case histories of five patients, including two siblings, are reported who have both zzso 1 and primary progressive multiple sclerosis zzso A further patient with both zzso and zzso has since been zzso More recently, a systematic clinical review of 138 zzso adult patients with zzso identified one patient with a slowly progressive zzso zzso and multiple high signal zzso on zzso weighted zzso zzso genetic studies suggest a mechanism by which the clinical association of progressive white matter disease and zzso might zzso The gene for zzso is located on zzso zzso spans 350 zzso of zzso DNA, and contains 60 zzso The gene for zzso zzso zzso zzso is embedded within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a membrane zzso that appears in the human zzso at the time of zzso It can be detected zzso on zzso zzso and on the surface of cultured zzso zzso zzso has the potential to function as an zzso zzso and could contribute to the interactions between the plasma zzso of zzso and zzso required for zzso and/or zzso zzso This study considers the specific hypothesis that zzso in patients with zzso results from concurrent zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso genes of four unrelated patients with zzso and zzso were examined using a combination of Southern zzso dosage zzso chain reaction, and chemical zzso of zzso The entire zzso coding zzso all zzso zzso the zzso zzso and 1 zzso of zzso sequence were zzso The DNA from two patients was found to contain an zzso in the zzso gene resulting in an zzso acid change of zzso to zzso acid at zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso in patients with zzso can occur without concurrent zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso to zzso acid zzso zzso at zzso 21 is neither sufficient nor necessary for the development of zzso
