We have developed zzso zzso for the direct identification of wild zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso are complementary to sequences of the first 30 to 32 zzso of zzso which evolve more extensively zzso zzso than the rest of zzso To illustrate our general approach, we describe the design of zzso specific to each of four major zzso recently endemic zzso to zzso to the zzso Andean type 1, Brazil type 1, Brazil type 3, and Central zzso type zzso A wild isolate of each zzso was selected according to molecular and zzso criteria to be representative of the principal lineages in zzso zzso zzso sequences of the representative zzso were amplified by the reverse zzso zzso and were inserted into a zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso The in zzso zzso labeled with zzso served as zzso These formed stable hybrids only with zzso of zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso were detected by a sensitive zzso zzso capable under normal diagnostic conditions of detecting specific wild zzso sequences in samples containing up to a zzso excess of zzso vaccine zzso sequences of the same zzso
