We have used a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction procedure zzso zzso to isolate zzso corresponding to transcripts that accumulate in zzso zzso zzso In this report we describe the characterization of an zzso transcript, zzso zzso zzso in zzso plants was detected at low levels in zzso leaves, and flower buds and at higher levels in roots and mature zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso induced in leaves 3- to zzso within the first 6 h of ozone zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso induced 3- to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that it encodes a zzso zzso basic protein that contains a putative signal zzso and two potential zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso represents a novel stress-related protein that accumulates in response to the production of active oxygen zzso
