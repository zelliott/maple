In this brief review, the use of synthetic peptides representing linear zzso sites in human zzso virus zzso structural proteins for detection of zzso in zzso from zzso individuals is zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso zzso offer unique advantages for determination of zzso zzso In particular, various peptides representing the region of zzso acids zzso in the zzso zzso have been effectively zzso Of primary importance is the fact that properly designed zzso zzso tests allow a distinction between zzso zzso a quality not provided by any other currently available zzso Furthermore, synthetic zzso zzso allow the design of highly simplified and effectively standardized zzso zzso they lend themselves to use for screening purposes or zzso zzso not only in zzso countries, but also in developing zzso It is also possible that tests with selected peptides may measure zzso which have value in predicting the risk for infection in children born to zzso mothers and for progression of disease in infected zzso
