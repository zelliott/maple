zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso that is zzso in association with the zzso membrane from zzso zzso zzso As a first step towards determining the possible zzso of this protein in zzso the mouse zzso gene zzso has been cloned from a zzso cell zzso zzso Over 14 zzso of DNA was zzso including the entire zzso unit of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso and 3' zzso region, zzso In addition, the overall structure of the bovine gene zzso was determined by amplification of zzso DNA by the zzso chain zzso Both zzso and zzso comprise seven zzso and six zzso The signal sequence and two zzso folds of the zzso domain and the membrane anchor are zzso by separate zzso and the zzso domain is zzso by two short zzso and a large terminal zzso that also includes 3' untranslated zzso The zzso gene appears to have evolved from a subset of genes in the zzso zzso and genes zzso the zzso domain, which is zzso in a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected specifically in the zzso zzso by zzso protection zzso zzso increased during the last half of pregnancy and was zzso during zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso was analyzed for putative regulatory elements and is different from the promoters of other zzso zzso zzso should be useful for determining the mechanisms underlying zzso gene expression and potentially for the production of zzso proteins in the milk of transgenic zzso
