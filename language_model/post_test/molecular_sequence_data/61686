We describe the isolation of zzso growth factor independent 1 zzso and present an analysis of its pattern of expression during early zzso As with its zzso zzso zzso expression is detected in the zzso cells of the neural zzso and in developing hair cells of the zzso In keeping with a role in the development of sensory hair cells, zzso is also expressed in zzso of the anterior and zzso lateral line zzso Finally, zzso is expressed in the developing zzso in the zzso zzso where its zzso is restricted to the zzso
