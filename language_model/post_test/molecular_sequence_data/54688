zzso has been known to play a critical role in the maintenance of zzso of embryonic stem zzso Recent research has shown that zzso is also expressed in partial tumor cell lines and zzso This study is aimed to develop a real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso for relative quantitative detection of zzso zzso and discrimination from zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A locked zzso acid zzso probe was designed to discern the single base difference zzso to identify zzso zzso An zzso primer was designed to avoid false positive caused by zzso zzso In addition, a house keeping gene zzso zzso zzso was measured in parallel to zzso the differences between samples and zzso 

zzso showed that the newly established zzso zzso amplified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gave negative zzso Cell lines zzso and zzso showed positive results in zzso zzso while for zzso and zzso cell lines, as well as primary peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso expression was zzso Additionally, the relative quantity of zzso zzso was calculated by cycle threshold zzso method and house keeping gene zzso 

This technique proved to be effective for relative zzso of zzso zzso with high zzso
