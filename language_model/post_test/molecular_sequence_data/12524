The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been reported to induce zzso changes in cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and competes for zzso binding on zzso zzso suggesting that it may mediate zzso responses to zzso However, we now show that zzso is a zzso and potent zzso for the zzso inflammatory zzso alpha zzso zzso on zzso normal T zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso order for zzso changes zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound directly to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 and 7 zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso by all zzso zzso tested except zzso In contrast, binding to zzso zzso was zzso only by zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso for zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a functional zzso for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso which otherwise have distinct zzso for zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso responses to zzso could be zzso by both zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso responses to zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso
