A twin zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in transport of folded proteins across the inner zzso was identified in the signal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the precursor form of zzso carrying a zzso His tag in an zzso background and subsequent zzso with zzso zzso showed that only the mature form of zzso associated with the membrane and that the precursor form of zzso was entirely found in the zzso When zzso was expressed without the signal zzso most of it remained in the zzso where it was apparently correctly folded and showed activity comparable to that of the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signal zzso affected both the processing and zzso of zzso confirming a critical role for the zzso system in membrane targeting of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to the zzso face of the inner membrane in zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso K treatment of zzso and also by zzso cell sorting analysis of cells expressing zzso fluorescent protein zzso with and without an zzso tag that targets zzso proteins to the zzso zzso
