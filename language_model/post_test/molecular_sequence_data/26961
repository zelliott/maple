Most studies of bacterial zzso have used nitrate zzso as the first electron zzso whereas relatively less is understood about zzso zzso zzso We isolated novel bacteria that proliferated in the presence of high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among several zzso was zzso positioned within the alpha zzso of zzso and identified as zzso zzso zzso This strain zzso zzso as well as zzso The gene clusters for zzso zzso zzso nor, and zzso were cloned from zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso and nor zzso were zzso We confirmed that zzso in the zzso zzso produced a functional zzso zzso containing copper that was involved in bacterial zzso zzso The strain zzso up to 40 zzso zzso to zzso under zzso conditions in which other zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli neither proliferated nor reduced zzso Under zzso zzso conditions, zzso zzso zzso and its type strain zzso zzso proliferated even in the presence of higher levels of zzso zzso zzso and both were considerably more resistant to zzso zzso than were the other strains noted zzso These results indicated that zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso that has evolved zzso nitrogen oxide tolerance zzso
