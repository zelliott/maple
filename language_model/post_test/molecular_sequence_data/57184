zzso of the zzso zzso outer membrane protein is zzso under zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso derived from clones containing the zzso iron zzso region revealed the existence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is only expressed under zzso conditions and acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso with slight but discernible decrease in the zzso level of zzso zzso determined by zzso protection and by Northern zzso zzso zzso extension experiments revealed that the level of several possible zzso transcripts was reduced in the presence of zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso expression is slightly reduced in the presence of zzso coli zzso We have identified and cloned a zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso
