An unusual zzso zzso zzso zzso in which all zzso zzso are zzso on both strands for zzso base pairs, has been reported at zzso origins of DNA zzso This report had far-reaching implications in understanding of DNA zzso and DNA zzso For example, since this zzso appeared in about zzso of zzso cells, but not in stationary cells, it may regulate origin zzso In an effort to confirm and extend these zzso the zzso at the well characterized zzso locus 17 zzso downstream of the zzso gene in zzso of Chinese zzso zzso cells was checked for zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso status of this region was examined in randomly zzso and stationary cells and in cell populations enriched in the zzso zzso or zzso + M zzso of their cell division zzso DNA was subjected to 1) zzso by zzso restriction zzso 2) zzso modification of zzso followed by zzso zzso and 3) zzso modification of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso The zzso reaction is a novel method for direct detection of zzso zzso that zzso the more commonly used zzso zzso These methods were capable of detecting zzso in zzso of the zzso At the region of the proposed zzso only one zzso at a zzso site was zzso However, the zzso zzso was not detected in any of these cell populations using any of these zzso
