After zzso in the zzso the zzso zzso is activated in zzso zzso by the spontaneous zzso among other zzso of the major zzso heat shock zzso zzso in the absence of zzso of heat shock zzso To obtain information on this phenomenon, we have zzso one- and zzso zzso ability to express zzso reporter DNA zzso containing the zzso coli zzso gene driven by promoters from early zzso zzso the human zzso zzso and the normal or zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso of these promoters was also tested in mouse zzso cells and zzso zzso as a function of zzso construct zzso and occurrence of heat zzso The zzso promoter was zzso in both zzso cells and zzso Its heat zzso required the presence of zzso and, in the zzso of construct linear zzso In the zzso however, this promoter was expressed independently of the presence of zzso and of construct zzso and its activity was not affected by heat zzso When zzso with early zzso and zzso promoters were injected into zzso zzso they appeared to be zzso with the first embryonic zzso in agreement with previous observations zzso et zzso zzso By contrast, both normal and zzso zzso promoters maintained their activity through the first zzso providing the first evidence of a gene escaping such zzso zzso Present results confirm previous findings on zzso expression during early mouse development, and suggest that this zzso is zzso by a zzso other than zzso
