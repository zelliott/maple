The crystal structure of purple acid zzso from rat bone has been determined by molecular replacement and the structure has been refined to zzso A resolution to an R zzso of zzso % (R zzso zzso zzso The core of the zzso consists of two zzso mixed zzso with each sheet flanked by zzso zzso on one zzso The two sheets pack towards each other forming a zzso The zzso center, located at the bottom of the zzso pocket at one edge of the zzso contains a zzso or zzso bridge and both metal zzso are observed in an almost perfect zzso coordination zzso The electron density map indicates that a zzso bridge is found in the metal center and that at least one zzso zzso is located in the first coordination sphere of one of the metal zzso The zzso study of rat purple acid zzso reveals that the zzso zzso are very similar in overall structure to the plant zzso in spite of only 18 % overall sequence zzso In particular, coordination and geometry of the iron cluster is preserved in both zzso and comparison of the zzso suggests a common mechanism for the zzso and plant zzso However, significant differences are found in the architecture of the zzso binding zzso
