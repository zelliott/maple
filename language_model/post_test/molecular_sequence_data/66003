We have previously demonstrated that zzso of three single zzso zzso zzso within the first zzso of the zzso gene are extremely strongly associated with variation in human eye zzso In the present work, we describe additional fine association mapping of eye color zzso in the zzso region upstream of zzso and within the neighboring zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso We screened an additional 92 zzso in zzso European individuals and found that a single zzso in zzso 86 of zzso zzso predicted eye color significantly better zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association zzso zzso zzso than our previous best zzso zzso zzso of sequence alignments of multiple species showed that this zzso lies in the center of a short highly zzso sequence and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso breaks up this zzso zzso part of which forms a consensus binding site for the zzso zzso factor zzso We were also able to demonstrate the zzso zzso zzso coding zzso acts as a zzso modifier of this new zzso zzso for eye color, and somewhat zzso of melanoma zzso We conclude that the zzso region around zzso represents a regulatory region controlling zzso expression of zzso and that the C zzso at zzso leads to decreased expression of zzso particularly within iris zzso which we zzso to be the ultimate cause of blue eye zzso
