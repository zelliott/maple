The zzso complex is an zzso filament zzso that activates regulated zzso assembly in response to zzso zzso The zzso complex is composed of seven zzso the smallest of which is known as zzso or zzso We have identified a human zzso sequence with zzso to zzso and here provide evidence that this encodes a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated against the novel zzso which we have termed zzso as well as the previously zzso zzso zzso henceforth zzso The presence of both zzso zzso was detected in zzso complex affinity zzso from human zzso zzso The tissue distribution of zzso and B was zzso using the zzso zzso and it was found that the two zzso exhibited significant zzso zzso was found to be highly enriched in zzso and zzso while zzso exhibits a more regular zzso with levels in the brain being zzso zzso zzso and B zzso with the zzso complex when expressed in zzso cells and the cellular distribution of the two zzso could not be zzso Our data show for the first time that zzso cells contain multiple forms of the zzso zzso
