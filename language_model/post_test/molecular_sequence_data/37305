In zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression and cellular differentiation are linked by the function of the zzso arrest zzso The zzso arrest genes control differentiation by regulating the zzso zzso of many zzso zzso The zzso arrest genes have been subdivided into zzso and can classes, based on the mechanism by which they control cell cycle zzso zzso has previously been shown to zzso a zzso zzso We present the zzso cloning and zzso of a novel zzso zzso arrest zzso cookie monster zzso that has a zzso zzso indistinguishable from that of zzso A zzso zzso zzso of zzso is viable but male zzso zzso primary zzso fail to initiate zzso of a large number of zzso and arrest before entry into the zzso zzso In adult zzso expression of zzso is zzso specific, low levels of transcripts are detected at other stages of zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso which is nuclear and primarily zzso to regions of zzso in primary zzso The nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso proteins are mutually zzso Finally, we show that active zzso zzso II is found in distinct zzso in the nucleus that constitute a subset of the total zzso stained zzso
