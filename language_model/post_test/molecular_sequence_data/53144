E6 zzso from zzso and bovine zzso type 1 zzso bind to similar zzso peptides termed charged zzso motifs found on the cellular focal zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E6 zzso zzso that do not bind to zzso are defective at inducing cellular zzso It is possible, however, that zzso zzso that do not bind zzso are defective for transformation for an unrelated reason than the ability to bind to charged zzso zzso To address the role of zzso interaction with charged zzso zzso we fused a zzso charged zzso motif to the zzso zzso of zzso thereby creating an zzso binding zzso We found that the fusion protein failed to bind to zzso or transform zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso terminal binding motif in the fusion protein restored both interaction with zzso and zzso This demonstrates that zzso transformation requires binding to charged zzso motifs on particular cellular proteins and that transformation by zzso zzso can be zzso by competitive interactions with charged zzso zzso
