We examined the role that aromatic zzso located in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso play in promoting zzso zzso Since zzso display low affinity binding at zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso were zzso to the corresponding zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso of the zzso had any effect on the affinity of the zzso However, the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso was reduced zzso and zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso An additive loss in affinity zzso for zzso was observed at an zzso containing both zzso The loss of zzso affinity scenario could be reversed by a gain of affinity with zzso of the corresponding zzso in the zzso to the zzso zzso in the zzso We propose that both zzso and zzso are involved in independent aromatic interactions with the zzso ring of zzso The potency but not the efficacy of zzso in stimulating zzso zzso was reduced zzso at the zzso zzso relative to the wild type zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent novel binding contacts in the zzso binding pocket of the zzso but are not involved directly in zzso zzso
