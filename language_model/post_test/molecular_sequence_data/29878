We have used a zzso zzso system employing cell lines derived from zzso zzso and zzso and cloned zzso zzso zzso to identify a DNA sequence essential for efficient zzso of the powerful zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 zzso Although deletion of the zzso box, the zzso zzso box, and several other sequences had little effect on zzso promoter activity, deletion or zzso of a short sequence related to the zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso in both cell zzso The activity of the zzso zzso zzso element, which is located at positions zzso to zzso is strongly position zzso zzso of even five copies of the VA element at zzso does not restore activity to a VA zzso while zzso of a single VA element at zzso largely restores promoter zzso The VA element is not zzso since VA zzso zzso and insertions zzso similar effects on zzso promoter activity in the cell lines derived from zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using nuclear extracts from the zzso zzso cell line demonstrate the presence of a protein which binds with high affinity and specificity to the VA zzso The zzso consensus zzso but not a functional zzso consensus zzso which actually exhibits higher zzso to the VA element than the zzso zzso competes for binding to the VA zzso In zzso using simplified promoters in which single copies of the VA region or zzso sequence are linked to a zzso box, the VA region, which does not contain a zzso is zzso more active than the consensus zzso zzso The zzso protein therefore appears to be related to, but not identical to, the zzso zzso zzso
