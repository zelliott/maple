zzso regions of a zzso zzso 17 DNA zzso were found to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this zzso showed that both activities are zzso by a single zzso open reading frame corresponding to the zzso zzso The predicted product has a characteristic signal sequence that is followed by an zzso domain related to family G zzso while the zzso domain is related to zzso from several other bacterial zzso These two zzso are connected by a region of unknown function that consists of 309 zzso acids and includes a zzso zzso zzso A zzso having a molecular weight of approximately 90,000 and exhibiting zzso and zzso activities was detected in zzso coli cells carrying the cloned zzso zzso This is one of the first cases in which a microbial zzso has been shown to carry separate zzso zzso active against different plant cell wall zzso within the same zzso zzso is one of a family of related genes in zzso zzso that zzso zzso having multiple zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso exhibits a high degree of similarity with the corresponding regions of another zzso zzso which carries two different zzso zzso zzso
