A number of primary human breast zzso exhibit amplification of the zzso 11 region containing the zzso zzso and progression of breast cancer has been correlated with zzso amplification or with certain restriction zzso length zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Using the zzso chain reaction zzso we obtained the zzso coding sequences from six primary tumors, four of which exhibited amplification of the zzso gene and one of which exhibited amplification of the zzso zzso The majority of these tumors (five of zzso were aggressive, as judged by their early zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequencing of zzso products revealed that previously described zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso as well as a new zzso at position zzso were located within the zzso between the second and third zzso A seventh tumor was used to zzso one of the zzso zzso 5 zzso from the zzso site of the third zzso However, none of the tumor zzso analyzed showed differences in the zzso protein coding regions when compared with normal zzso zzso These results imply that aggressive human breast zzso zzso an zzso form of the zzso zzso
