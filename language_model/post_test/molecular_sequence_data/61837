zzso are a zzso group of zzso skin peptides originally identified in skin extracts of zzso leaf zzso zzso zzso by chemical zzso Until now, zzso precursor structure and biological activity remain zzso Here we describe the isolation of a novel, zzso modified zzso zzso zzso from the skin zzso of the Mexican leaf frog, zzso zzso Using a zzso and zzso strategy and an in zzso skin zzso library, the zzso precursor was cloned and found to consist of an zzso frame of 62 zzso acids with a single copy of zzso located towards the zzso A synthetic replicate of zzso was found to be a potent zzso agent, relaxing zzso zzso smooth muscle and contracting small zzso smooth muscle at zzso zzso zzso is thus the first zzso skin zzso to be zzso characterized and the first whose precursor zzso has been zzso
