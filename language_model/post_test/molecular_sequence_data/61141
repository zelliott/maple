We have identified two separate zzso types zzso and zzso in the European zzso zzso zzso zzso hybrid molecules were not zzso By selective zzso of zzso we isolated zzso which, as revealed by electron zzso and zzso is present as zzso of a approximately 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, the two well-studied zzso types of the closely related marine zzso zzso zzso On the basis of limited zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso sequencing, we identified eight different zzso zzso functional units in zzso termed zzso to zzso and determined their linear arrangement within the zzso zzso From zzso mantle zzso rich in zzso pore cells, we isolated zzso and constructed a zzso zzso By expression screening with zzso rabbit zzso a zzso clone was isolated and zzso which codes for the three zzso functional units zzso g and h of zzso Their sequences were aligned to those available from other zzso notably to functional unit f and functional unit g from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the first zzso functional unit of type f from a zzso zzso zzso to functional unit f from zzso Also functional unit g from zzso and zzso zzso to each zzso zzso is a zzso zzso functional unit type which is absent in zzso and has not been zzso zzso It exhibits a unique tail extension of approximately 95 zzso zzso which is lacking in functional units a to g and zzso with a published zzso sequence of 48 zzso acids from functional unit h of zzso zzso zzso The new zzso sequences are discussed with respect to their counterparts in zzso the 15 A three-dimensional reconstruction of the zzso zzso from electron zzso and the recent zzso A X-ray structure of functional unit g from zzso zzso
