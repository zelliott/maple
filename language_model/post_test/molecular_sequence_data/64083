The natural silk zzso recovered from zzso zzso silk waste by the zzso processing in the zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso acid composition and molecular weight range of the zzso protein as a zzso for zzso zzso were zzso The silk zzso protein with different molecular mass from 50 to 200 zzso was poorly soluble zzso with an average size of about 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso The immobilized zzso on the natural support by zzso with zzso maintained zzso of the original activity of the zzso The zzso of zzso was 8 times lower than that of native zzso The zzso of zzso widened the optimum zzso temperature range of the zzso The immobilized zzso showed significantly higher stability when the temperature raised to zzso degrees C, it also showed preferable resistance to zzso zzso as compared with native zzso The results are discussed regarding the possible explanations of zzso zzso stability, as well as the possible applications of immobilized zzso zzso
