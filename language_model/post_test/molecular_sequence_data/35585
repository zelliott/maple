In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was expressed in an zzso coli expression system and zzso with zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso analysis revealed that zzso was expressed at significantly higher levels in muscle larvae and adult worms than in newborn zzso zzso was detected in zzso proteins of zzso zzso with western zzso zzso with the zzso zzso induced zzso immune responses, which zzso as elevated specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a mixed zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso had good zzso and could be a vaccine candidate for the control of zzso zzso infection, we zzso zzso mice with zzso and subsequently challenged the mice with zzso zzso zzso The results showed that mice vaccinated with zzso exhibited an average reduction in the muscle larvae burden of zzso relative to the control zzso These results suggest that zzso could be a novel vaccine candidate for controlling zzso zzso
