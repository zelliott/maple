The zzso of zzso zzso of aromatic acids are poorly understood in both zzso and zzso Although such reactions have been observed in numerous zzso acting on a variety of zzso the genes zzso zzso responsible for these processes have not, to our knowledge, been reported in the zzso Here, the isolation of a zzso from soil zzso zzso zzso which efficiently converts zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso zzso two-dimensional gel analysis revealed that several proteins were zzso in response to zzso zzso One of these was characterized by partial zzso sequencing, leading to the cloning of a gene cluster from a zzso DNA zzso zzso library, consisting of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons suggest that the product of zzso zzso zzso is similar to zzso zzso of zzso the putative products of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are similar to hypothetical proteins of unknown function from various zzso and are found in a similar cluster in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso transcript in zzso cells, suggesting that the cluster is under the control of a single zzso zzso zzso of the entire zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso as a zzso host resulted in that strain acquiring the ability to zzso zzso acid to zzso zzso Both zzso zzso strain D7 and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene cluster do not, however, zzso structurally similar aromatic zzso suggesting that the system is specific for zzso zzso This zzso system may be useful as a component for zzso engineering research focused towards the production of valuable chemicals from zzso and agricultural zzso
