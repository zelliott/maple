zzso zzso C zzso is a critical cell signaling zzso involved in many disorders such as cancer and zzso zzso To date, evaluation of zzso zzso binding affinity has been performed by competitive studies against zzso zzso that are problematic for zzso zzso In the present study, we have developed a zzso binding zzso system for identifying zzso that target the zzso zzso binding domain zzso zzso An environmentally sensitive fluorescent dye zzso zzso which has been used in multiple applications to assess zzso zzso was inserted in proximity to the binding pocket of a novel zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso domain zzso underwent a significant change in fluorescent intensity upon zzso zzso and we further demonstrate that the fluorescent zzso domain zzso can be used to evaluate zzso binding zzso
