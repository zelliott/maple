The zzso zzso of zzso zzso consists of a zzso long and thin zzso inserted into a zzso zzso The avian zzso possess a zzso which presents another symmetry zzso each zzso base is associated with two zzso Here we have studied the zzso of the zzso of zzso virus, an avian zzso and we have determined the sequence of both zzso one long and one zzso The short zzso is probably associated with the base in the same way as the zzso viral zzso and we will discuss how the long zzso could be zzso The shafts of all known zzso zzso consist of a series of zzso zzso The avian virus zzso show a more complicated and less regular zzso repeat structure with single, double and triple zzso The sequences of the zzso binding zzso zzso of both zzso are very different from all other known zzso head zzso and very different from each other, suggesting that the two zzso might bind to different zzso The zzso organization of the zzso region is rather different from that in human zzso In particular, a region zzso to the human virus zzso region was not found at the position where it normally occurs in the human virus zzso
