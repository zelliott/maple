zzso factor 1 zzso is required for the growth and differentiation of zzso zzso and is also involved in modulating various activities in mature zzso We report zzso that zzso lines produce zzso and zzso zzso zzso species of zzso and express the zzso protein on their outer zzso as determined by zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso protein is biologically zzso Interested by the possible zzso function of zzso we assessed its effect in an zzso of zzso presentation to the T cell zzso We found that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso Moreover, soluble zzso could not overcome this zzso but exerted a significant zzso activity on the interaction between T cells and zzso cells leading to zzso zzso and proliferation in zzso Based on these observations we propose that zzso zzso may be involved in the interaction of these cells with zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso
