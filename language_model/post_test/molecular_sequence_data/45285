The independent evolution of zzso similarities is zzso For simple traits, such as overall body zzso repeated transitions by means of zzso in the same gene may be zzso However, for more complex traits, the possible genetic paths may be more zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying their independent origins and the extent to which they are constrained to follow certain genetic paths are largely zzso Here we show that a male wing pigmentation pattern involved in courtship display has been gained and lost multiple times in a zzso zzso Each of the cases we have zzso zzso gains and two zzso involved regulatory changes at the zzso pigmentation gene zzso zzso involved the parallel zzso of the same zzso element zzso with changes at a few zzso sufficient to account for the functional divergence of one element between two sibling zzso Surprisingly, two independent gains of wing spots resulted from the zzso of distinct ancestral zzso These results demonstrate how the functional diversification of the modular zzso of zzso genes contributes to evolutionary novelty and the independent evolution of zzso zzso
