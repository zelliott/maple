zzso injury of zzso tissue represents an acute inflammatory response that can cause significant morbidity and zzso The mechanism of injury is not fully zzso but recent studies indicate an important role for natural zzso and the classical zzso of zzso To test the hypothesis that injury is initiated by specific zzso we have screened a panel of zzso zzso prepared from zzso cells enriched in zzso zzso One zzso zzso was identified that could restore zzso injury in zzso mice in an zzso model of zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the classical zzso of complement was evident by deposition of zzso complement zzso and zzso in damaged tissue after passive transfer of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso heavy and light chains showed zzso zzso with high zzso to a zzso sequence from the zzso repertoire and a zzso of a known zzso natural zzso These data provide definitive evidence that zzso injury can be initiated by zzso specific natural zzso that activates the classical zzso of zzso This finding opens an avenue for identification of zzso zzso and early prevention of zzso
