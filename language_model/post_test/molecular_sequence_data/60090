The cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso was examined in cultured zzso zzso at selected times during development using double zzso zzso The distribution of zzso zzso began as diffuse and zzso but as the cells zzso the distribution assumed a zzso zzso pattern, and zzso appeared to be localized in zzso - zzso regions adjacent to the zzso zzso a component of the zzso was localized in the same zzso zzso zzso analysis of the incorporation of the zzso zzso and other zzso proteins into zzso revealed that zzso was integrated into zzso following incorporation of zzso and zzso heavy chain zzso but prior to that of zzso This suggests that zzso zzso are incorporated into a pre-existing zzso structure, and it is unlikely that zzso zzso participate in the initial assembly of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also localized in zzso where they formed zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso however, was not found in cardiac zzso The zzso raised against the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused disruption of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso linkages zzso by zzso of zzso zzso may play a crucial role in the stabilization of zzso assembly and in the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso but not zzso interacts with the zzso signaling zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in downstream signaling triggered by zzso and that the zzso signaling zzso is distinct from that of zzso
