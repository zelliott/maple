The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso has been compared with that of the zzso of zzso virus zzso an agent shown recently to produce zzso symptoms in zzso It is shown that there is significant sequence zzso between a region of the zzso formerly identified by us as a possible zzso and a region on the coat protein zzso of zzso The viral protein also shows significant sequence zzso with several muscle zzso Identification of the likely spatial location of the zzso sequence on the shell of the virus by comparison with two other zzso whose three zzso structures have been determined, reveals it to be zzso with known zzso sites on these zzso Independent structural zzso of the possible zzso by comparison with two zzso zzso whose three zzso structures are known, also reveals that the sequence in question is likely to be zzso placed on zzso zzso to zzso with appropriate zzso These findings provide more definitive evidence in support of our previous suggestion that molecular mimicry could explain the origin of serum zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and suggests a likely viral zzso for the zzso
