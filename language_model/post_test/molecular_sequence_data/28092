Since zzso zzso functions are zzso in part through the binding of adhesive proteins containing an zzso zzso recognition zzso and since zzso reactions may be inhibited in zzso by zzso zzso we assessed in zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was induced by a device consisting of a zzso segment coated with type I zzso followed by two regions of expanded diameter exhibiting disturbed flow and zzso The zzso device was incorporated into zzso zzso zzso under conditions of intermediate wall zzso rate zzso zzso zzso formation was measured by zzso camera imaging of zzso and by counting of zzso zzso that formed on the collagen zzso was rich in zzso while zzso formed in the disturbed flow regions was rich in zzso and red zzso zzso zzso was infused zzso to the zzso device to maintain local plasma zzso of 25, 50, and 100 zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso of both zzso and zzso on the collagen zzso in a zzso zzso At the highest dose zzso and zzso deposition after 40 zzso was reduced by greater than zzso zzso less than zzso In the region of disturbed flow, zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso deposition by zzso zzso less than zzso but did not reduce the zzso of zzso zzso less than zzso Similarly, the zzso inhibited the release of zzso proteins from zzso associated with zzso zzso factor 4, zzso P less than zzso but did not prevent the appearance of zzso A in circulating blood zzso greater than zzso No systemic zzso in blood pressure, bleeding time, or zzso zzso ex zzso were produced by locally infused zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso disappeared within 5 zzso after zzso the zzso In control studies infused zzso zzso 100 zzso showed no zzso zzso Thus, zzso selectively blocks zzso zzso formation in zzso
