zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso T spores have been analyzed by high-resolution tandem zzso transform zzso zzso resonance mass zzso Two techniques have been applied for zzso of the isolated multiply charged precursor zzso zzso sustained zzso zzso activated zzso and electron capture zzso zzso sequence tags and zzso sequence similarity zzso database searches allow unequivocal identification of the major zzso protein with unprecedented zzso zzso fragmentation patterns further confirm protein zzso Moreover, methodology combining accurate mass zzso of intact proteins with additional information contained in a zzso database permits tentative assignment of several other protein zzso isolated from the zzso zzso T zzso We argue that approaches involving tandem zzso of protein zzso combined with zzso can drastically improve the specificity of individual zzso zzso particularly in complex zzso
