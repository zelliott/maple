zzso of the zzso zzso complex host several different zzso in the zzso zzso Here we address two questions arising from our previous studies of these associations on an offshore zzso First, do the same zzso and patterns of association zzso A and B found in higher zzso zzso than zzso zzso occur on an zzso zzso Second, does zzso zzso at the limits of its depth range host only zzso C, as it does at intermediate zzso In both surveys, a new zzso zzso and different patterns of distribution zzso by analyses of small zzso zzso zzso genes zzso were zzso zzso a zzso we name zzso E predominated in higher zzso zzso in zzso zzso and its two sibling zzso the only other zzso observed was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly hosted zzso C, but hosted zzso A, B, C, and E in shallow water and zzso E and C in very deep zzso zzso E may be zzso zzso zzso zzso within samples of zzso B, C, and E is interpreted as variation across copies within this zzso zzso Experimental zzso of zzso C supported this zzso Thus sequences from natural samples should be interpreted zzso
