Marine zzso zzso are widespread and abundant in deep oceanic waters but, despite their obvious ecological importance, little is known about zzso zzso analyses of large zzso fragments allow access to both gene content and zzso structure from single individuals of these zzso zzso We present the comparative analysis of 22 zzso zzso clones containing zzso zzso genes that were selected from four zzso libraries constructed from zzso and zzso zzso of different oceanic regions (South Atlantic, Antarctic Polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso depths from 500 to zzso zzso We zzso clones of the divergent zzso lineages Group zzso zzso and Group III zzso as well as clones from the more frequent Group I zzso and Group II zzso Whenever possible, we zzso clones that had identical or nearly identical zzso zzso genes and that were retrieved from distant geographical locations, that is, that defined zzso operational zzso units zzso We detected genes involved in nitrogen fixation in Group zzso zzso and genes involved in carbon fixation pathways and zzso zzso in Group I zzso which could confirm the idea that these are zzso A zzso system resembling that found in zzso bacteria was found in Group III zzso while genes for zzso respiratory chains were detected in Group II zzso Whereas gene sequence conservation was high, and zzso and gene zzso extensive within and between zzso in Group I zzso gene sequence conservation was low and global zzso maintained in Group II zzso This implies remarkable differences in zzso dynamics in Group I zzso and Group II zzso with zzso and zzso being, respectively, the dominant zzso zzso These zzso along with variations in zzso content, led us to zzso that the two groups of organisms have fundamentally different zzso
