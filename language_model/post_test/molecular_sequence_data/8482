We have employed a zzso monkey kidney cell line zzso zzso with plasmids zzso zzso the zzso gag and pol zzso and zzso zzso the zzso rev zzso as a model to investigate whether zzso zzso could interfere with specific zzso gene and protein zzso We zzso an zzso construct zzso directed against a zzso region of the zzso zzso to zzso cells that expressed the zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso was able to zzso levels of relevant zzso zzso and gag proteins in the absence of zzso zzso
