zzso zzso in a zzso system prepared from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were identified and structurally characterized as zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also found in the zzso membrane anchor of the G surface zzso of zzso strain zzso Using a combination of in zzso zzso with zzso and in zzso zzso with zzso we found that the core zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso with an zzso modification identified as zzso zzso The modification of the zzso core zzso by zzso zzso has not been described to date in other zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso was studied by a zzso zzso Their structural characterization is zzso We propose the following structure for the putative zzso membrane anchor precursor of zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
