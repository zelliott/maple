zzso to a wide variety of zzso are associated with systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso to zzso DNA zzso are thought to be particularly closely related to tissue damage and disease activity in zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso are found in patients with zzso but their role in zzso is zzso Using a transient expression system, we previously showed that particular sequence motifs in zzso of light chains derived from the human zzso gene zzso are very important in determining their ability to form a zzso site, when paired with the heavy chain of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso These motifs are often sites of zzso zzso and/or contain zzso zzso In the experiments reported in this paper, the same expression system was used to show that these zzso motifs also affect binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but that binding to different zzso is affected in diverse ways by particular changes in the sequence of the zzso The heavy chain also plays a role in binding to these zzso zzso of the same range of 11 zzso derived light chains with the heavy chain of a different zzso zzso zzso gave reduced ability to bind DNA in comparison with the results obtained using the B3 heavy zzso zzso models of the three-dimensional structures of these zzso chain combinations were used to define the positions occupied by the important sequence motifs at the binding sites of these zzso and to explain the different effects exerted by zzso zzso at different positions in the light zzso
