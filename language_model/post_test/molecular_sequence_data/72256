The subspecies zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso display dramatic differences in the copy number and zzso zzso of a zzso repeated DNA family zzso zzso In order to analyze the evolutionary dynamics of this repeat family, we studied the organization of zzso elements in the related zzso species zzso zzso We find three different patterns of zzso element organization in zzso zzso showing that zzso elements may be either strictly zzso or be an integral part of two zzso tandem repeats zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All three types of zzso repeats are localized in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the dispersed zzso zzso of zzso elements in zzso zzso zzso may be the result of an amplification and zzso during evolution of this zzso
