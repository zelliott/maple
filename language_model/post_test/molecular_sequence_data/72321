We show here that the zzso acid zzso contributing to the active sites of the zzso containing zzso are zzso within three families of acid zzso this suggests that the active sites of these zzso are very zzso This is confirmed by activity zzso showing that zzso exhibits zzso zzso These observations not only reveal interesting evolutionary relationships between these groups of zzso but may also have important implications for the research on acid zzso especially zzso zzso affected in von zzso zzso which the predicted membrane zzso may have to be zzso
