Leaf zzso is a unique zzso process that is characterized by massive programmed cell death and zzso zzso The underlying molecular regulatory mechanisms are not well zzso Here we report the functional analysis of zzso a gene zzso a zzso family zzso zzso zzso of this gene is closely associated with the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso Leaf zzso in two zzso zzso lines of this gene is significantly zzso The zzso knockout plants are otherwise zzso The zzso zzso can be restored to zzso by the intact zzso as well as by its zzso in rice and kidney bean plants that are also zzso during leaf zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso causes precocious zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso and its zzso play an important role in leaf zzso in zzso and possibly in other plant zzso
