Plants perceive microbial invaders using pattern recognition receptors that recognize zzso molecular zzso In this study, we identified zzso TO zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso that recognizes zzso zzso zzso and acts as a novel zzso molecular pattern zzso zzso recognizes several zzso from the plant pathogen zzso zzso as well as one from the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso Columbia induced a zzso response, whereas zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso A zzso cloning strategy, combined with comparative and functional zzso led to the identification of the Columbia zzso gene and showed that this gene is essential for the responsiveness of zzso to the zzso Transformation of zzso into zzso zzso resulted in a gain of PG zzso zzso zzso plants expressing zzso were equally susceptible as the recipient zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso zzso leaves of the transgenic plants with a PG resulted in increased resistance to zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso and PG form a complex in zzso zzso which also involves the zzso zzso repeat zzso protein zzso (for zzso OF zzso zzso zzso plants did not induce necrosis in response to zzso and were compromised in zzso resistance to zzso zzso
