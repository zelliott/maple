The complete zzso gene from the fish pathogen zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was analyzed and zzso The partial characterization of the zzso zzso confirmed that it belongs to a group of zzso zzso involved in carbon zzso zzso Multiple sequence alignments were used to deduce a new consensus sequence for this family of bacterial zzso characterized by several zzso zzso zzso This sequence was more specific and allowed the detection of the first zzso protein of this zzso The zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and the zzso protected the zzso from this zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso in or close to the active zzso
