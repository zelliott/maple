Three zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso were isolated from pigs suspected of having zzso in zzso One, zzso zzso was zzso 128 times zzso in zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame 7 zzso 7) gene from each of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is located at the 3' end of the zzso zzso was amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso products were zzso zzso and compared with published sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso in replication and zzso effect zzso between the zzso and zzso strains in zzso zzso cells were zzso Korean zzso field strains had zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence similarity with each other, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso Compared to the original zzso strain, the zzso strain differed by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso had six zzso and two zzso acid deletions compared to the original zzso zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso 7 zzso Korean zzso strains were clustered into two zzso One group zzso zzso zzso was related to zzso strains isolated in zzso Another Korean zzso isolate zzso was related to a strain from China and one from the zzso The Korean zzso zzso appear to have evolved from a separate lineage of zzso zzso zzso in growth rate and zzso between the zzso and zzso strains were discovered in zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso strain exhibited a higher replication rate than zzso and produced a zzso distinctly different from that of the zzso zzso
