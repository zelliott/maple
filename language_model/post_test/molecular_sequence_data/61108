In order to test the influence of chemical modifications designed to allow zzso zzso of zzso zzso motifs into variable sized zzso a series of zzso derivatives was zzso The building block encompassing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso behaved normally in the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso albeit at higher concentration and with a slightly reduced zzso A zzso zzso attached via the zzso zzso group of zzso to the zzso of zzso increased membrane zzso The latter was further enhanced in a zzso and a zzso in which zzso chains were zzso to zzso or zzso zzso respectively, but zzso zzso zzso displayed much reduced zzso and reversed zzso An usual zzso with high zzso was restored with the modified zzso of zzso in which zzso separated the two consecutive zzso zzso in the zzso Of special interest was the development of a zzso zzso branch in zzso zzso zzso for low zzso of this zzso with the more flexible zzso Single channel events displayed only one single open state with fast zzso and whose zzso matches that of the zzso zzso or zzso
