zzso spruce zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso conifer endemic to the Sierra Madre Occidental in northwestern zzso zzso variation was investigated using zzso inherited zzso zzso and zzso inherited zzso zzso DNA zzso Among the 16 zzso regions zzso only two zzso were zzso while the study of six zzso zzso markers revealed eight different zzso The average zzso diversity zzso zzso zzso was low but much higher than that for zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution of zzso revealed two clear zzso areas zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), one including northern populations and the second one including the southern and central stands, suggesting that these two regions may represent different ancestral zzso The zzso markers showed lower population differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that the two ancestral populations continued to exchange zzso after their initial geographic zzso A lack of a zzso structure was revealed by different spatial analyses of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and reduced zzso gene flow was noted among populations zzso zzso zzso Some stands deviated significantly from the zzso zzso suggesting recent zzso Altogether, these various trends are consistent with the hypothesis of a population collapse during the zzso warming and suggest that most of the modern zzso zzso populations are now effectively isolated with their genetic diversity essentially zzso by genetic zzso The conservation efforts should focus on most southern populations and on the northern and central stands exhibiting high levels of genetic zzso Additional zzso sequence analysis confirmed that zzso zzso zzso is not zzso with zzso zzso and thus deserves separate conservation zzso
