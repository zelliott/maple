Seven zzso zzso by the letters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso to zzso from the culture zzso of zzso zzso All seven zzso are zinc zzso that require calcium zzso for activity and have essential zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso can be divided into two classes on the basis of the sequence zzso in their zzso zzso as revealed from a comparison of their zzso zzso This division into classes is also supported by a comparison of their zzso toward zzso zzso their interaction with zzso zzso and their mode of attack of triple zzso zzso The sequence zzso of these zzso have been studied in zzso The zzso of the two classes are similar, but zzso Both classes exhibit both zzso and zzso activities, where the latter is thought to facilitate removal of zzso triplets from the zzso of collagen zzso The mode of attack of these zzso on triple zzso type I, II and III zzso is very similar for the zzso within each class, but different for the two zzso The class I zzso first zzso zzso near the ends of the triple zzso zzso of these collagen zzso while the class II zzso make their initial zzso in the zzso The sites of these initial zzso are being zzso and preliminary results indicate that they do not resemble the tissue zzso zzso site with respect to either their zzso acid content or zzso The kinetic parameters for the zzso of type I, II and III zzso have been measured and are similar in magnitude to those for the tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been prepared for both classes of zzso and shown to be zzso zzso
