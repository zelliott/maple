Chemical synthesis of homogeneous human zzso exhibiting zzso in zzso has been a challenging zzso In an effort to overcome this long-standing problem, we selected zzso and examined its zzso The 166 zzso zzso chain of zzso was prepared by zzso zzso of two synthetic zzso segments and a zzso synthetic zzso bearing a zzso zzso of biological zzso The peptides were zzso condensed by native chemical zzso Selective zzso followed by zzso of the two zzso zzso gave the target full-length zzso chain of zzso bearing either a zzso zzso zzso zzso or its zzso zzso zzso folding with zzso formation of the native zzso bond afforded correctly folded homogeneous zzso The chemically zzso zzso zzso exhibited potent zzso activity in zzso
