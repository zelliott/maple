zzso zzso repeat mapping by zzso zzso provides a digital approach to DNA typing that can reveal huge levels of variation at zzso zzso zzso has so far been applied to three human zzso including the zzso locus zzso Previous analysis at zzso was based on the discrimination of repeat unit types that differ by a single base zzso We now show that a second zzso site within zzso repeats may be zzso simultaneously with the first to define four classes of repeat units zzso zzso This approach can also be applied to the other end of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both of these procedures substantially increase the zzso of zzso analysis at zzso and should prove useful in studies of zzso biology and potentially in forensic DNA zzso
