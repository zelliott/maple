zzso zzso zzso is a dominant zzso that alters cell fate and causes zzso cell division and expansion in the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso box zzso sequence closely linked to the zzso zzso was cloned and shown by zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein is highly similar to zzso in the zzso domain but contains a unique zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the shoot zzso zzso in a circular pattern preceding leaf zzso but is not zzso in leaf zzso or mature leaves in normal zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso leaf zzso sites in the shoot, and lateral organ zzso in zzso and floral zzso The timing and position of zzso expression in zzso suggests a possible role for zzso in patterning the placement of lateral zzso along the axis of the zzso In contrast to wild type, zzso is expressed in early leaf zzso of zzso zzso plants, suggesting that zzso expression causes the zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso plants suggests the zzso zzso region is more competent to respond to zzso than blade or sheath zzso
