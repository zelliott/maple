A novel zzso inhibitor named zzso was identified from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the coding zzso was isolated from a tick zzso zzso This zzso codes for a zzso of 166 zzso zzso including a predicted signal zzso composed of 15 zzso acids zzso to the mature zzso The zzso mature zzso contains 14 zzso and two zzso zzso It displays high sequence similarity with a tissue factor zzso inhibitor zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has 10 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which has 12 zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso as efficiently as native zzso zzso This is the first report of a zzso inhibitor from tick zzso
