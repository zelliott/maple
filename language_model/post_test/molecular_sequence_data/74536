The zzso isolate zzso originally identified by zzso characteristics of the zzso body as zzso zzso efficiently produces zzso zzso zzso and is used for degradation of natural, persistent aromatic zzso zzso zzso acids and brown coal zzso The zzso zzso zzso has shown good activity in conversion of zzso compounds such as zzso zzso and zzso However, this zzso promising fungus has not previously been studied at the molecular biology zzso We show here that according to the molecular characterization of its main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial sequencing of its zzso three zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso that the fungus has a close zzso relationship to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a possible representative of a new species of the zzso zzso nearest to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso belongs to a completely different family zzso and order zzso within the zzso zzso than the zzso zzso which is classified in the order zzso family zzso Our results thus indicate a need for systematic zzso of the previously named zzso zzso isolate zzso
