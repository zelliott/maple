To identify new gene products involved in zzso zzso we isolated zzso zzso zzso that require zzso binding factor I zzso for zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected for further zzso The zzso gene encodes a novel zzso protein that is notably similar to previously identified zzso human and zzso zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso zzso cells were temperature sensitive for zzso At the zzso temperature, zzso and zzso delta cells lost zzso at a zzso approximately zzso and approximately zzso higher than zzso cells, zzso These zzso also displayed unusually long and numerous zzso of zzso zzso as revealed by zzso zzso In addition, we occasionally observed improperly oriented zzso zzso residing entirely within one of the zzso Presumably as a result of undergoing nuclear division with improperly oriented zzso a large percentage of zzso cells had accumulated multiple zzso While zzso zzso cells were hypersensitive to the zzso compound zzso they showed increased resistance to the closely related compound zzso relative to zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso plays a role in governing zzso dynamics within the cell and may interact directly with zzso or zzso
