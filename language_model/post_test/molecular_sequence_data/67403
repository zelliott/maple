The incorporation of a complementary zzso zzso into a zzso zzso DNA zzso attached to the surface of a sensor zzso generates an zzso charge that can be either trapped on the sensor surface or diffused into the surrounding zzso zzso detection methods of DNA synthesis are based on these zzso kinetic zzso The detection method that uses zzso which is related to the surface zzso zzso showed a better sensing signal than the induced charge detection method, which is related to the diffusion of zzso into the surrounding zzso The zzso reaction should be zzso however, so that it would be stable under various surface conditions and zzso Moreover, the reaction should be zzso and the reaction parameters should be zzso in the subsequent synthesis zzso For the induced charge method, the zzso current level was too small to be detected using an ordinary amplifier circuit with the same sensor size as that of zzso zzso the sensor operation zzso and zzso ratio characteristics should be addressed carefully in the selection of the proper sensor zzso
