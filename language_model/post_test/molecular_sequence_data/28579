The substantial variations in the responses of cells to the zzso zzso and its zzso form, zzso suggest that more than one type of cell surface zzso for these zzso might zzso However, only a single zzso for zzso and zzso zzso has been characterized to zzso Here we report that the orphan zzso zzso which shares zzso zzso acid identity with zzso binds zzso with high affinity but has a zzso higher affinity for zzso than zzso zzso also has a moderate affinity for zzso zzso but zzso studies suggest that zzso binds to a distinct site from zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso like the zzso zzso may have a low binding affinity for this zzso Unlike zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells does not support zzso or increases in zzso zzso and is not rapidly zzso in response to zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso by zzso did zzso the zzso response to zzso of the high affinity zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso protein with unique zzso binding and signaling zzso
