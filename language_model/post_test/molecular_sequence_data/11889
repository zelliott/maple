zzso processed peptides from zzso zzso zzso zzso arthritis zzso and zzso zzso molecules were analyzed by zzso liquid zzso and mass zzso The molecular weights observed for more than 60 zzso peptides from each zzso protein ranged from zzso to zzso atomic mass units, corresponding to peptides 7 to 32 zzso acids in zzso zzso of more than 60 of the abundant peptides revealed zzso sets of peptides that were derived from only 12 different zzso The majority of these proteins were zzso zzso class I, class II, and zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso bound with high affinity (5 to 80 zzso to the zzso molecules from which they were zzso In addition, most were zzso binding peptides in that they also bound to other zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences and zzso scanning zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso were used to identify the zzso zzso involved in binding to zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso chain zzso was zzso from the zzso molecules but not from the zzso zzso The lack of zzso chain peptides from zzso and zzso molecules may contribute to the loading of zzso peptides into these molecules and to their association with zzso
