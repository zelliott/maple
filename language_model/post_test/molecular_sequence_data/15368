zzso engineering plays a unique role in fundamental plant biology studies and in improving crop zzso These efforts often zzso introduction and expression of multiple genes using promoters from a very limited zzso Current common practice of expressing multiple genes is the repeated use of the same or similar zzso This practice causes more frequent zzso zzso due to a high degree of sequence zzso and a greater chance of zzso among repeatedly used promoter zzso zzso availability and use of natural zzso promoters to minimize gene zzso and achieve desirable expression pattern of zzso is a critical issue in the field of plant genetic zzso Here we describe the use of a single natural zzso promoter to drive the expression of two reporter genes in onion zzso cells and in transgenic tobacco zzso We show that zzso the promoter drives the simultaneous expression of zzso and zzso reporter genes after transient expression and stable zzso zzso the zzso is equally strong in both directions, zzso immediate upstream regions in each direction control zzso independently from each other, and zzso the reporter genes are expressed in leaves and stems but not in roots, as expected from the fact that the zzso promoter controls the expression of two zzso genes in zzso zzso use of zzso promoters in zzso background provides a means to express multiple genes in transgenic plants and aids genetic zzso crop zzso
