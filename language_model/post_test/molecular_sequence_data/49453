zzso I and E of the zzso virus, zzso by the zzso open reading frames 67 and 68, are transcribed into several transcript species that differ in zzso From zzso three transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are known, and from zzso two transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in size are zzso Here, we demonstrate that these various transcript species appear in different amounts at different times post zzso At 12 zzso post infection, the transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were clearly zzso whereas the other transcripts appeared later zzso zzso studies using a set of different zzso provided clear evidence that zzso and zzso are transcribed both, zzso and zzso with predominance on the respective zzso zzso Additional evidence for zzso zzso was found in the fact that both zzso contain their own zzso start zzso Both promoter regions have their own zzso zzso activity and include active zzso that were recognized by the zzso binding zzso
