The zzso fungus zzso zzso is a cotton pathogen transmitted by zzso It is readily grown and manipulated in the laboratory and is commercially exploited as a natural zzso of vitamin zzso Our previous zzso analysis of zzso zzso isolate zzso collected in Trinidad nearly 100 years ago, revealed extensive zzso with the zzso zzso zzso leading us to use it as a model zzso to understand the evolution of zzso zzso To further develop zzso as a model system, we have investigated the ecological niche of zzso zzso and isolated additional strains and a sibling species, both useful in comparative zzso We isolated zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso from different zzso insects of the zzso zzso generated a zzso tree based on zzso zzso and performed high coverage short read sequencing with one zzso zzso isolate from Florida, a new species, zzso zzso isolated in North Carolina, and a genetically marked zzso of zzso zzso used for functional zzso In contrast to zzso zzso all strains carry four not three mating type zzso adding a new puzzle in the evolution of zzso zzso Another surprise was the zzso identity of zzso between the Florida strain and zzso isolated in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show zzso gene orders rearranged by eight zzso zzso overall sequence identity, and fewer tandem zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Both species lack zzso zzso Finally, our work identifies zzso insects of the zzso zzso as the most likely natural zzso of zzso and that infection of cotton and other plants may be incidental to the growth of the fungus in its insect zzso
