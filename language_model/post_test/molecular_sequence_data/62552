The protein zzso by the first gene of the triple gene block zzso of zzso is required for movement of the zzso It has been reported that single zzso zzso at position 11, 16 or 21 of zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso eliminate its zzso activity, while zzso at position 16 or 21 only affect its zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it remains unclear whether these zzso zzso also affect the movement of zzso in zzso To address this question, six zzso of zzso each containing either a zzso or a zzso substitution at zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were constructed and used to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that all of the zzso zzso were able to replicate in zzso of zzso zzso However, only the zzso with an zzso substitution in zzso remained capable of movement from cell to cell in zzso zzso with zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso of zzso replaced with zzso were defective in virus zzso This zzso was suppressed when a zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the cells using a novel satellite zzso The ability to zzso the movement zzso by the zzso zzso strongly suggests that the zzso substitution at position 16 or 21 of zzso which diminishes the zzso and zzso activities of zzso also eliminates the capability of zzso to move from cell to cell in host zzso
