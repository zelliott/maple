The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has vital functions both in controlling the expression of pancreatic zzso hormones and in the development of the zzso The zzso and zzso properties of zzso have been well zzso but nuclear transport is still zzso Here we show that zzso bears a nuclear zzso signal zzso that is part of zzso 3 of the zzso zzso deletion zzso were zzso with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the respective zzso fusion proteins was analyzed by direct zzso zzso and Western zzso using an zzso As a result we were able to demonstrate that the zzso or zzso 3 alone was sufficient and necessary for transport into the zzso Point zzso of basic zzso acid zzso within zzso 3 led to identification of an zzso with six zzso acids being crucial for nuclear transport of zzso Because this zzso does not match known examples of zzso the zzso zzso may represent a novel class of zzso
