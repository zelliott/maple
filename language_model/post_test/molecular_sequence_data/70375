The zzso zzso zzso expressed by zzso mediates the initial attachment of these cells to high zzso zzso within peripheral zzso zzso This adhesive interaction is required for the migration of B and T zzso from the blood into peripheral zzso zzso There is currently little information regarding the nature of the factors involved in the regulation of the synthesis and expression of zzso by zzso In this report, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to markedly zzso the surface density of zzso in the established human B zzso zzso cell line and in a zzso of zzso human B zzso zzso Other zzso such as zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and low molecular weight B cell growth factor did not affect zzso surface expression in the model zzso B cell zzso zzso of zzso surface density in zzso zzso B cells correlated directly with an increase in zzso zzso steady state levels and enhanced zzso binding to a zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso had characteristics similar to that of classical zzso genes including rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso levels or surface expression in an zzso zzso zzso which exhibits a zzso in the signal zzso zzso required for the zzso induction of zzso zzso These data demonstrate a fundamental role for zzso in regulating zzso synthesis and expression in human B zzso cells and suggest a mechanism zzso this zzso regulates the regional trafficking of B cells to peripheral zzso zzso
