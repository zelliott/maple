zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso are essential zzso proteins implicated in zzso zzso and contained within large zzso zzso Here we describe the tandem affinity zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Using transmission electron zzso we show that the zzso zzso complex is a discrete zzso The components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso or zzso zzso were identified using direct analysis of large protein complex zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At least 26 proteins were detected in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso with those identified by zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that these two zzso complexes are nearly identical in zzso The majority of zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso proteins are known zzso zzso factors including core zzso and U2 and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the complex contains the U2, zzso and zzso zzso Previously zzso proteins were also identified, and we provide evidence that several of these novel factors are involved in zzso zzso Our data represent the first comprehensive analysis of zzso proteins in zzso describe a discrete highly zzso complex containing novel zzso zzso factors, and demonstrate the power of zzso for identification of components in zzso zzso
