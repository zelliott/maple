zzso strains of the zzso oral zzso vaccine replicate in the human gut and, in rare cases, cause zzso zzso zzso In the present study, 15 zzso strains isolated from patients with zzso zzso zzso and from healthy zzso were zzso Four distant sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were targeted, and the zzso segments were amplified by zzso chain reaction followed by restriction zzso length zzso analysis with four restriction zzso Among the 15 zzso (11 zzso type 2, 3 zzso type 1, and 1 zzso type zzso four zzso type 2 zzso zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region of the viral zzso The zzso zzso identified were zzso for two zzso and zzso and zzso for each of the other two zzso zzso zzso viruses with unmodified segments in the zzso zzso and the zzso regions of the viral zzso a modified segment in the zzso region only for one strain, and an often zzso segment in the zzso zzso parts of the zzso were so zzso These findings provide strong evidence that zzso is a frequent phenomenon in type 2 zzso vaccine strains and suggest that zzso may be an important mechanism of the natural evolution of zzso of zzso type 2 origin, perhaps even one of the mechanisms of zzso of attenuated vaccine strains toward zzso
