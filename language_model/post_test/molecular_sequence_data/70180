We have developed a technique in which gene expression from multiple reporter plasmids introduced by needle zzso can be monitored simultaneously in individual cells by zzso indirect zzso With zzso active viral zzso expression from zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter genes can be detected within as little as 30 zzso after zzso zzso from such strong promoters reaches a maximum level after about 2 zzso In place of the zzso promoter, promoters containing different zzso elements respond as expected to different zzso allowing for the comparison of two defined zzso control elements in living zzso zzso expression can be analyzed temporally and can be compared to expression of zzso zzso This technique is complementary to zzso and allows for the targeted analysis of expression in specific cells, for example, in a mixed cell population, and for the analysis of expression in cells that are available only in small zzso
