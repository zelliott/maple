In order to examine the frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso of the zzso zzso we constructed strains that contained zzso restriction sites in the zzso zzso sequences of zzso III in addition to zzso markers zzso the zzso One of these markers was the zzso zzso zzso which was inserted less than one zzso from the zzso We found that zzso conversion of the zzso gene occurred at normal frequency (about zzso of zzso zzso and that more than one-third of these zzso zzso the markers within the zzso In addition, we observed zzso in which conversion events extended through the zzso to include a marker on the opposite side from zzso We conclude that zzso conversion events occur within the zzso at rates similar to other zzso zzso
