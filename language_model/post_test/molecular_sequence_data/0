The DNA of zzso T4 normally has a zzso base, zzso instead of the usual zzso The zzso shuts off host zzso after infection presumably by specifically blocking zzso of zzso zzso If T4 incorporates zzso into its own DNA, this zzso mechanism is directed back at itself and blocks its own zzso zzso which overcome this zzso block are in the T4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso allow the propagation of T4 with zzso in their DNA zzso Snyder, zzso Gold, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso By genetic criteria, zzso is the same as another zzso zzso whose product is required for the unfolding of the bacterial zzso after infection zzso zzso zzso Wei, and zzso Snyder, Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1976; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The product of the zzso gene has been identified as a zzso protein zzso zzso Herman, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Rand, zzso zzso zzso and an open reading frame has been proposed to be the zzso gene based on its size and map position zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Rand, zzso zzso zzso We used marker rescue techniques and DNA sequencing to confirm that this open reading frame is the zzso zzso We also present a molecular proof that zzso and zzso are the same zzso While these results do not rigorously exclude the possibility that zzso and zzso are different activities of the same zzso they strongly support the conclusion that the unfolding of the bacterial zzso the zzso of zzso are but different manifestations of the same zzso
