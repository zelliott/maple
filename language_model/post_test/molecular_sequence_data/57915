We describe studies in a canine model aimed at establishing methods for ex zzso gene delivery to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were harvested from tissue obtained by unilateral zzso grown in zzso media, and zzso with zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso zzso Up to zzso of cells were zzso with zzso zzso containing the zzso resistance zzso and zzso cells could be selected with zzso zzso zzso and selected cells exhibited the zzso of zzso zzso cells and continued to express zzso To assess the viability of cultivated and zzso cells for zzso cells were stained with the vital fluorescent dye zzso recovered by zzso and transplanted into the zzso zzso lobe of zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso and identification of zzso sequences zzso days after zzso zzso transcripts were evident using coupled reverse zzso and the zzso chain reaction using total zzso from transplanted zzso zzso zzso cells may represent an attractive target for gene therapy due to their zzso potential, their large protein synthetic and zzso capacity, and their zzso to zzso The zzso might be a target for therapy of zzso or acquired zzso diseases as well as disorders requiring regulated expression of proteins in the zzso This work demonstrates the feasibility of ex zzso gene delivery to zzso zzso cells that may be used in future zzso
