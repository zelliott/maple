Recent studies showed that zzso is a crucial component of the zzso zzso quality-control mechanism in zzso The zzso zzso encodes a weak zzso of zzso zzso but little is known about this zzso Here we report the crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso and the first zzso and functional studies on this zzso The overall structure of zzso is similar to zzso zzso has robust zzso activity on zzso with zzso zzso but it has no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also possesses zzso zzso zzso activity, and we propose the name zzso for this new zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso Studies of zzso in which both zzso and zzso are disrupted reveal that zzso with incomplete caps are produced even under normal growth conditions, in sharp contrast to current understanding of the capping zzso
