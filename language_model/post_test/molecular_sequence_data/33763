zzso affinity limits sensitivity of detection in many areas of biology and zzso High affinity usually depends on achieving the optimal combination of the natural 20 zzso acids in the zzso binding zzso Here, we investigate the effect on recognition of protein targets of placing an zzso zzso adjacent to the target binding zzso We positioned a weak zzso zzso near the binding site between an zzso a zzso binding scaffold, and its protein zzso The proximity between zzso zzso or zzso on the target protein drove zzso bond formation to the zzso on the zzso zzso bonds did not form to a zzso point zzso of the target, and there was minimal zzso with serum, cell zzso or when imaging at the cell zzso zzso zzso showed more stable protein imaging at the surface of zzso cells, and the sensitivity of protein detection in an zzso improved by two orders of zzso Thus zzso zzso combined good specificity with improved detection of protein zzso
