zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso leads to the development of a novel organ, the root zzso A zzso zzso zzso a novel type of plant protein zzso containing a zzso region with an zzso domain, was identified and shown to be expressed both in zzso zzso and spontaneous zzso in zzso This gene is not exclusively associated to zzso since its expression was detected in other plant zzso Several genes coding for zzso protein zzso zzso were detected in various plants and zzso Three closest zzso zzso zzso of zzso were identified in databases and two of them were shown to express zzso in various zzso using zzso zzso In contrast, Southern analysis suggests that a zzso gene exists in zzso zzso zzso By screening a zzso zzso zzso library the zzso zzso region was isolated and zzso Two zzso genes showing zzso to previously identified sequences in data banks were detected in the vicinity of the zzso gene and compared to similar regions of the three zzso zzso The distribution of zzso was the same for all expressed genes of both species although zzso contained larger zzso Upon zzso stress zzso expression was induced in roots of alfalfa starting from three hours up to two days of zzso These data suggest that zzso involved in alfalfa zzso stress responses, belongs to a novel class of plant protein zzso
