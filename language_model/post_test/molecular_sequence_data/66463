In order to contribute to the debate about southern glacial zzso used by temperate species and more northern zzso used by zzso or zzso species, we examined the zzso of a widespread snake species zzso zzso inhabiting Europe up to the Arctic zzso The analysis of the zzso DNA zzso sequence variation in zzso zzso of the zzso b gene and in zzso zzso of the zzso control region was performed with zzso zzso Our results suggest that both the duplicated control region and zzso b evolve at a similar rate in this zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is divided into three major zzso zzso probably resulting from an Italian, a Balkan and a Northern (from France to zzso zzso area in Eastern Europe, near the zzso zzso In addition, the Northern zzso presents an important zzso suggesting two sequential colonization events in zzso First, the continent was zzso from the three main zzso areas mentioned above during the zzso zzso Second, zzso of most of Europe most likely originated from several zzso located outside of the Mediterranean zzso zzso region, east of the zzso France and possibly zzso during the zzso zzso while populations within the Italian and Balkan zzso zzso only slightly in distribution range, with larger zzso populations during glacial times and with zzso mountain populations during zzso as in the present zzso The zzso structure revealed in our study suggests complex zzso dynamics of the European continent by zzso zzso characterized by zzso as well as zzso range shifts, driven by both zzso changes and competition with related zzso
