The zzso component in rat brain reacting most strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso on western blots zzso as an zzso zzso zzso identifies zzso zzso because it is highly specific for terminal zzso zzso After zzso of this zzso zzso band by zzso on zzso and zzso gel zzso binding of other zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso and a trace of zzso but no zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso H produced a zzso band, indicating that it consisted of about zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that the major zzso zzso is a zzso with the structure zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences of peptides produced by zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso zzso zzso component contained the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and at least one other member of the zzso protein zzso zzso The unusually high content of zzso zzso zzso on these zzso members of the zzso zzso in neural tissue could be of functional significance for zzso zzso or zzso
