zzso zzso forms diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that aid in its survival in a variety of zzso One such zzso is the zzso that forms at the zzso interface in standing zzso We screened for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso that were unable to form zzso Analysis of these zzso led to the identification of seven adjacent zzso named zzso zzso the products of which appear to be involved in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso In addition to being required for zzso formation, the zzso genes are also required for the formation of solid zzso zzso zzso analyses predicted that three zzso genes zzso zzso proteins and that five zzso genes have functional zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso observations revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso zzso able to bind zzso zzso no zzso zzso was produced by the zzso zzso A comparison of the carbohydrates produced by the zzso strain and zzso zzso suggested that zzso was a principal component of the zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso genes are responsible for the production of a zzso zzso material required for the formation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso
