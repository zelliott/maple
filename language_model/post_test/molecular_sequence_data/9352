zzso A virus zzso segment 7 encodes protein zzso which is the zzso protein playing crucial role in the virus life zzso Any zzso strategy that aims at zzso in particular, the expression of this zzso segment should, in principle, reduce the zzso of the zzso We developed a specific zzso approach at the molecular level and designed several novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specifically targeted to cleave at the zzso zzso of the influenza virus zzso zzso We sought to use zzso molecules with the hope that it will facilitate the zzso zzso We observed that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was achieved by both the zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso This combination of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in principle, resulted in more effective gene suppression, inhibited the whole virus replication in host cell, and thus could be exploited for therapeutic zzso
