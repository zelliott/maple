Human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection has been discovered recently in people of zzso descent living in coastal areas of British Columbia, zzso DNA sequencing combined with zzso analysis and restriction zzso length zzso zzso typing of zzso strains recovered from these British Columbia Indians zzso was zzso zzso zzso trees distributed the zzso zzso among the Japanese zzso zzso zzso and the geographically widely distributed zzso zzso zzso of the large zzso cosmopolitan zzso Long terminal repeat zzso zzso typing revealed three zzso equally frequent zzso zzso patterns, two of which were of previously recognized Japanese and widely dispersed cosmopolitan zzso A third, new zzso pattern was detected which may have arisen by zzso between two other zzso zzso Our results suggest multiple origins for zzso in zzso which are equally consistent with zzso a cluster of recent sporadic infections, zzso ancient endemic vertical transmission through zzso zzso or zzso zzso
