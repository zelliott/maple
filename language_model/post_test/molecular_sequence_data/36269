A promoter probe zzso which zzso the zzso AB genes from zzso zzso as reporters of gene zzso was constructed for use in zzso zzso Using this system gene expression can be monitored zzso and in zzso simply by measuring cellular zzso zzso of the promoter probe were constructed that contained the cloned promoters from the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso The activity of these promoters was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso in a strain containing an intact copy of the zzso zzso expression from both the zzso and zzso promoters was zzso higher than in zzso zzso Heat shock was identified as an environmental signal which induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso stress had no effect upon the expression of the zzso zzso In addition, the composition of the growth media was found to have a dramatic effect upon the expression of zzso and zzso suggesting the presence of an unidentified signal which may regulate induction of expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso
