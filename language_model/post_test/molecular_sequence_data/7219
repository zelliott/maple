zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cell lines in zzso requires the products of the zzso locus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso By generating zzso zzso with a zzso zzso deletion in either zzso or zzso we have identified zzso and zzso as zzso proteins of zzso zzso with molecular weights of zzso and zzso zzso These results were obtained with zzso zzso raised against either protein and zzso by zzso end sequencing of zzso and zzso By zzso analysis, the production of both zzso was found to be strongly dependent on growth temperature and, particularly for zzso on the presence of the zzso regulator zzso zzso of zzso was not strictly dependent on the presence of the zzso regulator zzso zzso analysis of the zzso locus revealed that the zzso gene was transcribed by several zzso of which only one is zzso zzso This zzso zzso promoter, which contains two base zzso within its putative zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso promoter located 51 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso of the zzso gene was also zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed both individually and in an zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso culture invasion zzso employing various zzso cell lines demonstrated that both zzso and zzso are required for zzso In zzso studies using the mouse infection model revealed that both zzso zzso were attenuated for zzso
