In this study we investigated which type of T zzso high zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso or intermediate zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso expanded in the liver and other zzso resulting in the induction of zzso disease zzso with minor zzso stimulating zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice, zzso cells expanded in the liver and other zzso of recipient zzso The majority of these cells were found to be zzso in zzso zzso The zzso region in their zzso zzso zzso was zzso although there were skewed zzso of zzso and zzso The majority of cells were confirmed to be of donor origin by the individual discrimination method, zzso they originated from isolated zzso zzso Interestingly, these T cells lacked zzso against both a natural killer zzso target and zzso with zzso disparity and zzso Another important finding was that activated zzso expanded at generalized sites in zzso zzso The present results raise the possibility that zzso disparity is mainly recognized by zzso cells with unique properties but that direct zzso cells that induce zzso might not be such T cells but rather accompanied zzso
