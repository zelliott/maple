The zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in tumor invasion and zzso by a series of zzso zzso zzso In addition, direct evidence for the role of these zzso in this zzso process comes from studies using specific zzso zzso to block tumor invasion and zzso formation, both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso for four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their tissue zzso zzso zzso were selected, zzso and zzso in the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso to study the qualitative profile of these zzso and zzso in cultured human tumor cells and tumor zzso These zzso are specific and generate unique amplification products for each appropriate zzso and zzso Slight enhancement in the amplification of zzso products was achieved by adding zzso to the reaction mixture, but commercial enhancement zzso were zzso Using this zzso method, zzso amplification was successful with zzso from as few as 20 cultured tumor zzso The zzso analysis was done on three invasive human colon zzso and their paired adjacent normal zzso The results show zzso and zzso products in all three tumors, and zzso detected in one of the three normal zzso zzso zzso expression was present in two of three patients and awaits quantitative assessment of zzso zzso
