We had previously reported that zzso zzso produces zzso in response to iron zzso In the present study, we identified in zzso zzso zzso the zzso system cluster which consists of eight zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso genes zzso proteins zzso to components of bacterial zzso binding cassette transport systems for zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso code for zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In accordance with their zzso zzso putative zzso box sequences were found within the respective promoter regions of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso transcript was detected by northern zzso Moreover, zzso comparison between the zzso strain and its targeted gene zzso supported the biological functions that were expected for the respective zzso and genes on the basis of the zzso zzso The arrangement of the zzso gene clusters thus far found in zzso and zzso species was compared and discussed from an evolutionary point of zzso
