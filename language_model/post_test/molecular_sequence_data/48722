zzso have attracted much attention zzso to their potential zzso The zzso of zzso however, was zzso by their low zzso at high temperature or extreme zzso The purpose of this work was to enhance the zzso of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso a zzso family 11 zzso from zzso zzso was enhanced by replacing its zzso segment with the corresponding one of zzso , a zzso family 11 zzso A hybrid zzso with high zzso zzso was predicted by molecular dynamics zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso was then constructed as designed zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The temperature optimum of zzso zzso zzso was zzso much higher than that of zzso Both zzso were zzso at 65 and zzso zzso Additionally, the pH optimum and stability of zzso were zzso and at a range of zzso Its activity was not significantly affected by metal zzso tested and zzso but strongly inhibited by zzso and zzso 

This work obviously enhanced the zzso of a zzso zzso making zzso a promising candidate for industrial zzso It also provided an effective technical strategy for improving zzso of other zzso zzso
