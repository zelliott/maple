To reveal the molecular mechanism of involvement of zzso II zzso protein in the electron transfer in zzso effects of zzso in zzso on the zzso of zzso were investigated by means of electron zzso resonance zzso and flash zzso Wild type and a series of zzso versions of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso depleted zzso reaction center core complex consisting of zzso was prepared and zzso with the wild type and each zzso version of zzso together with or without zzso zzso signal indicating the formation of zzso state upon zzso zzso disappeared in zzso and it was recovered when the complex was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of a few zzso acid zzso in the zzso region of zzso such as substitution of a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso selectively resulted in the loss of the capability of zzso to recover the zzso formation of zzso state in the zzso zzso zzso profile of zzso suggests that it spans the membrane once by a zzso stretch of the zzso side as its zzso end to face to the zzso If this is the case, the zzso acid zzso essential for zzso to function are expected to be located close to the donor side of zzso suggesting the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso to facilitate the zzso of zzso by zzso to form zzso state in zzso Evidence against zzso being involved in the electron transfer from zzso to zzso was obtained by the flash zzso zzso
