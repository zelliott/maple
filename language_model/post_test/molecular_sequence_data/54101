A zzso bacterial strain of the zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the Indian zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the isolate shared zzso sequence similarity with zzso zzso zzso the type strain of the only described species of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso between these two strains was zzso zzso zzso zzso The cell wall contained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, which zzso to the description of the zzso zzso The zzso type of the zzso chain of the zzso was zzso Other characteristics of strain zzso zzso were consistent with those of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso moderately zzso zzso zzso and zzso The major zzso was zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso The DNA zzso content was 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is assigned as the type strain of a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso
