Recently, we identified multiple unique sequences in the zzso region and predicted them to be a cluster of genes zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso analysis of these clustered genes revealed that the cluster spans over 165 zzso and consists of 21 zzso sequences including 16 putative genes and 5 zzso These were further divided into two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso All 16 putative genes possess several zzso repeat sequences and apparently belong to the zzso zzso gene family zzso zzso zzso known for nonhuman zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso analysis for all 16 putative zzso genes and their expression was restricted to hair root cells zzso zzso zzso and not found in 28 other zzso including zzso All 16 zzso genes produced zzso zzso indicating their nature to be that of active zzso zzso Interestingly, all these zzso genes are located within zzso of the recently identified gene zzso zzso gene symbol zzso 214 zzso in zzso Surprisingly, the zzso direction of 8 of the 16 active genes is the same as that of zzso This finding suggests a novel zzso mechanism in which zzso gene zzso passes over the multiple zzso termination sites of the zzso zzso
