Research into the molecular basis of zzso interactions is hampered by the inability to alter the expression of individual genes in plants growing under natural zzso The ability of zzso gene zzso zzso to silence the expression of two zzso genes known to mediate the expression of two potent direct zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are produced in different zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso is documented zzso zzso of consensus sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso genes were cloned in sense, zzso and zzso repeat zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso to trigger zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso in plants previously zzso with zzso zzso zzso or left as zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso and zzso increases in the zzso of nicotine and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso with zzso containing appropriate genes inhibited these zzso increases and zzso zzso zzso regardless of the orientation of the gene zzso Root zzso transcript levels were significantly elevated in zzso plants 10 h after zzso but not in plants zzso with the appropriate zzso zzso 9 d prior to zzso treatment, demonstrating that zzso was responsible for the zzso of these potent direct zzso While additional research is required to minimize the effects on plant growth and the risks of using such zzso in natural settings, it is concluded that zzso has a potential to manipulate the expression of genes important for ecological zzso
