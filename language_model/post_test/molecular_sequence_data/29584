Human zzso is the major zzso zzso zzso in adult human liver and is known to zzso many zzso and zzso zzso There is substantial zzso variation in the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported in the zzso regulatory region of the zzso zzso those that have been investigated so far do not appear to have any effect on gene zzso To determine whether other zzso exist in this region of the zzso we have performed a new population screen on a panel of 101 human DNA zzso A zzso zzso section of the zzso zzso regulatory region of the zzso zzso containing numerous regulatory zzso was amplified from zzso DNA as three overlapping zzso The 300 zzso zzso zzso region at zzso containing additional regulatory motifs was also zzso zzso analysis of the resulting zzso products was carried out using zzso single strand zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing of both DNA strands in those samples showing extra zzso zzso In addition to detection of the previously reported zzso zzso in nine subjects, three novel zzso were zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso in one zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso at zzso in 17 subjects) and zzso containing a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso linked to an zzso transition at zzso and a zzso transition in zzso 6 zzso zzso in the zzso in one zzso All the novel zzso were zzso No zzso were found in the upstream zzso zzso zzso Our results clearly indicate that this rapid and simple zzso approach can reveal zzso zzso in drug zzso zzso zzso zzso and determination of the frequency of novel zzso in zzso will assist investigation of the relationship between zzso zzso metabolism and toxicity in the zzso family of zzso
