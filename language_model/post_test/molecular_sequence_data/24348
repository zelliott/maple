zzso zzso of zzso were prepared containing a zzso side chain at position zzso in the zzso surface zzso zzso and a second zzso in the sequence of zzso zzso which includes the zzso loop zzso and zzso ends of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interactions between the spins were analyzed to provide zzso distance zzso in both the dark and zzso states of zzso In the dark state in solutions of zzso zzso the zzso distances are found to be consistent with structural models of the zzso side chain and zzso both derived from zzso zzso of zzso shows a pattern of increases in zzso distance between the reference, position zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso that suggests an outward displacement of zzso relative to zzso by approximately 3 zzso
