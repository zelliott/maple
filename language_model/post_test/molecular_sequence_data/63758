Mass zzso zzso is a technique that is used for biological zzso It consists in zzso a spectrum to a biological zzso A spectrum consists of couples of values zzso zzso where intensity measures the abundance of zzso (as zzso with a zzso ratio zzso present in the originating zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso are used to identify pattern expressions in clinical samples that may be responsible of zzso Recently, to improve the identification of zzso related to patterns, zzso process is used, consisting in performing cascade of mass zzso analysis on selected zzso zzso technique has been demonstrated to improve the identification and zzso of zzso in zzso Nevertheless, zzso analysis deals with a huge amount of data, often affected by noises, thus requiring automatic data management zzso zzso have been developed and most of the time furnished with the instruments zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso pattern recognition, zzso protein databases zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Currently most of the tools supporting such zzso need to be zzso to improve the protein (and their zzso identification zzso In this article we survey on applications supporting zzso and biologists in obtaining information from biological samples, analyzing available software for different zzso We consider different mass zzso techniques, and thus different zzso We focus on tools for zzso data zzso allowing to prepare results obtained from zzso to be zzso zzso zzso analysis, representation and mining, aimed to identify common and/or hidden patterns in zzso sets or in zzso zzso zzso databases zzso to identify zzso and zzso improving and boosting the identification and zzso of selected zzso We trace some open problems and report on requirements that represent new challenges for zzso
