A major mechanism zzso malaria zzso evade the host immune response to give chronic infections in patients' blood for months, or even years, is zzso zzso In order to generate zzso zzso zzso require large zzso zzso Although several gene families involved in these phenomena have been identified in the human malaria zzso zzso to date no zzso zzso gene families have been identified in malaria species that will zzso widely used zzso laboratory zzso Here we present, for the first time, to our knowledge, a large zzso family zzso in both zzso and human zzso which is a strong candidate as a major zzso zzso gene zzso In each of four species of zzso three zzso zzso and the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso of the gene family were found to have a zzso zzso zzso In the zzso malaria zzso zzso zzso of members of the gene family was zzso regulated with maximum expression in late zzso zzso which is the zzso stage known to express zzso zzso zzso
