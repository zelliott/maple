zzso are highly variable zzso proteins hypothesized to be nerve zzso cell zzso zzso As a test of the hypothesis that zzso is restricted to the nerve zzso we examined zzso in the electric organ of the zzso electric zzso zzso zzso generated against the zzso domain of electric fish zzso were used in zzso and Western zzso analyses of the zzso zzso that zzso the electric zzso Our results indicate that zzso is not expressed at electric organ nerve zzso as expected by the zzso zzso Instead, zzso is expressed by zzso zzso and on zzso zzso This zzso has a molecular weight of 140 zzso consistent with an zzso In addition, we find that zzso cells of the zzso nerve also express a zzso These cells surround zzso of zzso to form a diffusion barrier and are thought to be a special form of zzso The results of the study argue against a universal role for zzso as nerve zzso proteins but suggest that zzso are involved in zzso cell and zzso cell zzso
