We describe a simple protocol for introducing random point zzso into cloned DNA fragments via forced zzso of zzso zzso zzso by either of two zzso which lack zzso activity, reverse zzso or a zzso zzso DNA zzso A high ratio of one zzso to the other three is used to enhance the error zzso zzso is initiated from a specific primer and restricted to a relatively short segment by limiting the amounts of the zzso zzso Our method is highly efficient, resulting in the isolation of greater than 50% zzso plasmids with most zzso zzso zzso A wide spectrum of zzso can be zzso in contrast to commonly used methods for random zzso
