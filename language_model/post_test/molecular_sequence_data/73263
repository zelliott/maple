Using zzso zzso we aimed to study the role of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso receptors in the mechanism of zzso hormone zzso zzso in zzso Since zzso cell bodies are located in the rat zzso zzso while most zzso terminals are in the zzso zzso we compared the effects of zzso on zzso of the whole zzso area included) or zzso zzso When zzso zzso is evoked by zzso and zzso a zzso reduction of zzso zzso is caused by zzso zzso for the beta zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso binding studies of zzso zzso show a decrease in zzso and zzso zzso While these zzso effects are observed using whole zzso no such effects are seen using zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso and zzso receptors are zzso in the zzso zzso Using several zzso zzso or zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso release of zzso is not zzso When spontaneous zzso zzso zzso is zzso the zzso zzso zzso cause an increase of the zzso zzso This increase is seen using whole but not zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso result in a reduction of zzso zzso zzso Such a reduction is seen using whole as well as zzso zzso indicating that the zzso and zzso receptors which mediate zzso of zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mediate a zzso effect on zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso in the zzso zzso mediate an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is affected differently than the zzso release of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso pulse generator consist of different cellular zzso
