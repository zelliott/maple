We recently identified zzso 71 of two zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a crucial zzso for differences in their zzso zzso zzso recognition of a distinct three-dimensional zzso To study the role of this key zzso in zzso recognition, we used surface zzso resonance analysis to evaluate the affinities of inactive zzso in which zzso 71 of zzso and zzso were zzso respectively with zzso and zzso toward different types of zzso We identified another zzso acid zzso involved in the interaction with zzso from analyses of inactive zzso between zzso and zzso using an in zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso 72 contributes to collagen zzso By substituting zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso showed a change in zzso specificity and high zzso activity toward type IV collagen comparable to zzso We demonstrated that the neighboring zzso 71 and 72 in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso play an important role in zzso zzso
