We have isolated from a human zzso library a zzso of the zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso Its sequence shows a zzso similarity with the human zzso The zzso gene is located on human zzso 20, while the zzso maps to zzso region zzso in equilibrium zzso An additional locus detected by the full-length zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso region zzso in equilibrium zzso and probably represents a second zzso
