Some bacterial pathogens elaborate and zzso zzso factors in response to environmental signals, others in response to a specific host product, and still others in response to no discernible zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso factors is controlled by a zzso system that zzso an zzso produced by the zzso zzso The zzso activates expression of the zzso zzso a global regulator of the zzso zzso This response involves the zzso regulation of genes zzso surface proteins and those zzso zzso zzso zzso As cells enter the zzso phase, surface protein genes are zzso by zzso and zzso protein genes are subsequently zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a regulatory zzso zzso whose zzso is activated by an zzso signal zzso system for which the zzso is the zzso
