We determined the complete zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso of the Korean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso DNA zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes were in the same order and orientation as the completely zzso zzso of other zzso species, except for the presence of an extra copy of zzso High similarity in primary sequence and secondary structure between the two zzso located copies of the zzso suggest a recent zzso of an original single zzso The zzso arm of the two copies of zzso formed a simple loop as seen in many other zzso zzso zzso The putative initiation zzso for the zzso zzso zzso gene appears to be a zzso zzso found commonly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are next to another zzso gene at their 3' end all had the sequences potential to form a hairpin structure, suggesting the importance of such a structure for precise zzso of the mature zzso zzso
