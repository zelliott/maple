A zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been isolated from a zzso library prepared from leaves of barley zzso zzso zzso An open reading frame encodes a protein of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The derived zzso sequence contains a putative transit zzso zzso required for targeting to zzso and has a highly zzso positioning of critical zzso zzso that are believed to be involved in zzso zzso The derived zzso sequence shows zzso identity with the corresponding protein from zzso but only zzso identity with zzso from zzso zzso The zzso gene is expressed predominantly in leaves and to a lesser degree in seed zzso but not roots, of zzso
