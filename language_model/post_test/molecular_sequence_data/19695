zzso virus zzso zzso preferential zzso integration into the zzso region of human zzso 19 during zzso infection, at least in zzso cell zzso However, integration at the level of the whole zzso zzso in zzso cells has not yet been monitored for zzso as it has been for zzso and zzso Here we have used zzso zzso zzso to monitor the formation of zzso junctions within zzso zzso DNA after zzso Our analyses show that, in the absence of selection, the complexity of junction formation is much greater than for selected zzso zzso of more than 50 authentic zzso clones showed that zzso formed junctions with many different zzso sites via DNA zzso that frequently involved zzso motifs located within the zzso zzso zzso One site at position 280 was zzso Even greater complexity was found when zzso junctions identified by zzso were zzso by direct zzso amplification and cloning of zzso zzso No clones containing zzso zzso 19 junctions were identified among the zzso zzso although they were readily obtained using zzso zzso zzso suggesting that junctions with zzso constituted only a small portion of the zzso Thus, we have identified an additional means by which zzso sequences may join to human zzso although the detailed molecular mechanisms remain to be zzso These data may have implications for the design of zzso zzso zzso
