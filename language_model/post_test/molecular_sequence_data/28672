zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso capable of reducing toxic zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso defense and zzso zzso a zzso zzso library, we isolated two zzso zzso 1 and 2) containing zzso for this zzso On comparison with the zzso zzso zzso 1 contained only two silent zzso exchanges, and the zzso region zzso carrying the functionally important zzso zzso sequence was free of zzso This zzso was found in various mouse strains and could be mapped to the region zzso of zzso zzso In zzso studies indicated significant promoter activity in the zzso region of zzso 1, and we observed a zzso expression of this zzso In the zzso zzso Most zzso transcripts originated from zzso zzso In contrast, zzso 2, containing numerous zzso in all parts of the zzso was not expressed in any zzso It was mapped to region zzso of zzso 17, and we did not detect any promoter activity in its zzso zzso These data indicate the existence of two zzso zzso zzso one of which encodes a functional zzso This zzso belongs to the rare group of zzso that are zzso expressed under the control of captured regulatory zzso and it constitutes an example of zzso acquired zzso in gene zzso The results are important for the design of future knockout strategies aimed at investigating the biological role of this zzso
