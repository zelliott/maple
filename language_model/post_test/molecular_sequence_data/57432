zzso zzso is capable of zzso the zzso of a specific zzso bond in DNA, when used in concert with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso is not caused by zzso damage of the DNA backbone but instead is the result of zzso attack by zzso A single zzso bond is broken in the zzso zzso of DNA by zzso also occurs with an inactive zzso of zzso in which the active site zzso zzso has been replaced by zzso Besides providing information on the mechanism of strand zzso by zzso these results may contribute to the development of new synthetic DNA zzso zzso that act by zzso and not radical zzso
