We have characterized several zzso of the beta zzso of protein zzso zzso The zzso half of the protein exhibits a zzso segment in tandem with a zzso binding domain responsible for the zzso of the zzso by these zzso zzso Study of the chemical features of this zzso binding site showed that zzso zzso exhibiting the highest affinity for zzso are the best zzso zzso zzso analysis disclosed that zzso zzso lying in the zzso region of the zzso zzso are involved in the interaction with zzso molecules and allowed the zzso of an autonomous binding zzso Furthermore, this regulatory domain was shown to mediate the association of zzso with plasma zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso plays a role in the zzso of the zzso since it was observed that a truncated form of this zzso lacking its zzso zzso acids was incompetent for the assembly of zzso forms of zzso Altogether, our results support the notion that the beta zzso of zzso is a modular protein made by the association of zzso zzso that are involved in its multiple zzso
