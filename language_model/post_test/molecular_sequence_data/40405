zzso are zzso and lethal zzso toxins of about 25 zzso that are contained in the zzso zzso of marine zzso zzso zzso In this study, complementary zzso zzso zzso four zzso zzso A, B1 and zzso were isolated from the zzso library constructed from the zzso echo zzso zzso and completely zzso Although the zzso acid sequence identity between the four zzso and zzso (20 zzso zzso from sea zzso was very low zzso some zzso acid zzso important for the biological activity of zzso were well zzso in the zzso In the case of zzso 2, the zzso DNA corresponding to the coding region was zzso zzso data revealed that the zzso 2 gene is devoid of zzso within the coding region as reported for the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso have evolved from zzso or both toxins have evolved from the same zzso
