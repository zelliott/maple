zzso zzso is a zzso zzso bacterial pathogen responsible for severe opportunistic infections in humans and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso O zzso mediates zzso escape and allows bacterial growth in the zzso of infected zzso In order to identify new zzso zzso participating in bacterial zzso this study focused on a major target of zzso zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso region zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso in the zzso or in the two clusters of positive charges zzso the zzso Two zzso zzso (a single zzso zzso and a double zzso zzso zzso were normally and zzso zzso by zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso carrying four zzso acid zzso in the zzso itself zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly susceptible to zzso zzso While these three zzso zzso proteins showed a reduced zzso activity, they all promoted efficient zzso escape and zzso zzso in different cell types, and were zzso The deletion of the zzso zzso as well as the substitution of two, three or four of the four zzso zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso did not lead to the production of a zzso zzso These results confirm the lack of correlation between zzso activity and zzso membrane zzso They reveal the importance of the zzso region in the production of a stable and functional zzso zzso zzso in the mouse model suggest a possible link between zzso stability and zzso
