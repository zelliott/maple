A full-length zzso of an zzso carrier protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso was isolated from the woody oil plant zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso shares about zzso identity with zzso zzso but only about zzso identity with zzso zzso from other zzso The deduced sequence also contains two essential zzso zzso and zzso for TE zzso activity and a putative zzso transit zzso at the zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed that a single copy of zzso is present in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was expressed in all zzso that were zzso most strongly in seeds, in which its expression peaked in late zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso resulted in increased levels of saturated fatty zzso especially zzso and in reduced levels of zzso fatty zzso The findings suggest that zzso from this woody oil plant can function as a saturated zzso TE and could potentially modify the seed oil of zzso zzso to increase its levels of zzso
