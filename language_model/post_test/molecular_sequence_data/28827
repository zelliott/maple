To identify novel human zzso membrane zzso we analyzed two-dimensional gels of zzso extracts containing zzso proteins that zzso into zzso zzso Four protein spots with zzso points zzso ranging from zzso to zzso and apparent molecular weights from 32 to 34 zzso were zzso by mass zzso and found to contain common zzso zzso Cloning the corresponding zzso revealed that these protein spots were products of a single gene zzso zzso a protein of 32 zzso with a predicted zzso of zzso zzso has a potential zzso domain in the zzso zzso and is zzso in zzso on zzso zzso Northern zzso of eight human zzso and zzso dot zzso of 76 human zzso showed that zzso expression was zzso zzso zzso contained an zzso terminal domain zzso to the major zzso zzso surface protein and a domain similar to that of zzso from zzso zzso in its zzso zzso The zzso locus consists of seven zzso on zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso recognized protein spots originally zzso from a two-dimensional zzso This zzso strongly stained the equatorial segment and faintly stained the zzso cap of zzso human zzso by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was associated with the inner zzso membrane in the principal and the equatorial segments of the zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso was localized to zzso phase round zzso and subsequent stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with serum from an zzso man, suggesting that it is zzso zzso against zzso zzso inhibited both the binding and the fusion of human zzso to zzso zzso zzso
