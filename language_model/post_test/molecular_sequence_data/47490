zzso zzso zzso II complexes and zzso containing zzso of zzso zzso proteins have been isolated recently from tissue culture zzso The zzso zzso complex is involved in global gene expression and is essential, but it is not yet known if its zzso counterparts are broadly expressed in zzso or if they are zzso We have isolated the zzso gene zzso zzso an zzso complex protein whose sequence and function is highly zzso between zzso and zzso The mouse zzso gene is single zzso and Northern analysis showed that it is expressed in all zzso zzso zzso of the gene in embryonic stem cells revealed that it is essential for cell viability and zzso embryonic zzso These results, together with evidence that zzso zzso is associated exclusively with high molecular weight forms of zzso zzso II in zzso suggest that zzso zzso complexes occur in most zzso and have essential roles in expression of protein coding zzso
