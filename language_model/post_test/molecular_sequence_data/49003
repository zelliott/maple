The large-scale production of zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso provides significant process and regulatory challenges to the biotechnology industry in order to meet the regulatory agencies stringent requirements in a cost-effective zzso Host cell derived zzso acid causes problems from both a process and a regulatory perspective, as high molecular weight zzso DNA is responsible both for the zzso of cell zzso and it is a source of zzso DNA sequences whose inclusion in the final product must be zzso We have constructed a modified zzso coli zzso expression host zzso containing a zzso zzso expression zzso integrated into the host zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso is expressed as a fusion to the zzso signal zzso and is zzso to the zzso of the cell, protecting the zzso zzso acid from any toxic zzso The zzso is released during cell zzso where it subsequently acts to zzso host zzso acid present in the zzso zzso with this strain show that sufficient levels of zzso activity are produced to completely zzso the zzso zzso DNA to a size zzso on zzso zzso zzso generating a markedly lower zzso zzso This provides a suitable methodology to remove zzso DNA sequences early in the product stream and decrease zzso zzso improving the efficiency of downstream processing and product yield, whilst avoiding the addition of zzso zzso and its prohibitive costs at zzso
