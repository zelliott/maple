The zzso zzso isolated from a zzso zzso rice zzso prevents this fungus from infecting a second host grass, weeping zzso We have investigated the distribution of sequences zzso to zzso in zzso zzso strains isolated from diverse grass zzso Multiple zzso zzso with varying degrees of sequence zzso were zzso The presence of zzso zzso does not correlate with an zzso zzso on weeping zzso in many zzso some strains were fully zzso on weeping zzso although they carry multiple zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned and zzso One of these, the zzso gene previously identified by genetic analysis, functioned to prevent infection of weeping zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso although zzso became functional if its expression was driven by either the zzso or the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes map to different zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of the predicted zzso zzso and zzso proteins have 75, 51, and 57% identity, respectively, to the zzso zzso Our studies indicate that zzso genes are members of a zzso rapidly evolving gene zzso
