The zzso internal transcribed zzso 1 region was zzso for 10 species of zzso and eight species of zzso zzso of the sequences revealed considerable sequence zzso which was zzso to prepare a capture probe of unique sequence for each zzso The capture zzso were tested by zzso zzso combining the sensitivity and specificity of the zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were entirely species specific, enabling the detection and identification of the amplified DNA of species from individual cultures or from mixed samples of the zzso of two different zzso This approach to species zzso which provides a molecular technology to process large numbers of samples and still identify the zzso with a high level of confidence, may greatly reduce the resources and the time of highly trained specialists currently needed to identify these important species of plant zzso zzso
