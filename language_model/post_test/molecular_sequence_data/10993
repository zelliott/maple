In zzso a zzso zzso is found at a position where their zzso sequences predict a zzso zzso In multiple zzso zzso an inherited zzso storage disorder, zzso inactive zzso are zzso which retain the zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso Using in zzso translation in the absence or presence of transport competent zzso we found that newly zzso zzso zzso carry a zzso zzso and that the zzso of its zzso group to an zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso A linear sequence of 16 zzso surrounding the zzso in zzso A is sufficient to direct the zzso This novel protein modification occurs after or at a late stage of zzso protein zzso into the zzso zzso when the zzso is not yet folded to its native zzso
