The zzso zzso is the essential scaffold protein of the zzso zzso complex, which is recruited to the DNA by a diverse group of zzso zzso targeting genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, proliferation and zzso zzso contains four repeats commonly zzso as paired zzso zzso zzso zzso that provide the principal interaction surface for various zzso Here, we present the first structure of the free state of the zzso domain and discuss its implications for interaction with the zzso The zzso zzso is very similar to the zzso observed when bound to either the zzso or zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso domain serves as a template that guides proper folding of the zzso zzso The free zzso domain shows zzso to zzso zzso exchange between the zzso major state and a partially zzso minor zzso Upon complex formation, we observe a significant decrease in fast zzso flexibility of local regions of the zzso correlated with the formation of zzso zzso and an overall decrease in the slow zzso zzso zzso On the basis of our data and using a multiple sequence alignment of all zzso zzso we suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso form zzso binding zzso in full-length zzso like zzso and act as folding templates for the interaction zzso of their zzso
