Evidence for the involvement of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the transmission of tomato yellow leaf zzso zzso zzso is zzso A approximately zzso protein was identified in zzso zzso zzso extracts using an zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The 30 zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso with that from different zzso species and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibited zzso similarities to that of the zzso from zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that tomato yellow leaf zzso virus zzso particles displayed a specific affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Feeding zzso zzso zzso zzso before the acquisition of zzso reduced zzso transmission to tomato test plants by zzso In the zzso of these zzso zzso DNA was reduced to amounts below the threshold of detection by Southern zzso zzso Active zzso were recovered from the insect zzso suggesting that by zzso the zzso zzso the zzso disturbed interaction with zzso leading to degradation of the zzso We propose that zzso of zzso zzso protects the virus from destruction during its passage through the zzso
