One proposed strategy for controlling the transmission of zzso pathogens uses a drive mechanism to ensure the rapid spread of zzso zzso disease zzso throughout wild zzso Here, we report the creation of zzso selfish genetic elements in zzso that drive population replacement and are resistant to zzso zzso of drive and disease zzso zzso These selfish elements use zzso zzso of a zzso expressed gene essential for zzso which is coupled with early zzso expression of a rescuing zzso
