The unconventional zzso are a zzso of zzso motor proteins that are expressed in a wide range of cell types and zzso Thirteen classes of unconventional zzso have been zzso and current efforts are focused on zzso their individual functions in zzso Here, we report the identification of a family of unconventional zzso genes in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chain of an unconventional zzso genes zzso members of zzso classes I, zzso VI and zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a high molecular mass zzso zzso 307 zzso that is one of the most highly divergent zzso and is the founding and only known member of class zzso The physical position of each hum gene has been zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes have been mapped by zzso near previously zzso zzso several of which are zzso identifying potentially essential unconventional zzso genes in zzso zzso
