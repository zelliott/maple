Multiple sclerosis zzso is characterized by the active degradation of central nervous system zzso a zzso membrane system that zzso nerve zzso zzso arises from complex interactions between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the circumstances of zzso zzso remain hypothetical, one persistent theme involves immune system recognition of zzso zzso derived from zzso basic zzso the most abundant zzso zzso membrane zzso and/or another equally suitable zzso protein or zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso particularly their zzso organization, structure, and accessibility with respect to the zzso zzso zzso thus becomes central to understanding how and why these zzso become selected during the development of zzso This article focuses on the current understanding of the molecular basis of zzso as it may relate to the protein and zzso components of zzso which dictate zzso zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso and the relationship, if any, between the zzso components and the destruction of zzso in pathological zzso
