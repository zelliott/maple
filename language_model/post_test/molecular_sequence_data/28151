The induction of several zzso acid zzso under zzso conditions at low pH has been known for many years, but the mechanism associated with this type of regulation has not been zzso To study the regulation of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso to these genes were zzso zzso fusion strains deficient for zzso zzso or zzso zzso were identified using zzso indicator media and zzso for their regulation of zzso zzso The position of the zzso fusion in zzso zzso strains has been mapped to the zzso gene at zzso minutes, while the zzso zzso exhibiting a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso have been mapped to zzso zzso
