zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso a novel family of zzso viral membrane fusion zzso to induce zzso fusion and zzso zzso Unlike the zzso enveloped virus fusion zzso the zzso proteins position the majority of their mass within and internal to the membrane in which they zzso resulting in extended zzso zzso tails zzso Using tail zzso we demonstrate that the last 8 zzso of the zzso CT of the avian zzso zzso zzso protein and the last 20 zzso of the zzso CT of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso but are not required for, pore expansion and zzso zzso Further zzso indicate that the zzso 12 zzso of the zzso and 47 zzso of the zzso zzso are essential for pore formation and that a residual tail of 21 to 24 zzso that includes a zzso zzso zzso region present in all zzso proteins is insufficient to maintain zzso protein fusion zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with scrambled versions of the deleted sequences restored pore formation and zzso while zzso with zzso sequences partially restored pore formation but failed to rescue zzso The zzso regions of the zzso protein zzso therefore exert multiple effects on the membrane fusion reaction, serving in both zzso and zzso manners as positive zzso of pore formation, pore expansion, and zzso
