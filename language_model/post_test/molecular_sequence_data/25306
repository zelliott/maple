The complete zzso sequence of the open reading frame zzso located upstream of the zzso structural gene for zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso This ORF, which codes for a 12 zzso zzso was identified as zzso the structural gene for the zzso zzso a component of the zzso cascade involved in the regulation of zzso activity in some zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso mapping of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was performed with bacteria grown under different zzso zzso The zzso gene can be transcribed either as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso or as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of the two zzso was found to depend on the nitrogen zzso The zzso zzso was the major transcript under nitrogen fixation conditions, while the synthesis of the zzso zzso was almost completely zzso The zzso zzso was predominantly produced in zzso zzso zzso start site analysis revealed the presence of three different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso was transcribed selectively from tandem zzso One of them is similar to the zzso promoter and the other to the zzso coli zzso 70 zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso was regulated by a promoter, which was zzso (or zzso only under conditions of nitrogen zzso when zzso nitrogen was the sole nitrogen zzso The zzso initiation site in front of zzso is not preceded by a zzso zzso coli zzso 70 zzso A sequence reminiscent of the zzso promoter consensus, except for a fundamental zzso was found at positions zzso to zzso This sequence overlapped a putative zzso zzso site, similar to those identified in enteric zzso From these results, it is zzso that zzso zzso is controlled by a novel type of zzso zzso
