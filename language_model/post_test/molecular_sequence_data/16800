We identified four zzso genes zzso zzso proteins that are distant relatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins in the green zzso zzso zzso Their zzso levels after transfer from zzso light to high-intensity light zzso were examined and compared with those of zzso genes zzso zzso proteins of zzso The transfer caused a decrease in the zzso level of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso within 2 zzso followed by gradual restoration depending on the intensity of zzso The response was similar to that of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased, reached a maximum within 1 h after the transfer and then rapidly returned to a low zzso The intensity of zzso little influenced the response of these zzso While the zzso and zzso proteins were zzso of early zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso respectively, zzso zzso a novel zzso The zzso expression of zzso was most prominent among the genes zzso Studies using various zzso indicate that the zzso response is not zzso by the zzso state of zzso pool or zzso oxygen species, but required de zzso protein synthesis in the zzso
