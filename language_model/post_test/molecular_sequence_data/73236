Up to zzso of patients with zzso syndrome zzso have peripheral blood expansions of zzso large zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether the T cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences of these expansions from different patients have features in common that would support the hypothesis of an zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso from peripheral blood zzso followed by synthesis of complementary DNA, inverse zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso usage in such patients demonstrated a zzso region motif zzso the zzso acids zzso or zzso in 7 of 14 zzso sequences and the motif zzso in 8 of zzso A biased zzso zzso region usage of a zzso and/or basic zzso acid at position 2 was seen in 5 of 8 expanded zzso These features differed significantly from control zzso 

Given current models of zzso zzso complex interaction, these observations are consistent with an zzso rather than a zzso process in at least a zzso of patients with zzso
