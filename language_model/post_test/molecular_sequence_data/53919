Our previous analysis of the zzso of metabolism showed that both the zzso of zzso acids and lipids from zzso and the zzso of organic zzso were energetically driven by electron transfer reactions resulting in carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spontaneous zzso zzso direction of carbon group transformation in zzso brought about and driven by the energetically downhill transfer of electron pairs from more oxidized carbon groups (with lower zzso reduction zzso to more reduced carbon groups (with higher zzso reduction zzso In this report, we compare the zzso and kinetic properties of carbon groups in order to evaluate the relative zzso capability of organic zzso and to identify the optimal zzso This analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso are the optimal zzso zzso because they contain the maximum number of zzso useful high energy zzso atom while still containing a single zzso group needed to zzso facilitate their conversion to useful zzso zzso This conclusion applies to zzso life throughout the Universe because it is based on zzso zzso carbon zzso the universal reduction zzso of carbon zzso
