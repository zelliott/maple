In zzso bacteria, zzso and zzso proteins have key roles in reducing cell growth and overcoming zzso Here we identify functional zzso zzso in zzso (named zzso zzso by zzso in human and zzso in zzso zzso and reveal their structures and zzso Like the bacterial zzso zzso proteins contain an active site for zzso zzso and a zzso zzso motif for zzso zzso zzso with these structural data, zzso efficiently zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso also suppresses zzso zzso and zzso delayed cell growth in zzso zzso deletion of zzso zzso in zzso zzso retarded body growth and impaired zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has highly zzso DNA and protein zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso have an zzso zzso function in zzso zzso
