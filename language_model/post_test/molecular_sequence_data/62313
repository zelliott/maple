Although it is widely regarded that the targeting of zzso molecules to zzso destinations depends upon the recognition of zzso found within their 3' untranslated regions zzso relatively little is known about the specific features of these zzso that zzso their zzso zzso between specific repeated motifs within the 3' zzso and zzso proteins has been proposed as a critical step in the zzso of zzso zzso to the vegetal pole of zzso zzso To understand the relative contributions of repeated zzso element zzso zzso we used comparative functional analysis of zzso zzso from two zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that clusters of repeated zzso and zzso motifs are required for efficient zzso However, groups of either site alone are not sufficient for zzso In addition, we present evidence that the zzso borealis zzso zzso is recognized by the same set of zzso proteins as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is capable of productive interactions with the zzso zzso transport machinery as it is sufficient to direct vegetal zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that clustered sets of zzso sites within the zzso direct vegetal transport through specific interactions with the zzso zzso
