zzso have a complex life cycle zzso and zzso hosts as well as larvae living freely in water) in which they are exposed to different environments and temperatures (20 degrees C - 37 degrees zzso Since heat shock genes are activated in response to stress and during development zzso it is of interest to study the zzso gene family in zzso To approach this issue we have isolated from zzso zzso a zzso clone containing the complete coding region of zzso and the zzso zzso DNA with zzso regulatory elements including zzso zzso shock zzso zzso
