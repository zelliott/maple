We report here the full-length zzso sequence of zzso zzso gene from an zzso river zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family: zzso zzso relationship analysis revealed that the identified zzso has high sequence similarity with many zzso fish zzso The tissue distribution and zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso were studied in fish exposed to zzso Liver showed the highest level of zzso gene expression followed by other zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to cadmium zzso Muscle showed a weak expression response of zzso zzso zzso study revealed highest early phase (at zzso expression in the brain and late persistence of induction in the zzso zzso zzso expression showed a zzso expression in all the zzso However, induction in brain and liver occurred at much lower zzso as compared to other zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso in zzso zzso is induced by cadmium exposure which indicates that it plays a functionally zzso function of metal zzso
