zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso protein zzso whose zzso is comprised of two zzso zzso and/or zzso and two zzso zzso The zzso possesses zzso functions that can be physically dissected by generating synthetic fragments encompassing its zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that by mutating basic zzso in the zzso and in the zzso regions of the zzso the negative regulation by the zzso and by its zzso synthetic zzso zzso which is zzso using zzso as a zzso for zzso is drastically zzso In contrast, the positive regulation by a zzso zzso is unaffected or even zzso Moreover, the zzso activity of alpha zzso zzso zzso and zzso toward specific zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso many fold more than that of alpha wild type, while zzso by beta zzso zzso zzso with alpha wild type, is abolished with these zzso These data support the conclusion that down regulation by the zzso zzso clustered in the zzso zzso of beta is zzso by basic zzso in the zzso and in the zzso sequences of the zzso These are also implicated in zzso recognition consistent with the concept that the zzso zzso region of the beta zzso operates as a zzso In contrast, another zzso zzso zzso is more sensitive to zzso by either zzso or its zzso zzso while its stimulation by the zzso zzso zzso is comparable to that of alpha wild zzso These observations suggest an indirect role of zzso in zzso to the zzso a zzso less sensitive to down regulation by zzso
