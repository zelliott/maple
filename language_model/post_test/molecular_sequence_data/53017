zzso protein is one of the zzso of the zzso complex involved in zzso folding of cellular zzso We used the zzso of the human zzso zzso to obtain a full-length zzso from a rabbit kidney zzso zzso Two transcripts of 2 and zzso zzso were detected in rabbit kidney and liver by Northern zzso The rabbit zzso was zzso identical to the human zzso the deduced zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso A zzso analysis of zzso proteins from zzso zzso human, and zzso showed greater similarities of zzso protein among the species than among other zzso zzso The zzso sites were perfectly zzso among zzso and zzso supporting the role of zzso complex in zzso protein zzso Using a zzso zzso to human zzso protein and Western analysis, we found expression of this zzso in a variety of rabbit zzso and zzso as well as in bovine zzso human zzso human and rabbit zzso and in two cultured kidney cell zzso We also found zzso protein by Western analysis in several rabbit zzso as well as in bovine zzso These data characterize the rabbit zzso zzso and compare it to its zzso The Western analyses support the concept that zzso complex is widely distributed among zzso and highly zzso among zzso
