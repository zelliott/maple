We have previously developed a chemically zzso zzso monkey zzso zzso zzso that can zzso in zzso T cells and induce long term tolerance of mismatched zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso is a monkey analogue of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we cloned the light and heavy chain variable regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and constructed a zzso zzso zzso by linking variable light and variable heavy regions with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso the zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso a truncated form of diphtheria zzso The zzso fusion protein was expressed in zzso coli and zzso with zzso affinity and zzso exchange zzso Similar to the chemically zzso zzso zzso zzso can also specifically inhibit protein synthesis in primary monkey T cells in a zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso or zzso at zzso zzso is sufficient to reduce protein synthesis of monkey primary T cells to less than zzso of the zzso The 50% zzso dosage zzso of zzso is 1 zzso zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso is 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting the lowered affinity of zzso zzso zzso to its parental zzso zzso The availability of functional zzso will provide the basis for the construction of zzso zzso zzso for zzso studies on the induction of tolerance in organ transplantation and experimental zzso zzso
