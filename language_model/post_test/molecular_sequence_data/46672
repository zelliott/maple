The two major families of small zzso zzso zzso Box zzso and Box zzso are generated in the zzso and transported to the zzso where they function in zzso processing and zzso We have investigated the sequences involved in the zzso transport of Box zzso zzso by zzso the zzso of injected fluorescent zzso in zzso zzso nuclear zzso Our analysis of zzso zzso and zzso has revealed that disruption of either of the zzso sequence zzso Box H or Box zzso eliminates zzso zzso In addition, the stem present at the base of the 3' hairpin is required for efficient zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso that consist of Box H and Box zzso zzso either the zzso or 3' hairpin are targeted to the zzso The targeting is dependent on the presence of the Box zzso but not on their zzso Our results indicate that in each of the two major families of zzso a motif composed of the signature zzso sequences and an adjacent structural element that zzso the sequence elements directs the zzso zzso of the zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is also targeted to the zzso by a Box zzso zzso
