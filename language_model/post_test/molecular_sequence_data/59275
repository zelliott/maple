zzso zzso zzso electrons by a novel zzso zzso zzso Using the human zzso zzso zzso probe, the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and zzso A specific zzso was zzso identified because the zzso sequence has a stop zzso 7 zzso acids upstream from the initiation site zzso The zzso open reading frame encodes a zzso zzso The position of the initiating zzso site in zzso zzso zzso is consistent with the first zzso site in human and mouse zzso and with the second of two zzso sites in the bovine zzso This result indicates that a five zzso domain model best represents the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso plays a fundamental role in the physiology of all neuroendocrine zzso and the results presented here show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is specific to neuroendocrine zzso and is zzso regulated at the zzso zzso
