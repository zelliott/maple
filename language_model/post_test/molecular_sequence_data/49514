zzso T4 zzso zzso requires zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that form a complex at a middle promoter zzso T4 middle promoters have been defined by a consensus sequence deduced from the list of 14 middle promoters identified in earlier zzso To date, 33 middle promoters have been mapped on the T4 zzso Of these, 12 contain differences even at the highly zzso positions of the consensus zzso In the T4 zzso gene cluster between genes e and zzso we have identified 12 new middle zzso most of which contain differences from the consensus sequence deduced zzso Analysis of base conservation in the different sequence positions of new middle zzso as well as those identified zzso revealed some new features of middle T4 zzso We propose to define these promoters by a zzso box zzso zzso at the position zzso the sequence zzso zzso at zzso relative to the zzso start site, and the zzso region of zzso zzso between zzso
