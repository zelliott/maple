Many cellular signaling pathways share regulation by protein zzso zzso a widely expressed zzso zzso and the zzso G protein zzso zzso activity is altered in zzso and in some neurodegenerative zzso We have identified binding of zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso composed of A zzso B zzso and C zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now show in zzso analysis using zzso zzso that zzso was zzso 3- to zzso by zzso zzso zzso with little effect on zzso zzso To identify the binding zzso zzso the zzso interaction, an extensive zzso analysis was zzso zzso zzso of zzso were expressed in zzso and tested for binding to zzso in pull-down zzso zzso binds to zzso along repeats 7 to 10, and zzso B zzso are not necessary for zzso To identify where zzso binds to zzso a series of 61 zzso zzso were engineered to contain the sequence zzso zzso in place of 6 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were individually expressed in human embryonic kidney cells and analyzed for interaction with zzso or zzso in pull-down zzso The zzso binding sites were localized to regions near the N and C zzso of zzso The expression of zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso zzso canine kidney cells zzso zzso activity as determined by decreased zzso of zzso 307 on the zzso zzso Based on crystal structures of zzso and zzso zzso a model describing the binding surfaces and potential mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso is zzso
