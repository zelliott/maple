The B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be essential for zzso switching and affinity maturation of zzso genes during the immune zzso zzso AID activity has also been linked to zzso and zzso zzso how AID expression is regulated in zzso is therefore central to understanding its role in health and zzso Here we use zzso zzso and high-resolution zzso zzso mapping to accurately zzso AID gene regulatory zzso Based on this strategy, we identify a novel, positive regulatory element required for AID zzso Furthermore, we generate two AID indicator mouse strains using bacterial artificial zzso that faithfully zzso zzso AID zzso The first strain uses a green fluorescent protein reporter to identify B cells that actively express AID during the immune zzso In the second strain, AID zzso affects the permanent expression of a yellow fluorescent protein reporter in zzso center and terminally differentiated zzso We demonstrate the usefulness of these novel strains by resolving recent contradictory observations on AID expression during B cell zzso
