The zzso zzso zzso provides an attractive expression platform and can be exploited as gene source for zzso interesting zzso In the following study, a striking example for the combination of both aspects is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including its promoter and zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The gene includes a coding sequence of zzso zzso zzso a putative 321 zzso acid protein of zzso zzso The zzso characteristics analyzed from zzso of native strains and zzso strains zzso the zzso gene revealed a molecular mass of zzso 140 zzso corresponding to a zzso structure, a pH optimum of zzso zzso and a temperature optimum of 20 degrees zzso The preferred zzso for the zzso include zzso and zzso whereas zzso is not zzso The zzso expression level under zzso conditions was observed to increase in media supplemented with zzso zzso rendering the zzso promoter attractive for moderate zzso gene expression under zzso zzso Its suitability was assessed for the expression of a human serum zzso zzso reporter zzso
