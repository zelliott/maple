A zzso zzso zzso DNA library was constructed in the expression zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated by screening with serum from a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the insert from this clone revealed two open reading zzso zzso peptides of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Database searching indicated that the two genes were zzso of zzso and zzso genes zzso a group of heat shock proteins involved in protein processing, export and zzso Western zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso protein was recognized by zzso raised against four zzso of zzso zzso which originate from South Africa, West Africa and the Caribbean, but not by zzso to the closely related zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of African and European zzso which can be expected to occur in similar geographical areas to zzso zzso This suggests that this protein may be useful in development of zzso tests for zzso zzso infection which are not subject to zzso with zzso to zzso zzso The cloning and expression of the zzso zzso will also facilitate further study of the roles of the zzso proteins in the immune response to zzso zzso
