Two genes zzso proteins related to large zzso of zzso were identified in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that forms water zzso zzso The zzso gene belongs to the form I zzso typically encountered in zzso green algae, and land zzso The second and newly discovered gene is of the form IV zzso and widespread in the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, the expression of both zzso and zzso is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli cells did not display zzso fixation activity but zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso gene rescued a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein functions both in zzso and in zzso and might be involved in a zzso salvage zzso Despite variations in the zzso acid zzso zzso shares structural similarities with all members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids within the zzso site may thus represent the minimal set for zzso whereas variations, especially located in loop 6, may account for the limitation of the zzso reaction to zzso Even at low protein zzso in zzso the zzso zzso assembles spontaneously into zzso the minimal unit required for zzso forms zzso zzso The discovery of the coexistence of zzso and zzso in zzso the ancestors of zzso zzso episodes of the chaotic evolutionary history of the zzso a protein family of major importance for life on zzso
