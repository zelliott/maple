zzso zzso is a zzso zzso found in tropical and zzso zzso The zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso has revealed many genes that zzso its zzso to diverse zzso Moreover, zzso zzso genes with potential applications in industry, medicine and agriculture have also been identified, such as those zzso zzso However, none of the zzso genes of the zzso zzso strain have been subjected to experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso linkages in zzso an abundant zzso found in zzso zzso and zzso These zzso are of great zzso interest as potential zzso agents against zzso and zzso This work aimed to zzso validate one of the zzso from zzso zzso 

The open reading frame zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein zzso zzso that is composed of a signal zzso a zzso domain, a zzso region, and a zzso zzso domain belonging to family 18 of the zzso zzso The zzso was amplified by zzso and cloned into the expression zzso zzso High levels of zzso activity were detected in the zzso culture zzso of zzso coli zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso and induced with zzso The zzso zzso protein was zzso by affinity zzso on a zzso zzso and showed an apparent molecular mass of zzso zzso as estimated by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso sequencing confirmed the proper removal of the native signal zzso during the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso zzso and zzso The optimum pH for its activity was zzso and the zzso retained zzso of its activity when heated to zzso for 30 zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and zzso by affinity zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso protein into the culture medium was directed by its native signal zzso The mature zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso and synthetic zzso This newly identified signal zzso is a promising zzso factor that should be further investigated in future studies, aiming to demonstrate its usefulness as an alternative tool for the zzso production of zzso proteins in zzso zzso
