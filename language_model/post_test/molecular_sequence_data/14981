Comparative zzso has provided evidence for numerous zzso protein zzso whose functions remain zzso We identified a protein harboring zzso of unknown function zzso zzso as a component of group II zzso zzso particles in zzso zzso This zzso assigned the name zzso zzso this zzso zzso from zzso extract with group II zzso zzso is required for the zzso of the zzso with which it associates, and promotes zzso in the context of a zzso with the zzso zzso protein zzso Both zzso and its resident zzso bind zzso in zzso demonstrating that zzso is a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso is found only in plants, where it is represented in a protein family zzso 14 zzso groups in zzso Most members of the zzso family are predicted to zzso to zzso or zzso suggesting that proteins with this domain have multiple roles in zzso metabolism in both zzso These findings add to emerging evidence that the zzso of nuclear and zzso zzso spurred the evolution of diverse zzso zzso motifs that perform zzso zzso
