The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are potent and selective zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Two zzso strains resistant to these compounds were selected and had resistance zzso in genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso by these two genes are the two zzso of the zzso zzso and are necessary for zzso and packaging of viral zzso DNA, a process inhibited by zzso and zzso We now report that both strains also have a previously unidentified zzso in zzso the zzso portal zzso This zzso which results in zzso zzso was introduced into the zzso of zzso zzso by utilizing a recently cloned zzso of zzso as a bacterial artificial zzso The virus with this zzso alone was not resistant to zzso suggesting that this site is not involved in binding zzso zzso As in previous proposals for zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso strains resistant to BAY zzso we zzso that this zzso could compensate for zzso changes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso since the zzso zzso is likely to interact with the portal protein during zzso and packaging of zzso zzso
