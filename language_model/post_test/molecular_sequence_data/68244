The expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso insect cells is often much less efficient than that of other foreign proteins in this zzso In an effort to improve the expression and zzso of such proteins we have constructed zzso zzso which contain the signal zzso coding regions from two zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and the envelope zzso zzso We used these zzso to express zzso zzso inserting the zzso signal peptides in place of the zzso envelope signal zzso When zzso cells infected with zzso zzso made from these zzso zzso and zzso were compared with cells infected with the normal zzso zzso a 6- to zzso increase in expression and zzso of zzso was zzso When the zzso signal zzso was used only zzso or less of the total zzso produced in zzso cells was zzso However, using the zzso or zzso signal zzso up to zzso of the total zzso produced was zzso zzso not only was more zzso produced from these modified viruses but zzso of zzso was more zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso from a 5-liter zzso zzso or a 6-liter zzso flask resulted in a yield of 10 to 15 zzso of zzso protein per zzso Using these zzso signal peptides in zzso expression zzso is thus likely to aid in increasing expression and yield of zzso zzso proteins in insect zzso
