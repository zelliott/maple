The coat protein zzso gene from potato virus Y zzso zzso zzso was engineered into zzso zzso zzso zzso for expression in different tobacco zzso Three different zzso zzso breeding lines were transformed and the integration of the zzso gene was confirmed by zzso technique using zzso DNA zzso The zzso and expression of the integrated zzso gene was detected by Northern and Western zzso zzso resistance was demonstrated by zzso of the zzso progeny of the transformed lines with zzso zzso The efficiency of protection varied between different transgenic plants ranging from almost complete to no zzso Five zzso expressing tobacco lines were resistant to challenge infection with zzso as indicated by zzso or absence of symptom development associated with reduction or lack of zzso virus zzso Data from Western blots showed that there is no correlation between the level of the expressed zzso and the extent of zzso This suggests that the mechanism of the observed resistance is independent of the level of zzso zzso in the transgenic tobacco zzso
