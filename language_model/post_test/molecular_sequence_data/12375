The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso encompasses four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso results in the formation of two overlapping zzso probably originating from a single promoter upstream of zzso The major transcript comprises zzso zzso and zzso while a minor transcript encompasses all of these genes and zzso By deletion analysis and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrate that this gene encodes the zzso zzso immunity zzso zzso is active in zzso coli and when zzso was expressed zzso with zzso both the precursor and the mature form of zzso were observed zzso zzso zzso was only detected if both zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso are zzso zzso of only this domain of zzso in cells producing zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso From these results we conclude that both zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso and that zzso is capable of processing zzso
