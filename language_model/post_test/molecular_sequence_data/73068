We describe a novel human zzso isolated by target site screening of a zzso expression library, using as a probe, an essential element of a zzso zzso promoter corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso a predicted protein of 290 zzso zzso designated core zzso protein zzso which has three zinc fingers zzso zzso at the end of its zzso domain, a zzso central region and an zzso domain lying within the zzso zzso Additional sequence analysis and data base searches revealed that only the zinc finger zzso are zzso zzso zzso in other zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso from a minimal promoter containing its natural zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso protein between zzso and zzso DNA binding domain also increased the activity of an zzso reporter gene containing zzso DNA binding zzso The tissue distribution analysis of zzso zzso revealed that it is zzso expressed with an apparent enrichment in zzso zzso The DNA binding and zzso activity of zzso in conjunction with its expression pattern, strongly suggests that this protein may participate in the regulation and/or maintenance of the zzso expression of zzso and possibly other zzso zzso zzso
