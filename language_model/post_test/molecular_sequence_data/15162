zzso zzso rice was found to contain a substantial amount of zzso with the ratio of the zzso to the zzso being higher for zzso than for other zzso zzso The relative amount of zzso zzso reached approximately zzso six days after zzso A putative zzso zzso gene zzso clone zzso zzso was found in zzso 4 of the zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was expressed as zzso in zzso coli and its gene product zzso was zzso to apparent zzso zzso is a zzso with a zzso molecular mass of zzso and is highly specific for zzso In addition to a zzso zzso reaction, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for which the specific activities were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso The optimum temperature and pH were respectively determined for the zzso reaction (35 degrees C and zzso and for the zzso reaction (35 degrees C and zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso activity of zzso but increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso increases the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso activity of zzso and decreases that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso in zzso indicated that the structure of zzso is distorted by the addition of zzso and this structural change probably regulates the two zzso zzso
