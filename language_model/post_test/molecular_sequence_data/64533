The neural crest gives rise to zzso cells in the peripheral nervous zzso Among the peripheral zzso zzso cells form the zzso often wrapping the peripheral zzso Compared to other zzso cell lineages such as zzso the analysis of fate determination and subsequent differentiation of zzso cells is not well advanced, partly due to the lack of early markers of this zzso In this study, we have identified a zzso uniquely expressed in avian zzso zzso cell zzso which encodes a novel zzso factor, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the earliest phase of zzso cell zzso zzso binds to neural crest cells and zzso cells, and affects the distribution of zzso cells, when introduced to chicken zzso during neural crest zzso Our results suggest an zzso function of zzso and provide a significant step to understand the zzso processes of zzso cell zzso
