zzso dynamics simulations of the zzso zzso interacting with zzso zzso zzso have been carried zzso The zzso and zzso environments of the zzso the zzso chain order, and the zzso and zzso dynamics have been investigated with use of density profiles, zzso distribution functions, zzso chain order zzso profiles, and time correlation zzso It appears that the zzso chain region zzso the peptides in the zzso with minimal zzso to this zzso The zzso dynamics in the zzso bound form has been compared with that of the free zzso in zzso The zzso structure does not vary on the simulation time scale (of the order of hundreds of zzso compared with the solution structure in which a random structure is zzso
