We have designed two zzso zzso for the internal transcribed zzso zzso region in the nuclear zzso repeat zzso These zzso zzso and zzso were intended to be specific to zzso and zzso zzso We have tested the specificity of these zzso against 13 species of zzso 14 of zzso and 15 of zzso Our results showed that zzso when paired with either a zzso primer zzso or the zzso primer zzso efficiently amplified DNA from all zzso and zzso against zzso zzso The results with plants were not as zzso The zzso primer pair produced a small amount of zzso product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the zzso ITS zzso However, under conditions where both plant and zzso zzso were present, the zzso DNA was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant zzso zzso preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the zzso component in zzso and in zzso zzso These zzso can be used to study the structure of zzso communities or the distribution of zzso on alternate zzso
