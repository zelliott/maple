The zzso zzso is a characteristic zzso initially found in the zzso regulatory domain of the zzso DNA binding domain from zzso We have previously described the kinetic folding mechanism of the human zzso domain, and, as part of these studies, we present a structural characterization of the zzso state of the zzso We have obtained a set of chemical shift assignments for the zzso domain in zzso using zzso zzso methods and found regions with persistent residual zzso Based on chemical shift zzso from random zzso values, zzso zzso zzso constants, zzso single quantum zzso peak zzso and nuclear zzso effect data, we have determined clusters of residual structure in regions corresponding to the DNA binding zzso and the second zzso in the folded zzso Most of the structures found are of zzso nature, including zzso zzso zzso zzso at equilibrium displayed a loss in protein concentration zzso in absolute parallel to a similar zzso observed in the folding rate constant from kinetic zzso These results strongly suggest an alternative folding zzso in which a zzso intermediate is formed and the zzso step becomes first order at high protein zzso The structural elements found in the zzso state would collide to yield productive zzso establishing an zzso folding nucleus at high protein zzso We discuss our results in terms of the folding mechanism of this particular zzso in an attempt to contribute to a better understanding of the folding of zzso in general and intertwined zzso proteins such as zzso factors in zzso
