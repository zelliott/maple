The zzso zzso accumulates in zzso only in the presence of bound hormone, whereas the zzso zzso has been reported to be zzso zzso To investigate this distinction, we compared the nuclear zzso zzso of the two receptors and the capacity of their respective zzso regions to regulate nuclear zzso zzso As with the zzso zzso we showed that the human zzso zzso contained a nuclear zzso signal between the zzso and zzso regions zzso acids zzso however, in contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso lacked a second nuclear zzso domain within the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso failed to regulate nuclear zzso signals, although it efficiently regulated other zzso zzso We conclude that the two receptors employ a common mechanism for signal zzso involving a novel zzso function, but that they differ in their control of nuclear zzso Thus, despite the strong zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors in structure and activity, certain differences in their properties could have important functional zzso
