zzso zzso transcript zzso is a putative DC zinc zzso zzso zzso factor described recently in zzso Here, we illustrate that zzso is highly zzso in evolution and report the initial characterization of the zzso zzso of zzso which is also zzso expressed in DC as shown by real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction, and its distribution resembles that of its human zzso Studies undertaken in human embryonic kidney zzso cells depict its nuclear zzso and reveal that the zzso finger domain of the protein is mainly responsible for nuclear zzso The human and the mouse genes are located in zzso zzso regions and exhibit a similar zzso organization with numerous common zzso zzso sites in their promoter region, including sites for many factors implicated in zzso and DC biology, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these data show that zzso is zzso in evolution and that the mouse zzso is more than zzso zzso to the human zzso zzso mouse models can be used to zzso the function of this novel DC zzso
