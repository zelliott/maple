The zzso strain of zzso virus has several recognized zzso including a deletion in the unique short region encompassing the zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and point zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have determined that zzso has zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene relative to the zzso Becker zzso Our analysis revealed that Becker zzso contain the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso do zzso To test whether the zzso in the zzso zzso protein were responsible for this zzso we constructed a zzso zzso strain, zzso which expresses the Becker zzso zzso zzso failed to package zzso into the zzso indicating that zzso other than those in the zzso primary zzso acid sequence were responsible for the failure of zzso to package its zzso zzso A zzso Becker strain, zzso which expresses the zzso zzso zzso was constructed to test whether it was capable of being packaged into zzso The zzso zzso protein was not incorporated into zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the primary sequence of the zzso zzso protein affects packaging into the zzso To determine whether the packaging of other zzso proteins was affected in the zzso strain, we examined zzso Whereas Becker packaged zzso into zzso zzso had a severe zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression in zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso had a slower mobility on sodium zzso zzso gels, indicating either primary sequence differences and/or different zzso modifications relative to Becker zzso Taken together, these data indicate that, while the primary sequence of the zzso protein does affect its incorporation into the zzso other factors are zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that one or more of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso genes influences the zzso of the zzso protein in infected cells, and this effect may be important for the proper incorporation of zzso into zzso
