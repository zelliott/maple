zzso zzso zzso is one method by which protein production is restricted to a particular zzso zzso We report here a novel mechanism for zzso of transcripts zzso distinct protein zzso to different zzso Alternative processing of transcripts produced in the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus introduces distinct 3' untranslated regions zzso that zzso zzso the zzso Three classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the germ line nurse cells and zzso proteins with zzso zzso regions but divergent zzso zzso The zzso and zzso classes of zzso remain in the nurse cells and are not transported into the zzso In contrast, the zzso class of transcripts is transported from the nurse cells into the zzso starting at stage 1, is subsequently localized to the zzso zzso at stage 8 and then to the anterior pole from stage 9 zzso All aspects of zzso transcript transport and zzso are directed by the zzso 3' untranslated region zzso The organization of zzso elements in the zzso zzso is zzso a 150 zzso core is sufficient to direct transport and zzso throughout zzso Additional zzso elements function zzso together with this core region at later stages of zzso to maintain or enhance anterior transcript zzso The swallow locus is required to maintain zzso transcripts at the anterior pole of the zzso and functions through the zzso zzso In addition to the three classes of germ zzso zzso zzso a fourth class zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso cells that surround the germ line zzso This transcript class encodes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
