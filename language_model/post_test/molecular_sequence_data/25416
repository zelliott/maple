This study analyses the influence that the nature of the zzso constant has on the final structures obtained from in zzso molecular mechanics calculations on a zzso complex and compares these structures with the energy zzso complex including explicit zzso zzso zzso have been performed on a zzso structure, where the drug was zzso at the zzso site of the zzso zzso duplex, using two expressions for the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso form and for values of zzso from 1 to zzso zzso different structures are obtained for the zzso and the zzso expressions of the zzso zzso The use of a zzso zzso constant leads to distorted structures, which are very sensitive to slight changes in the value of zzso The use of a zzso zzso constant leads to less distorted and more stable zzso The effects on zzso parameters are zzso in zzso The structures obtained for different values of zzso zzso the zzso zzso seem to zzso for values of zzso equal to 4 or zzso Based on these results a zzso form of the zzso with an zzso value of 4 is recommended in order to produce reliable refined zzso acid structures by molecular zzso These conclusions have been supported by zzso zzso of the same structure with the inclusion of explicit water molecules and zzso
