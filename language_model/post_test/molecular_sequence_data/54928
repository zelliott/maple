The ACT domain is a structurally zzso small zzso binding domain which is mostly involved in zzso acid and zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of a tandem ACT zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso The two zzso zzso in the zzso unit form a zzso with a zzso twofold axis in a zzso manner, showing a zzso structure with a central zzso This structure contributes to expand our knowledge on the structural diversity of ACT zzso zzso
