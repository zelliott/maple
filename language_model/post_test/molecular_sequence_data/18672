zzso and zzso are two recently identified zzso proteins that regulate cell proliferation in an opposite way and are closely related to human cancer zzso Both zzso and zzso consist of an zzso zzso domain and a zzso domain with high sequence zzso The zzso enhancement by zzso is attributed to its interaction with zzso zzso II zzso zzso Here we provide zzso and structural evidence to support and extend this molecular zzso Through zzso polarization analysis, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso bind to different Pol II zzso domain zzso zzso with similar affinity and zzso We also determined the crystal structure of zzso zzso and structural comparisons with zzso domain of zzso a zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso reveal structural basis for the similar binding profile of zzso and zzso with Pol II zzso We also determined the crystal structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso which is a long zzso zzso and each zzso adopts a zzso zzso We propose that zzso through the zzso domain enhances the binding strength between zzso or zzso with Pol II by increasing binding zzso Our results collectively reveal the respective roles of zzso zzso domain and zzso domain of zzso and zzso in recognizing zzso Pol zzso
