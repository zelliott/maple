zzso initiation and processing was examined for three zzso zzso DNA genes zzso zzso zzso and two open reading frames zzso zzso to characterize sequences associated with initiation and other zzso strategies for this zzso The zzso zzso of ten transcripts were determined by primer extension, and zzso was capped with zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso to identify zzso initiation zzso Eight transcript zzso were suitable zzso for zzso zzso indicating the presence of one zzso zzso zzso two zzso or three zzso promoters for the five zzso The majority of the putative promoters were associated with single zzso zzso while two examples exhibited two zzso sites within the zzso Four examples were characterized by initiated transcripts without subsequent processing, indicating that processing is not zzso Each of the putative promoter regions included significant zzso zzso regions, consistent with previous examples, but four exceptions to a consensus core zzso sequence were zzso The anomalies zzso zzso suggest plasticity in the primary structure of the core region of zzso zzso DNA zzso
