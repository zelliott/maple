Human zzso type 6 zzso is a low-risk zzso whose replication cycle, like that of all zzso is differentiation zzso We have previously shown that zzso displacement protein zzso binds the zzso zzso E1 promoter and zzso regulates its activity in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Roman, zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso we now report that zzso Yang 1 zzso a zzso protein that can act as a zzso zzso or zzso and that can also inhibit zzso replication in zzso binds the zzso E1 zzso zzso using zzso of the promoter as zzso showed that the zzso binding site is located at the zzso end of the E1 zzso When a putative zzso site was zzso the ability of zzso to bind was greatly zzso The activity of the zzso E1 promoter, monitored with the reporter gene zzso was zzso greater than that of the zzso promoter, suggesting that zzso zzso regulates zzso E1 promoter zzso Nuclear extracts from differentiated zzso showed decreased binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with this, in differentiated zzso the activity of the zzso zzso gene transcribed from the zzso promoter was comparable to that of the zzso zzso both promoters were zzso in differentiated zzso compared to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso functions in zzso zzso but not in differentiated zzso Both the zzso and zzso promoters could be zzso regulated by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso appear to be negative regulators of the zzso zzso E1 promoter and thereby the zzso life zzso In contrast, only binding of zzso was detected using the E1 promoter of the high-risk zzso
