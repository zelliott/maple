The zzso immune system uses several strategies to generate a repertoire of zzso and zzso zzso receptors with sufficient diversity to recognize the universe of potential zzso In zzso T cells, which primarily recognize zzso zzso presented by major zzso complex zzso most of this zzso diversity is contained within the third zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso Although it has been estimated that the zzso immune system can generate up to zzso distinct zzso pairs, direct assessment of zzso zzso diversity has not proved amenable to standard zzso zzso DNA zzso We developed a novel experimental and zzso approach to measure zzso zzso diversity based on zzso DNA sequencing, and used this approach to determine the zzso sequence in millions of rearranged zzso genes from T cells of 2 zzso We find that total zzso zzso diversity is at least zzso higher than previous estimates, and the diversity in the subset of zzso zzso zzso T cells is at least zzso higher than previous zzso These methods should prove valuable for assessment of zzso zzso repertoire diversity after zzso cell zzso in states of zzso or acquired zzso and during normal zzso
