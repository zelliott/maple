To isolate plant zzso zzso from Western zzso forests in zzso 

A zzso rod zzso cream white zzso strain zzso zzso isolated from Western zzso soil zzso The zzso position of the zzso was confirmed by sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A strain grew at a wide range of temperature ranging from zzso degrees C, but optimum growth was observed at zzso degrees zzso It showed multiple plant zzso attributes such as zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso acid zzso production, zzso production and zzso zzso It was able to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and produce zzso zzso zzso at 28 degrees zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was associates with a drop in the pH of the culture zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerate to different environmental stresses like zzso degrees C, zzso salt concentration and 4-12 pH zzso 

The zzso zzso gene sequence confirmed that the isolate zzso was belongs to zzso zzso and showed considerable differences in zzso properties with previously reported species of this zzso zzso zzso possessed multiple attributes of plant zzso zzso 

Hence in the context it is proposed that zzso zzso zzso could be deployed as an zzso to attain the desired plant zzso activity in agricultural zzso
