zzso of DNA zzso zzso is a challenging problem for zzso Many human gene products influence sensitivity to DNA zzso agents, but the mechanisms of zzso repair are zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso leads to marked sensitivity to DNA zzso zzso The zzso portion of the zzso zzso encodes a DNA zzso whereas a putative DNA zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso As a step toward zzso proteins involved in DNA zzso repair, we searched for zzso genes similar to the DNA zzso portion of zzso Human and mouse zzso were isolated from zzso expression libraries and designated zzso Human zzso is on zzso zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The protein was expressed in insect cells and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso of a highly zzso zzso to zzso in zzso domain I eliminated both zzso The protein readily zzso zzso to zzso duplex zzso zzso of longer zzso was less efficient but was zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was supported by zzso or zzso but not other zzso zzso The zzso zzso on DNA with 3' to zzso polarity and behaves as a zzso upon gel zzso
