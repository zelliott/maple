zzso DNA sequence analysis was used to define the extent of deletions within the C1 inhibitor gene in two families with type I zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis initially indicated the presence of the partial zzso One deletion was approximately 2 zzso and included zzso zzso whereas the other was approximately zzso zzso and included zzso zzso zzso libraries from an affected member of each family were constructed and clones containing the deletions were zzso zzso analysis of the deletion zzso of the zzso and corresponding regions of the normal gene in the two families demonstrated that both deletion zzso resulted from zzso of two zzso repetitive DNA zzso zzso repeat sequences from zzso VI and zzso combined to make a novel zzso in family A, and zzso sequences in zzso III and VI were spliced to make a new zzso in family zzso The zzso sites in the zzso sequences of both zzso were located in the left arm of the zzso element, and both zzso zzso overlapped one of the zzso zzso III promoter zzso Because the involved zzso zzso in both instances, were oriented in the same direction, unequal zzso is the most likely mechanism to account for these zzso
