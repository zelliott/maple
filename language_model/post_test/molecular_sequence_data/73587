The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is essential for promoter zzso zzso Factor directs the zzso zzso core zzso zzso zzso to the promoter consensus elements and thereby zzso selectivity for zzso zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso has been shown to inhibit DNA binding by the zzso DNA recognition zzso Since DNA recognition is the first step of zzso zzso we predicted that the zzso domain of zzso may also influence the initiation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso derivatives were used to zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso of the first 75 to 100 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso resulted in both a slow rate of transition from a closed promoter complex to a zzso zzso open complex, as well as a reduced efficiency of transition from the open complex to a zzso initiated zzso These effects were partially reversed by the addition of a zzso containing region zzso in zzso zzso region zzso not only zzso DNA binding but is important for efficient zzso zzso once a closed complex has zzso A deletion of the first 133 zzso zzso which removes regions zzso and zzso resulted in arrest of initiation at the earliest closed complex, suggesting that region zzso is required for open complex zzso
