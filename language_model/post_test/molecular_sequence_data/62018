zzso a zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso increases the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in human liver cells, which may partially explain the increase of this zzso in the serum of individuals undergoing zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso We compared the mechanisms of zzso action in human and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso rat promoters in zzso and zzso cells established a critical role for sequences similar to nuclear zzso responsive elements in the zzso zzso zzso Nuclear proteins bound to these sequences and the amounts of protein bound were decreased by zzso treatment, probably accounting for the decreased gene zzso zzso studies confirmed the involvement of zzso However, this zzso did not bind directly to these zzso The human promoter was cloned and the regulatory region localized between zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that, in humans, the zzso was also involved in the increase in expression of the zzso gene due to zzso without the presence of a zzso zzso responsive zzso
