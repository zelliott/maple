Living zzso growing in a hot spring in Yellowstone National Park are composed of zzso zzso zzso Two zzso mat types grow on the zzso surfaces and are preserved as two distinct zzso One mat is present when the zzso are submerged or at the zzso interface and the other when zzso zzso from the hot zzso The zzso created by the zzso of submerged mats constitutes the bulk of the zzso is comprised of zzso zzso and is distinctly zzso To better understand the zzso membership and community structure differences between the mats, we collected mat samples from each zzso zzso methods revealed that submerged mat zzso were predominantly one novel zzso while the exposed mats were predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso dominating the submerged mat type does not belong in any of the zzso groups of zzso recognized by the zzso Database Project and has also been found in association with zzso zzso in a Southwest Japan hot zzso zzso membership profiles indicate that the zzso zzso are zzso zzso members of the submerged zzso The zzso zzso likely emerge when the water level of the hot spring zzso Environmental pressures tied to water level such as zzso exposure and possibly oxygen tension may inhibit the zzso types in submerged zzso These living zzso are finely laminated and therefore, in texture, may better represent similarly laminated ancient forms compared with more zzso laminated living marine zzso
