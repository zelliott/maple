Small cell lung zzso is an aggressive neuroendocrine tumor that zzso several hormones, some of which act as zzso growth zzso In order to obtain more information on the process of hormone zzso from this zzso we have studied the role of zzso free zzso zzso and zzso calcium channels in the control of zzso release from in zzso growing cell zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso increase of zzso zzso and a parallel enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso a zzso and zzso zzso release that in the zzso cell line was effectively inhibited by zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso against zzso channels present in the zzso of zzso zzso patients antagonized zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis indicated that zzso cells express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channel alpha 1 zzso together with two types of zzso channel beta zzso The presence of three functionally distinct high threshold zzso channels was also revealed by patch clamp zzso high threshold zzso channels were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is released by small cell lung zzso cells in a zzso manner and that zzso zzso release is zzso by zzso influx through zzso zzso zzso channel zzso
