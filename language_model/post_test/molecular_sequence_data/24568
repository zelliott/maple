zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso for the presence of genes specifying resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of the genes zzso zzso and zzso but also for the confirmation of their physical linkage were zzso A resistance gene cluster consisting of all three genes and zzso by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected on four different types of plasmids and also in the zzso DNA of seven zzso zzso linked zzso and zzso genes were detected on three different types of plasmids and in the zzso DNA of three zzso zzso analysis of the different zzso zzso revealed that these genes were present in either the orientation zzso separated by differently sized zzso zzso or zzso A truncated zzso gene preceding a zzso gene was also detected in two zzso
