zzso in zzso zzso zzso T cells has been well established in several experimental zzso Although it is clear that regulatory zzso zzso play a crucial role in the control of zzso cells, it is still not clear whether zzso zzso zzso clones are also involved in control of zzso We have shown that zzso zzso and zzso zzso play an important role in the spontaneous recovery and resistance from zzso of experimental zzso zzso in zzso zzso We report, by sequencing of the zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso that the zzso repertoire is limited and the majority of zzso zzso use the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Interestingly, sequencing and zzso data of cloned and zzso zzso populations revealed that a dominant public zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso with a zzso length of 7 zzso exists in the zzso peripheral repertoire and is expanded during the course of recovery from experimental zzso zzso Furthermore, a higher frequency of zzso zzso clones in the zzso repertoire zzso with less severity and more rapid spontaneous recovery from disease in parental zzso or zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that unlike the zzso diverse zzso repertoire among the zzso zzso population, zzso zzso zzso involved in negative feedback regulation of zzso use a highly limited zzso zzso zzso Thus, a selective set of zzso zzso as well as zzso T cell clones can be targeted for potential intervention in zzso disease zzso
