In recent years, zzso peptides have been studied in great zzso Much of the focus has been on the zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been conducted with nuclear magnetic zzso with additional information obtained from circular zzso zzso transform zzso and molecular dynamic simulation zzso Point zzso both in the zzso and in the turn region, have systematically explored the role of turn zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso length on zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to studying the elements of structural stability zzso the cooperative nature of the individual components to combine to form the overall structure has also been zzso Because the zzso peptides often spontaneously form their zzso they have begun to serve as models for studying zzso binding and therapeutic zzso
