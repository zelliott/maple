zzso sequence variation in the zzso region of zzso in white sturgeon zzso zzso a zzso North American fish species, was examined in 27 individuals from populations of the Columbia and Fraser zzso zzso varied zzso positions were present in a zzso zzso zzso amplified using the zzso chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso trees of sequences from 19 zzso suggest that the two populations have recently zzso This is consistent with the hypothesis that the Columbia River, a zzso zzso habitat, was the source of founders for the Fraser River after the last glacial zzso On the basis of a divergence time of zzso thousand years ago, the estimated substitution rate of the white sturgeon zzso region is zzso zzso zzso zzso which is comparable to rates for zzso sequences in the human zzso zzso Furthermore, the ratio of mean percent zzso differences in the zzso zzso to that in whole zzso zzso as estimated from zzso zzso is zzso which is similar to the zzso substitution rate estimated for the human zzso The high zzso substitution rate of the zzso region indicates that the zzso zzso has potential as a genetic marker in molecular population zzso
