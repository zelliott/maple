We analyzed zzso variation in the zzso genes of zzso zzso (five zzso and zzso zzso (four zzso to characterize the zzso and diversifying roles of gene conversion in their zzso Gene conversion within and between the zzso and zzso gene clusters zzso the zzso coding zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are virtually zzso and large zzso conversion tracts diminish zzso zzso zzso zzso share many zzso consistent with frequent zzso zzso Shared zzso is highly biased toward silent zzso zzso conversion interacts with zzso zzso In contrast to the coding regions, some zzso zzso regions show zzso zzso Strong reductions of zzso zzso and linkage zzso among zzso sites in zzso and zzso zzso sampled from a single natural population are consistent with a selective zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes reveals zzso fixed differences, consistent with rapid propagation of novel zzso among duplicate zzso These results suggest that the zzso and diversifying roles of conversion interact to drive dynamic concerted evolution of the zzso zzso
