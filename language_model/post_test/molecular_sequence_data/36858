The specificity of the anti zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso experiments with zzso human zzso and by zzso of zzso In addition, binding to various zzso and zzso by different zzso and zzso were examined by zzso zzso with zzso to the zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso zzso increased their zzso by zzso zzso similar treatment of zzso cells decreased their zzso zzso This is in line with the known location and zzso sensitivity of A and N specificity zzso Treatment of the zzso with zzso increased their zzso and abolished the distinction between N and M zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso and its binding to zzso measured by zzso zzso confirmed the high specificity of zzso for zzso zzso times more than for zzso and suggested the presence of zzso interactions around zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso were better zzso than the corresponding zzso this preference was zzso and sometimes zzso when the zzso zzso of the same zzso were tested, stressing again the importance of zzso interactions in the binding of carbohydrates to zzso The zzso reacted well with zzso substance and with zzso A of the N zzso zzso but did not react with zzso substance or zzso The strongest inhibitor was zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains many zzso zzso zzso calculated per zzso zzso it was 1500 stronger than free zzso In accordance with this result, it was found that the zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso The specificity of zzso can, thus, be defined as zzso zzso with blood types A and zzso and with zzso The zzso can best be explained by assuming that zzso contains a small number of zzso or partially zzso zzso zzso which are present in smaller proportions, if at all, in zzso
