We investigated the spatial and zzso response of the zzso gut zzso to infection with zzso zzso an zzso zzso that provokes innate and zzso immune responses, resulting in transient bacterial zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso zzso inflammation is associated with an increased abundance of zzso We report here a deeper analysis of this model using DNA bar coding and zzso zzso to characterize zzso partial zzso zzso gene sequences from 85 microbial samples from zzso and zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which allowed us to identify previously unappreciated spatial and kinetic changes in multiple bacterial zzso The deep sequencing data revealed that zzso zzso was most abundantly associated with the zzso zzso at day 9 zzso and then diminished in zzso providing the first reported use of deep sequencing to track a pathogen in zzso through the course of zzso zzso changes were associated with both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at both day 9 and day 14 zzso zzso in abundance were seen for zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, changes in zzso could be accounted for by the presence of zzso zzso itself, which is a member of this zzso The zzso group decreased in abundance during infection, which may be important for zzso because members of this lineage zzso the composition of the gut zzso and are used as zzso Thus, deep sequencing provides previously zzso information on how zzso infection and clearance zzso the gut microbial community in space and zzso
