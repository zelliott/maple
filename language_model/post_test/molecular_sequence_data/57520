The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is zzso by serum zzso A genetic zzso of zzso zzso activity which determines high versus low zzso zzso in human zzso may determine sensitivity to zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso at position 192 specifies high activity zzso whereas a zzso specifies the low activity zzso zzso zzso or restriction zzso analysis of amplified DNA allow for the zzso of zzso zzso maps to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in agreement with previous genetic linkage zzso
