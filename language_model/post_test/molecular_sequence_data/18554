We investigated how root zzso zzso zzso to root dry weight, Lo ) is regulated by the zzso zzso topping (about zzso reduction in leaf zzso reduced Lo of zzso zzso zzso zzso soybean zzso max zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by 50 to zzso More detailed investigations with soybean and zzso showed that the reduction in Lo was not correlated with the reduction in leaf area, and zzso or cutting single leaves had a similar zzso Percentage reduction in Lo was largest when initial Lo was high in zzso zzso of Lo by weak acid zzso zzso was smaller after shoot damage or leaf zzso The half time of reduction in Lo was approximately 5 zzso after total shoot zzso These characteristics indicate involvement of zzso We excluded zzso signals and zzso zzso zzso zzso signals are possible since zzso rapidly decreased within root zzso cells after shoot zzso There was a significant reduction in the expression of several zzso in the plasma membrane intrinsic protein zzso family of both zzso and zzso In zzso there was a five- to zzso reduction in zzso expression over zzso h which was sustained over the period of reduced Lo zzso
