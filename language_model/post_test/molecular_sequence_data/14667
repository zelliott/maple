zzso zzso account for about zzso of cases of childhood zzso Heat shock zzso factor 4 zzso is related with human zzso dominant zzso and zzso zzso a zzso transition at zzso 348 was found in a large Chinese cataract zzso The aim of this study was to analyze the unique role of zzso and the zzso of zzso 

The zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso coupled with the two-dimensional liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso technique, was used to identify and zzso differential zzso in human lens zzso cell lines zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of 104 unique proteins were identified from the human lens zzso cell lines zzso zzso Apart from the proteins due to the effect of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso led to 23 zzso expressed zzso of which four were zzso proteins and three were zzso zzso The zzso transition at zzso 348 in zzso led to 18 zzso expressed proteins in zzso zzso among which zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso and zzso protein belong to heat shock protein zzso The zzso or zzso proteins were functionally analyzed using zzso Pathways Analysis zzso to interpret the interaction network and zzso zzso pathways involved in these zzso expressed zzso 

A multitude of zzso expressed proteins was found to be associated with zzso and a zzso transition at zzso 348 in zzso The proteins zzso directly or indirectly with each other, and they may provide clues as to how zzso zzso protein expression in the lens zzso cells of zzso zzso Although further investigation is required, the results may provide some new clues to the zzso mechanism of zzso and cataract zzso
