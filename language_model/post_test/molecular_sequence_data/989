The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from its wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a loss of genetic diversity both through a population bottleneck and through directional selection at zzso important zzso In order to discriminate between those effects and to investigate the nature of the zzso zzso we analyzed zzso diversity data from 12 zzso 1 zzso in zzso We found an average loss of zzso diversity of 38% across zzso but this average was skewed downward by four zzso selected zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To better understand the zzso process, we used the zzso with zzso to simulate bottlenecks under various lengths and population zzso For each zzso we determine the likelihood of the observed data using three summary statistics: the number of segregating sites, an estimate of the population zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on the eight zzso evolving zzso a model with a bottleneck had a significantly higher likelihood than a model without zzso The four zzso selected zzso had significantly different likelihood zzso than the neutral zzso and this approach confirmed that zzso and zzso were selected either during zzso or zzso Overall, the zzso models had a bottleneck in which the population size and the bottleneck duration had a ratio of approximately zzso to approximately zzso for example, if the initial zzso event occurred over a zzso period, the population size was roughly 2,000 to 2,500 zzso However, this range did vary with the summary statistic used to assess the fit of simulations to zzso In this context, zzso D performed poorly as a zzso zzso probably because zzso zzso zzso zzso has a frequency spectrum that is significantly skewed toward zzso zzso Finally, we found that demography is unlikely to account for the previously observed positive correlation between zzso diversity and the zzso zzso in zzso leaving this observation difficult to zzso
