zzso surfaces of the type II transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso domain zzso are mapped by combining zzso zzso results with zzso modeling of the zzso zzso Of the 17 deletion zzso produced within the core binding domain of zzso only three retained binding to zzso Comparative modeling based on the crystal structure of the zzso type II zzso zzso domain zzso indicates that the zzso zzso which retain zzso binding are deleted in some of the zzso connecting the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso data within the structural framework of the zzso model allows for the prediction of potential binding sites at the surface of zzso
