Natural zzso preparations containing zzso and the zzso zzso proteins B and C zzso and zzso are effective in the treatment of respiratory distress syndrome in premature zzso The limited supply, and the risk of infectious agents and zzso reactions have promoted the evaluation of synthetic peptides in zzso zzso However, the folding of synthetic zzso into an zzso is inefficient and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso form zzso In order to circumvent these problems we have zzso an zzso zzso named zzso which differs from zzso mainly by the exchange of most of the Val zzso in positions zzso with zzso zzso to promote an zzso zzso and by the introduction of zzso zzso at positions 17, 22 and 27 in order to locate positive charges around the zzso circumference and thereby avoid self zzso CD zzso showed a spectrum typical for zzso peptides and zzso disclosed a single zzso The zzso activity of artificial zzso preparations containing zzso and zzso with and without native zzso was measured using a zzso balance and a pulsating bubble zzso zzso zzso zzso in a mixture of 1, zzso zzso acid zzso by zzso suspended in 150 zzso zzso showed rapid spreading at the zzso interface and produced a surface tension of zzso zzso at minimum bubble size zzso and 42 zzso at maximum bubble size zzso in the pulsating bubble zzso The addition of zzso zzso zzso to the preparation reduced the maximum surface tension to zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso values were similar to those of natural zzso zzso zzso in zzso characteristics were also obtained from a preparation containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso when zzso acid was omitted from the zzso zzso zzso containing zzso preparations made up in zzso buffer at pH zzso instead of in 150 zzso zzso had similar zzso activity provided that zzso acid was zzso but decreased activity in the presence of zzso zzso
