In humans, assembly of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso begins in the zzso where the zzso zzso zzso of motor zzso complex mediates the formation of a zzso ring of zzso proteins on to a zzso site of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso The zzso complex contains the zzso protein zzso and several additional zzso that participate in zzso zzso zzso was first identified as the product of a gene found to be deleted or zzso in patients with the neurodegenerative disease zzso zzso muscular zzso the leading genetic cause of infant zzso In the present study, we report the solution structure of zzso bound to the zzso domain of zzso determined by zzso zzso This complex reveals the structure of zzso how zzso binds to zzso and the roles of zzso zzso zzso near the binding zzso Surprisingly, several zzso zzso zzso including the sites of two zzso patient zzso are not required for binding to zzso Instead, they form a zzso zzso surface that may be functionally important for zzso zzso The zzso structure explains how zzso is stabilized by zzso and establishes a framework for zzso studies to investigate zzso zzso as well as biological processes involving zzso that do not involve zzso zzso
