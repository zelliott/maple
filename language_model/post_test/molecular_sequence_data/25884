We have searched for induced transcripts in a zzso library derived from bean cell zzso cultures treated with an zzso from zzso zzso Six independently isolated zzso corresponding to rapidly induced small zzso have been classified by their DNA sequence and slightly different induction zzso into two zzso zzso and zzso regions exhibit little zzso but the deduced small zzso proteins designated zzso and zzso are zzso zzso No relationship was found with the zzso zzso proteins from zzso However, the zzso proteins are closely related to zzso in pea zzso zzso zzso in potato zzso zzso and zzso in parsley zzso zzso which are also induced in response to zzso or microbial zzso Moreover, a major zzso zzso in birch zzso has a zzso identity with zzso zzso These similarities establish a ubiquitous class of zzso zzso proteins and suggest a common yet still unknown zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that zzso protein gene organization is highly complex with an estimated copy number of more than 12 zzso
