zzso acid zzso coding methods determine the meaning of a certain character in individual zzso by the characters surrounding zzso The meaning of each character is context dependent, not position zzso Although zzso coding is most commonly used in genetic zzso zzso a zzso coding formation is in fact more closer to the natural DNA zzso With the context dependency, the DNA coding methods allow zzso parts, zzso and variable string length in zzso strings while remaining compatible with the standard genetic zzso This paper tries to explicitly explore the influence of those special features of the DNA coding zzso Two fundamental DNA coding methods (with and without the use of zzso are constructed and compared with the zzso coding method, which lacks the features of zzso The performance of the proposed DNA coding methods is analyzed through the robot soccer role assignment zzso The zzso coding exhibits the advantages in handling the negative effect of zzso The zzso and zzso parts are helpful in preventing useful zzso from disruption and in increasing the population zzso The variable length of the individual string enables zzso to evolve both the size and the structure of the fuzzy rule zzso
