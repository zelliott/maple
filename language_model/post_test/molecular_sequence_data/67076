To evade host resistance mechanisms, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso must alter its zzso following zzso zzso To identify new colonization and zzso factors that mediate zzso zzso we have isolated zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso at various time points following infection and used a liquid zzso zzso zzso approach to detect the changes in zzso protein zzso Because host resistance to zzso infection is strongly modulated by the expression of a functional zzso regulator, zzso natural zzso zzso protein 1 zzso also called zzso we have also examined the effects of zzso activity on the changes of zzso protein zzso A total of 315 zzso proteins have been identified from isolated zzso cells, which are largely zzso proteins whose zzso remain relatively constant during the time course of zzso However, 39 zzso proteins are strongly induced after infection, suggesting their involvement in modulating colonization and zzso Of the 39 induced zzso 6 proteins are specifically modulated by zzso activity, including zzso as well as zzso whose zzso abundance changes were confirmed using Western zzso zzso zzso of the gene zzso zzso resulted in a dramatic reduction in the ability of zzso to colonize zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrating a critical involvement of zzso in promoting the replication of zzso inside zzso The predicted function common for zzso is zzso and modification of the zzso layer of the zzso cell zzso
