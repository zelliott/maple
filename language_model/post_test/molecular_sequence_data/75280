We have generated a series of rat zzso cell lines that zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso the beta 1 form of protein zzso C zzso These cell lines contain a zzso to zzso increase in zzso activity and exhibit dramatically enhanced zzso changes following exposure to the tumor promoter zzso zzso zzso They grow to a high zzso density in zzso cultures and, when maintained at zzso develop small, dense zzso In contrast to control cells, which display complete zzso zzso zzso cells form small colonies in soft zzso in the absence of zzso and large colonies in the presence of zzso Thus, the mere overproduction of a single form of zzso is sufficient to zzso multiple growth abnormalities in rat zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso plays a critical role in growth control and that it mediates several of the cellular effects of the zzso zzso tumor zzso They also suggest that the zzso of zzso may be of central importance in the process of zzso zzso
