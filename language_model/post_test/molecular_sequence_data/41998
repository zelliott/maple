An zzso substitution in the mature von zzso factor zzso has been associated with defective binding of zzso to factor VIII zzso We studied four families with members initially classified as having type I von zzso disease zzso who were either zzso or zzso for the zzso zzso The first family was the original case described by zzso et zzso zzso where three members were zzso for the zzso zzso They had a low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio, from zzso to zzso and the ability of their plasma zzso to bind zzso was markedly zzso All the zzso members had normal zzso and zzso levels but the capacity of their plasma zzso to bind zzso was reduced and intermediate between the zzso members and zzso The affected individual from the second family was zzso for the zzso zzso and demonstrated a zzso ratio of zzso The zzso binding zzso confirmed the zzso status indicating that the moderately low levels of zzso were due to reduced expression of both zzso The zzso from the third family was also zzso and had below normal levels of zzso as well as a low zzso ratio of zzso however, zzso binding to her plasma zzso was similar to that of the zzso individuals suggesting that zzso was the major circulating zzso Her daughter who has type I zzso inherited the zzso without the zzso zzso indicating that the expression of this zzso was indeed zzso The zzso patient in the fourth family had a zzso level of 24 zzso but an zzso ratio greater than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
