Many bacterial pathogens produce a class of surface structures called type 4 zzso In zzso zzso these zzso are responsible for zzso and zzso across host zzso zzso We have identified a novel gene involved in the complex process of type 4 zzso zzso This zzso termed zzso is located on zzso zzso S at 30 zzso on the zzso zzso zzso map, which is the sixth region on the zzso shown to contain a zzso zzso The zzso protein has a predicted zzso of zzso and together with a highly zzso upstream zzso shares a zzso arrangement similar to that found in zzso zzso A zzso zzso is blocked in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and accumulates this protein in the membrane zzso zzso studies indicate that the cloned zzso gene is able to restore the expression of surface zzso twitching zzso and zzso to zzso zzso
