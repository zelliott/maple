zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso forms complexes with zzso zzso 6 zzso from zzso host zzso These complexes show higher zzso activity than host cell zzso in complex with cellular zzso and are resistant to zzso zzso proteins zzso The crystal structure of human zzso in an active state was determined to zzso A resolution to better understand the structural basis of zzso zzso by viral zzso The zzso zzso in complex with zzso has many features characteristic of zzso zzso zzso There are, however, differences in the zzso at the tip of the zzso and its interactions with zzso zzso in the zzso extension of zzso wrap around the tip of the zzso zzso and form a short zzso with the zzso zzso These interactions lead to a zzso larger buried surface in the zzso interface than in the zzso complex and are probably largely responsible for the specificity of zzso for zzso and resistance of the complex to zzso by zzso zzso
