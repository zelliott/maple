Human von zzso factor zzso gene sequences zzso to zzso function as an zzso promoter in zzso Analysis of the zzso mechanism of the zzso promoter has resulted in the identification of a number of zzso elements and zzso factors that regulate its zzso The zzso and zzso zzso factors were shown to function as zzso of transcription, whereas zzso and zzso were shown to repress zzso We have reported the presence of another zzso element in zzso 1 that zzso with a protein complex designated zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso of this interaction resulted in promoter zzso in zzso zzso We have now identified the zzso protein complex as the zzso zzso zzso Using DNA zzso interference zzso and base substitution zzso analysis, we show that zzso interacts with a novel DNA sequence corresponding to zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso promoter that does not conform to the consensus zzso binding sequence zzso The zzso gene does contain a zzso element that is located downstream of the zzso box and we show that the zzso factor also interacts with this zzso zzso Using zzso specific against the A, B, and C zzso of zzso we demonstrate that the zzso complexes interacting with the zzso sequence have a composition similar to that of the zzso binding to the first zzso zzso The results of zzso analysis and zzso studies demonstrated that the interaction of zzso with the upstream zzso element is required for zzso promoter zzso Based on these results, we zzso that zzso can function both as a zzso and zzso of zzso and its function may be modulated through its DNA binding zzso
