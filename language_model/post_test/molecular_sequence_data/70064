This study was designed to measure the survival and development of zzso stage bovine zzso after zzso with DNA and either culture in zzso or incubation in the sheep zzso and to determine the percentage of zzso that retain zzso DNA at the zzso zzso In zzso matured and zzso zzso were examined for zzso development 18 to 20 h after zzso with zzso An zzso zzso gene construct was zzso into zzso with visible zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the same in zzso derived pool were zzso with zzso zzso cells or incubated in the sheep zzso and zzso respectively, for 7 zzso zzso were subjected to zzso chain reaction analysis for detection of zzso zzso The percentage of zzso zzso that formed zzso was similar for zzso and zzso cultured zzso The percentage of zzso recovered from the sheep zzso that hatched was higher than for zzso that developed in zzso Fourteen of 26 zzso zzso that developed from zzso zzso were positive for the zzso DNA by zzso chain zzso The implications are discussed for zzso chain reaction detection of the zzso gene construct in a relatively high proportion of zzso zzso
