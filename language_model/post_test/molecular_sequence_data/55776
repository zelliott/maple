zzso acid deletion and zzso experiments have indicated that the sequences zzso zzso preceding the first zzso at the N zzso of zzso 8 zzso is required for zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso is structurally related to zzso zzso sequence zzso but lacks the zzso zzso sequence and comparable effects on zzso We introduced the zzso sequence at the N zzso of zzso and found that the modified protein was a potent zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, when the zzso sequence was introduced into the corresponding positions of two other proteins related to zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein 1, neither of them acquired zzso properties, indicating that besides zzso additional structural zzso of zzso and zzso are important for binding to zzso zzso The conservation of these binding zzso suggests that zzso may have evolved from a zzso zzso zzso
