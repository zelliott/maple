zzso patients infected with drug-resistant human zzso virus type 1 zzso who initiate zzso therapy show a shorter time to zzso failure than patients infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not commonly seen in treated patients, which likely result from zzso or loss of primary resistance zzso have also been recognized in zzso zzso Little work has been done to characterize the patterns of zzso in these viruses and the frequency of zzso their association with zzso resistance, and their effect on fitness and evolution of zzso Through the analysis of resistance zzso in zzso newly diagnosed zzso persons from the United States, we found that 35 of 48 zzso persons infected with zzso containing zzso analog zzso zzso had viruses that lacked a primary zzso zzso zzso or zzso Of these zzso 9 zzso had only secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and all were found to be sensitive to zzso zzso and other zzso To assess the impact of secondary zzso on the evolution of zzso resistance, we generated zzso viruses from cloned zzso reverse zzso zzso Two viruses had zzso three had zzso and zzso and three were zzso Four zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also made in zzso In zzso selection of zzso resistance showed that viruses with zzso and/or zzso acquired zzso resistance zzso more rapidly than zzso viruses zzso days compared to 54 zzso P zzso zzso To investigate the factors associated with the rapid selection of zzso zzso in these zzso we evaluated fitness differences among zzso and zzso or zzso in the presence of zzso Both zzso and zzso were more fit than zzso in the presence of either low or high zzso zzso likely reflecting low-level resistance to zzso that is not zzso by zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the fitness cost zzso by zzso or zzso was zzso Our results demonstrate that viruses with unique patterns of zzso including zzso and/or zzso are commonly found among newly diagnosed persons and illustrate the expanding diversity of zzso viruses in this zzso The modest fitness cost zzso by zzso and zzso supports persistence of these zzso in the zzso population and highlights the potential for secondary zzso The faster evolution of these zzso toward zzso resistance is consistent with the higher viral fitness in the presence of zzso and shows that these viruses are zzso different from zzso zzso Our study emphasizes the need for clinical studies to better define the impact of these zzso on treatment responses and evolution of zzso
