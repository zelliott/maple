zzso are small peptides with zzso activity against a range of plant and animal microbial zzso To detect zzso peptides in applications such as Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso specific zzso that recognize zzso peptides are zzso The production of zzso against small peptides injected into host animals poses problems with respect to zzso an adequate zzso response due to the small size of the zzso To increase the zzso of a target zzso it may be expressed as part of a larger fusion zzso However, expression of an zzso zzso in bacteria may be zzso to the host or subjected to degradation by zzso zzso To overcome these potential problems, we fused the DNA coding sequence of a zzso gene analogue within the sequence of a bacterial zzso zzso The subsequent gene fusion zzso a bacterial zzso gene with a zzso coding sequence zzso at the active site of zzso was successfully translated in a bacterial expression zzso The fusion protein was zzso to the host zzso This represents a novel strategy to express zzso peptides in a bacterial expression zzso The fusion zzso zzso by molecular size zzso was recovered in a soluble form following zzso from zzso zzso zzso fusion protein was obtained for injection into rabbits and zzso were obtained from rabbit zzso that selectively recognized zzso peptides in Western zzso zzso
