zzso molecules containing the alpha 1, alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells exhibit a two- to zzso difference in their zzso for zzso zzso 1 zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso To investigate the structural basis for this difference, zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso containing each alpha zzso zzso was analyzed for its zzso dependence zzso zzso of these experiments do not reveal a region in the alpha 1 or alpha zzso zzso that is clearly responsible for the apparent affinity for zzso It is possible that molecular interactions involving zzso acids that span virtually the entire zzso zzso contribute to the determination of this zzso
