A novel zzso sequence zzso element was found in the zzso region of the zzso carrier zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The sequence contained an open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids which revealed high similarity with zzso from zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso The direction of zzso was the same as that of zzso and typical zzso and direct repeats characteristic of IS were found in both the zzso and 3' region of the zzso Southern zzso analysis of the zzso DNA revealed that multiple copies of the zzso sequence were contained in the zzso zzso This element might well be a member of a new IS family including zzso and zzso and we have designated this element zzso The analysis of zzso expression in zzso coli cells indicated that zzso promotes the expression of zzso
