zzso organisms respond to various stresses with the synthesis of heat shock proteins zzso zzso is a large molecular mass zzso that is part of the zzso zzso In this study, we have zzso for the first time, the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso cultured cells and zzso zzso analysis revealed that the protein zzso by the zzso zzso exhibited zzso identity with its counterparts in zzso and only zzso with members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or protein was detected zzso in A6 kidney zzso cells and was zzso by heat zzso sodium zzso and cadmium zzso However, treatment with ethanol or copper zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for zzso zzso except that it was zzso with zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was present zzso during zzso Heat zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurred only after the zzso zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso in control and heat shocked zzso was enriched in selected zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso zzso gene expression is zzso and stress zzso in cultured cells and zzso and tissue zzso during early zzso
