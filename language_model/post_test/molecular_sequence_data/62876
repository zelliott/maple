zzso of zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is required to initiate both infection and asexual development in the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso zzso we sought to determine the requirements for Ras proteins in zzso zzso and asexual development of zzso zzso A second zzso zzso has been identified that characterizes a new zzso of Ras zzso zzso active zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso of each gene were introduced into zzso as zzso zzso expression led to reduced zzso zzso zzso and altered zzso zzso whereas expression of zzso caused a significant reduction in the rate of zzso zzso In contrast, expression of zzso slightly delayed the initiation of zzso and caused the development of zzso in submerged zzso zzso expression led to reduced zzso zzso and zzso appear to play different, but zzso roles in the zzso growth and asexual development of zzso zzso
