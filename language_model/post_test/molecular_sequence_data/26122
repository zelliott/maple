The gene coding for starch zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a potato zzso library constructed in zzso zzso It is an unusually long plant gene zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence is interrupted by 14 zzso whose positions do not match those of the zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso A 78 zzso acid central zzso unique to plant zzso zzso is hypothesized to have arisen through the zzso of an zzso junction site in an ancestral zzso The fifth zzso of the zzso is very large zzso 7 zzso and contains a zzso zzso element inserted in the opposite orientation to that of the zzso zzso This element has been named zzso it is bordered on the zzso and 3' sides by long terminal repeats of 285 and 283 zzso respectively, which define an internal domain of zzso zzso zzso contains 4 open reading frames zzso that zzso protein zzso for a reverse zzso an zzso an zzso site and a zzso zzso of the zzso gene appears to proceed zzso through the zzso zzso
