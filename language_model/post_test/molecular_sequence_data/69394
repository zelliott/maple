Different pharmacological approaches to zzso zzso were compared for their effects on zzso and bleeding time in zzso zzso zzso was induced in the carotid artery by zzso vessel injury and in the zzso zzso by partial blood flow stasis combined with mild zzso zzso Small zzso arteries were zzso with a zzso needle to measure the bleeding zzso zzso relationships were determined with a zzso active site zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interferes with zzso binding to the zzso zzso but, unlike zzso zzso it does not block zzso zzso zzso The effects on zzso and bleeding time were correlated with ex zzso zzso times using the activated partial zzso time for zzso and the zzso time for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited more than zzso by all three zzso at doses that either produced threshold increases or had no effect on bleeding and zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso but it was not inhibited by zzso zzso These zzso activities were accompanied by a zzso activated partial zzso time increase and doubling of the bleeding time with zzso and a zzso zzso time zzso and zzso increase in bleeding time with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso which act at the active site or zzso or through zzso III, are equally zzso against zzso zzso but active site zzso are the most effective against zzso zzso
