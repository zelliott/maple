To provide evidence for the zzso DNA sequences and zzso factors involved in the complex pattern of zzso and zzso expression of the beta zzso zzso zzso containing fragments of the gene fused to the zzso zzso gene were used in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of four major zzso two negative regions in the zzso zzso a zzso promoter region which directs expression at low levels in zzso and differentiated muscle cells, and a positive region within the first zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso This positive regulatory element is located in the zzso portion of the first zzso zzso zzso to zzso and acts as an zzso irrespective of orientation and position from the zzso beta zzso promoter or the zzso zzso zzso promoter, zzso in both cases zzso expression to the linked reporter zzso zzso of a putative zzso zzso factor 1 zzso binding site, containing a zzso zzso zzso had no effects on zzso transcription, indicating that this site is not required for the activity of the zzso zzso mobility shift zzso competition analysis, zzso I zzso and zzso studies indicated that this element interacts through an zzso box with a zzso zzso and through a zzso box with a novel ubiquitous zzso zzso of either the zzso box or the zzso box resulted in a significantly reduced activity of the zzso in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso and zzso binding factors are each necessary for zzso expression of the beta zzso gene in skeletal muscle zzso
