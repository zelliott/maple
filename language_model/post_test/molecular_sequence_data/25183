We have previously shown that zzso zzso called zzso a gene which is exclusively expressed in the male germ line of zzso zzso is subject to negative zzso zzso While zzso of this gene takes place zzso translation occurs only after the zzso of zzso is zzso We report here the identification of a sequence element within the first 45 zzso of the leader which is crucial for this zzso zzso zzso comparison with six other zzso which form a gene family with zzso shows the conservation of a twelve zzso element within this leader zzso It is found in all genes at positions zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso of this element or zzso of two zzso by in zzso zzso both lead to the breakdown of the zzso control zzso The zzso tail of the zzso zzso becomes longer and zzso in length when the zzso is recruited for zzso We present evidence that the control for this additional zzso also resides within the zzso element of the zzso
