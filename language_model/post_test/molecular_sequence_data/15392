A zzso green zzso mosaic virus zzso was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope zzso protein binding region from zzso acids zzso to 423 zzso The zzso gene was inserted at the terminal end of the zzso coat protein zzso open reading frame zzso zzso sequences of zzso or zzso zzso or zzso were, respectively, inserted in between the zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were transcribed into full-length capped zzso zzso zzso Only zzso with the zzso zzso zzso sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, zzso zzso zzso zzso The ratio of modified to unmodified zzso for the zzso expression clone developed was also found to be approximately zzso higher than what has been previously zzso It was also observed that zzso was not affected by differences in zzso between the zzso and its wild zzso Analysis of zzso viruses after zzso zzso revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial zzso of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type zzso with this zzso
