zzso zzso directed against an isolate of zzso zzso disease virus zzso characterized by virus zzso tests and competition zzso were used to compare zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso related zzso viruses by zzso zzso reaction patterns and one specific for zzso viruses were zzso This provided a method for distinguishing between these zzso In addition, zzso were undertaken with zzso virus and zzso zzso Different product patterns were obtained which correlated with the genetic differences revealed by zzso sequence zzso zzso distinguished between zzso and zzso viruses by pattern zzso Further zzso zzso were carried out with clinical zzso zzso zzso were detected with a sensitivity equivalent to that of virus isolation in cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso products resulted in a not previously described sequence of a B5 isolate and in zzso sequence of two zzso virus A16 zzso The differences of the zzso by zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso sequence differences are consistent with the zzso concept of zzso zzso
