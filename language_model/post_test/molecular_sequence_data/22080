We tested whether the interaction between host gastric zzso zzso and the zzso protein of zzso zzso determined gastric colonization zzso 

A total of 145 zzso zzso patients were assessed for their bacterial density and gastric zzso and zzso zzso Their corresponding zzso zzso zzso were tested for zzso and zzso zzso by zzso The zzso zzso products were zzso to check for zzso affecting zzso zzso The zzso and zzso expressions of each isolate were confirmed by Western zzso 

All 145 zzso zzso zzso were zzso and expressed zzso There were 116 zzso zzso zzso but only 45 zzso of the zzso expressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso products was achieved in 92 zzso of which zzso had regular CT zzso and the other zzso had a unique deletion of the CT zzso Neither the deletion nor the different CT zzso in the zzso region were totally correlated with zzso zzso defined by Western zzso zzso zzso density was higher in those expressing gastric zzso zzso (which interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso only in those patients expressing weak or no gastric zzso zzso (which would interact with zzso not in those with evident expression of gastric zzso zzso 

In Taiwan, zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso but only zzso of them express zzso The interaction between gastric zzso and zzso of zzso zzso determines the colonization density of patients expressing gastric zzso zzso or not at zzso
