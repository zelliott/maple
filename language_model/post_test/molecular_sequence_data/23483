zzso a zzso zzso is zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and then to zzso by liver zzso zzso New methods of separation for zzso and its zzso by TLC have been developed and applied to study the metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso metabolism of zzso zzso zzso was transformed into zzso and the zzso zzso transformed into zzso by rat liver zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were also zzso and the zzso at the zzso was zzso zzso from zzso and the zzso from zzso were shown to be zzso zzso with zzso acid in rabbit zzso and to be zzso zzso to form zzso by rabbit and guinea pig zzso zzso A new zzso zzso of zzso was found in which zzso zzso with zzso to form zzso acid and a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso acid was zzso into the urine and the zzso zzso into the zzso of rats zzso with zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso into zzso were zzso from the liver zzso of zzso guinea zzso zzso rats, mice, zzso and humans and zzso These zzso were zzso proteins and had molecular weights of about zzso and used zzso and zzso as zzso except for the human zzso that had a molecular weight of about zzso and used zzso zzso Each zzso exhibited its own zzso zzso specificity demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso and zzso secondary alcohols but also some 17 zzso 3 zzso or both, except for the human zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso indicated that it belongs to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
