The importance of zzso for the proper biological functioning of many zzso proteins has generated interest in the zzso of the zzso zzso and their interactions with zzso and zzso Previous observations that zzso a zzso zzso analogue of zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Zheng, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cassady, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso prompted a closer examination of the effect of zzso at the zzso on the interactions of zzso acid and zzso zzso with zzso As an initial approach, three zzso acid derivatives bearing different zzso at the zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, and zzso acid, were selected for zzso Both zzso acid and zzso acid were available zzso zzso acid was prepared zzso All three compounds were found to be only weak zzso of zzso in zzso Of the three, zzso acid was the most potent zzso zzso 100 zzso In cultured cells, however, zzso acid was by far the more effective inhibitor of protein zzso Neither zzso acid nor zzso acid significantly inhibited protein zzso in cultured cells, indicating that zzso was not occurring at the level of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid derivatives to their corresponding zzso zzso by zzso zzso resulted in zzso of greatly increased zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and shown to be competitive zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 45, 450, and 200 zzso zzso These data suggested that the enhanced zzso potency of zzso acid seen in cells was most probably a result of its zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The presence of zzso at the zzso also affected the ability of the zzso group to be transferred by zzso to a zzso zzso Of the three zzso zzso only zzso served as a zzso for zzso
