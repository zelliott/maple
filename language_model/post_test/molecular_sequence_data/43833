zzso bacterial clones producing human zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso to zzso zzso virus zzso zzso were selected from a human zzso zzso library constructed in a zzso zzso by a panning procedure against an zzso zzso Thirty-four of the zzso zzso were able to specifically recognize zzso cells in indirect zzso zzso zzso of these, 25 recognized cells infected by either zzso type 1 zzso or zzso while 9 recognized only zzso zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso were further evaluated as zzso for viral detection and typing by IF zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and 62 zzso viral cultures from clinical zzso The results obtained with these two zzso were fully consistent with those obtained with a commercial preparation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The detection sensitivity with the zzso zzso in indirect IF zzso was higher overall than that provided by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suitable for IF zzso can be easily and zzso obtained in a clinical zzso laboratory from zzso coli zzso Similar zzso zzso therefore, could be advantageous for in zzso diagnostic zzso
