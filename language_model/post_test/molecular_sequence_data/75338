zzso coli 30 S zzso zzso and 70 S zzso were treated with the zzso zzso zzso acting as a zzso One major zzso protein pair in the 30 S zzso was generated in relatively high zzso This zzso was shown to consist of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso of this complex was achieved by a series of conventional and/or high pressure liquid zzso techniques allowing its isolation in zzso zzso To reveal the exact position of the two zzso acids involved in the zzso formation, the zzso protein pair zzso was subjected to several zzso zzso and the resulting peptides were characterized by sequence analysis, zzso acid analysis, and fast atom zzso mass zzso After isolation of the zzso zzso zzso in protein zzso and zzso in zzso could be unequivocally identified as the zzso acids zzso by the zzso zzso This result demonstrates that, despite zzso scattering data which place the centers of mass of zzso and zzso 85 A apart, at least these regions of the two proteins are located within a zzso distance in the zzso zzso
