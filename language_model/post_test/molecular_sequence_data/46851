Human zzso zzso has been found to be associated with zzso zzso and zzso either directly or indirectly and is one of at least eight human genes that are members of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso family thought to affect zzso stability through DNA zzso zzso While zzso of DNA mismatch repair clearly leads to instability of repeated sequences and to an increased risk for zzso such a parallel for the zzso family members has not been zzso Recently, a high frequency of loss of zzso at zzso zzso near the zzso region containing zzso has been reported in human tumors zzso Wick et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso may be involved in the zzso of these tumors, we have characterized the zzso genetic locus and mapped it to zzso zzso within the central region of loss of zzso However, zzso zzso zzso analysis and direct sequencing of tumors did not reveal any zzso in the zzso coding sequence or zzso zzso We also examined the DNA zzso status of a zzso region in the putative zzso promoter zzso No indication of zzso was zzso These results suggest that zzso is not a tumor zzso because it is either an essential zzso redundant gene and/or independent of the zzso tumor zzso zzso
