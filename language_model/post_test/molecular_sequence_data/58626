The zzso zzso gene is of special interest because it has a dual function in zzso zzso and in the regulation of the cell zzso The recent discovery that the zzso zzso gene has a structural and functional human zzso initiated a detailed comparison of the genes and their zzso In addition the zzso zzso zzso of liver zzso genes from rat and mouse have just been identified and it has been found that the zzso proteins have a specific function in liver zzso and in zzso It now turns out that the organization of the zzso regions of these genes is much more complicated than zzso The latest research has discovered an additional zzso in the zzso region of the mouse gene and possible zzso extensions of the reading zzso In this work, zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene identifies a putative zzso with an unusual 3' branch zzso It is shown that a small zzso of 83 zzso is present in this zzso zzso Analysis of zzso clones demonstrates that the zzso is correctly removed from the zzso zzso and that therefore the unusual 3' branch site is probably zzso Furthermore, studies with zzso directed against zzso zzso protein demonstrate that the gene product is associated with zzso in agreement with its involvement in zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso and different zzso deletions of the gene identify the corresponding zzso for zzso and the start zzso for zzso
