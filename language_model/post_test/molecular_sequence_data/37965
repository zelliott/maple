The major zzso outer membrane proteins zzso of zzso bacteria demonstrate numerous zzso properties and are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso Because zzso coli zzso is the zzso zzso in terms of structural and functional zzso in zzso zzso and zzso responses to this zzso in six different strains of mice were zzso Mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso or overlapping synthetic zzso zzso spanning the entire zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses and zzso G zzso responses to native zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso For each strain, patterns of zzso proliferation were similar regardless of whether native zzso or synthetic peptides were zzso although all strains recognized one or more cryptic zzso Mice exhibited several zzso responses, but genetically zzso zzso were also zzso Four peptides zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strong zzso zzso responses from all strains of mice when mice were zzso with native zzso or a zzso zzso In general, 10 or fewer peptides were recognized by zzso from mice zzso with native zzso or synthetic zzso and most zzso from zzso mice reacted poorly with the native zzso Four peptides spanning zzso acids 45 to 64, 95 to zzso 115 to 134, and 275 to zzso were recognized by zzso from all strains zzso with native zzso but not by zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were universally recognized by zzso from zzso mice, but these zzso reacted zzso or were negative when tested against the native zzso Based on the pattern of zzso zzso by zzso T cells, zzso with native zzso zzso T helper cells toward development of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso responses have been investigated based on the assumption that differences in zzso specificity could influence protective or zzso host zzso Because of the high level of structural zzso of zzso to zzso isolated from other enteric zzso the identification of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso may have broader zzso
