The zzso organization of a gene coding for an alpha 1 zzso of a zzso calcium channel of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Thirty-four zzso distributed over 45 zzso of zzso zzso have been identified and zzso including zzso in three regions involved in alternative zzso and new sites potentially involved in zzso zzso The comparison of the zzso boundaries of this channel with a zzso counterpart shows that the zzso structure of these two genes has remained fairly similar during evolution, with more than half of the zzso zzso positions being perfectly zzso compared to the human zzso zzso analysis of the mutually exclusive alternative zzso revealed that they have zzso zzso It is suggested that this zzso rather than reflecting evolutionary age, is the likely result of accelerated rates of evolution following zzso
