In order to screen zzso libraries of peptides and/or small organic molecules against the human zzso zzso we have developed a novel method for zzso and screening zzso segment zzso zzso The zzso for a high affinity zzso zzso zzso was added to the zzso of the human zzso zzso and zzso cell lines expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso The addition of the zzso tag did not affect the affinity of zzso for zzso The zzso tag allowed for zzso zzso of active zzso either in intact zzso or following zzso extraction with zzso or zzso If this method is generally zzso to other zzso receptors it may have broad utility for drug discovery screening as well as other zzso
