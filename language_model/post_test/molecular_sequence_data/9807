Human zzso zzso zzso is found in a zzso form and on the surface of zzso as a complex with a second related protein called zzso zzso zzso Both zzso human zzso alpha and zzso have similar biological activities zzso via the zzso zzso whereas the cell surface zzso alpha beta complex binds to a separate zzso called the zzso beta zzso zzso beta zzso The zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta zzso alpha and zzso zzso proteins have never been zzso When zzso zzso alpha was produced by either of several methods, the protein had a very low specific activity relative to that of human zzso alpha in the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso The weak activity observed was inhibited by a soluble zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso but not by zzso beta zzso zzso of both zzso alpha and a soluble version of zzso beta in insect cells led to an zzso alpha beta form that was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso via the zzso beta zzso To determine whether natural zzso zzso forms with zzso activity comparable to that of zzso human zzso alpha were zzso from primary zzso cells, zzso zzso were activated in various ways, and their zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso Using specific zzso to distinguish between zzso and zzso a zzso component was readily zzso however, there was no evidence for a zzso zzso alpha zzso activity using this zzso zzso these observations suggest that zzso zzso alpha may not play a role in the mouse via interactions with zzso and the ramifications of this hypothesis are zzso
