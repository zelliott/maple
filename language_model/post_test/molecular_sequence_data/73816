The mouse gene zzso zzso transfer protein zzso was cloned from zzso zzso II library and characterized for the first zzso It is comprised of 16 zzso separated by 15 zzso Its gene organization zzso resembles that zzso the human zzso the zzso junctions in these two genes are completely zzso zzso analysis reveals that the putative promoter of mouse zzso gene consists of a zzso a high zzso region, and several consensus sequences for the binding of zzso zzso Within the first 200 zzso of the zzso region, the mouse and human zzso genes share zzso identity of zzso sequences and contain the consensus sequences for the zzso factors zzso and zzso at the same zzso
