zzso zzso contains characteristic zzso zzso zzso in the cell wall zzso Reduction of the reducing zzso of these zzso by zzso causes a significant downfield shift in the zzso signals for the second and third zzso units and zzso shift of the fourth zzso zzso To show the correlation between the shift in the zzso signals and the zzso of the zzso zzso we performed molecular mechanics zzso Six energy zzso of the zzso zzso were found in the relaxed map zzso using the zzso force zzso Five of the six energy zzso could also be generated by a simulated zzso from a 900 K molecular zzso Similarly, the solution zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso was identified by the high zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso terminal zzso unit was located near the reducing terminal one and formed a folded zzso This result suggests that a zzso unit affects the zzso chemical shifts of not only the second zzso unit, but also the third and fourth zzso zzso
