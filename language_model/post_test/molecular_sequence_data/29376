zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates the step of fatty zzso reduction in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso It has been suggested that the zzso signal zzso of zzso in zzso zzso involves zzso zzso and zzso (also known as protein zzso zzso We have cloned two zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso library of zzso zzso The zzso clone predicts a zzso acid protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso with a molecular mass of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence well zzso the zzso B zzso domain and two zzso a zzso and an zzso domain, showing zzso and zzso identities to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso clone predicts a zzso acid protein zzso to the regulatory zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence well zzso four zzso type zzso structures, showing zzso and about zzso identities to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso system has demonstrated the molecular interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso Northern zzso analyses revealed that both zzso and zzso genes were expressed in various zzso and adult zzso of zzso zzso Both transcripts detected in the zzso zzso three days before adult zzso increased by the day before zzso and the zzso levels were found to be high even two days after adult zzso zzso analysis has revealed that zzso zzso zzso is localized in the zzso of the zzso zzso
