zzso zzso is one of the most significant threats to the giant zzso survival, responsible for half of the deaths reported from 2001 to zzso zzso zzso has been identified as one of the key factors for gene regulations at the zzso level, and also considered as a potential control and treatment target against infectious zzso 

The present study investigated the zzso profile of zzso zzso via high zzso sequencing and real-time quantitative zzso 

A total of zzso million raw reads were obtained and zzso million were identified with high zzso By analysis of standard zzso structures, 108 zzso candidates were predicted, including 60 known zzso and 48 novel zzso Target prediction revealed that the zzso was the most abundant target with zzso zzso and 263 targets were related to zzso and egg zzso The zzso protein related sequences occupied 449 zzso 

Previous studies have shown that some zzso zzso zzso for zzso and/or for penetrating the zzso zzso of the zzso It therefore seems that zzso zzso may be effectively regulated by zzso for development, invasion, and zzso Given that zzso have been identified as important biological control agents for zzso identification of zzso in zzso zzso of the giant panda would provide useful information for the development of biological control strategies and/or vaccines against zzso zzso infection in the giant zzso
