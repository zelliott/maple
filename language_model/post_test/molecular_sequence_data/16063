A single zzso clone zzso zzso isolated from bean zzso zzso zzso contains two genes that zzso zzso zzso These genes are present as single copies in the zzso are separated by zzso zzso and zzso transcripts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins contain zzso zzso and have zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso transcript is present in young zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced this transcript in old, but not in young zzso zzso zzso raised against regions of the zzso protein zzso expressed as a zzso fusion protein in bacteria, react with a protein of 53 zzso in a protein fraction extracted from cell walls of bean zzso zzso imprints of bean zzso treated with zzso protein zzso showed that the zzso protein was distributed in a regular pattern of small, highly localized discrete zzso The zzso regions zzso to the pattern of vascular tissue in the zzso In young zzso zzso protein is present at four pairs of discrete sites zzso arranged on the inner side of the vascular zzso These results suggest a close relationship between zzso proteins and development of the vascular zzso
