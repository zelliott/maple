The efficiency of zzso zzso formation of zzso necrosis virus zzso is determined by the distance between the cap site and the zzso zzso When the distance between the cap site and the zzso site was shorter than 500 zzso only zzso of the zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso zzso However, when the distance between the cap site and the zzso site was zzso bases or more, zzso of the total zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso signal sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso late genes functioned at high efficiency, even with a distance between the cap site and the zzso site that was short enough to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso zzso of zzso zzso formation is specific for zzso sequences and perhaps for related zzso This finding explains the difference between the zzso and 3' zzso sites in many zzso zzso
