zzso zzso offers a practical molecular means to quickly and reliably differentiate bacteria for microbial products zzso A combination of low resolution and high resolution zzso zzso provides a zzso system which allows the discrimination of bacteria at species and subspecies level within 7 zzso DNA was extracted from cells by zzso them in water at 95 degrees C for 30 zzso A sample of 1 zzso of the zzso zzso extract then was used as a source of template DNA in the zzso The zzso products were separated by zzso on an zzso gel and zzso by zzso zzso zzso The band patterns generated for each different culture were unique, zzso and independent of zzso zzso Band patterns may be compared visually or by using imaging and pattern matching zzso In our laboratory, bacteria such as zzso zzso and zzso soil zzso and zzso zzso bacteria have been differentiated using zzso zzso
