This paper describes a method for determining the affinity constant zzso of the binding between an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso protein zzso under equilibrium zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against outer membrane protein zzso of zzso zzso is used in a competitive zzso polarization zzso with a zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso and zzso zzso outer membrane zzso revealed highly specific binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
