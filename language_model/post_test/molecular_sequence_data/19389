We describe how one can apply molecular zzso methods, based on the molecular zzso Born zzso approach, to the prediction of the relative affinity of DNA minor groove binding zzso for different DNA zzso We discuss the theoretical background to the technique, some variations in the methodology that can be zzso and illustrate its application through a case zzso analysis of the zzso of binding of zzso zzso to the minor groove of various zzso DNA zzso We show how the underpinning molecular dynamics zzso simulations can be set up, how they can be zzso for satisfactory zzso and various approaches to zzso thermodynamics of drug binding from zzso We find that while certain zzso to the basic zzso method can improve the agreement with experimental data zzso calculating the DNA zzso zzso others have to be zzso with more caution zzso calculating zzso zzso zzso Overall, these zzso can rank the affinity of a zzso for the minor groove of different DNA sequences fairly well, but the calculation of absolute binding affinities is not very zzso
