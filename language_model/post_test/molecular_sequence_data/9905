We describe a zzso zzso designed for the zzso expression of proteins fused to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso model system permits the zzso analysis of signaling pathways and analysis of zzso zzso in response to manipulation of zzso zzso zzso is a modified zzso zzso which contains an zzso zzso zzso promoter followed by the zzso initiation sequence of zzso zzso and the zzso binding domain of zzso The zzso 3' zzso untranslated region and zzso site immediately follow the multiple cloning site to permit the efficient translation of in zzso transcribed zzso in zzso and zzso The utility of zzso is demonstrated by cloning the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso into this zzso and injecting the corresponding in zzso transcribed zzso into zzso zzso active zzso fusion protein was expressed in the injected zzso and induced zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso fusion protein could be readily zzso from zzso extracts using zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain retains activity when fused with the zzso zzso zzso and is subject to negative regulation by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso will be useful for an in zzso analysis of the zzso role and regulation of a wide variety of signaling molecules when expressed in zzso zzso and zzso
