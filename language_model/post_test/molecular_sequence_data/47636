zzso in the zzso zzso gene lead to precocious zzso of zzso in immature seed coat in zzso The ban zzso zzso has been isolated from a collection of zzso zzso and found to be zzso by the zzso zzso The sequencing of zzso and two independent zzso zzso confirmed the identity of the zzso Analysis of the full-length zzso sequence revealed an open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso acid protein which shared strong similarities with zzso and other zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was restricted to the zzso of immature seeds at the zzso to early zzso stages of development as predicted from the maternal inheritance of the zzso and therefore represents a marker for early differentiation and development of the seed zzso zzso is probably involved in a zzso zzso between the production of zzso and zzso in the seed zzso
