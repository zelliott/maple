zzso membrane proteins containing at least one zzso zzso zzso are believed to account for between zzso and zzso of most zzso There are several zzso that accurately predict the number and position of TM zzso within a membrane protein zzso However, these methods tend to disagree over the beginning and end zzso of TM zzso posing problems for subsequent modeling and simulation zzso zzso dynamics zzso simulations in an explicit zzso and water environment are used to help define the TM zzso of the zzso protein from influenza A zzso Based on a comparison of the results of five different secondary structure prediction zzso three different zzso lengths (an zzso a zzso and a zzso were zzso Each simulation system contained zzso zzso molecules plus approximately zzso waters, giving a total of approximately zzso zzso Two simulations, each of 2 zzso zzso were run for the zzso and zzso and five separate simulations were run for the zzso using different starting models generated by restrained in zzso MD zzso The total simulation time amounted to 11 zzso Analysis of the zzso secondary structure of the TM segments was used to define the regions that adopted a stable zzso zzso throughout the zzso This analysis indicates a core TM region of approximately 20 zzso (from zzso 22 to zzso zzso that remained in an zzso zzso Analysis of atomic density profiles suggested that the zzso zzso revealed a local zzso of the zzso zzso Polar side chains on either side of this region form relatively zzso zzso to zzso zzso and water zzso
