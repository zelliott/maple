We found a novel protein in the zzso zzso fraction of rat liver, which is soluble in zzso zzso acid and strongly zzso protein synthesis in a rabbit zzso zzso zzso The protein extracted from the zzso fraction with zzso zzso acid was zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein was shown to consist of two identical zzso with a molecular mass of 14 zzso By zzso with the rabbit zzso against the zzso a zzso zzso the protein was cloned and zzso The zzso contained an open reading frame of 411 base pairs zzso a zzso acid protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was completely identical with that constructed from all of the above zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso protein inhibited zzso protein synthesis in the rabbit zzso zzso system in a different manner from zzso zzso The protein is likely to inhibit an initiation stage of zzso protein zzso Among the rat zzso tested, the protein was located only in liver and zzso These findings are the first report on a new inhibitor that may be involved in the regulation of protein synthesis in those zzso
