zzso the most abundant zzso hormone in blood, partitions into zzso zzso In a zzso system, zzso plasma proteins counteract this zzso and establish zzso zzso zzso zzso These are far larger than the free zzso zzso In larger zzso proteins specifically binding zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some binding of zzso can also occur to zzso During evolution, zzso synthesis first appeared in the zzso zzso of the stem zzso about 300 million years zzso zzso synthesis in the liver evolved much later, zzso in birds, zzso and some zzso zzso Analysis of 57 human zzso zzso suggests that most zzso in zzso are not compatible with its normal metabolism and lead to its deposition as zzso Analysis of zzso or its gene in 20 different species shows that evolutionary changes of zzso predominantly occurred near the zzso A change in zzso zzso between zzso 1 and zzso 2 led to a decrease in zzso and length of the zzso It is proposed that the selection pressure producing these changes was the need for a more effective prevention of zzso zzso into zzso zzso pools increased during evolution with the increases in relative sizes of brains and internal zzso and changes in zzso composition of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
