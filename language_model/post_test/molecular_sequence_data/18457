zzso species strain zzso zzso at least 35 diverse zzso of zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso Most zzso genes are located on the zzso pair symbiotic zzso zzso Previously, three zzso host range zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by their ability to extend the zzso capacity of zzso zzso to include zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso contains two new zzso linked zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso of the tropical tree zzso zzso while the zzso genes regulate zzso of the pasture zzso zzso zzso and the grain zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso upstream of zzso by the zzso zzso was shown using a fusion with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the zzso gene did not reveal zzso with any gene in the zzso library, although zzso zzso zzso contains both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We suggest that broad host range in zzso is controlled in part by a zzso gene which interacts with a wide range of zzso and in part by zzso nod genes such as zzso
