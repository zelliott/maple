Plants zzso the zzso zzso zzso via the route zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In spinach, the first step is zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that has been hypothesized to be an zzso of identical zzso and to be an zzso zzso Analysis by zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso confirmed that native zzso contains only one type of zzso (Mr zzso zzso of zzso sulfur and zzso iron demonstrated that there is one zzso cluster per zzso and zzso spectral data indicated that this cluster is of the zzso zzso coordinated by two zzso and two His zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from spinach using a probe generated by zzso amplification for which the zzso were based on internal zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso that included a zzso transit zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence included two zzso pairs spaced 16 zzso apart, a motif characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso regions that included this motif also showed some sequence similarity zzso zzso to zzso zzso particularly bacterial zzso Otherwise there was very little similarity between zzso and proteins from plants or other zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that the expression of zzso in leaves increased zzso during zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso representative of a new class of plant zzso
