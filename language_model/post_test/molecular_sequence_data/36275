We have isolated and zzso a portion of the gene zzso the zzso domain zzso of the largest zzso of zzso zzso II from three zzso These zzso sequences include one zzso and two zzso zzso Comparisons of the new sequences to mouse and Chinese zzso show a high degree of conservation among the zzso zzso Due to synonymous zzso zzso the zzso differences between zzso zzso zzso and human result in no zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequence for the mouse zzso appears to have one different zzso acid when compared to the other four zzso zzso except for the one variation in zzso all of the known zzso zzso have identical zzso acid zzso This is in marked contrast to the situation among more divergent zzso The present study suggests that there is a strong evolutionary pressure to maintain the primary structure of the zzso zzso
