zzso are members of the ancestral zzso zzso zzso zzso which evolved rearranging zzso receptors zzso with the zzso zzso But instead of zzso zzso zzso zzso variable zzso receptors zzso consist of highly diverse zzso zzso Although zzso represent the only known zzso immune system not based on zzso little is known about their zzso zzso Here we report robust plasma zzso responses of zzso zzso with zzso egg zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating zzso immune responses against soluble zzso To isolate zzso zzso we constructed large zzso libraries from zzso and zzso animals in a novel zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso surface zzso We cloned zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso B, zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso up to the single-digit zzso range, equivalent to those of zzso zzso zzso We also isolated from a single zzso 13 zzso zzso clones with affinities ranging from low zzso to zzso All of these zzso clones were closely related in zzso differing at only 15 variable zzso positions along the zzso zzso diversity region, which zzso zzso affinity up to zzso Thus, zzso can provide a protective zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the broad range of nominal zzso that zzso can specifically zzso and the affinities zzso indicate a functional zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be useful natural zzso alternatives to conventional zzso for biotechnology zzso
