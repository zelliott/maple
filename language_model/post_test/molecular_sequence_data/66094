Genes of the Major zzso Complex zzso play a fundamental role during the immune response because zzso molecules expressed on cell surface allow the recognition and presentation of zzso peptides to zzso Although zzso zzso have been found to correlate with pathogen resistance in several zzso systems, several studies have also reported associations between zzso zzso and an accrued infection risk or an accelerated disease zzso The existence of these zzso zzso is puzzling, as the cost generated by the infection should rapidly eliminate them from the zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso may be maintained in a population of house zzso zzso zzso if they have zzso effects on different malaria zzso We found that one zzso class I zzso was associated with a zzso increase in the risk to be infected with a zzso strain, but with a zzso reduction in the risk to zzso a zzso zzso We suggest that this zzso effect might arise because zzso genes can alter the competitive interactions between malaria zzso within the zzso
