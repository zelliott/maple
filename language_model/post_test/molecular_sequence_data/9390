Previous studies on the zzso zzso genes in avian species are limited zzso to zzso and zzso but have revealed several interesting features, including the absence of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso inversion of the zzso zzso gene and the use of gene conversion as the primary mechanism to generate an zzso zzso To better understand the zzso genes and their evolutionary development in birds, we analyzed the zzso genes in the ostrich zzso zzso which is one of the most primitive zzso Similar to the chicken and zzso the ostrich expressed only three zzso chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso light zzso The zzso and zzso constant zzso are similar to their counterparts described in other zzso Although conventional zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified in the ostrich, we also detected a transcript zzso a short zzso form of zzso zzso the last two zzso zzso that was zzso at the protein zzso No zzso or zzso zzso genes were zzso The presence of a single leader zzso in the expressed heavy chain and light chain V regions indicates that gene conversion also plays a major role in the generation of zzso diversity in the zzso Because the ostrich is one of the most primitive living zzso this study suggests that the distinct features of the bird zzso genes appeared very early during the divergence of the avian species and are thus shared by most, if not all, avian zzso
