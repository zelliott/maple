The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso regulator of insulin zzso and a major therapeutic target for the treatment of type II zzso However, regulation of zzso function is complex with multiple zzso peptides that interact with the zzso including full-length zzso and truncated zzso forms of zzso that can exist in an zzso form zzso and zzso and the related zzso zzso In addition, the zzso possesses zzso zzso including zzso and the zzso zzso compound 2 zzso The complexity of this zzso system is further increased by the presence of several single zzso zzso zzso that are distributed across the zzso We have investigated 10 zzso zzso which were characterized in three zzso relevant signaling pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding and cell surface zzso expression were also zzso We demonstrate both zzso and zzso effects for multiple zzso with the most dramatic effect observed for the zzso zzso zzso At the zzso zzso there was selective loss of zzso responses across all pathways zzso but preservation of response to the small zzso compound zzso In contrast, at the zzso zzso zzso responses were preserved but there was attenuated response to compound zzso zzso the loss of zzso function at the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso rescued by compound 2, providing zzso evidence that zzso drugs could be used to treat patients with this loss of function zzso
