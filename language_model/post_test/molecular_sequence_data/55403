A strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from healthy infant zzso has shown a remarkable zzso activity against 32 bacterial zzso strains of human clinical zzso Among them, 13 strains belonging to species of zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 4 strains of zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso This zzso activity was attributed to a zzso designated as zzso zzso It was zzso up to zzso for 5 zzso and active within the pH range of zzso Its activity was lost when treated with zzso which reveals its zzso zzso This zzso was successfully zzso only by two steps of reversed phase zzso Its molecular mass, determined by mass zzso analysis, was zzso zzso To our knowledge, the present study is the first report on characterization and zzso of a zzso produced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain exhibiting an zzso activity against various zzso species of zzso and zzso bacteria, which reveals its potential for use in prevention or treatment of infections caused by zzso species especially in cases of zzso zzso zzso
