The zzso zzso zzso zzso in the formation of the zzso or zzso layer of zzso zzso We isolated a zzso clone containing the zzso gene and cloned the zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso region, we identified putative zzso zzso including the zzso box zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding zzso In addition to the zzso the zzso gene is also expressed in the zzso muscle, liver, and zzso These results showed that zzso not only takes part in the formation of the hard tissue but also might be involved in zzso balance, zzso zzso and maintenance of zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that the addition of human zzso activates zzso from the zzso zzso This is the first report of a promoter from a gene that controls the formation of the hard tissue of zzso zzso
