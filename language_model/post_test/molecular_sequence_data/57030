zzso zzso muscle contains a set of zzso proteins with discrete zzso in the zzso Some of these zzso including zzso and zzso are characterized by a series of internal repeats zzso with zzso to either the zzso of the zzso zzso or the zzso type III zzso These repeats are predicted to be involved in zzso interactions within the zzso The zzso zzso the zzso organization, and the zzso zzso of the human zzso of zzso are zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso containing two zzso and two type III zzso The zzso is expressed in a skeletal zzso zzso A zzso region of zzso sequence has been isolated that encompasses the zzso and 3' ends of the zzso This region includes zzso zzso of upstream sequence with a potential promoter and 14 zzso of downstream sequence containing the zzso zzso The zzso assignment was made by high resolution zzso in zzso zzso This method maps the gene to zzso zzso The repeat structure described previously in chicken zzso and zzso was also detected in human zzso The primary sequence of the zzso zzso motif and its predicted secondary structure have been extensively zzso in zzso zzso and other members of the zzso zzso This zzso motif has been implicated in zzso zzso
