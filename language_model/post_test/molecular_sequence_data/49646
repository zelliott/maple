The zzso zzso and functional activities of zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso envelope protein zzso were zzso zzso zzso were directed towards two distinct sites in zzso zzso one overlapping the major zzso pocket in the zzso domain and the other involving a region that includes the most zzso zzso zzso Two other groups of zzso zzso with distinct sites in the zzso domain or in the zzso region zzso did not neutralize zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso specific for the zzso pocket were able to block binding of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso specific for the zzso domain did not interfere with the zzso interaction, they efficiently inhibited zzso fusion zzso by zzso zzso indicating that they zzso with a zzso event necessary for zzso The zzso domain zzso displayed the highest zzso zzso and binding zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso bound to intact zzso with affinities similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso exposure, while necessary, is not sufficient for viral zzso by zzso These results identify two separate zzso zzso in zzso zzso and suggest a role for the zzso domain in a zzso step necessary for viral zzso
