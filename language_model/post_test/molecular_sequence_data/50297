The zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso that has been implicated in both zzso and zzso We describe the isolation and characterization of the corresponding zzso Within the predicted zzso half of the protein there is extensive zzso zzso zzso with human zzso zzso which are related to the zzso zzso particularly in the proposed zzso zzso The zzso region, which is related to the zzso coli zzso zzso presumably encodes the zzso zzso The zzso may thus represent a new class of zzso zzso Because of the zzso nature of the zzso this protein is renamed zzso (rather than the original zzso and the gene is zzso for zzso Over expression of the gene leads to altered cell growth and nuclear zzso We propose that the gene plays an important role in cell development as well as DNA zzso
