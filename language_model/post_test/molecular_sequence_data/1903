Many viral proteins limit host immune defenses, and their genes often originate from their zzso zzso zzso is a broadly distributed cell surface zzso that interacts with a zzso on zzso cells zzso that is implicated in locally preventing zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso of zzso have been identified in many zzso and zzso Here, we show that the product of the zzso open reading frame from human zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso interacts with human zzso and is expressed at the surfaces of infected cells solely during the zzso zzso Despite sharing only zzso primary sequence identity, zzso and zzso zzso with zzso with an almost identical and low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast to other characterized viral zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso on the cell surface were able to inhibit zzso by activated zzso of zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso an effect that could be specifically relieved by addition of zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso delivers local zzso signals to zzso cells through direct zzso contact and that the zzso viral zzso closely mimics zzso
