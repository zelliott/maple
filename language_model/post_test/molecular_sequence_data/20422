We report the efficacy of a new zzso with zzso at the zzso and zzso receptors that has zzso sustained zzso and zzso zzso Selective chemical modification to zzso resulted in a loss of zzso with minimal change to inherent zzso The structural basis for the zzso appears to be a combination of local zzso interactions and a change in secondary zzso Two zzso peptides differing from each other only in their level of zzso zzso zzso were studied in zzso obesity zzso Administration of zzso peptides once per week zzso zzso and zzso tolerance in zzso obese zzso Reduction of body weight was achieved by a loss of body fat resulting from decreased food intake and increased energy zzso These zzso studies indicate that when full zzso zzso is zzso with an appropriate degree of zzso zzso zzso body fat reduction can be substantially enhanced without any overt adverse zzso
