The zzso gene is expressed in developing limb and zzso structures, regions known to be important for growth and patterning of the mouse zzso Although zzso is alternatively spliced to generate at least 7 zzso zzso that differ only at their mature zzso zzso the biological significance of these multiple zzso is not zzso In this report, we demonstrate that multiple zzso zzso are present at sites of zzso expression during mouse zzso To address the possibility that the zzso zzso might interact with different zzso growth factor zzso we prepared zzso zzso protein zzso We examined the ability of these proteins to activate alternatively spliced forms of zzso growth factor receptors zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso form of zzso and zzso while zzso also efficiently activates zzso zzso form of zzso No activity could be detected for zzso or cell expressed zzso Furthermore, none of the zzso tested interact efficiently with zzso zzso forms of zzso or the zzso zzso form of zzso These results indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso produced by zzso derived zzso cells, interact with zzso expressed zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso may therefore provide a zzso signal to the underlying zzso during limb and zzso zzso
