The complex structures of zzso wheat zzso have been mapped along individual zzso and within zzso using the zzso of the binding of zzso zzso by atomic force zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso can be used to produce inactive zzso as structural zzso For the zzso zzso zzso has been used to compare the binding of different zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind randomly along zzso zzso The zzso binding was also monitored following zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso It was demonstrated that removal of zzso side chains significantly altered the binding pattern of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to show zzso from random binding to the zzso zzso It is believed that this is due to the effect of a small residual zzso activity of the zzso that alters the binding pattern of the zzso Control procedures were developed and assessed to establish that the interactions between the modified zzso and the zzso were specific zzso The experimental data demonstrates the potential for using zzso zzso and zzso to probe the structural zzso of individual zzso zzso
