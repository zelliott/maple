zzso sequences for zzso zzso were determined for strains of the zzso zzso including most described species, as well as strains of the described species of the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso These were aligned with published sequences for other species of these zzso as well as those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and representative zzso from other zzso zzso zzso analysis of the sequence data showed that species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of the same zzso and distinct from the zzso It is proposed that a new family be created within the class zzso for these zzso to be called the zzso on the basis of the oldest described zzso within this family, zzso zzso et zzso The zzso properties of all the zzso to be placed within the new family have similar cell wall type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although zzso and zzso may be zzso zzso type zzso and zzso zzso zzso
