To investigate the strand preference of the initial zzso of human zzso by human zzso in zzso 

We used a series of in zzso transcribed zzso that were zzso labeled at their zzso or 3' ends in zzso reactions with zzso human zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were zzso by zzso and native PAGE and only the zzso structures were used in the zzso Products of zzso reactions were resolved by zzso zzso and scanned by zzso 

zzso zzso performs a biased zzso in the zzso and zzso 3' zzso This result is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The differential zzso is observed in zzso reactions only when zzso are zzso for zzso
