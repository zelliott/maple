zzso in the trafficking protein particle complex C2 protein zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a component of the trafficking protein particle zzso zzso zzso complex, have been linked to the skeletal disorder zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso is just one of a complement of zzso genes in zzso Here we characterize zzso a novel, highly zzso zzso protein related to zzso and the zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso and zzso genes are found in pairs across species and show broad and overlapping zzso suggesting they are functionally zzso a notion supported by zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso in zzso cells leads to fragmentation of the zzso implicating both proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso of cellular zzso indicates that zzso is found with a portion of cellular zzso on very zzso zzso whereas the remainder of zzso but not zzso is found associated with zzso zzso zzso displays genetic interactions with zzso zzso genes and the gene product zzso with and interacts with zzso zzso zzso Taken together these results indicate that zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are novel zzso proteins that may zzso the function of the zzso II zzso
