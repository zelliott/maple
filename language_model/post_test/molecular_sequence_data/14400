zzso virus zzso causes a zzso disease in zzso Clinical and zzso studies provide evidence of zzso differences between two geographically distinct zzso virus zzso the West African and zzso zzso zzso analysis of strains from both zzso identified a zzso zzso deletion in the less virulent West African zzso zzso to zzso One absent open reading frame encodes the zzso virus zzso of the complement control protein zzso This zzso protein prevents the initiation of both the classical and alternative pathways of complement zzso In zzso virus, zzso also known as zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein with sequence zzso to this zzso of zzso Here we investigate zzso expression and its role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was incorporated into the West African strain and removed from the zzso zzso strain by zzso zzso zzso expression zzso were confirmed for both wild type and zzso zzso viruses and zzso activity was confirmed using a zzso binding zzso To characterize the disease, prairie dogs were zzso infected and disease progression was monitored for 30 zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso strain reduced zzso disease morbidity and zzso but did not significantly decrease viral zzso The inclusion of zzso in the West African strain produced changes in disease zzso but had no apparent effect on zzso zzso This study identifies zzso as an important zzso protein in zzso zzso but not solely responsible for the increased zzso seen within the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
