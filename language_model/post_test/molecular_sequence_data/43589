zzso T4 encodes a zzso factor, zzso that binds to the zzso region of zzso promoters and activates zzso by host zzso zzso We have solved the structure of the zzso zzso domain to zzso A by X-ray zzso and have also determined its secondary structure by zzso An area on the surface of the protein has a distinctive patch that is populated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso within this patch cause a defective T4 growth zzso arguing that the patch is important for zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and analyzed by zzso and the zzso clearly show that the domain is properly zzso The zzso full-length protein appears to bind DNA normally but is deficient in zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso surface patch is specifically involved in zzso zzso which is reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso zzso
