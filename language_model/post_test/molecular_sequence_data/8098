An analogue of the zzso compound zzso zzso in which the zzso ring has been replaced by an zzso group, has been zzso with the zzso sequence zzso The structure has been solved by X-ray zzso analysis and has been refined to an zzso of zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso The zzso is found to bind in the minor groove, at the central four zzso base pairs of the zzso double zzso with the involvement of a number of van der zzso contacts and hydrogen zzso There are significant differences in minor groove zzso for the two compounds, along much of the zzso zzso In particular this structure shows a zzso groove at the 3' end of the binding site consistent with the zzso zzso of the zzso group compared with the zzso ring of zzso zzso and therefore a smaller zzso in groove zzso The higher binding affinity to DNA shown by this analogue compared with zzso zzso itself, has been zzso in terms of these zzso
