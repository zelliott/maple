zzso changes of zzso during zzso zzso are demonstrated by the difference in the zzso fragments of the zzso heavy chain between in the absence and presence of zzso and zzso Here zzso sites in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been mapped on the zzso chain of outer arm zzso from sea zzso zzso zzso zzso sites are located not only near the central zzso domain which includes four zzso but also near the zzso zzso zzso The zzso site is located in the most zzso region, which is nearly zzso zzso acid zzso apart from the the fourth zzso zzso zzso The region from the most zzso zzso site zzso zzso to the zzso site covers approximately zzso zzso acid zzso which is almost half the whole zzso zzso zzso of the sequences around the zzso sites of the sea zzso b chain and those of the zzso heavy chains from other organisms reveals that the sequence around the zzso site is highly zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso but that around zzso sites is only zzso in zzso zzso suggesting functional differences in the zzso region between the two zzso of zzso
