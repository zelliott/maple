zzso is involved in DNA mismatch repair and its defects cause zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso as well as other types of zzso A defective DNA mismatch repair system results in genetic instability, also referred to as zzso instability zzso which is a good indicator of zzso Using in zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso we initially identified a zzso zzso type 2) whose second zzso is 5 zzso shorter than that of a genuine zzso transcript zzso type 1) and a transcript using alternative promoter zzso type 3) whose zzso starts about 300 bases downstream of zzso type zzso We then compared the expression level of zzso types 1 and 3 among six zzso cancer cell lines using real-time zzso As a result, we found that the cell lines that completely suppress the expression of zzso type 1 by zzso expressed zzso type 3 to a certain zzso This result suggests that the expression of zzso types 1 and 3 did not completely follow the same zzso zzso We also found that the cell lines showing zzso to be positive either expressed zzso type 3 more than type 1 or expressed only zzso type zzso These results showed the potential zzso of zzso expression analysis to molecular diagnostic tests of zzso cancer zzso
