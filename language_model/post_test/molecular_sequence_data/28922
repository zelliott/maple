Type III zzso zzso proteins of bacterial pathogens play central roles in zzso yet are notoriously difficult to zzso We used an in zzso genetic screen to identify 13 zzso zzso by the type III apparatus (called zzso for zzso response and zzso of the plant pathogen zzso zzso Although sharing little overall zzso the zzso regions of these zzso had zzso similar zzso acid zzso This feature facilitated the zzso prediction of 38 zzso zzso zzso including 15 previously unknown zzso The zzso of two of these putative zzso was shown to be type zzso zzso showed high zzso variation, supporting a role for some zzso in adaptation to different zzso
