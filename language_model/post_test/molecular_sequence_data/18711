This paper reports rational engineering of zzso zzso zzso to develop an effective zzso for a potentially important type of zzso production of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously been used to investigate the structural requirements for zzso zzso We observed that the zzso zzso zzso has a zzso motif zzso at the border of the zzso binding zzso The motif differs substantially in chemical properties and substitution probability from the zzso zzso and we zzso that this motif is important for zzso zzso The zzso motif is strongly positively charged with a marked change in hydrogen bond donor capacity as compared to the zzso To investigate the role of this zzso we expressed and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for efficient zzso were determined, and zzso zzso specificity demonstrated zzso with respect to the zzso zzso enabling zzso of zzso containing terminal zzso and zzso and even zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acid is important in association with human milk zzso and zzso was shown to zzso a number of established and potential zzso zzso evaluation of zzso potential using pure cultures demonstrated, albeit not zzso growth of zzso Since the zzso motif stands out in the native zzso is markedly different from the zzso zzso compared to previous zzso and is shown here to zzso efficient and broad zzso activity, we suggest that this motif can serve as a framework for future zzso of zzso towards zzso zzso
