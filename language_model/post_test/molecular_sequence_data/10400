A zzso DNA zzso from zzso zzso zzso was isolated, which could complement an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the region revealed two complete open reading frames zzso zzso both a predicted zzso protein of zzso zzso and a predicted zzso protein of 199 zzso and also the zzso of the predicted zzso gene organized in the order of zzso Consensus heat shock zzso promoter sequences were identified upstream of the start of both zzso and zzso zzso However, no obvious promoter sequences were detected upstream of zzso The zzso start points of zzso and zzso were determined by primer extension analysis and the amount of each of the transcripts increased zzso to zzso after zzso
