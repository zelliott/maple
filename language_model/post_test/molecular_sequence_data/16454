A novel zzso motif called a nest has recently been described in proteins with the function of binding zzso or partially zzso atoms such as zzso O zzso In the present work, a search for nests in small zzso stored in the Cambridge zzso Database is zzso 37 unique examples were zzso over half form part of zzso arrangements resembling those in zzso such as zzso loop zzso various types of zzso and zzso or zzso while a third are in novel situations, some involving binding to zzso groups from other molecules within the crystal zzso An example is the zzso zzso which incorporates a prominent nest forming part of a zzso zzso This nest binds the zzso of the zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso precursor zzso thereby zzso the final step of bacterial zzso zzso As in zzso a number of nests occur in short peptides with an alternating zzso sequence but, uniquely to zzso zzso short zzso several nests within them are constructed from alternating zzso and zzso zzso and such sequences seem to specially zzso zzso
