In the present study we describe the molecular cloning of zzso formerly named zzso We show that zzso is an intermediate filament protein with a core domain most closely resembling zzso and zzso zzso also contains a novel zzso zzso acid repeat domain, zzso multiple zzso zzso repeats, located in its tail zzso Based on these structural motifs we propose that a novel intermediate filament protein that is zzso expressed by zzso zzso during zzso development has been zzso We also show the existence of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso occurring in the novel zzso repeat domain to give rise to zzso zzso that lack this zzso zzso By in zzso zzso analysis we show that zzso zzso is expressed by zzso zzso zzso structures, by several zzso zzso and by zzso zzso of the developing zzso Based on the structural properties of the zzso zzso and expression of its zzso we suggest that zzso is a new member of the intermediate filament gene zzso that is zzso expressed by zzso zzso
