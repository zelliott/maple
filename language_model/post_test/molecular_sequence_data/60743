zzso like zzso zzso must resist zzso stresses during transmission or zzso Growth of zzso zzso zzso under iron limitation greatly increased the expression of two zzso of 26 and 55 zzso The identification of these proteins by zzso zzso acid sequencing showed both to be involved in the defense against zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the N zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso and the zzso protein showed significant zzso to the small zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The upstream region of zzso zzso a divergent zzso zzso zzso whereas downstream sequences contained zzso and zzso zzso which are involved in zzso zzso There was no evidence for an adjacent zzso of zzso zzso the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene studies showed that iron regulation of zzso and zzso is achieved at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in an increased sensitivity to zzso stresses caused by zzso zzso and exposure to atmospheric zzso while resistance to hydrogen zzso was not zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein is an important zzso of the ability of this zzso pathogen to survive zzso and zzso zzso
