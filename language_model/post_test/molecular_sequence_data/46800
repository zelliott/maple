We describe a modified zzso zzso procedure that allows the construction of longer fragments of DNA from zzso overlapping zzso zzso This method permits the construction of zzso templates for DNA sequence analysis zzso zzso from DNA that is too zzso for direct amplification of fragments of this zzso As an example, the entire zzso region 1 of human zzso zzso zzso was reconstructed in one step from five overlapping amplification products zzso zzso zzso 131 and 93 zzso derived from a zzso tooth zzso
