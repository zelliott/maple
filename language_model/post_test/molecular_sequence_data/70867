zzso determined by the zzso method often suffer from model zzso In extreme cases, the refinement of the atomic model can stall at high free R values when the resulting zzso maps provide little indication of how to correct the model, sometimes rendering even a correct solution zzso Here, it is shown that several recent advances in refinement methodology allow productive zzso even in cases where the zzso zzso maps do not allow manual zzso In test calculations performed with a series of zzso models of zzso using either backbone zzso or backbone atoms plus zzso core zzso model bias is reduced and refinement can proceed zzso even if the initial model is far from the correct zzso These new methods combine zzso zzso dynamics simulated zzso and zzso target zzso It is also shown that the free R value is an excellent indicator of model quality after zzso potentially discriminating between correct and incorrect zzso zzso The use of phase information, even in the form of zzso zzso phase zzso greatly improves the radius of convergence of refinement and hence the quality of the zzso zzso further extending the limits of molecular zzso
