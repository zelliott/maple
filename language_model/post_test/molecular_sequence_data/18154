The complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B), which span a portion of the mouse zzso zzso centered around zzso 61, were zzso by using standard zzso zzso chemistry and characterized by sequence zzso Strand A, containing a sole zzso at the position corresponding to the first base of zzso 61, was modified with zzso or its zzso zzso In both cases only the corresponding zzso zzso was formed, as judged from zzso and zzso analyses conducted after zzso zzso of the modified zzso zzso and modified zzso were zzso with strand zzso Cooperative melting transitions were observed with all samples, thus indicating the formation of stable zzso Melting temperatures decreased in the order zzso duplex greater than zzso duplex greater than zzso duplex, which indicated zzso of the zzso structure upon incorporation of the zzso with zzso having the greatest zzso zzso zzso zzso of all duplexes were characteristic of an overall right-handed zzso zzso with no major zzso differences being detected between the two zzso zzso
