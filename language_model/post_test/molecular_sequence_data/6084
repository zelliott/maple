We have carried out a functional analysis of the human zzso exchange factor in the zzso zzso zzso Twelve zzso zzso among most of all known zzso exchange factors zzso have been independently changed to zzso Taking advantage of the ability of zzso to replace the zzso zzso exchange factor, and using the zzso system with zzso zzso we have identified key zzso for the interaction with Ras and/or its zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso leads to a complete loss of interaction with zzso though the protein remains zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to zzso results in inactive proteins at 39 degrees C, still able however to interact with zzso The other zzso zzso led to no zzso zzso when present alone but most of them dramatically increased the temperature sensitive zzso observed with zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso to zzso substitution in the highly zzso zzso motif proved to be without effect, suggesting that the zzso group is not essential for stability or interaction with zzso
