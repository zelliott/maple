zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso to form zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons between the zzso and the zzso coli proteins suggested that a region, identified as a small flexible loop that covers the active site of the zzso coli zzso might be zzso in the zzso zzso Three zzso zzso in the zzso protein were generated to test this zzso Two zzso within the zzso region zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso in an in zzso zzso based on cadmium resistance in zzso zzso and in an in zzso zzso of the activity of the zzso expressed in zzso zzso A third zzso outside of this zzso region zzso had a smaller effect in both zzso These results are consistent with the idea that this zzso loop in the zzso and zzso coli proteins might serve the same function in covering the active site of the zzso
