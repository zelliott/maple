Members of the family of zzso heat shock proteins zzso play various zzso roles in zzso In this study, a wheat zzso gene was isolated from a suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso library of wheat leaves infected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso that was designated as zzso was predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso Further analysis revealed the presence of a zzso signature that is characteristic for zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in leaves of both green and zzso wheat zzso and in stems and zzso The transcript level in roots was approximately zzso less than in leaves but zzso treatment did not charge zzso zzso Following heat shock of wheat zzso at zzso zzso expression increased in leaves of zzso zzso but remained stable at the same level in green zzso In addition, zzso was zzso expressed during an incompatible and compatible interaction with zzso zzso and there was a transient increase in expression upon treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso treatments had no influence on zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in stress-related responses, and in defense responses zzso by infection with stripe rust fungus and does so via a zzso signal zzso zzso
