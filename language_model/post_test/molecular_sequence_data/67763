zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso cardiac zzso characterized by an zzso zzso in the right zzso leads of the zzso and an increased risk of zzso and sudden zzso zzso zzso the cardiac sodium channel zzso is the main gene involved in zzso Despite the fact that several zzso have been reported in the zzso of zzso the functional role of this region remains zzso We aimed to characterize two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a construct where this region was deleted, zzso and a construct where only this region was present, zzso 

zzso recordings in zzso cells demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso abolished the sodium current zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso zzso exerted a strong zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso revealed that both zzso were mostly retained in the zzso zzso and that their zzso with zzso channels led to zzso channel zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments showed that zzso were interacting with each other, even when zzso deciphering the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were mostly zzso by the zzso system, while zzso was addressed to the zzso and zzso expression induced a zzso increase in zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso but zzso zzso zzso gave rise to a small zzso 

This study reports for the first time the critical role of the zzso zzso region in channel function and the zzso effect of zzso channels occurring through zzso zzso
