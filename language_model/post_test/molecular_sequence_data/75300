zzso clones which seem to represent the zzso of zzso and zzso expressed by the zzso zzso have been isolated and used as zzso zzso to measure the corresponding zzso levels in zzso and other human zzso lines, and the effect of zzso zzso and zzso on these zzso It is shown in zzso and in its derived line zzso that zzso zzso levels are zzso before treatment but respond to zzso and zzso more markedly than those of zzso This differential induction is best shown with zzso which is hypersensitive to zzso where the zzso zzso levels increase to a level zzso those of zzso Other zzso lines tested also showed preferential induction by zzso of zzso although the zzso levels of zzso and zzso tended to be zzso The effect of the altered ratio of zzso to zzso zzso on surface expression of the zzso and the correlation between zzso level expression and zzso are zzso
