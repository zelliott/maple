Alternative zzso of the zzso zzso gene transcript provides an efficient mechanism for generating functionally appropriate forms of this adhesive zzso in zzso Cellular zzso that include the zzso and/or zzso zzso segments are prominently expressed during zzso wound healing, tumor zzso and zzso However, the roles of this domain in altering overall zzso protein structure and regulating cellular function remain zzso We previously reported that two zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso segment ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Sheppard, zzso and Van De Water, zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) and that the zzso for zzso zzso zzso lie within the zzso loop of zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Van De Water, zzso (1999) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now performed zzso zzso within the zzso segment and carried out cell zzso zzso on these zzso zzso We find that the zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso loop of zzso are necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides based on the predicted important zzso acid sequence from the zzso loop zzso sufficient information to completely inhibit zzso cell zzso We also report that zzso promotes zzso formation in zzso cells accompanied by zzso zzso Our data provide a cellular activity for the zzso segment, evidence for zzso zzso and zzso sequences for probing zzso functions in zzso and in zzso
