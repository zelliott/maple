A new knowledge, structure, and sequence based strategy involving the effective exploitation of the zzso zzso is zzso A comprehensive analysis of the structure, zzso zzso and active sites of zzso zzso zzso crystal structures present in zzso Data Bank zzso and the zzso approved zzso zzso drugs has been done, and the information is used for the design of type II zzso The 98 crystal structures, 138 zzso and 31 zzso drugs comprise of 7 different sequences of 2 organisms zzso Homo sapiens and zzso zzso differing in sequence zzso zzso both zzso and zzso Multiple sequence alignment with zzso showed zzso sequence similarity with highly zzso zzso and a high propensity for zzso in the zzso zzso The bound zzso were zzso and their interactions with zzso in and out zzso were zzso These zzso and zzso drugs were fragmented on the basis of their binding interactions and their affinity to zzso and zzso zzso The zzso library thus generated contains 106 fragments with overlapping drug zzso A blue print zzso three main parts zzso head zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tail zzso zzso has thus been formulated and used to design 64 type II zzso zzso zzso zzso The above strategy has been employed to design potent type II zzso zzso zzso zzso which are shown to be very zzso
