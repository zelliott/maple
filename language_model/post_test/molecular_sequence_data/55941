zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso is an abundant cellular protein and its zzso sequence has been zzso from numerous organisms, including bacteria, zzso plants and zzso In large measure, it would appear that the overall structure has probably been maintained given the zzso identity and zzso similarity of zzso coli zzso with human zzso zzso Chemical sequencing of zzso and zzso alpha has revealed that these proteins are zzso zzso In order to assess the possible function of these zzso we have chemically zzso the zzso alpha from the lower zzso zzso zzso zzso To our surprise, the zzso pattern of zzso zzso alpha was quite different from either rabbit or brine shrimp zzso alpha with only the zzso at position 79 zzso although the zzso protein is zzso identical to rabbit zzso zzso A zzso was observed at position zzso which zzso to a zzso in brine shrimp and rabbit zzso zzso The other positions in zzso zzso alpha which were zzso were unrelated to the other six possible positions for modification observed in brine shrimp or rabbit zzso zzso In addition, the unique zzso observed in zzso zzso alpha and suspected in brine shrimp zzso alpha was not found in zzso zzso zzso
