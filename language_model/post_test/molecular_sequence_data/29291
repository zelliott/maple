Previously we have shown that the African zzso fever virus zzso NL gene deletion zzso zzso is attenuated in zzso Our recent observations that NL gene deletion zzso of two additional zzso zzso zzso Malawi zzso and zzso remained highly virulent in zzso zzso zzso suggested that these zzso zzso an additional zzso zzso that was absent from zzso To map this putative zzso zzso in zzso marker rescue experiments were performed by zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing zzso NL deletion zzso virus zzso and zzso DNA clones from the Malawi NL gene deletion zzso zzso A zzso clone representing the zzso zzso region zzso units zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso was capable of restoring full zzso to zzso Southern zzso analysis of recovered virulent viruses confirmed that they were zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso to zzso DNA zzso of the Malawi zzso These zzso exhibited an zzso zzso disease and zzso zzso when zzso into zzso Additional in zzso marker rescue experiments identified a zzso fragment, zzso members of zzso families zzso 360 and zzso as being capable of fully restoring zzso to zzso Comparative zzso sequence analysis of the left variable region of the zzso and Malawi zzso zzso identified an zzso deletion in the zzso isolate which resulted in the deletion and/or zzso of three zzso 360 genes and four zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso deletion zzso lacking three members of each zzso gene family was constructed and evaluated for zzso in zzso The zzso virus zzso normally in zzso cell culture but was zzso in zzso Together, these results indicate that a region within the left variable region of the zzso zzso containing the zzso 360 and zzso genes represents a previously zzso zzso zzso for domestic zzso
