In 1995, and again in 1998, high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen over their entire geographical range on the Australian zzso A virus with typical zzso zzso was identified as the zzso agent, although the source of the virus remains zzso At the time of the mortality events, the only available diagnostic test available for the detection of the virus was electron zzso and zzso development of a rapid diagnostic test for detection and identification of the virus was zzso zzso sequence data for zzso zzso zzso was acquired by comparing the highly zzso region of the zzso 62 gene of other zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso virus, zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso and designing zzso that successfully amplified a zzso of zzso Here we describe the use of zzso chain reaction zzso technology to detect zzso in infected zzso zzso analysis of amplified zzso resulting from this zzso is different from all known zzso and can therefore distinguish zzso from all known zzso
