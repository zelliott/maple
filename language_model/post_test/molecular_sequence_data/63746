The role of zzso charged zzso acids in the zzso of the beta 4 zzso in channel zzso and zzso was studied using the zzso zzso The selected zzso acids were changed to their neutral zzso via point zzso zzso currents were recorded in zzso cells zzso zzso with the alpha 3 beta 4 zzso zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso nicotine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to cells clamped at zzso zzso produced inward currents which displayed zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and Nic were increased by a factor of 3-6 due to zzso zzso or zzso Only zzso remained an zzso in the zzso receptors with zzso increased zzso The interaction of the receptors with the competitive zzso zzso zzso was weakened almost zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso increased the proportion of the slower zzso component and increased the response zzso resulting in decreased zzso zzso The double zzso substantially accelerated the return from long-term zzso induced by zzso
