We report the cloning and functional characterization of human zzso zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso Human zzso zzso shares significant zzso to zzso zzso K, zzso zzso and C, which are involved in zzso regulation via zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein contains an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso repeats of alternating zzso and zzso a hallmark of the zzso family of zzso zzso A new zzso and the mouse zzso of human zzso zzso have also been cloned in this zzso Human zzso zzso is expressed zzso in normal human zzso and tumor zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso with zzso factors zzso and zzso within nuclear zzso and that it associates with zzso but not zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso zzso via its zzso zzso zzso It can also associate with the zzso and zzso through its zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso protein can stimulate in zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso suppresses the growth of human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso inducing cellular zzso This process involves zzso of zzso and zzso and decreased expression of zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso represents a new member of the zzso family, which might regulate the zzso and zzso processing of certain zzso factors, resulting in tumor cell growth zzso and zzso
