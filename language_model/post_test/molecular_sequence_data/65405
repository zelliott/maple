Plant genetic tumors represent zzso zzso which arise spontaneously in hybrid plants without apparent external zzso To understand the molecular nature of zzso cell zzso a zzso D zzso clone zzso a zzso D of zzso was isolated from a genetic tumor and designated zzso zzso DNA gel zzso analysis suggested that there are two copies of zzso in the genetic zzso Northern analysis showed that this gene had the highest expression level in genetic tumor compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and hybrid zzso Plant zzso of hybrid plant was an intermediate between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was altered in the genetic zzso The cell cycle distribution in zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso it was G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in hybrid plants it was G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in genetic tumors G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying genetic tumor formation from zzso hybrid between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
