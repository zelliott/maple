zzso and zzso are two novel members of the zzso zzso zzso Their zzso role is poorly zzso although both proteins bind oxygen zzso and may be involved in cellular oxygen zzso Here we investigate the selective constraints on coding and zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso genes in human, zzso rat and zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso displaying very low levels of zzso zzso zzso An oxygen supply function predicts distinct modes of gene regulation, involving zzso zzso zzso To detect zzso candidate regulatory zzso we compared the zzso and zzso genes in zzso and zzso The zzso gene was included to test if it also contains zzso regulatory zzso Long zzso zzso zzso indicative of zzso zzso were found in the zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso comparison and experimental data allowed us to zzso upstream regions of the zzso and zzso genes that contain the putative zzso defining candidate regulatory regions for functional zzso The zzso and the zzso genes both lack zzso zzso elements zzso for zzso zzso but contain zzso zzso zzso stabilization signals in their 3' untranslated zzso The zzso zzso in contrast, harbors both zzso zzso and zzso stabilization sites, strongly suggestive of an zzso zzso
