Several lines of evidence suggest that the limited replication potential of normal human cells is due to the presence of an intrinsic genetic zzso This zzso zzso is believed to reduce the zzso of cancer by limiting the growth of most of the transformed cells arising in zzso although some cells do escape zzso becoming both immortalized and zzso Here we review the literature that describes the zzso process in terms of gene expression and the regulation of gene expression by a variety of mechanisms affecting zzso factor zzso We focus on regulation of the zzso gene through zzso modification of the serum response factor zzso as an example of altered gene expression during cellular zzso
