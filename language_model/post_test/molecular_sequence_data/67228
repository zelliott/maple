zzso are a recently discovered class of proteins that have a characteristic zzso zzso backbone stabilized by a knotted arrangement of three zzso zzso They are exceptionally resistant to chemical, zzso and zzso treatments because of their unique structural zzso zzso have a range of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity but their zzso properties suggest that their natural zzso role is in plant zzso They are genetically zzso as linear precursors and subsequently processed to produce mature zzso peptides but the mechanism by which this occurs remains zzso Currently most zzso are obtained via direct extraction from plants in the zzso and zzso zzso To facilitate the screening of zzso for zzso studies and to exploit them in drug design or agricultural applications a convenient route for the synthesis of zzso is zzso In this review the current chemical, zzso and zzso routes to the production of zzso are zzso
