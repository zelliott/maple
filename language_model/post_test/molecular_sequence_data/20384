The zzso protein zzso contains a core zzso domain with multiple zzso motifs that are zzso by zzso and other zzso zzso Here, we used a synthetic strategy to determine the importance of the arrangement, zzso and identity of the zzso zzso By zzso short DNA sequences zzso two zzso zzso we created a panel of zzso zzso in which the entire zzso domain was replaced by synthetic zzso containing random numbers and arrangements of the zzso Most of these synthetic zzso zzso were recognized and zzso by zzso in zzso and in intact zzso zzso The random zzso zzso also restored migration activity to zzso knockout zzso even artificial proteins containing a single motif retained some biological zzso Our results suggest that the arrangement of zzso motifs is not critical for zzso This method could be used to identify the minimal functional units in other signaling zzso
