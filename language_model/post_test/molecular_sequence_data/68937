A zzso affinity zzso was set up for the determination of the affinity of the interaction between the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and peptides corresponding to repeated sequences in three blood stage zzso of the malaria zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso is of interest due to the zzso blocking capacity of the zzso Previous studies with zzso have defined the minimal zzso for the zzso as the zzso zzso a sequence frequently found in zzso zzso In the previous study, zzso responsible for the zzso of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso In the affinity zzso described zzso the zzso was coated on a solid phase and binding of a zzso zzso was displaced by zzso or zzso zzso The affinity of peptides corresponding to zzso increased with increasing zzso and the highest affinity was displayed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso repeat (K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length did not influence the binding of peptides corresponding to the zzso and zzso repeats, which had lower affinities comparable to that of the shortest zzso zzso (K zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only peptides containing binding sites as defined by zzso analysis showed a measurable zzso When using peptides as zzso in zzso zzso binding correlated with the affinity of the zzso but only the high affinity peptides were zzso In contrast, a poor correlation was found when peptides were used directly for coating in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
