We investigated the occurrence of gene zzso between zzso sequences of zzso derived from ancestral zzso and their effect on the evolutionary history of DNA zzso A zzso with long zzso regions zzso zzso including both coding and zzso sequences was zzso zzso size zzso was used to detect the zzso of both zzso counterparts and zzso linkage arrangement between zzso DNA sequencing of seven zzso species revealed that zzso sequences were highly differentiated within species, especially for zzso zzso Ten gene conversion events between zzso sequences were zzso While these events appears to have zzso regions of otherwise highly differential zzso zzso they amplified the differentiation among zzso zzso Their effects were larger on coding than on zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso sequences grouped by zzso lineages in zzso trees, whereas coding regions grouped by zzso Based upon these results, we present a model showing how gene conversion events may also result in the zzso amplification of zzso sequences in different zzso with obvious complications for zzso zzso comparative zzso and population genetic zzso
