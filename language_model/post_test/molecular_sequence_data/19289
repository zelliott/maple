zzso was discovered in 2005 as the southernmost known zzso field along the Mid-Atlantic zzso It is exceptional in that it lacks zzso venting probably because of a thickened zzso The absence of zzso and zzso zzso in emissions supports the argument against the presence of a hot subsurface at zzso as is typically suggested for diffuse emissions from areas of zzso zzso The high zzso diversity and novelty of bacteria observed could be because of the zzso influence, the distinct location of the zzso field or the zzso zzso covering the sites of zzso The zzso zzso at the zzso are characterized by lowered pH and slightly elevated hydrogen (16 zzso and methane ( approximately zzso zzso contents compared with ambient zzso No typical hydrogen and methane zzso zzso were zzso The higher diversity of reverse zzso acid genes and the form II zzso genes of the Calvin zzso zzso cycle compared with the form I zzso genes of the zzso cycle suggests that the zzso community is better adapted to low oxygen zzso zzso zzso and zzso dominated the zzso zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso energy source zzso zzso zzso bacteria were associated with sulfur zzso including zzso zzso and zzso with the latter being the most abundant bacteria according to zzso in zzso zzso With members of various zzso Divisions zzso for zzso of clone library sequences we suggest that their role in zzso zzso might be more important than previously assumed and propose potential mechanisms they might be involved in at the zzso zzso zzso
