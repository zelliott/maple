zzso zzso zzso T cell clones were generated by zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso mice at limiting zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso All isolated T cell clones exhibited the cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferated specifically in response to zzso zzso After stimulation with zzso zzso in culture the T cell clones produced zzso and proliferated in the absence of zzso zzso zzso mice to which zzso T cell clones had been zzso transferred developed a zzso delayed type hypersensitivity reaction upon simultaneous zzso injection of zzso in their zzso The ability of zzso viral fusion zzso representing the zzso zzso protein of the zzso closely related zzso zzso virus and of synthetic peptides derived from the zzso acid sequence of the zzso of zzso to stimulate these T cell clones enabled the identification of T cell zzso
