Family D DNA zzso zzso is a new type of DNA zzso possessing zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we report the characterization of the zzso activity of zzso from zzso zzso By zzso zzso we verified that the putative zzso zzso domain in the small zzso zzso predicted according to computer analysis and structure zzso reported zzso is the zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso and zzso are the essential zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical zzso for the zzso We provide experimental evidence demonstrating that zzso rather than zzso is the preferable metal zzso for the zzso activity of zzso We also show that zzso alone is insufficient to perform full zzso which additionally requires the formation of the zzso complex and zzso zzso We found that a 21 zzso acid, zzso zzso of the sequence from zzso cluster II of the large zzso zzso stimulates the zzso activity of zzso and the internal deletion zzso of zzso lacking the zzso zzso This indicates that the putative zinc finger motif of the zzso cluster II is deeply involved in the zzso zzso
