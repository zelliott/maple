The zzso oxygen species hydrogen zzso is a byproduct of the zzso process that occurs in zzso Since zzso oxygen species can cause serious damage to zzso a number of zzso control their zzso zzso One such scavenger that is present in the zzso is the zzso zzso In this study, the crystal structure of zzso expressed zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a typical zzso zzso it is zzso and is highly similar to zzso from other zzso However, its hydrogen zzso activity is higher than those of a number of other zzso for which structural data are zzso zzso zzso indicate that the nature of the major channel, the path for hydrogen zzso to the active site, varies from those seen in other zzso structures, an observation that may account for the high activity of zzso zzso zzso
