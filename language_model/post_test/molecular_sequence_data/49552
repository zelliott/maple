zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso regulates diverse zzso functions, including cell zzso zzso and survival, in addition to providing zzso signals for programmed cell death or zzso In this study, zzso fragments for two distinct zzso zzso were obtained from a Japanese flounder, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were obtained by using these zzso fragments as zzso The zzso for the Japanese zzso zzso zzso predicts a zzso of 395 zzso acids that is zzso identical to the zzso region of mouse zzso whereas the zzso of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso predicts a zzso of zzso zzso acids that is zzso identical to the zzso region of human zzso The zzso domain contains a sequence that has the consensus motif of the death domain of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso In a healthy fish, the zzso of both zzso zzso were predominantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso was induced in peripheral blood zzso zzso after stimulation with zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso and zzso zzso was strongly induced in zzso after stimulation with Con A zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 3 zzso The different expression patterns of the two distinct zzso zzso may be critical in determining whether binding with zzso or zzso have zzso zzso or zzso effects on target zzso
