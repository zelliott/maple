zzso zzso production by B zzso has previously been demonstrated for zzso cells and for in zzso activated normal B zzso zzso in zzso production of zzso by normal B zzso has only been demonstrated in mice, in which zzso zzso 1 + B cells are zzso In the present study, spontaneous expression of the zzso gene by peripheral blood zzso cells was investigated in systemic lupus zzso zzso a human disease involving zzso B zzso Of the 47 zzso patients tested by coupled reverse zzso chain reaction, 34 scored positive, contrasting with only 1 positive out of 34 normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso production of zzso by zzso determined using an zzso zzso was 33 times higher in zzso than in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of production of zzso in zzso was unrelated to either clinical or biological markers of disease zzso Among zzso zzso and B zzso both contributed to zzso production, whereas T cells did zzso zzso overproduction in zzso suggests that this zzso zzso plays a role in the production of zzso through pathways involving both zzso production by zzso and zzso zzso production by zzso B zzso
