We discovered the presence of a unique zzso zzso in the F1 copy of zzso zzso zzso restricted to the bee family zzso zzso zzso The zzso ranges in size from 101 to zzso zzso and shows no zzso zzso Our data also demonstrate the complete absence of this zzso from zzso representing all other bee families, as well as from close zzso zzso A review of the literature finds that this zzso is likewise absent from all other zzso for which data are zzso This provides zzso evidence for a relatively recent zzso zzso event in the zzso common zzso and, at least in this specific instance, lends support to the zzso zzso The comparative distribution of this novel zzso also supports the zzso of zzso and the exclusion of the zzso from this family, providing an example of the potential of some zzso to act as robust markers of shared zzso
