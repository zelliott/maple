Previous attempts to use the zzso approach for sequencing long DNA fragments have met with little zzso As a result, nearly all zzso sequencing is done by the random zzso approach, and the economy promised by the zzso approach has so far not zzso Here we describe a simple system based on the use of ordered deletions that can be incorporated in the common strategies for zzso zzso Long zzso fragments are cloned in the zzso zzso and fragmented by zzso with specific restriction zzso The zzso are zzso to zzso individual restriction zzso The zzso are then subdivided by overlapping deletions and used for zzso We present the zzso sequences of two zzso zzso from zzso IV of zzso zzso the zzso gene and the zzso end of the zzso zzso that were determined by this zzso This is the first report of successful sequencing of long zzso fragments by the use of overlapping zzso Our calculations show that, with the present approach, sequence data can be acquired at a rate comparable to the shotgun approach but with significantly reduced numbers zzso zzso of sequencing zzso zzso the use of ordered deletions should allow significant savings in both the amount and cost of sequencing zzso
