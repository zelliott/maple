The common or brown shrimp zzso zzso zzso is a highly abundant and important zzso both ecologically and zzso yet knowledge on its population structure and historical zzso is zzso We studied population genetic structure across the distribution range of this species by sequencing a 388 zzso zzso of the zzso I gene for 140 individuals from 25 zzso Strong population structuring and high levels of genetic diversity were zzso Four main zzso were zzso northeastern Atlantic, western Mediterranean, zzso Sea and Black zzso Gene flow of these shrimp across known zzso barriers zzso the Strait of zzso and/or zzso front, Sicilian zzso and Turkish zzso is severely zzso The oldest and most variable populations currently inhabit the western zzso The observed absence of structure across the entire northeastern Atlantic shelf is proposed not to be due to gene flow, but to relatively recent colonization following the glacial cycles of the late zzso Black Sea shrimp are currently disconnected from Mediterranean zzso and colonization is zzso on the basis of zzso analysis, to have happened relatively recently, but possibly earlier than zzso years zzso We zzso the hypothesis that zzso zzso survived the last zzso zzso per zzso period inside the Black Sea and/or one of the adjacent inland zzso We conclude that zzso common shrimp populations from different zzso are strongly zzso zzso gene flow across zzso is probably very zzso and zzso the zzso history of the zzso is largely in accordance with the geographic history of its distribution zzso This study provides further evidence that high population connectivity of marine species zzso by policy zzso should not be zzso
