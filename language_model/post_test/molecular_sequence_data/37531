zzso 71 zzso is the most common zzso agent detected in cases of hand, foot and mouth disease zzso resulting in zzso of neurological complications and fatality in recent zzso A comparison of the zzso proteins implicated in the zzso of the fatal and zzso strains of zzso reveals a high degree of zzso zzso zzso To facilitate diagnostic zzso and vaccine development, a consensus structural model for the zzso coat protein has been developed based primarily on the zzso structure of the bovine zzso The overall architecture of the zzso closely resembles those of related zzso zzso zzso atomic zzso of the fatal zzso strain has been carried out, and the functional regions zzso and zzso from closely related viruses mapped onto the surface of the predicted zzso From the model, we have identified two putative zzso regions, one of which is unique to zzso The zzso pocket within zzso found in bovine zzso zzso and zzso is also zzso in zzso
