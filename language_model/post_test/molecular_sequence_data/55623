This study examined the evolution and variation of the human influenza virus zzso gene from the earliest zzso to the zzso zzso reconstruction of the most zzso evolutionary path connecting 49 zzso sequences yielded a single zzso The average calculated rate of zzso was zzso zzso zzso per year zzso zzso zzso zzso per site per zzso zzso percent of these zzso resulted in zzso acid zzso and the remainder were silent zzso Analysis of virus zzso from China and elsewhere showed no significant differences in their rate of evolution, genetic diversity, or mean survival zzso The nearly constant rate of change was maintained through the two zzso shifts, and there were no obvious changes in the number or types of zzso associated with the changes in the surface zzso A detailed comparison of the changes that have occurred on the main evolutionary path with those that have occurred on the side branches of the zzso tree was zzso This showed that while zzso of the zzso on the side branches resulted in zzso acid changes, only zzso of those on the main path affected the protein zzso These results suggest that although the rate of change of the human influenza virus zzso is much higher than that previously described for avian influenza zzso there are measurable constraints on the evolution of the surviving virus zzso zzso of the zzso of virus zzso adapted to chicken zzso with the zzso of those grown only in zzso cells revealed no consistent differences between the virus zzso Thus, although the zzso is known to be critical for host zzso its adaptation to growth in eggs apparently involves no immediate selective pressures, such as are found with zzso
