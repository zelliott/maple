In an attempt to identify zzso that could possibly influence the zzso activity of zzso zzso receptors zzso we used a zzso zzso system with zzso as bait to screen a mouse liver zzso library and have identified steroid zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso We now report the isolation of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which also serves as a zzso zzso also binds to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and this binding is increased in the presence of specific zzso zzso of the last 12 zzso acids from the zzso zzso of zzso results in the abolition of interaction between zzso and zzso zzso modestly increased the zzso activity of zzso and a truncated form of zzso zzso acids zzso acted as a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a genuine zzso for zzso In addition, zzso contains two zzso signature motifs considered necessary and sufficient for the binding of several zzso to nuclear zzso In zzso zzso and Northern analysis showed that zzso is expressed in many zzso of adult mice, including the zzso zzso of zzso where it appeared most abundant, and during zzso suggesting a possible role for this zzso in cellular proliferation and zzso
