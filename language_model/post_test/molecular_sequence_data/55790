In zzso zzso the genes zzso zzso toxin zzso are located on a segment of DNA zzso the zzso zzso that is flanked by two or more copies of a repeated sequence called zzso Together these DNA units comprise the zzso genetic zzso Evidence presented here suggests that zzso sequences zzso a zzso zzso system, which allows integration of a suicide zzso carrying zzso into an zzso sequence zzso located on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with large deletions removing zzso and the entire zzso genetic element no longer undergo zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Additionally, these deletion strains show a zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments zzso the gene responsible for enhancing colonization to a portion of the core region of the zzso zzso The identified gene encodes a zzso that is highly similar in zzso acid sequence to the flexible zzso of zzso zzso These results have important implications in the construction of stable, live attenuated zzso zzso
