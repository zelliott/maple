zzso (A zzso is a zzso zzso acid that is the primary component of plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso Previous studies from our laboratory and others have shown that A beta zzso zzso via zzso in zzso suggesting that A beta may also initiate an zzso zzso of cell death in zzso zzso has been suggested to proceed by a zzso program in several zzso zzso we have investigated whether A zzso zzso is associated with the induction of genes that may regulate or play a role in cell death in zzso Immediate early genes zzso respond to cellular stimuli and participate in cellular signaling zzso The protein products of some zzso zzso zzso are capable of forming zzso and acting as zzso regulatory zzso and have been implicated in zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we report a selective and zzso sustained induction of zzso in cultured zzso zzso treated with A zzso In addition, we describe the lack of induction of zzso in zzso that are relatively resistant to A zzso zzso and a correspondence between zzso for zzso and changes in nuclear zzso that are indicative of zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is induced in cultured zzso that undergo A zzso zzso and suggest that zzso may participate in a cell death program in these zzso
