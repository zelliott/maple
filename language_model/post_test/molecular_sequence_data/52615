Special zzso zzso protein 1 zzso predominantly expressed in zzso was identified as a component of the nuclear zzso protein zzso zzso cell death of zzso zzso was induced by various stimuli in zzso and zzso zzso During zzso but not during zzso zzso was zzso as rapidly as was zzso B, in a zzso way yielding a stable 70 zzso zzso The same result was obtained for zzso zzso We constructed various deletion zzso of zzso expressing protein zzso zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso of these into zzso or zzso cells followed by initiation of zzso allowed us to map the potential zzso zzso site zzso to the zzso third of zzso leaving an intact zzso domain in the zzso part of the zzso Our results suggest that zzso breakdown of zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso might be of zzso relevance during zzso zzso deletion and zzso of peripheral zzso zzso
