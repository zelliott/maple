The structures of two zzso duplexes, the base sequences of which were zzso after both a zzso zzso and a small zzso were studied by zzso Both duplexes contain adjacent zzso zzso one has a zzso sequence and the other a zzso zzso It is concluded on the basis of many characteristic zzso that in both duplexes zzso base pairs are formed in the unique zzso form, where an zzso zzso instead of an zzso zzso of G is involved in the hydrogen zzso and G and A bases are arranged zzso by zzso instead of zzso to zzso A zzso experiment, which gives unique and independent information on the zzso accessibility of zzso zzso also supports zzso base pairing rather than a zzso structure of G and A zzso This is the first demonstration that not only the zzso sequence but also the zzso sequence can form the unique sheared zzso base zzso Taking the previous studies on zzso zzso into account, the idea is suggested that a zzso sequence is a minimum and essential element for the formation of the sheared zzso base zzso The sheared zzso base pairs in the zzso sequence are suggested to be more stable than those in the zzso zzso This is explained rationally by the idea proposed zzso
