zzso of the three-dimensional structure of bovine zzso with the structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso shows that zzso in zzso occupies a position between the specificity zzso zzso and zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso has been introduced in an zzso zzso construct of zzso by bridging its unique restriction sites by a synthetic zzso zzso zzso A zzso fusion product was expressed in zzso coli in such a way that the extension and substitution of the zzso does not interfere with the zzso of the zzso After zzso of the crude zzso the zzso was zzso by affinity zzso on zzso with zzso as zzso This procedure provided large amounts of pure protein as judged by zzso the zzso ratio, and zzso The zzso properties were determined by using a variety of zzso zzso and zzso zzso values for the zzso zzso were approximately twice those of the wild type, but the zzso values were little zzso The zzso zzso was zzso X-ray data were collected to zzso resolution by using a zzso area zzso and the structure was solved by using difference zzso methods and refined to an R factor of zzso The zzso leads to only local changes in zzso with the zzso side chain occupying part of the zzso and zzso zzso This accounts for the increased zzso of this zzso for a zzso with a large zzso side chain at zzso It is also consistent with the higher affinity of the zzso for an inhibitor with small side chains at zzso and zzso when compared with the zzso zzso
