zzso are a family of zzso catalyzing the transfer of zzso acid zzso to terminal zzso positions of zzso chains of zzso and zzso Although expression of zzso acid is well documented in animals of the zzso zzso zzso have been predominantly described for relatively recent zzso lineages such as birds and zzso This study outlines the characterization of the only zzso gene found in the zzso zzso zzso the first such report of a zzso zzso zzso which has been discussed as a possible zzso of the common zzso of zzso zzso We also report for the first time the characterization of a zzso II gene from the zzso fish zzso zzso We demonstrate that both genes zzso functional zzso that are structurally and functionally related to the zzso family of zzso zzso However, characterization of the zzso zzso forms of both zzso reveal novel zzso zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso This is in contrast to the zzso zzso II that predominantly zzso zzso Taken together the zzso zzso site previously proposed for the mouse zzso II might represent a unique feature of zzso zzso II that is missing in the evolutionary more distant fish and zzso species reported zzso This suggests that during the evolution of the zzso II, probably following the separation of the zzso a significant shift in zzso specificity enabling the zzso of zzso took zzso
