zzso zzso zzso C zzso is a zzso zzso factor produced by zzso zzso that activates zzso zzso The biologically active form of zzso is thought to be a zzso containing an essential zinc coordination site on each zzso consisting of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data suggested that zzso specificity is dependent on contacts between the zinc coordination site of zzso and the zzso of the major zzso complex type II zzso zzso Our results indicate that only a minor fraction of zzso is present at zzso zzso zzso of zzso following zzso of the zzso side chain of zzso at zzso 27 to zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso had only minor effects on protein stability but resulted in greatly diminished zzso zzso as measured by surface zzso resonance with isolated zzso pairs and flow zzso with zzso zzso However, with the exception of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso site of zzso did not significantly impact zzso zzso The zzso zzso located in a polar pocket zzso among most zzso resulted in significant loss of zzso zzso although no effect was observed on the overall binding to human zzso zzso perhaps because of the masking of this lower affinity interaction by the dominant zzso zzso To a lesser extent, zzso of side chains found in a second zzso zzso zzso site consisting of a zzso surface loop decreased zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zinc coordination are not essential for biological activity of zzso and suggest the contribution of an alternative zzso binding mode to zzso zzso
