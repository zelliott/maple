The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified and zzso This gene comprises zzso zzso and would zzso a zzso of zzso Da that shows similarity to zzso zzso from higher plants and to the zzso zzso zzso from enteric zzso zzso found at positions corresponding to those zzso acids which in the zzso proteins hold the zzso active center suggest that zzso zzso from zzso bears an active site much alike that present in those zzso The fact that the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins gives support to the zzso theory for the origin of zzso
