We have previously shown that the exchange of the zzso base zzso of human zzso for G is alone sufficient to achieve complete loss of zzso acceptance and to create an efficient zzso zzso The reverse identity switch, however, which was studied using zzso zzso zzso transcripts of in zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals a far more complex pattern of identity elements for zzso Introduction of the following zzso structures is necessary to transform human zzso into an efficient zzso zzso the zzso base zzso the base pairs zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso loop and the long extra zzso In contrast to zzso human zzso identity requires both the sequence and the correct orientation of the long extra arm, whereas only its orientation is essential for zzso zzso
