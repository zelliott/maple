The zzso zzso designated as zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso soil in zzso (South zzso and were zzso characterized using a zzso approach and their diesel oil degradation abilities were zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, based on their zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso fatty acid profiles and various zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to use diesel oil as the sole carbon and energy zzso Both strains could degrade over zzso of diesel oil with an initial concentration of 20,000 zzso after incubation for 7 days, the most significant degradation occurred during the first 3 zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on diesel zzso zzso among bacterial strains belonging to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
