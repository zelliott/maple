The zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned by detection of a zzso restriction zzso zzso with each of two zzso zzso that corresponded to zzso and zzso repeats characteristic of known zzso zzso The zzso gene was situated upstream of zzso and zzso zzso and downstream of a putative zzso zzso zzso results indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso regions were highly zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in inability to grow in zzso media, and inability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso and zzso Although it was not possible to zzso zzso in a clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso was disrupted in a laboratory zzso zzso strain previously selected for the ability to grow on zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso shared a similar iron complex zzso deficient zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso present on a zzso did not complement an zzso coli zzso zzso but inefficient zzso of zzso zzso was observed in one zzso zzso zzso zzso copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
