zzso expression of zzso not only promotes zzso entry but also zzso zzso Although it has been well documented that zzso is able to induce zzso zzso via raising zzso activity, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Here we report that zzso can directly bind to and activate the promoter of zzso a zzso zzso zzso through the zzso sites zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to be zzso in combination rather than zzso by zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso since neither zzso nor zzso is able to activate zzso or zzso Using the zzso zzso cell line where zzso activity can be zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso the zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels upon zzso treatment, resulting in an enhanced zzso zzso zzso reducing the zzso expression by zzso interference significantly diminishes zzso induced by zzso These results may suggest a novel mechanism by which zzso promotes zzso zzso through directly regulating its downstream zzso zzso factors, such as zzso
