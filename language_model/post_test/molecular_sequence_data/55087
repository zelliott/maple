A number of molecular ecological studies have revealed complex and unique microbial communities in various zzso plant zzso however, little is known about the microbial communities of aquatic plant roots in spite of their potential use for water quality improvement in aquatic environments zzso floating treatment zzso zzso Here, we report the microbial communities inhabiting the roots of emerged plants, zzso zzso zzso and Japanese zzso zzso zzso collected from a floating treatment zzso in a pond by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the microbial compositions between the two aquatic plant roots were clearly different zzso the zzso zzso was zzso for zzso and zzso for Japanese zzso In comparisons of microbial communities between the plant roots and pond water taken from near the plants, the microbial diversity in the plant roots zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than that of pond water zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the plant roots zzso zzso times more zzso novel clone zzso than pond zzso The zzso approach also revealed differences in the microbial composition and diversity among the two plant roots and pond zzso More importantly, compared to pond water, we succeeded in zzso approximately two times more novel isolate zzso including a zzso of candidate zzso zzso zzso named zzso from the plant zzso These findings suggest that aquatic plants roots are significant sources for a variety of novel zzso
