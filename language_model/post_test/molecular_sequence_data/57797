An zzso study of Alzheimer's disease zzso with a panel of zzso zzso revealed two zzso that stained zzso bodies zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso These two zzso zzso zzso were raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides zzso to sequences zzso acids zzso and zzso in the 58 zzso acid insert in the zzso zzso of the longest form of human zzso This region is zzso to zzso 2 and zzso 3 of bovine zzso The zzso 2 zzso contains a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which has been shown to be a zzso site in paired zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso 2 zzso failed to zzso zzso but those to the zzso consistently stained zzso zzso however, was most consistent with the zzso to the zzso 3 zzso As in previous studies, zzso were also stained by zzso a zzso zzso whose zzso in zzso appears to be a zzso site in or near zzso 2, perhaps at zzso zzso 46 zzso et zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso failed to consistently stain zzso More often they produced zzso around the periphery of the zzso giving the appearance of an zzso zzso Most zzso were also zzso with an zzso to zzso The results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso are derived from zzso altered zzso possibly zzso by zzso The failure to detect most regions of zzso in zzso is consistent with the idea that zzso is partially zzso or highly modified in zzso
