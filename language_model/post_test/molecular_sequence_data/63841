zzso is a novel gene cloned from zzso cells, and its function is still zzso zzso data showed that zzso might be regulated by DNA zzso and had an important role in DNA zzso In this study, we investigate whether the expression of zzso is regulated by DNA zzso and whether zzso of zzso increases efficiency of DNA repair of zzso DNA damage in zzso zzso The results showed zzso the promoter of zzso was zzso in zzso cells, resulting a silence of its zzso Gene expression was restored by a zzso agent, zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso and the numbers of cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle in cells zzso with zzso increased about zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso B1 level was much lower in cells zzso zzso than in control zzso and zzso after exposure to zzso radiation, the zzso cells showed shorter comet tails compared with the zzso zzso From these results we conclude that the expression of zzso is controlled by zzso in its promoter in zzso cells, and zzso zzso resistance to zzso damage and zzso the DNA repair zzso
