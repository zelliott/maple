The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso exist as either zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso are diverse, since the zzso zzso domain is associated with other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso We report the first crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso This protein consists of two structural zzso a modified zzso domain and a novel zzso zzso binding zzso The active site of zzso zzso is formed at the domain interface and is shared between the zzso of the zzso We zzso from the structure that access to the active site is regulated via a gated zzso which is modulated by an zzso network involving a zzso zzso zzso In addition, the crystal structure reveals for the first time the positions of a number of key zzso zzso and the identity of other active site zzso that may participate in the reaction zzso these zzso include zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the structure further reveals that two secondary structure zzso zzso and zzso are missing in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This observation suggests that the two functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso and explains why these zzso cannot be zzso
