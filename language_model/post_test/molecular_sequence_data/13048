A detailed comparison of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of rubber tree zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso and zzso transport into barley zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed very similar transport zzso In order to identify proteins zzso the zzso two zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso and found to efficiently inhibit zzso zzso into barley zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso In zzso from both plant species, these zzso zzso specifically labeled a single protein with a molecular mass of zzso zzso This zzso binding protein zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso acid sequences were determined for zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a zzso coding for the zzso protein of zzso was zzso The zzso codes for a precursor protein of zzso zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso acid signal sequence for zzso zzso zzso a prerequisite for zzso zzso The mature zzso does not show significant sequence similarities to any known primary protein structure and thus represents a member of a novel class of zzso
