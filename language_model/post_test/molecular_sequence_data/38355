zzso and zzso expressed human zzso virus type 1 zzso gag and zzso under the regulation of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso leukemia viral long terminal repeat zzso zzso Analysis of the immune responses zzso by direct DNA injection of zzso and zzso in zzso indicated that generation of the zzso and zzso zzso responses correlated directly with the promoter strength of the vaccine zzso In zzso zzso zzso generated stronger zzso responses and zzso zzso responses to zzso and zzso using less DNA and fewer number of injections than zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso responses, which persisted long-term and were zzso zzso of large amounts of zzso in general, failed to produce zzso levels comparable to zzso However, injection of a control animal with large amounts of zzso DNA produced a generalized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The results indicated that generation of high immune responses to zzso cannot be achieved by increasing the vaccine DNA dose and may require high protein expression from the DNA by including a strong promoter or by the use of other boosting zzso Furthermore, safety concerns may arise with increasing the DNA dose that could need additional zzso
