Identification of cell surface viral binding proteins is important for understanding viral attachment and zzso We have fused the zzso domain of the duck zzso B virus zzso large envelope protein to zzso zzso and demonstrated a zzso binding protein zzso in zzso duck zzso zzso This zzso was found abundantly in all zzso zzso zzso with zzso and in some zzso zzso though it is not zzso into the zzso The interaction of zzso fusion protein with zzso was competitively inhibited by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, infection of zzso with zzso blocked the binding of zzso fusion protein to zzso which suggests a biological role for zzso during natural zzso The zzso binding site was mapped to a zzso sequence of 16 zzso acid zzso zzso 87 to zzso by using 24 zzso deletion zzso this binding domain zzso with a major zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso revealed that an zzso zzso at position 97 is critical for zzso zzso zzso was zzso by a combination of zzso and affinity zzso and four zzso sequences were zzso Two peptides showed significant similarities to human and animal zzso zzso M, and zzso Taken together, these results raise the possibility that the zzso binding protein is important during the replication cycle of zzso
