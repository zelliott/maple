The zzso zzso protein zzso 2 zzso plays a central role in cellular proliferation and zzso Full zzso of zzso requires dual zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an important mechanism for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a highly efficient zzso for zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso values for the zzso zzso of zzso peptides are 3 orders of magnitude zzso To gain insight into the molecular basis for zzso zzso zzso we analyzed the effects of altering structural features unique to zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso specificity is zzso upon zzso by both negative and positive zzso To avoid zzso zzso zzso zzso employs zzso in the zzso recognition loop as a key negative zzso to restrain its zzso zzso zzso The extremely high efficiency and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is achieved by a zzso zzso interaction zzso in which zzso interactions between the zzso interaction motif in zzso and the common zzso site in zzso promote the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso by increasing the local zzso zzso and second site interactions between the zzso zzso site and the zzso zzso region enhance zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso by organizing the zzso zzso with respect to zzso for optimal zzso zzso
