Natural killer zzso cells mediate bone zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying such a rejection remain zzso In previous zzso it has been shown that zzso cells recognize zzso target cells through zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso which was composed of 226 zzso zzso showed approximately zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that expression of zzso was largely confined to zzso and zzso cells, but was not seen in T zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the injection of zzso zzso before the zzso bone zzso transfer in zzso zzso on the function of zzso resulting in the enhanced colony formation in the zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso recognition and rejection of zzso target zzso
