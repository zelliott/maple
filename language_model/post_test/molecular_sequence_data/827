In the course of a zzso zzso survey of different ecological zzso found in Ecuador, two zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from samples of rotten wood and fallen leaf debris collected at separate sites in the central region of the zzso zzso These strains were found to represent a novel zzso species based on the sequences of their zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso gene and their zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso sequences revealed this novel species to be most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two as yet zzso zzso species, with the six zzso zzso collectively forming a distinct species group within the zzso zzso The species name of zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed to accommodate these zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso designated as the type zzso
