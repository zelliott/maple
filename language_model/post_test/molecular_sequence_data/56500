We have identified eight different basic zzso growth factor zzso or zzso transcripts which can be grouped into three classes expressed during chicken zzso and in specific adult zzso Three of them zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Two additional zzso are structurally zzso to the previously isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Their expression during zzso and the zzso zzso amounts of sense and zzso transcripts in several adult zzso provide further evidence for a possible regulatory role of the zzso zzso zzso a novel class of three alternatively spliced zzso transcripts expressed predominantly during zzso was zzso Alternative zzso of zzso 1 of the open reading frame creates a predicted zzso zzso containing a completely novel zzso zzso This is the first report describing alternative zzso of the coding region of zzso Similar levels of alternatively spliced zzso and zzso zzso transcripts are expressed during zzso but in adult zzso zzso transcripts are far less abundant, which suggests roles for the predicted novel zzso zzso during zzso
