To investigate the factors involved in the sorting of cargo proteins into zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso apparatus transport zzso we have created a strain of zzso zzso zzso that lacks all eight members of the zzso family of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso to zzso The zzso proteins have been implicated in zzso and zzso zzso formation, cargo protein zzso and regulation of zzso transport in zzso zzso We find that zzso cells grow zzso to wild type and show delays of zzso and zzso zzso transport identical to those seen in a single zzso deletion zzso Thus, zzso proteins do not have an essential function in the zzso zzso Instead, they may serve as quality control factors to restrict the entry of proteins into zzso zzso
