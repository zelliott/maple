The main aim of this work was to study molecular characterization of a DNA zzso zzso resistance to zzso in zzso zzso zzso The strain zzso resistant to zzso zzso in zzso extract medium was isolated from zzso zzso growing in mine tailings of zzso County, zzso The availability of the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso provides an opportunity for investigating genes that play significant roles in zzso zzso A copper resistance zzso with a length of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was identified by zzso zzso length zzso from zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso gene strongly increased in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso display sensitivities to zzso compared with their wild zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso by a zzso DNA zzso containing zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this gene zzso a hypothetical outer membrane protein with zzso similarity to outer membrane zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These studies suggested that the zzso product was involved in the zzso tolerance of zzso zzso zzso
