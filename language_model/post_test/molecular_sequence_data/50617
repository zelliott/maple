The emergence of zzso B virus zzso unable to express zzso protein during late stage of viral infection may represent an important mechanism of viral zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for the elimination of zzso expression are nonsense or zzso zzso or initiation zzso zzso in part of its coding zzso the zzso zzso So far only 2 of the 29 zzso zzso acid zzso have been found zzso to stop zzso in nature, although a total of 10 zzso are convertible to stop zzso by single zzso zzso Since the zzso sequence is largely overlapped by the zzso zzso signal zzso zzso a recently found zzso element required for the packaging of zzso zzso the absence of other potential nonsense zzso could result from their impairment of the zzso zzso Seven such potential stop zzso zzso were constructed and tested for replication capacities by zzso into a zzso cell zzso Five zzso were replication competent, but at levels lower than that of a prevalent natural stop zzso zzso The remaining two zzso were completely defective in DNA zzso which clearly explained why these two zzso are not found in zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed zzso levels of zzso zzso by these two zzso but complete lack of packaged zzso zzso Additional studies lent further support to the importance of the zzso signal in zzso zzso and suggested relaxed sequence requirements for the zzso zzso zzso region as compared to the zzso loop of the zzso
