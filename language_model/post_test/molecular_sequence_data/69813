The zzso sequences of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso zzso Each of these zzso is located in intervals that strongly correlated with zzso to diabetes in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant variations in the zzso of zzso at 16 zzso on zzso zzso 3 or zzso at 8 zzso on zzso 17 were zzso However, the zzso zzso in zzso at 20 zzso on zzso 3 was found to differ from that in zzso by a complex zzso involving the contraction of a simple sequence repeat zzso zzso in zzso differs from the zzso in zzso via a complex zzso involving a deletion of four zzso zzso from the zzso together with a zzso zzso zzso of a segment zzso from the zzso Two zzso zzso in the coding region zzso to the zzso were also zzso Only these two zzso forms of zzso were detected in a survey of 13 standard zzso lines and 4 wild mouse zzso We propose to designate these zzso as zzso (for zzso such as zzso that contain 12 zzso zzso and zzso (for zzso such as zzso which occurred in a variety of standard zzso strains and in all four wild zzso zzso zzso zzso The distribution of these zzso zzso among zzso strains correlated with the detection of zzso 3 as an zzso zzso diabetes zzso in three separate genetic zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
