The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso is important for the maturation of B zzso A variety of point zzso in this zzso result in a severe human zzso known as zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso domain that specifically binds zzso zzso and, zzso responds to zzso via zzso zzso Point zzso in the zzso domain might abolish membrane zzso preventing zzso via zzso 

We have determined the crystal structures of the zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso binds to a site that is similar to the zzso zzso binding site in the zzso domain of zzso zzso A second zzso zzso zzso is associated with the domain of the zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism for its zzso interaction with zzso The affinities of zzso zzso to the wild type zzso zzso 40 zzso and several zzso zzso have been measured using zzso zzso zzso 

Our data provide an explanation for the specificity and high affinity of the interaction with zzso zzso and lead to a zzso of the zzso zzso that reside in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that do not simply destabilize the zzso fold either directly affect the interaction with the zzso of the zzso head group or change zzso properties of the zzso zzso One point zzso zzso cannot be explained by these facts, suggesting that the zzso domain of zzso carries an additional function such as interaction with a zzso zzso
