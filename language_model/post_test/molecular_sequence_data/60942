zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso To determine whether a zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso we performed sequence analysis of its zzso gene zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso were examined in six zzso derived cell lines, in three zzso tumor cell lines, as well as in peripheral blood zzso and in tissue from heart, zzso and liver by zzso These studies did not disclose the expected tumor related zzso but led instead to the identification of three novel forms of zzso These forms vary in zzso but contain all functional zzso formerly characterized in the zzso zzso The results indicate that the previously published sequence is not the zzso form most widely zzso
