zzso zzso is a zzso located, key zzso zzso In addition to its general zzso role, zzso is important in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity have been associated with certain neurodegenerative human zzso Although a single species of human zzso zzso zzso has been identified so far, both zzso DNA Southern and zzso analyses have indicated the presence of a zzso gene zzso zzso of a human zzso zzso library with the zzso zzso led us to the isolation of several clones divided into five structurally distinct zzso We have confirmed the presence of all zzso sequences in the human zzso by detailed zzso Southern zzso This study allowed the identification of the entire functional zzso zzso named zzso The zzso gene is about 45 zzso long and it is organized into 13 zzso Its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso start sites were zzso Potential binding sites for various regulatory factors such as zzso zzso and zzso were recognized at the promoter region of the zzso The members of the other zzso showed an organization clearly different from zzso Two distinct zzso gene zzso termed zzso and zzso possibly represent truncated zzso Their high degree of similarity to zzso is limited to the region surrounding zzso 2, 3, and zzso Finally, two additional zzso zzso zzso termed zzso and zzso are structurally similar with the 3' part of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso probably represent truncated zzso zzso generated by zzso The data presented here suggest that all human zzso zzso have zzso recently in zzso
