zzso factor 2 zzso is a protein involved in zzso chain zzso in zzso We isolated the mouse zzso gene and characterized its zzso We showed that the majority of zzso elements were located within 500 zzso of the zzso sequence and identified a factor binding site sequence zzso located between zzso zzso and zzso containing two zzso motifs separated by two zzso The motif represents a zzso for binding of the zzso response element zzso binding protein zzso zzso analysis indicated that the presence of one zzso site alone zzso zzso zzso but the presence of one or two zzso sites and spacing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA affinity zzso revealed that three zzso zzso and zzso proteins bound to the zzso zzso Of these, the zzso protein was unique to the zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso and the zzso protein with the molecular size of zzso was not zzso on the basis of zzso to their respective zzso Because zzso responds poorly to zzso zzso it is likely the contributor to the zzso expression rather than zzso expression of the zzso element, and, thus, the zzso zzso
