A model is proposed, based on recent zzso analog and ice crystal zzso studies, zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the winter zzso zzso the growth of ice zzso by hydrogen bonding of zzso zzso and zzso side chains in a specific pattern to the zzso zzso zzso planes of zzso It is further suggested that this mode of binding is zzso maximizing opportunities for packing of zzso on the ice surface, and that ice crystal growth zzso occurs by a zzso mechanism involving hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso zzso
