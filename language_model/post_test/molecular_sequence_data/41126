A protein with strong removal activity against the natural zzso zzso was zzso from a culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein was characterized as a zzso and had a molecular mass of zzso on zzso The zzso was most active at pH zzso and zzso The partial zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso showed zzso with zzso from mushrooms, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso name: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso treatment was very efficient for removing the zzso activity of steroid zzso Our results suggest that the zzso may be zzso as a potential factor for removing natural steroid zzso
