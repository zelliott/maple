The zzso protein zzso of minute virus of mice zzso an autonomous zzso zzso the replication of a zzso zzso containing the zzso origin of replication zzso embedded in the zzso zzso It appears that a zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso DNA is zzso in the presence of zzso to cause the zzso of DNA replication driven by the zzso zzso placed on the same zzso This effect is not dependent on the orientation of the zzso target sequence and results from both a reduced level of zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of progressing replication zzso at the level of the zzso Furthermore, replication driven by zzso virus origin zzso is zzso by zzso but this zzso does not require the presence of zzso sequences in zzso On the basis of sequence zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso terminal zzso it is proposed that the direct or indirect interaction of zzso with zzso sequences present in zzso viral and possibly also cellular zzso may result in an zzso of DNA zzso
