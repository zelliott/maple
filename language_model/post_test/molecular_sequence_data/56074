Eight zzso peptides were produced by zzso from engineered zzso zzso One was zzso to an zzso zzso of the winter zzso the others differed in length and/or zzso The zzso zzso and all those of equal or greater length were able to inhibit zzso The longer peptides were so zzso that their identification required modification of the usual protocols for high pressure liquid zzso Their zzso positions were correlated to their zzso and their zzso Additional naturally occurring zzso may be identifiable with this zzso
