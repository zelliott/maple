zzso and zzso are closely zzso low molecular weight zzso proteins that have both been implicated in regulation of zzso zzso zzso This zzso system is composed of multiple zzso and zzso zzso and when activated zzso the zzso reduction of oxygen to zzso zzso and its highly zzso derivatives are essential for killing zzso zzso proteins undergo zzso processing, primarily the addition of an zzso group to a zzso zzso zzso We directly compared zzso zzso and zzso in a human zzso zzso zzso zzso system in which zzso was replaced by zzso zzso zzso components zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were both highly active in this system and supported comparable rates of zzso zzso Under different zzso conditions, however, in which zzso amounts of zzso were present in the zzso mixture, processed zzso worked much better than zzso at all but the lowest zzso This suggests that a factor in the zzso may suppress the activity of zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso proteins were only zzso able to support zzso generation in either system, but zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso restored zzso These results indicate that processing is required for zzso exchange but not for interaction with zzso zzso
