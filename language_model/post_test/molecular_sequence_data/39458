A widespread zzso procedure for characterizing a complex mixture of proteins combines tandem mass zzso and database search software to yield mass zzso with identified zzso zzso The same peptides are often detected in multiple experiments, and once they have been identified, the respective zzso can be used for future zzso We present a method for collecting previously identified tandem mass zzso into a reference library that is used to identify new zzso zzso zzso are compared to references in the library to find the ones that are most zzso A dot product metric is used to measure the degree of zzso With our largest library, the search of a query set finds zzso of the spectrum identifications and zzso of the protein identifications that could be made with a zzso database zzso A second experiment demonstrates that queries acquired on an zzso zzso trap mass zzso can be identified with a library of references acquired on an zzso zzso trap mass zzso The dot product similarity score provides good separation of correct and incorrect zzso
