zzso are a leading cause of zzso meningitis in adult and pediatric zzso We describe the development of a real-time zzso zzso that zzso a small target in the zzso zzso region upstream of the classical zzso zzso zzso The zzso includes an zzso internal control and incorporates modified zzso zzso 

We evaluated the performance characteristics of this design and performed blinded parallel testing on clinical samples, comparing the results with a commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that uses an zzso zzso plate end zzso 

We tested zzso samples and found 14 zzso samples between the 2 zzso Of these, the real-time zzso detected 6 samples that were negative by the zzso zzso 5 of which were confirmed as positive by sequence analysis using an alternative primer zzso Eight zzso samples were positive by the zzso kit and real-time negative, with 6 confirmed by zzso Overall, detection rates of zzso and zzso were obtained for the zzso kit and real-time zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of a number of single zzso zzso in the targeted zzso The comparative sensitivities of the 2 zzso were zzso with the limit of detection for the real-time zzso determined to be approximately 430 copies per zzso in zzso zzso 

This novel real-time zzso zzso is a sensitive and suitable zzso for routine clinical zzso The presence of single zzso zzso can affect real-time zzso zzso
