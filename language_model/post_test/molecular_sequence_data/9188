As major zzso of eye zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the transparency and zzso power of this region by preventing zzso and zzso of other zzso As shown zzso cataract formation was positively associated with high salt intake and the zzso of blood sugar zzso Here the effect of both temperature and zzso strength were studied on structure and zzso function of zzso and zzso zzso While zzso activity of these proteins was increased as function of temperature zzso in the presence of sodium salt zzso 160 zzso it was significantly zzso As shown by zzso and circular zzso zzso instruments, the salt induced structural zzso of zzso was accompanied with the exposure of zzso surfaces and a transition from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, the structural zzso induced by the salt were more pronounced in the case of zzso zzso compared to that of zzso protein zzso zzso this study shows the structural changes accompanied with lose of the zzso activity of zzso induced by sodium zzso zzso the obtained results may provide new zzso for the relationship between high salt zzso and cataract disease induced particularly by prolonged zzso
