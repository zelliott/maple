zzso is an unstable regulatory protein that affects both cell division and cell zzso zzso zzso a second round of DNA synthesis during S and zzso phase by binding the essential replication protein zzso zzso is also required for entry into zzso either by preventing replication abnormalities or by zzso the checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso during embryonic development zzso zzso neural zzso zzso eye formation, and zzso the zzso patterning of the zzso In order to define the structural and functional zzso of the zzso zzso we generated over 40 zzso and deletion zzso and tested their zzso in biological and zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso through the zzso domain to form zzso and that zzso is required for zzso zzso contains a typical zzso nuclear zzso signal that is also required for its destruction during zzso zzso zzso of zzso interfere with DNA replication in succeeding cell zzso zzso zzso domain lies immediately adjacent to the zzso domain and zzso zzso We constructed two zzso zzso in this domain and found that they neither inhibited replication nor permitted entry into zzso indicating that this domain is necessary for both zzso We identified several zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding domain that were deficient in their ability to inhibit replication yet were still able to allow zzso entry, suggesting that these are separate functions of zzso
