The normal functioning immune system is programmed to attack foreign pathogens and other foreign proteins while maintaining tolerance to zzso The mechanisms by which tolerance is broken in the initiation of zzso are not completely zzso In the present study, mice zzso with the zzso zzso c zzso zzso showed no response by the B or T cell zzso However, zzso with the zzso form of this zzso where the linkage of zzso to zzso occurs through the zzso group, resulted in strong B and T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso with the zzso form of zzso were zzso in binding to both zzso of zzso c zzso and to native zzso c zzso In a similar manner, zzso of mice with the zzso form of a zzso zzso of human systemic lupus zzso zzso resulted in strong B and T cell responses while mice maintained tolerance to the normal zzso form of zzso zzso linkages within proteins are enhanced in aging and stressed cells and arise under zzso zzso These zzso modified peptides may serve as an early zzso stimulus in zzso zzso
