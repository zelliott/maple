zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the human insulin zzso was examined by zzso Various zzso zzso molecules were used to identify two zzso zzso associated with the zzso region which accounts for zzso of the zzso of partially zzso insulin zzso These zzso were zzso with an zzso zzso against the zzso sequence and were zzso exclusively on zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso with zzso eliminated zzso zzso of the zzso region without affecting zzso zzso in the C zzso or regulatory zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso reduced zzso in the zzso region by more than zzso and manual zzso degradation indicated that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso region accounts for one-third of the insulin zzso zzso and contains both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and 11 adjacent zzso acids eliminated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced this zzso by more than zzso The insulin zzso also zzso zzso zzso outside of the zzso region which depends on the presence of zzso Together with our previous studies, this report suggests that zzso of zzso may play an important role in signal zzso by the insulin zzso
