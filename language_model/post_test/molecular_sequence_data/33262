The molecular zzso of the zzso transition are poorly zzso Here we show that two protein zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso and zzso are required for key events of the zzso transition in zzso zzso The predicted zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences are zzso identical and their functions are zzso In zzso lacking zzso and zzso we observe defects in zzso polar body formation, the block to zzso zzso zzso and eggshell zzso During zzso zzso and zzso assemble at the zzso zzso with the previously identified regulators or zzso of the zzso transition zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All of these molecules share a complex zzso with regards to their dynamics and zzso zzso Shortly after zzso zzso and zzso are required to properly coordinate a zzso of zzso and zzso away from the zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not only required for critical events of the zzso transition but also link the dynamics of the regulatory machinery with the advancing cell zzso
