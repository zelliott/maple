zzso zzso an zzso acid zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso the formation of a double bond between the C alpha and C beta zzso of various zzso derivatives provided that they zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso an zzso group, and zzso an zzso and unmodified zzso zzso zzso parameters were evaluated for a series of zzso zzso providing information on the contribution of each chemical group to zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso product was determined to be a zzso from zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso No reaction can be observed in the presence of other aromatic zzso zzso zzso which behave neither as zzso nor as zzso and therefore do not compete against this zzso The zzso synthesis of zzso peptides from 5 to 24 zzso was successfully achieved without side product formation, irrespective of the position of the zzso zzso in the zzso acid zzso A zzso mechanism involving a direct zzso of the zzso side chain is zzso
