Analysis of processing, zzso and function of higher zzso zzso zzso zzso has been hindered by the lack of an expression system that enables zzso to be modified and then examined zzso Given the potential usefulness of such a system, we have developed one for zzso zzso zzso We inserted a sequence tag into expansion segment 3 of mouse zzso zzso to monitor expression and zzso by zzso zzso were identified that zzso resistance to zzso allowing functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso containing synthetic zzso zzso by selectively blocking translation from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were suitably expressed in zzso cells, shown to process correctly, incorporate into zzso zzso of zzso zzso and function normally based on various zzso After rigorous analysis, the system was used to investigate the importance of sequences that flank zzso zzso in precursor zzso Although deletion analysis supported the requirement of binding sites for the zzso zzso it showed that a large segment of the zzso external transcribed zzso and the entire first internal transcribed zzso both of which flank zzso zzso are not zzso The success of this approach opens the possibility of functional analyses of zzso with applications in basic research and synthetic zzso
