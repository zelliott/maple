A zzso clone zzso zzso zzso from the soil zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The clone was identified by zzso screening of a zzso zzso zzso zzso library with an zzso probe which corresponded to the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso The zzso encodes a protein consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of a number of peptides obtained by zzso degradation of various zzso products of the zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli to yield high levels of active zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is very similar to the zzso zzso zzso with respect to the range of zzso acted zzso zzso by excess zzso and the order of magnitude of kinetic parameters in the overall zzso Southern zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso sequences in a number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains and in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
