The specificity of the zzso used by zzso zzso for zzso transport of zzso toxin zzso and other proteins was examined in several different zzso First, zzso zzso was tested for the ability to zzso the B zzso of the type II zzso zzso of zzso zzso Genes zzso the B zzso of zzso in zzso zzso were introduced into zzso zzso by zzso Culture zzso and zzso extracts were collected from cultures of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso B zzso were measured by an zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the B zzso of both zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso with efficiencies comparable to that measured for zzso of zzso Second, the zzso clones were introduced into strain zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso failed to transport the B zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso of type II zzso by zzso zzso proceeds by the same zzso used for zzso transport of zzso These data suggest that an zzso transport signal recognized by the zzso machinery of zzso zzso is present in zzso and zzso Furthermore, since the B zzso of CT has little, if any, primary zzso acid sequence zzso with the B zzso of zzso or zzso the transport signal is likely to be a zzso zzso Third, a zzso of the B zzso of CT zzso with zzso zzso for zzso at zzso acid position 11 was shown to be zzso poorly by zzso zzso although it exhibited zzso and zzso zzso activity comparable to that of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be within or near the zzso transport motif of zzso Finally, the genetic zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso sequence zzso
