The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso linear DNA zzso zzso zzso The DNA was zzso and the sequence was compared with DNA sequences of closely related zzso namely the members of the zzso zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso was shown to be the most closely related to zzso Comparisons of several open reading frames zzso among the family members helped to identify genes 1 and zzso A cluster of zzso between genes 16 and 17 contains two zzso with partial zzso with two zzso zzso located in the same zzso There are three more zzso in this region of zzso with good zzso binding sites zzso and optimal zzso usage that are not zzso to any of the zzso zzso The function of these five zzso remains zzso It was shown that major promoters characterized in zzso are retained in zzso Where many zzso occur in the vicinity of a promoter, at least the zzso and zzso boxes are zzso
