The majority of collagen zzso causing osteogenesis imperfecta zzso are zzso zzso that disrupt formation of the triple zzso A rare type of collagen zzso consists of a zzso or deletion of one or two zzso zzso These zzso shift the register of collagen chains with respect to each other in the zzso but do not interrupt the zzso zzso yet they have severe clinical zzso We investigated the effect of shifting the register of the collagen zzso by a single zzso zzso on collagen zzso stability, and incorporation into zzso and zzso These studies zzso a zzso zzso in zzso zzso 44 that occurred in the zzso and zzso of two siblings with lethal zzso The normal zzso encodes three identical zzso triplets at zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso encodes zzso The register shift delays zzso formation, causing zzso zzso scanning zzso yielded a decrease in zzso of 2 degrees C for zzso with one zzso chain and a 6 degrees C decrease in zzso with two zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso with the zzso zzso has slower zzso zzso than in normal controls or zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso showing that the register shift persists through the entire zzso The register shift zzso incorporation of zzso collagen into zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed zzso in zzso and contained only normal zzso and zzso with a single zzso zzso zzso with two zzso chains and a significant portion of zzso with one zzso chain did not form zzso In zzso deposited by zzso zzso zzso chains were abundant in the zzso zzso fraction but constituted a minor fraction of zzso zzso zzso The profound effects of shifting the collagen zzso register on chain interactions in the zzso and on zzso formation correlate with the severe clinical zzso
