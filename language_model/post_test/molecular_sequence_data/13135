We have developed a rapid and easy extraction procedure for zzso chain reaction zzso zzso Using this simplified step, we evaluated the sensitivity and the specificity of a simple zzso using the zzso of Wakefield et zzso and of a zzso zzso using new internal zzso selected by us, in a total of 89 zzso zzso zzso fluid samples from 43 zzso zzso In 13 patients, zzso zzso pneumonia zzso was diagnosed by zzso zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso cells zzso on microscope zzso In seven of these patients we attempted to estimate the zzso persistence of zzso zzso in zzso by zzso After a rapid zzso extraction zzso simple and zzso zzso were positive in all cases of zzso zzso and zzso zzso both had a zzso sensitivity and a 98 and zzso specificity respectively, compared to zzso After completion of treatment, zzso liquids from zzso patients were no longer positive by both zzso techniques, whereas the zzso fluid of a patient who was still symptomatic was positive by simple and zzso zzso In follow-up zzso zzso of patients with proven zzso persistence of zzso zzso was detected for a longer period by zzso zzso than by simple zzso zzso zzso is a very rapid and sensitive zzso for the diagnosis of zzso in zzso fluid and gives clear-cut results in the case of doubtful zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to improve the sensitivity of the detection of zzso zzso in zzso fluid, but the clinical relevance of a positive result remains to be zzso
