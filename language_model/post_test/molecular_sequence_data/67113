zzso zzso cancer cells of high zzso exhibited higher proliferation capacity than zzso zzso zzso Higher expression of zzso zzso and zzso and greater zzso zzso and zzso promoter activities were detected in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were increased in zzso but not in zzso cells upon serum stimulation from zzso Likewise, only in zzso cells could serum stimulate zzso activity of zzso promoter and zzso response zzso The increase of zzso promoter activity could be zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and was associated with recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso Ras reduced the levels of zzso zzso and zzso and consequently abolished the zzso zzso of zzso promoter activity and zzso promoter zzso Our results indicate that Ras and zzso play important roles in the zzso of zzso during proliferation of cells associated with a high degree of zzso thus outlining a signaling cascade involving these factors in the cancer zzso
