zzso of cells to zzso acid requires a zzso unknown number of zzso Studies on the zzso gene and its zzso protein in the zzso fungus zzso zzso have revealed an involvement of this protein in the molecular processes of adaptation to zzso zzso zzso belongs to a novel family of zzso proteins in zzso and zzso organisms that is characterized by the two motifs zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Analysis of four zzso zzso and zzso deletion analysis of zzso identified the zzso acid sequence zzso important for function of this protein in zzso zzso zzso of zzso slowed down adaptation to zzso acid, but had no effect on growth in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is induced by zzso acid and moderately zzso by zzso It was shown by zzso zzso that zzso is an integral membrane zzso which is also suggested by the presence of five to six putative zzso spanning zzso Fluorescence zzso confirmed a zzso to the plasma zzso A model is presented describing a hypothetical function of zzso during adaptation to zzso zzso
