zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in many signaling zzso including zzso for the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the hypothesis that zzso zzso may have a common function such as membrane targeting we tested the ability of zzso zzso from other signaling molecules to link zzso to the insulin zzso zzso zzso proteins containing a zzso zzso domain derived from other zzso proteins zzso or zzso were zzso zzso normally in response to zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso failed to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso even in cells expressing high levels of insulin zzso Moreover, zzso proteins containing zzso zzso zzso did not bind zzso zzso motifs derived from the insulin zzso suggesting that the presence of these structures zzso with the function of the adjacent zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso by the insulin zzso specifically requires a zzso domain derived from zzso zzso
