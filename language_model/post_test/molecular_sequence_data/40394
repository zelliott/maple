The evolution and zzso of zzso zzso strains isolated in Italy and Finland were studied by zzso analysis of different zzso comparative analysis of small zzso gene intervening sequence zzso amplified zzso length zzso analysis and zzso zzso The results of this study divided the zzso zzso strains into two distinct and divergent zzso zzso In the absence of a specific zzso or zzso to distinguish these groups, however, they may be referred to as two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso network of zzso and zzso gene zzso as well as the comparative analysis of small zzso gene zzso suggests independent evolution of the two zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso seems to be the result of adaptation of an ancestral zzso zzso strain in a new zzso The phenomenon of adaptation to different zzso or different zzso niches in the same host, associated with high zzso and zzso rates could explain the evolution and the complex zzso of the zzso zzso A comprehensive zzso study of this zzso would be useful to properly investigate this zzso
