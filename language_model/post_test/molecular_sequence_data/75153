zzso zzso protein B zzso an embryonic zzso is a 20 zzso zzso protein which is zzso by the zzso zzso from days 12 to 22 of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso using zzso zzso on a zzso column and was subsequently zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation was then used to determine the zzso zzso acid sequence up to 45 zzso The sequence data reveal a significant zzso between zzso and bovine zzso alpha of class II: zzso of the zzso acids are identical and zzso are zzso A highly zzso region including zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso between zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso is zzso These alignments between zzso and zzso occur at the zzso of the mature proteins and proceed without zzso These results suggest that zzso is an embryonic zzso
