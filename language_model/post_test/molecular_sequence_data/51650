The human zzso type 18 zzso promoter contains a zzso responsive element zzso which zzso zzso responsiveness on a zzso zzso In the context of the zzso promoter, however, this zzso site is zzso We have identified a negative regulatory domain in the zzso promoter which zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso This negative regulatory sequence has been mapped to 44 zzso zzso We identified this element as a zzso zzso based on its ability to interfere with zzso zzso This zzso zzso domain was narrowed down further to 23 zzso the zzso element, which bears similarity to three other zzso zzso present in the mouse zzso gene upstream regulatory region, the mouse zzso gene zzso and the zzso virus zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso which zzso regulates the zzso promoter, binds to the zzso zzso with high zzso zzso of the zzso binding site leads to an enhanced activity of the zzso promoter, strongly suggesting that zzso plays an important role in controlling zzso early gene zzso
