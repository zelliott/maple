To study the control of zzso cell zzso a human negative differentiation regulator zzso gene was identified by the comparative analysis of zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the adult bone zzso fetal liver and zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed the presence of zzso in human zzso zzso cell line and zzso cells sorted from the zzso zzso zzso When fused to the green fluorescent protein zzso zzso was directed to the nucleus of mouse zzso and zzso zzso Fusion protein with a deletion from zzso 7 to 87 was detected in the zzso zzso appeared not to affect the proliferation of zzso cells when overly zzso However, its expression was zzso during zzso differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated well with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso in zzso cells inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso an zzso of the protein zzso C zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a novel function of nuclear zzso protein in regulating zzso cell zzso
