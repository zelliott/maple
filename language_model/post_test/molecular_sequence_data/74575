The zzso zzso Sylvia zzso is formally considered a zzso species, with four subspecies, European zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resumed name: zzso and North African zzso zzso They are very similar in external zzso but clearly differ in their zzso We evaluated their uncertain zzso status reconstructing the zzso and zzso relationships among populations sampled across major zzso areas in the European zzso range, using zzso sequences of the zzso zzso b gene zzso zzso zzso A variety of zzso analyses zzso led to identify four major groups, only partially corresponding to the three European nominal zzso zzso trees showed a zzso group including all zzso individuals, well zzso from all other zzso zzso zzso assigned to zzso were zzso being split into two distinct zzso zzso and southern zzso with zzso zzso closely related to southern zzso zzso of zzso and southern zzso sampled in sites of zzso in central Italy were assigned to their respective groups, with perfect zzso between zzso and genetic zzso All findings indicate that zzso should be ranked as a distinct zzso Former subspecies zzso is zzso but additional data are needed to define the zzso status of its two zzso zzso is zzso related to southern zzso and should be zzso kept as a subspecies of zzso zzso The zzso complex thus provides an interesting zzso illustrating geographical structuring across small geographical zzso and it exemplifies zzso through differentiation in zzso leading to zzso isolation after a secondary zzso
