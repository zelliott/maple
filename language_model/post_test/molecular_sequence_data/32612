The present study attempted to identify and characterize the embryonic promoter of zzso a zzso regulator of zzso zzso A common zzso start region for human and mouse zzso was initially identified, which contained a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats of zzso had a strong zzso activity both at the zzso level and in response to zzso zzso carrying the zzso reporter zzso only upon zzso zzso The zzso core zzso region zzso was then identified in the 3' half of zzso within which a zzso motif was zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso promoter, and zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso motif lost their zzso zzso zzso and nuclear extracts formed a specific complex, which was zzso by zzso zzso and in zzso translated zzso specifically bound to zzso Thus, we successfully identified the zzso promoter and its core zzso and characterized the interactions with regulatory zzso zzso
