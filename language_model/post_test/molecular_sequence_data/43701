The zzso gene encodes a zzso regulator of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Biological and zzso activities of the two putative zzso motifs of zzso were studied by analyzing zzso containing altered finger zzso The zzso zzso zzso from three previously described zzso zzso zzso were mapped and cloned by a zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed single zzso acid zzso in two of the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso to D in zzso and zzso to L in zzso which are located in the zzso zzso finger domain, reduced zzso activity by zzso and were sufficient to zzso a zzso zzso The third zzso zzso zzso zzso also contained a zzso in one of the zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso in the zzso finger domain, but this zzso alone was not sufficient to zzso a zzso zzso A second frame shift zzso was identified in zzso and is necessary for the zzso zzso In an analysis of the function of the zzso finger of zzso the zzso zzso acid zzso was zzso to zzso A zzso protein with this zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, a similar zzso in the zzso domain abolished the ability of zzso to regulate zzso zzso and greatly reduced its ability to bind target zzso
