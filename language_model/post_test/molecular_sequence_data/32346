Previous studies have shown an association between chronic zzso zzso and zzso especially the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso type 1 zzso zzso But the underlying molecular mechanisms are zzso The zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso zzso might play a role, but this hypothesis has not been zzso We here examined the zzso zzso sequences of the zzso gene in patients carrying the zzso 

zzso was isolated from the surgically zzso zzso of 2 zzso patients carrying the zzso zzso zzso and from the gastric biopsy zzso of a zzso patient carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso The entire coding region of the zzso gene was amplified by reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso The level of the zzso zzso transcript was assessed by real-time zzso chain zzso 

Alternative zzso was not associated with the zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso caused skipping of whole zzso 3, where the zzso binding site is zzso This zzso protein was predicted to consist of 63 zzso zzso deletion of zzso acid sequence from zzso 30 to 64 and shifting of reading frame at zzso acid 65 with a novel stop zzso The expression of the zzso zzso transcript was decreased to zzso of the healthy control in the zzso patient carrying the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso might represent a mechanism for zzso zzso but the zzso zzso is not associated with alternative zzso
