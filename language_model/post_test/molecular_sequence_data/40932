zzso interactions between synthetic materials and human zzso are a major concern for implants and tissue zzso The most successful approaches to circumvent this issue involve the modification of the implant or scaffold surfaces with various functional zzso such as zzso zzso or cell growth zzso To date, such techniques have relied on surface zzso methods that are often zzso only to a limited range of materials and require the presence of specific functional groups, synthetic pathways or biologically hostile zzso In this study we have used zzso motifs that have been selected to bind to gold, zzso glass and titanium to modify surfaces with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The peptides have several advantages over conventional molecular zzso zzso they require no biologically hostile environments to zzso are specific to their zzso and could be adapted to carry various active zzso We successfully imparted zzso properties to gold and platinum surfaces using zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in conjunction with zzso We also induced a zzso increase in the number and spreading of zzso cells on glass and titanium surfaces using zzso and zzso peptides in conjunction with the zzso zzso zzso The results presented here indicate that control over the extent of zzso interactions can be achieved by relatively simple and zzso surface modification procedures using zzso binding peptides as zzso zzso
