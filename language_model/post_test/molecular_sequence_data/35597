zzso zzso interacting protein 1), initially discovered as a host protein involved in zzso cell DNA transfer, is a zzso factor of the basic zzso zzso domain family that regulates several zzso genes in zzso We have developed zzso to assess zzso binding to its DNA target in zzso and zzso zzso efficiency in zzso Several point zzso in the zzso response element zzso affected the zzso activity, and a strong correlation between zzso binding and zzso zzso levels was zzso zzso zzso by zzso was influenced by bacterial and plant proteins known to interact with zzso during zzso infection, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso strongly decreased zzso zzso zzso ability, but not its binding to zzso in zzso most likely by triggering zzso degradation of zzso Finally, zzso of a zzso promoter was observed in dividing cells, probably resulting from zzso of zzso zzso
