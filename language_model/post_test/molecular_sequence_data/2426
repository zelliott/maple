zzso and zzso virus induce a zzso host reaction in zzso zzso primary mouse kidney cell zzso To define the primary effects of infection we constructed a zzso library corresponding to zzso zzso isolated shortly after onset of zzso zzso zzso By differential screening of the library we have isolated and then zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by Northern zzso zzso zzso steady state levels increased in parallel with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Since this rapid and early increase was particularly striking zzso zzso in zzso cells, we studied the molecular mechanism of induction in this zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso large zzso is required for the increase in zzso zzso zzso The results tend to exclude that this increase is due to an zzso stabilization of the zzso zzso or to an zzso stimulation of zzso of the zzso zzso they are compatible with the working hypothesis that zzso large zzso increases the efficiency of processing, possibly zzso of the zzso zzso The biological implications of these results are zzso
