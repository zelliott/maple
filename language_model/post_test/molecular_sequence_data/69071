Using an active, zzso zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and via direct zzso the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is shown to associate with the EPO zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso with zzso EPO receptors was observed initially in zzso cells labeled metabolically with zzso and association of these factors was confirmed by Western analyses of zzso zzso using zzso zzso Interestingly, this association occurred in the absence of zzso and exposure of zzso cells to EPO did not zzso affect levels of zzso zzso or overall levels of zzso zzso However, EPO was observed to zzso the rapid formation of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Through zzso expression of zzso EPO zzso forms in zzso cells, zzso for zzso association were zzso zzso of zzso forms with zzso zzso and deletions delineated a candidate zzso for zzso binding to an essential extended zzso region zzso including a putative motif for zzso zzso zzso These findings extend a zzso alignment between the EPO zzso and protein zzso zzso receptors that likewise activate zzso and expand the importance of further defining pathways to zzso zzso
