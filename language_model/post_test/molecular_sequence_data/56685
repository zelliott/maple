zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gamma are liver zzso factors that mediate the coordinate expression of a number of zzso zzso The zzso proteins share zzso zzso among themselves and with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain constitutes an zzso protein motif that recognizes its zzso DNA binding site as a zzso Additional zzso proteins are known to be required for determination events during zzso in zzso and zzso In this report, we describe the isolation of nine additional zzso zzso zzso clones from zzso tissue zzso by using both zzso zzso and a zzso chain reaction zzso Many of the zzso genes exhibit a zzso expression pattern and are transcribed in zzso other than liver, including brain, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso motif therefore comprises a large gene family of zzso factors that play a role in zzso gene regulation and zzso
