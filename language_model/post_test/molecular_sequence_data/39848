zzso zzso constitutes an attractive strategy for zzso of abundant, low-cost agricultural zzso such as wheat zzso and zzso However, to adopt such an approach, efficient zzso are required, in particular zzso To promote zzso disorganization of the complex cell wall network in wheat zzso and thus increase zzso zzso we have attempted to improve the zzso of a zzso zzso that is already moderately zzso Using a previously described engineering strategy that involves the introduction of zzso bridges, a zzso zzso displaying enhanced zzso and zzso was zzso The half life at 70 degrees C zzso zzso of zzso is zzso greater than that of the wild type zzso and its specific activity is almost doubled zzso zzso zzso Despite these improvements, zzso was zzso for use at significantly higher reaction temperatures zzso zzso degrees zzso and thus the initial objective of this study remained zzso However, unexpectedly even at the normal zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso zzso was able to zzso 50% of the wheat zzso zzso 10 points more than the wild type zzso in parallel zzso The data presented here show that this improvement is not directly linked to the increase in zzso and/or zzso but rather to other unidentified changes to zzso properties that may allow zzso to better penetrate the cell wall network in wheat zzso
