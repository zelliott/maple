The interaction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with their respective zzso can lead to cell zzso The so-called death domain, a sequence motif present in the zzso portion of the two zzso has been identified as a critical structural element involved in signal zzso that leads to zzso Here we describe several additional proteins which contain a death zzso Novel members of this family include proteins known to be implicated not only in zzso but also in zzso zzso
