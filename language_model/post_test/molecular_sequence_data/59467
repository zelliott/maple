Genes zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso of zzso libraries with zzso derived from consensus motifs of various genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso S zzso The sequence of zzso gene fragments revealed core motifs and a modular structure typical for the family of zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene was zzso and one zzso acid zzso module was zzso The cloning of zzso zzso was verified by zzso zzso and the zzso minus zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contained parts of two zzso and was highly zzso to corresponding regions of module 6 and 7 of zzso zzso zzso the localized zzso may activate the zzso acids zzso and zzso
