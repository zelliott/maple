zzso proteins of the zzso type represent a class of malleable zzso proteins that may be selected to bind diverse zzso Typically, zzso proteins containing three zzso zzso like the zzso zzso factor zzso and the human zzso factor zzso bind nine zzso base zzso To create a class of proteins that would be generally zzso to target unique sites within complex zzso we have zzso zzso modeling to design a zzso zzso that zzso two zzso zzso Two zzso proteins were created and demonstrated to bind 18 zzso zzso of DNA in a zzso zzso zzso of these proteins as zzso to zzso or repression zzso allows zzso to be specifically zzso or zzso within human zzso zzso zzso proteins should be broadly zzso as zzso zzso switches in gene therapy strategies and the development of novel transgenic plants and zzso
