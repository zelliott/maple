A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso zzso from zzso of zzso zzso zzso by five steps of zzso Its zzso was estimated to be about 26,000 by zzso The optimum pH of the zzso was zzso at 30 degrees C using zzso as a zzso The zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso acid but not by zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso B is a zzso zzso Nine sites of oxidized insulin zzso were zzso by zzso zzso B in 24 h of zzso The four zzso sites among them resembled those of zzso From the zzso of five zzso zzso the specificity of zzso zzso B was found to be approximately zzso but the preferential zzso sites were zzso charged zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso B preferred also the large zzso zzso acid zzso at the zzso position, in a similar manner to zzso The zzso terminal sequence of zzso zzso B was identical with those of zzso in regard to the conservative zzso of zzso zzso
