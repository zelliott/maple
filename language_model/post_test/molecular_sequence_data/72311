We have previously reported a 50 zzso zzso zzso expressed specifically in the chick nervous system zzso zzso Sheppard, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a novel zzso zzso in the avian nervous system, with a zzso zzso zzso Brain zzso 70 (1992) zzso and we present its molecular zzso A zzso zzso was generated following sequencing of zzso and zzso fragments derived from zzso zzso A zzso zzso clone zzso containing the zzso the entire coding sequence and a short zzso was then isolated from a chick embryonic day 18 zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence encodes a 338 zzso acid zzso containing a 31 zzso acid signal zzso at the zzso and a 19 zzso acid zzso zzso linkage sequence at the zzso The mature protein contains three zzso zzso and a zzso zzso anchor and shares significant zzso to other members of the zzso zzso including neural cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso exhibits highest sequence identity to a recently classified zzso of the zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso and zzso - classified by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Reinoso, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso membrane protein is an zzso zzso member that mediates selective zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso the zzso binding cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso membrane protein zzso suggesting that zzso is a member of this zzso zzso is expressed predominantly on the cell surface of zzso in particular zzso cell and zzso cell zzso in the zzso In zzso and zzso zzso cultures, protein expression is exclusively located at the cell zzso Despite its cell surface zzso zzso does not directly influence the outgrowth of zzso from zzso cultures from zzso to zzso chick zzso prompting the suggestion that zzso may act in later zzso zzso
