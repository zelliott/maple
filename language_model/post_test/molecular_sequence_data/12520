zzso zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso with zzso X zzso zzso that binds to the zzso zzso responsive element zzso to regulate the expression of target zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has previously been shown to consist of three imperfect zzso zzso and form two distinct complexes zzso and zzso with the nuclear extracts from zzso zzso The present study identifies another imperfect zzso motif involved in the zzso zzso process and demonstrates that these four imperfect zzso motifs constitute an unique binding site consisting of two zzso elements overlapping a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bind the two zzso elements to form C1 complex or bind zzso element to form C2 complex with a zzso zzso zzso of the HD zzso zzso with zzso proteins cannot convert the zzso C2 complex to the higher order C1 complex, suggesting that they are formed zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso of any one of these zzso motifs or zzso of the entire HD zzso into a separate zzso and zzso element significantly reduced the zzso response of HD zzso to zzso zzso The rat HD zzso zzso binds with one or two zzso zzso providing the zzso zzso signaling zzso with two levels of zzso
