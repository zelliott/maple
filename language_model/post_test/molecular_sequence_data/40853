zzso zzso constitutes a zzso for discovering novel zzso from the zzso microbial zzso From three plant zzso zzso libraries zzso a total of zzso members of zzso zzso we obtained 14 zzso zzso that exhibited zzso zzso A selected zzso zzso zzso which showed maximum zzso activity, was further zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso in zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited maximum zzso activity towards zzso zzso indicating that it is an zzso zzso zzso showed optimal activity at 35 zzso and at pH zzso The zzso and zzso values were determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso exhibited an increase in zzso activity in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso protein zzso may be a member of a novel family of zzso zzso Several hypothetical protein zzso of zzso were found in the zzso A hypothetical protein from zzso zzso zzso a close zzso of zzso displayed zzso activity when the corresponding gene was expressed in zzso zzso Our results suggest that the other hypothetical protein zzso of zzso might also be members of this novel zzso
