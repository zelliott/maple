A transient zzso zzso has been developed to zzso promoter activity in zzso cells freshly zzso from the chick central nervous zzso The zzso enabled us to identify zzso regulatory elements within the zzso region of the alpha 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso In differentiated zzso regulatory elements direct reporter gene expression to a small subset of zzso which has been identified as zzso cells, zzso to the population of zzso in which alpha 7 transcripts were localized by in zzso zzso However, these promoter elements exhibit ubiquitous activity in zzso neural cells and in zzso stem zzso Our study supports the idea that alpha 7 regulatory elements acquire their zzso specificity in the course of zzso
