Our ability to identify and eliminate zzso contamination of water, now and in the future, is essential to reduce zzso of zzso zzso zzso source tracking is a recently developed approach for identifying sources of zzso zzso zzso zzso designed by Bernhard and Field zzso zzso Field, zzso zzso A zzso zzso to discriminate human and zzso feces on the basis of host differences in zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Dick et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Brodeur, zzso Santo Domingo, zzso Simpson, zzso Walters, zzso Field, zzso zzso Host zzso of zzso zzso zzso bacteria reveal genetic markers for zzso source zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of human zzso pig zzso and zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso genetic markers were tested for their suitability in detecting zzso pollution in Saskatchewan, zzso The sensitivity and specificity of these zzso were assessed by testing eight raw human sewage samples and 265 feces from 12 different species in zzso The specificity of each primer set was zzso or zzso The accuracy of zzso and zzso to distinguish between the different species was zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso of the pig zzso zzso of the zzso zzso markers and the conventional indicator zzso coli in relation to several zzso was investigated in 70 water samples collected from different sites along the zzso River zzso zzso Human and zzso zzso markers were identified in 41 and zzso of the water samples, respectively, whereas the pig marker was never detected in the river zzso The largest zzso in zzso coli counts were zzso to the simultaneous detection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxin genes zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso were detected in 6, 7 and zzso of the water samples, zzso However, none of the zzso positive water samples were positive for the zzso coli zzso gene marker zzso zzso ratios analysis suggests that zzso may be zzso for the presence of zzso zzso in the river zzso None of the zzso indicators were able to confidently predict the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso
