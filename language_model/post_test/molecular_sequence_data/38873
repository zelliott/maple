zzso is accompanied by marked changes in the expression and presentation of various zzso at the cell zzso These zzso adjustments result from the differential expression of genes coding for the production or zzso modifications of these zzso during transformation to a particular tumor zzso In turn, tumor cells acquire distinct zzso properties which set them apart from their normal zzso zzso of zzso structures and their organization on the surface of zzso cells is a hallmark of the zzso and, most notably, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions are critical events in the zzso dissemination and invasion of cancer zzso Many zzso contacts and subsequent zzso of the tumor zzso are zzso by zzso zzso The discovery of agents that zzso these interactions or interfere with the processing of tumor associated zzso is a fervent area of research zzso This review will highlight the current status of the use of zzso compounds that are being evaluated as potential zzso zzso In addition, the use of structures based on zzso and zzso zzso will also be zzso
