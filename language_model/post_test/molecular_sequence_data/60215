A pure culture of an zzso zzso marine zzso was obtained from an zzso enrichment culture in which zzso zzso was the sole source of zzso energy, and zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso as end zzso Other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso When zzso was the sole source of carbon and energy, the zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso or nitrate zzso to zzso but did not use zzso or zzso zzso as a terminal electron zzso for zzso zzso cells had significantly lower zzso zzso activities than zzso cells had, which was consistent with the notion that zzso was not released as a result of zzso zzso bond zzso and then zzso The name zzso zzso is proposed for this zzso zzso which is zzso unusual compared to the previously described zzso bacteria by virtue of the zzso present on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was not zzso nor was zzso zzso zzso of zzso were abundant in zzso zzso This zzso shares with the other member of the zzso zzso which has been described a unique zzso deletion in the zzso zzso zzso It differs in several ways from a recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cook, zzso zzso zzso 1997) that reportedly produces zzso but not zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso thus appears to be the first example of an zzso which exhibits zzso during zzso zzso zzso for zzso sulfur in the sulfur cycle are zzso
