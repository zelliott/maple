A family of five zzso has been characterized that catalyze the formation of zzso and zzso linkages present in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We now report a new member of the family zzso involved in zzso zzso The human and mouse genes were located on zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso are found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike other members of the family, zzso showed a broad zzso expression pattern by Northern zzso zzso Although a high degree of zzso across several zzso exists among other members of the zzso family, zzso zzso did not zzso zzso or zzso zzso Instead, the zzso transferred zzso from zzso to zzso containing a terminal zzso zzso zzso This product, zzso is found in the linkage region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso is the so-called zzso II involved in zzso zzso Its identity was confirmed in zzso by zzso zzso of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso Its zzso in the zzso zzso indicates that this is the major site for assembly of the linkage zzso
