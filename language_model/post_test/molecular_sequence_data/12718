The zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes map to zzso where genetic zzso have been frequently reported in various human zzso Using the zzso chain reaction zzso we investigated the loss of these genes on primary zzso samples and cultured zzso zzso All or any of three zzso of the zzso gene were zzso zzso in 11 zzso of 31 zzso none of 9 zzso zzso and 5 zzso and in all 6 human zzso cell zzso zzso 2 of the zzso gene was zzso deleted in 4 zzso of 31 zzso but not in lower grade zzso It was zzso deleted in 5 zzso of 6 zzso cell zzso In 12 short-term cultures of cells derived from primary zzso samples, 5 zzso and 2 zzso zzso cells had zzso deletion of all or any of the three zzso of the zzso gene and zzso 2 of the zzso zzso zzso The deletion pattern of these genes in cultured cells was completely consistent with that seen in the primary zzso Furthermore, two long-term cultures retained both genes that were identical to those in the original tumor zzso Our results indicate that loss of the zzso and zzso genes may be involved in tumor progression in human zzso especially in the development of glioblastoma, that this loss may give growth advantage to the cells in culture, and that it is not the result of culture zzso
