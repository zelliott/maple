A mass zzso analysis carried out to determine the zzso of the abdominal zzso zzso in the locust species zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded a number of zzso zzso peaks, among which are zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, three novel peptides were zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An extensive mass zzso study of the central nervous system showed that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are restricted to the abdominal zzso and their zzso zzso while the zzso zzso are present only in the zzso zzso zzso comparison with the zzso genes supports a zzso gene structure zzso a zzso gene encodes the zzso that are expressed in the abdominal zzso and stored in the zzso zzso while a zzso gene encodes the zzso that are expressed in the head zzso and stored in the zzso zzso
