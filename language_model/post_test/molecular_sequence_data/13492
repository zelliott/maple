We have designed and zzso fluorescent zzso zzso having improved zzso and zzso properties by exploiting the concept of resonance zzso energy transfer zzso These zzso carry a zzso zzso at the zzso end as a common zzso donor and other zzso and zzso derivatives attached to a modified zzso within the primer sequence as zzso These zzso all have strong zzso at a common zzso wavelength zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso intensity of the zzso zzso increases as the spacing between the donor and zzso is increased, and of the zzso studied the strongest zzso was observed when the number of zzso between the donor and zzso is zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso were also found to be a function of the spacing between the donor and the zzso and zzso of the single base extension DNA fragments generated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso to zzso greater than that of the corresponding zzso labeled with only one zzso The increased zzso intensity of the zzso zzso and the substantially similar zzso of the DNA fragments generated with the four zzso zzso allow zzso DNA sequencing on a zzso zzso DNA zzso using a single laser line at zzso zzso for zzso and without applying mobility shift zzso With zzso zzso DNA as the template, a typical run with the zzso zzso on a commercial zzso provided DNA sequences with zzso accuracy in the first 500 bases using zzso less DNA template than that typically required using zzso DNA zzso
