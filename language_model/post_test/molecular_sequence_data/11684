We have previously demonstrated zzso T cell zzso dominance using a zzso zzso for the zzso length of T cell receptors belonging to a limited number of zzso zzso In this study, we have modified this approach in order to analyze more zzso the frequency of zzso in the zzso T cell subset in 25 known zzso zzso In order to assess the relative roles of genes and environment in the shaping of a zzso restricted zzso T cell repertoire, we have analyzed zzso dominance in the zzso T cell population of zzso zzso related siblings, and zzso 

zzso was assessed in the zzso T cell zzso using a multiplex zzso approach to zzso for zzso length variation across 25 different zzso zzso zzso criteria for zzso were established, and confirmed by direct sequence analysis of the zzso zzso This zzso was used to investigate the zzso T cell repertoire of 56 normal subjects, as well as six sets of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso percent of normal subjects zzso zzso zzso had evidence of zzso in the zzso T cell zzso using zzso zzso Although zzso twins frequently displayed zzso T cell zzso dominance, the overall pattern of zzso was very diverse within each twin zzso However, we occasionally observed dominant zzso T cell clones that were highly similar in sequence in both members of some twin zzso Not a single example of such similarity was observed in normal controls or zzso 

zzso of circulating zzso T cells is a characteristic feature of the human immune system; both host genetic factors and environment shape the pattern of zzso in this T cell zzso The high frequency of this phenomenon in normal subjects provides a background with which to evaluate zzso T cell zzso in the setting of infection or zzso zzso Further zzso and functional characterization of these zzso expanded T cells should provide insight into normal immune zzso
