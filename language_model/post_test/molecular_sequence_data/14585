zzso zzso can produce a variety of proteins that help this zzso and its zzso zzso zzso kill the host zzso In this report, we zzso one protein fraction from the zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso which was designated zzso By injection, zzso caused zzso zzso zzso bodies to zzso and die with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso showed that this protein was a single spot on the gel with a molecular weight of 57 zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso analysis suggested that the zzso toxin was zzso to zzso zzso has been accepted as zzso zzso however, our research revealed that zzso zzso possesses another novel function as an zzso A zzso zzso tree defined the relationship among the related species of zzso bacteria zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso and the evolution within the family zzso Thus, zzso could be a complement to zzso zzso for studying the molecular zzso of the family zzso zzso zzso activity analysis of zzso zzso larvae injected with zzso suggested that the toxin activates the PO zzso which provides an extensive defense reaction that potentially responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso
