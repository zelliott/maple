zzso zzso an interrelated group of rheumatic diseases, has been suggested to be triggered by bacterial infections prior to the development of an zzso response that causes inflammation of the spinal and peripheral zzso Because human heat shock protein 60 zzso recently renamed zzso and bacterial zzso are highly zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a mechanism of disease zzso However, previous investigations of the zzso immune response to zzso in zzso patients have lacked determination of zzso G zzso zzso and patient zzso In this study, we have focused on these parameters in a cohort of zzso zzso patients with a well-established set of clinical zzso including zzso changes and human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso against zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso samples collected from 2004 to 2006 and in 2010 and 2011 from 39 zzso zzso patients were analyzed and compared with samples from 39 healthy zzso The zzso U test and zzso matched pairs test were used to compare the zzso levels in different and paired groups, zzso P zzso zzso was considered zzso The zzso zzso correlation was used to determine correlation between zzso levels and between zzso levels and the disease zzso 

zzso levels of zzso and zzso to human zzso and zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso patients compared with healthy controls at both time zzso The zzso levels were almost constant over time for zzso whereas high levels of zzso to human zzso tended to decrease over zzso The zzso response to human zzso was predominantly of the zzso zzso and patients with high levels of zzso to this zzso had low levels of zzso indicating an inverse zzso Different zzso zzso were produced against bacterial and human zzso in the same serum sample, zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that there was no zzso 

A significant association was observed between zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso to human zzso and of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Generation of zzso to human zzso was independent of the presence of zzso to bacterial zzso No association was observed between clinical and zzso changes with zzso over zzso Altogether, such zzso do not reflect the disease activity in these zzso This study has been approved by the Regional Research Ethics Committee of Central zzso zzso
