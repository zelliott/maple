The chicken zzso zzso sequence has previously been shown to bind multiple proteins present in zzso and differentiated red blood zzso In this report the protein binding to one specific region within a hypersensitive site approximately 200 base pairs upstream of the start of zzso has been zzso in zzso Using a combination of a modified zzso gel zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso missing contact point and zzso interference techniques, two proteins were found to bind to overlapping sequences within zzso zzso upstream of the start of zzso One protein resembles the zzso factor zzso the other is a protein which binds to three regularly spaced repeats of the core sequence zzso This zzso factor was termed zzso It requires additional sequences outside the three recognition motifs for tight zzso zzso was zzso to near zzso by zzso DNA zzso The approximate molecular weight of the zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso of 110 zzso sequence binding both zzso and zzso proteins leads to a 4 to zzso increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso in chicken embryonic zzso suggesting that the zzso is likely to be one of multiple nuclear factors involved in the zzso regulation of the chicken zzso zzso
