zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso in normal growing zzso zzso but becomes noticeably zzso in response to certain conditions such as prolonged zzso Because zzso of zzso has been associated with the regulation of gene zzso DNA repair, and other critical zzso we sought to use mass zzso approaches to obtain an in depth zzso zzso for this zzso zzso zzso zzso from both growing and starved zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enrichment via zzso We confirmed five zzso sites identified previously and detected two novel sites of zzso and two novel minor sites of zzso The sequential order of zzso on zzso was deduced by using mass zzso to define the modified sites on zzso zzso zzso separated by zzso zzso Relative levels of zzso zzso on zzso isolated from growing and starved zzso were obtained using a combination of stable zzso zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso
