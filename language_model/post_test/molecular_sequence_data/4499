zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was zzso approximately zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso to yield zzso The zzso procedure included zzso exchange zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso of the zzso from the zzso column indicated a zzso value of zzso The molecular mass for the native zzso was 50 zzso however, upon zzso under zzso conditions two bands of apparent molecular mass of 29 and 20 zzso were zzso We have previously reported the presence of two separate coding sequences for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The appearance of two bands under zzso conditions suggests that, unlike other zzso this zzso could form zzso This may be the basis for zzso specificity differences between this zzso and other zzso zzso zzso and product zzso patterns are consistent with a zzso zzso The zzso for zzso and zzso were 6 zzso and 15 zzso respectively and the zzso was 15 zzso These kinetic zzso are comparable to the zzso of zzso from other zzso
