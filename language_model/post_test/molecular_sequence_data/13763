The zzso zzso determining gene zzso contains an zzso zzso DNA binding zzso By zzso a family of genes related to zzso in the zzso domain have been called zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned and characterized the human zzso gene using the partial cloning of both human and mouse zzso genes and mapped it to zzso zzso The zzso sequence is strongly zzso with the chicken zzso and is related to zzso It contains several putative zzso either zzso or zzso zzso zzso expression pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that this gene is important in the developing nervous zzso
