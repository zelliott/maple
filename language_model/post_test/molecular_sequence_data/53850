Thirty new zzso strains were isolated from an agricultural soil and from the zzso of plants grown in that zzso Using a combined molecular and zzso approach, we found that the soil zzso included zzso of organisms that differed from zzso zzso Thirteen soil and seven common bean zzso zzso strains were isolated when zzso zzso was used as zzso seven and two soil strains were isolated when zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were used as zzso and one tomato zzso strain was isolated when zzso zzso was used as zzso In soil and in the zzso depending on the prey cells used, the zzso of zzso were between 3 zzso zzso to 6 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A prey range analysis of five soil and zzso zzso zzso performed with 22 zzso species, most of which were zzso and plant zzso bacteria, revealed unique zzso patterns and differences between closely related prey zzso An approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso genes of all of the zzso strains used was obtained by zzso amplification by using a zzso primer zzso zzso and common bean zzso strains produced two and one restriction patterns for this zzso product, zzso The zzso zzso genes of three soil zzso and three zzso zzso were zzso One soil isolate belonged to the zzso zzso zzso zzso while all of the other zzso clustered with zzso zzso and formed two zzso zzso zzso zzso
