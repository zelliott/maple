Before the onset of zzso destruction, type 1 diabetic patients and an animal model, the zzso diabetic zzso zzso show zzso and functional abnormalities in target zzso which may act as inciting events for zzso zzso To better understand these zzso but without the complications associated with zzso zzso we examined genes expressed in zzso target zzso of zzso combined zzso zzso mice and of zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso genetic background may zzso them to diabetic zzso including insulin resistance in the absence of high circulating zzso levels and without zzso destruction of their beta zzso Several of these genes lie within known type 1 and 2 diabetes zzso These data suggest that the zzso mouse may be a good candidate to study an interface between type 1 and type 2 zzso
