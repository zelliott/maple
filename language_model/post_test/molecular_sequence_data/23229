zzso differentiation from mouse embryonic stem zzso cells via the formation of zzso bodies zzso has been revealed by the expression of zzso genes such as zzso and zzso It is known, however, that the visceral zzso zzso in early zzso and expresses these zzso zzso Thus, it remains unclear whether zzso cells are capable of zzso into zzso derived from definitive zzso in zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso mouse were found to express many zzso zzso Among the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso gene that was not expressed in the zzso zzso zzso was induced in developing zzso and zzso differentiation was zzso observed in the developing zzso in attached culture as compared to those in suspension zzso zzso zzso factor permitted the differentiation of visceral zzso but inhibited the expression of zzso genes and the zzso differentiation in cultured zzso zzso cells expressing green fluorescent protein zzso under the control of the zzso zzso showed that cultured zzso contained zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso cells can differentiate in zzso into zzso derived from definitive zzso
