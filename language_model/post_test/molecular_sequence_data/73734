In the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso we have previously reported the presence of two different proteins with zzso zzso activity: zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso zzso In this work we show that expression of both the zzso and zzso genes is subjected to zzso regulation in response to changes in nitrogen zzso Northern zzso experiments and zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso gene is highly transcribed in zzso or zzso cells and exhibits two- to zzso expression in zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso gene is highly expressed only under nitrogen zzso zzso of both zzso calculated after addition of zzso or ammonium to zzso cells, were not significantly different zzso or zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso respectively, for zzso zzso suggesting that changes in transcript stability are not involved in the regulation of the expression of both zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso upstream regions were used to zzso the promoter and the regulatory sequences of both zzso zzso extension analysis showed that structure of the zzso gene promoter resembles those of the zzso zzso In addition, mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein binds to the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso extension also revealed the existence of a sequence related to the zzso binding site upstream from the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso failed to bind to this zzso These findings suggest that an additional modification of zzso or an additional factor is required for the regulation of zzso gene zzso
