zzso of zzso on zzso cells from human fetal liver zzso zzso blood zzso and bone zzso zzso was studied with a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for human zzso was demonstrated by zzso of a zzso zzso and the sequence of a zzso that was cloned by zzso of zzso cells zzso with a zzso library derived from a zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso expression is restricted to, an average, zzso of FL, zzso and zzso cells, and binding to these cell types is essentially restricted to a very small subset of zzso cells and approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were further characterized as zzso and zzso zzso When zzso cells were sorted on the basis of zzso zzso the majority of zzso cells were recovered in the zzso zzso whereas the majority of cells capable of producing zzso colonies after 5-8 zzso of long-term culture zzso culture initiating zzso were recovered in the zzso zzso In addition to zzso cells, zzso was found to be expressed on a zzso very small number zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso and peripheral blood that were further characterized as zzso zzso zzso The restricted expression of zzso on primitive zzso cells is in agreement with a previous report zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso expression was used to enrich for primitive zzso cells from fetal zzso Compared with those previous studies, we found zzso expression on a larger proportion of zzso cells zzso in our study zzso zzso in Baum et zzso and zzso performed studies on zzso expression on zzso cells from zzso FL, and zzso in relation to markers that are known to be zzso expressed on zzso zzso Taken together our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso is an attractive tool for further studies on the biology and zzso of human stem zzso
