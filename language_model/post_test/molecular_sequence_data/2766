DNA amplification by the zzso chain reaction zzso is a method capable of producing a selective and very high enrichment of a specific DNA zzso Hence it seems to be useful in various fields from basic research to clinical zzso In order to zzso zzso we assembled for a very low cost a mechanical system designed to carry a test tube holder successively in three zzso baths set at the required temperatures for the zzso Two examples of the use of this machine are zzso zzso amplification of DNA of a particular zzso of acute intermittent zzso zzso the detection of the zzso zzso message found in chronic zzso leukemia zzso
