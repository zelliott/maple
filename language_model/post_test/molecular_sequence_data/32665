The sorting zzso zzso constitute a large group of zzso zzso proteins that play critical roles in protein zzso We report here the solution structure of human sorting zzso 22 zzso Although zzso has zzso sequence identity with any zzso domain protein of known structure, it was found to contain the zzso fold and compact structural core characteristic of zzso zzso Analysis of the backbone dynamics of zzso by zzso relaxation zzso revealed that the two walls of the zzso binding zzso undergo internal zzso on the zzso zzso for the zzso loop and on the zzso to zzso zzso for the loop between the zzso motif and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure that differ from those of other zzso zzso include the loop connecting strands zzso and zzso and the loop connecting zzso zzso and zzso which appear to be more mobile than corresponding zzso in other known zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with zzso was investigated by an zzso zzso experiment, which identified the binding site in a basic zzso and indicated that zzso binding leads only to a local structural zzso as has been found with other zzso zzso Because motions in the zzso are zzso out when zzso zzso zzso effects could contribute to the lower affinity of zzso for this zzso compared to other zzso zzso
