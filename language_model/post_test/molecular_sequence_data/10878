Mouse kidney zzso zzso is the key zzso for the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that contains the zzso zzso zzso at its zzso zzso The expression of this zzso in the kidney is zzso it is expressed in zzso but not zzso zzso and a single zzso gene zzso is responsible for this zzso We report here the zzso sequence that encodes the kidney zzso of zzso mice, which possess a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence exhibits zzso identity to that of human core 2 zzso which suggests that kidney zzso is a mouse zzso of human core 2 zzso zzso The zzso zzso is expressed abundantly in the zzso but was not detected in other zzso zzso or in the zzso of zzso mice by Northern zzso zzso In addition, we were able to clone and sequence another zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The two sequences differ only in their zzso zzso The zzso zzso type of zzso was detected in various zzso of zzso mice by reverse zzso chain reaction, which indicates that the zzso zzso type is ubiquitous and that its expression is not regulated by the zzso zzso zzso obtained using the long accurate zzso chain reaction method indicate that the zzso gene is approximately 45 zzso long, and the order of the zzso from the zzso is zzso 1 of the kidney type, zzso 1 of the ubiquitous type, zzso 2, and zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 are present in both zzso and the translated region is in zzso zzso These data suggest that the expression of zzso is regulated by an alternative zzso mechanism and also probably by zzso enhancers and that zzso regulates the expression of zzso only in the zzso
