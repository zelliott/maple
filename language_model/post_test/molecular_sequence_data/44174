In order to study the mechanisms by which zzso function is zzso human zzso zzso zzso was cloned into a zzso virus zzso and the expressed zzso protein was used to investigate binding of the zzso by cellular proteins from a zzso expression library from human zzso One protein that bound zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso with DNA zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso from zzso zzso cell zzso (but not from zzso zzso cell zzso by an zzso to zzso zzso and zzso This binding was shown to occur without a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and adjacent zzso liver zzso from ten patients were studied to determine the level of expression of zzso II and zzso zzso zzso II proteins were detected by western zzso in six of ten zzso zzso including several in which presumed zzso zzso was detected by zzso No zzso II expression was zzso in the ten zzso liver zzso from the same patients or in a sample of normal human zzso
