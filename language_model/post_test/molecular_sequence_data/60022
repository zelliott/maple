zzso zzso were raised against synthetic peptides or zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have sequences similar to zzso and animal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso and zzso among the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso detected in zzso zzso after native zzso while zzso zzso reacted with zzso and zzso The zzso specifically recognized by each zzso was collected as the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso From the zzso acid sequences and molecular masses of the zzso zzso it was revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso were the products of zzso and zzso zzso zzso masses of the native forms of zzso zzso and zzso were estimated as approximately zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso consisting of zzso and zzso products, respectively, and that zzso is a zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
