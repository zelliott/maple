Comparative CD zzso were made on the model zzso peptides zzso and zzso in which X represents a zzso zzso zzso The former zzso contains three potential zzso i + 4 complementary zzso pairs at neutral zzso while the latter zzso contains one potential complementary and two potential zzso zzso i + 4 zzso zzso The effect of pH and zzso strength on the mean zzso zzso of these peptides was measured at 222 zzso and 0 degrees zzso These zzso were analyzed assuming a common two-state zzso transition and only zzso zzso + 4 zzso zzso The analyses suggest that the central zzso pairs do zzso zzso content while the peripheral zzso pairs do not, presumably due to the location of the peripheral zzso pairs in the frayed ends of the zzso The complementary central zzso pair zzso the zzso by about zzso zzso and the zzso central zzso pair zzso the zzso by about zzso zzso
