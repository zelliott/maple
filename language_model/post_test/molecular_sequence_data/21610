A novel zzso zzso was isolated from the forest soil of zzso University zzso Through zzso zzso sequence matching and zzso observation it was identified as zzso zzso zzso This strain can zzso a broad range of cellulosic zzso zzso zzso cellulose zzso zzso zzso zzso filter paper and rice straw by producing a large amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso culture conditions zzso zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso production of the zzso zzso were zzso The activity of zzso and zzso zzso produced by this strain was mainly present zzso and the zzso production was dependent on the cellulosic zzso used for the zzso Effect of zzso conditions and metal zzso on the zzso zzso production were systematically zzso The zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso have an optimal temperature of zzso and pH of zzso These zzso also have high zzso as evidenced by retaining zzso activity at zzso and pH of zzso and zzso by retaining zzso of the activity at pH 10 and zzso after zzso The efficiency of zzso conversion of the zzso rice straw by zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of theoretical ethanol zzso
