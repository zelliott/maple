A method is described for cloning large fragments zzso zzso to 2 zzso of dengue virus zzso from zzso viral zzso Aedes zzso cells zzso zzso infected with dengue virus contain zzso zzso zzso molecules which were used as a template for an initial reverse zzso using a primer containing sequence zzso to regions of the zzso at or near the 3' end of the gene being zzso The product was then used as a template for zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using the same 3' primer and a second which zzso to a region at the zzso end of the sequence to be zzso Both zzso were engineered to contain specific restriction zzso cutting sites which enabled the zzso product to be cut and cloned directly into plasmids for sequencing and expression zzso We have used this method to construct clones of the envelope zzso gene zzso and the zzso genes 1 and zzso zzso and 3 zzso of dengue type 2, zzso 1974 strain, and E and zzso from dengue type 3, zzso strain, either as discrete genes or as zzso with long and short leader zzso with or without anchor zzso The method could be applied to the cloning of any gene from any zzso directly from infected cell zzso without the necessity for tedious virus zzso zzso
