A defective form of the zzso B virus has been found in a patient with chronic type B zzso zzso analysis of the viral DNA after zzso chain reaction amplification revealed a zzso pair deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso This deletion includes the initiation zzso of the zzso region and a newly created zzso stop zzso in the zzso region zzso zzso located 230 base pairs downstream from the zzso initiation zzso This virus zzso with the zzso virus during the zzso period, as evidenced by an zzso of serum zzso zzso It was not detected in the stable period, and the blood chemistry results were zzso We zzso zzso against the zzso region by zzso zzso in serial serum samples to clarify the mechanism of the emergence of this zzso zzso zzso against the zzso region were zzso however, the zzso response against the zzso zzso coincided with the appearance of the zzso zzso These findings suggest that an activated zzso and zzso response had developed against the zzso region during zzso inflammation in this patient and that, consequently, selection occurred for a zzso zzso zzso strain of the virus that might be resistant to such an immune zzso
