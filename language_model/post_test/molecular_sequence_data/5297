The initiation of zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso requires the gene products of twist and zzso In either zzso the zzso cell zzso during zzso is blocked and no zzso tissue is zzso One of the functions of Snail is to repress zzso genes and restrict their expressions to the lateral zzso The zzso of the zzso genes into the zzso region in snail zzso is a possible cause of defects in zzso and in zzso zzso To investigate such possibility, we zzso a series of snail zzso zzso We found that different zzso genes respond differently in various snail zzso zzso Due to the differential response of target zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso that has reduced Snail function showed an intermediate zzso In V2 zzso zzso zzso such as single-minded and zzso are zzso while zzso zzso proceeds zzso However, the differentiation of these zzso cells into zzso lineage is zzso The results suggest that the establishment of zzso cell fate requires the proper restriction of zzso zzso while the zzso cell movement is independent of the expression patterns of these zzso Together with the data showing that the expression of some zzso genes disappear in snail zzso we propose that Snail may repress or activate another set of target genes that are required specifically for zzso
