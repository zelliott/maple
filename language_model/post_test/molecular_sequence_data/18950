A zzso expression library was created from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently screened for zzso zzso zzso activities, resulting in seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence lengths of the seven zzso zzso open reading frames zzso ranged from 260 to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of between zzso and zzso zzso The highest sequence identity scores for the seven zzso against the zzso database were between 45 and 59 % to a number of zzso zzso zzso The seven zzso primary structures contained sequence motifs that zzso well with a classical zzso zzso zzso zzso signature motif which zzso the zzso zzso zzso in other zzso zzso Six of the seven zzso genes were successfully expressed zzso in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso exhibited temperature zzso range of zzso zzso and the pH zzso of between zzso and zzso The zzso ratios for the six zzso zzso showed the following order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All six zzso showed poor conversion rates against zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which lacked the zzso zzso group zzso on the aromatic ring of the zzso zzso zzso the requirement for at least one zzso group on the aromatic ring of the zzso acid zzso zzso for optimal zzso zzso
