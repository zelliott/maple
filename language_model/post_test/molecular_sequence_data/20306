To determine whether circulation of dairy wastewater zzso the growth of zzso purple sulfur bacteria zzso 

Two dairy wastewater lagoons that were similar in size, geographic location, number and type of cattle loading the lagoons were zzso The only obvious visual difference between them was that one was stagnant and the water was brown in zzso zzso 1), and the other was circulated and the water was red in zzso because of the presence of zzso that contained zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso were sampled monthly for 3 months and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso After this point, zzso were placed in the wastewater zzso on Farm 1, and samples were taken monthly for 9 months and zzso for zzso and zzso Before the installation of zzso no zzso zzso zzso sequences or zzso were observed in the wastewater from Farm 1; however, both were observed in the wastewater from Farm zzso After the installation of zzso statistically greater levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were observed in the wastewater from Farm zzso 

Circulation enhances the growth of zzso in dairy zzso zzso AND zzso OF THIS zzso Because zzso zzso zzso and volatile organic acids zzso as an electron source for photosynthesis, and zzso and alcohols as a carbon source for growth, the increase in these bacteria should reduce zzso volatile organic compounds and alcohol emissions from the lagoons, enhancing the air quality in dairy farming zzso
