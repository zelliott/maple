We have developed a rapid and highly sensitive method for the detection of zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso in the presence of zzso copies of the zzso zzso This sensitivity is achieved by selective amplification of zzso zzso zzso using a zzso procedure with modified zzso In the first stage, zzso consist of zzso sequences in the 3' portion and zzso sequence (to minimize zzso with human zzso on the zzso zzso The 3' portion also consists of mismatch sequence that generates an zzso site in normal, but not zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso Thus, following the first round of 20 cycles, restriction zzso zzso is carried out to selectively digest normal zzso zzso 12 zzso To enrich zzso zzso a second amplification is performed using tail zzso that recognize the zzso but not human zzso This design ensures that in the second amplification only zzso zzso that were zzso in the first round would serve as template for this zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso of second-stage zzso product that has been zzso with zzso is used to monitor the presence of zzso zzso detected at sensitivity of zzso This technique offers high sensitive detection of zzso zzso zzso using a new concept of zzso design and is likely to assist in identifying patients at risk to develop zzso zzso or lung cancer, which harbor high zzso of zzso zzso zzso
