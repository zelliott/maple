zzso of zzso zzso 8 and 18 zzso and other intermediate filament proteins results in their reorganization in zzso and in zzso In order to study functional aspects of human zzso zzso we generated and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso that specifically recognizes a major zzso site zzso of human zzso but not zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments followed by zzso and zzso mapping of in zzso zzso zzso indicated that the overall zzso turnover rate is faster for zzso versus zzso and that zzso of zzso is a highly dynamic zzso zzso zzso focusing of zzso labeled zzso followed by zzso with zzso showed that the major zzso zzso species contain zzso zzso but that some zzso molecules exist that are zzso zzso on zzso sites other than zzso zzso of total cell zzso obtained from cells at different stages of the cell cycle showed that zzso zzso increases three to fourfold during the S and zzso zzso of the cell zzso zzso zzso of cells at different stages of zzso using zzso or other zzso that recognize the total zzso pool, resulted in preferential binding of the zzso zzso to the reorganized zzso zzso zzso of human zzso or zzso from transgenic mice that express human zzso showed that the zzso zzso species are located zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in the liver and zzso respectively, but no preferential zzso was noted in other simple zzso zzso zzso Our results support a model zzso zzso intermediate filaments are localized in specific cellular zzso depending on the tissue type and zzso of zzso In addition, zzso of human zzso is a highly dynamic zzso site that zzso zzso during the S and zzso zzso of the cell cycle in association with filament zzso
