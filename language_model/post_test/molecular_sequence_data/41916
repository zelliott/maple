zzso levels of zzso are regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso may play an important role in modulating the function of these zzso The recent demonstration that zzso is localized to the zzso zzso zzso et zzso Cell zzso 1992) is consistent with this zzso In this study we have examined the zzso distribution of zzso in a zzso cell line zzso Using indirect zzso we have shown that this zzso is distributed differently from zzso and is mainly concentrated in the zzso region of these zzso
