zzso zzso is a candidate for the zzso resistance gene zzso zzso analysis of human zzso was undertaken to determine its role in zzso 

A zzso artificial zzso carrying zzso was zzso and positive clones zzso The zzso start site was mapped using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso zzso analysis was used to map zzso 

zzso spans zzso and has 15 zzso zzso a 550 zzso acid protein showing zzso identity zzso zzso with zzso Two zzso zzso sites occur in zzso 2 zzso the zzso rich zzso binding domain, and in zzso zzso zzso sequence similarities zzso and zzso were observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso especially within putative functional zzso zzso 6 zzso the second zzso spanning domain, site of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 11 zzso a zzso transport zzso No zzso comparable to the zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso initiation site mapped 148 zzso zzso of the zzso initiation zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence contained putative promoter region zzso 6 zzso response zzso 3 zzso 3 zzso zzso B binding sites and 1 zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso core motifs for the zzso zzso zzso factor were identified, two combining with imperfect zzso sites to create zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso boxes were zzso A possible zzso element containing the zzso forming zzso repeat zzso was zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and was used to map zzso to zzso 

This analysis provides important resources to study the role of zzso in human zzso
