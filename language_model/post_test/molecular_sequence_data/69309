To analyze the mechanism of the cell zzso expression of rat zzso II type zzso zzso zzso zzso we isolated the zzso of the gene and identified multiple positive and negative regulatory sequences that regulate its zzso zzso extension and zzso mapping identified a zzso initiation site at 33 zzso zzso base pairs zzso downstream of zzso zzso The zzso activities of various zzso zzso of the zzso gene upstream region, fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined using rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso zzso predominantly or zzso cells expressing zzso and very small amounts of zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence contained at least three positive zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were active in the tested three cells, and zzso was functional only in zzso and zzso zzso In addition to these positive zzso there was negative element, zzso zzso to zzso which was active only in zzso zzso These zzso when zzso with the zzso fusion zzso had competitive effects against its promoter zzso The present study suggests the presence of multiple zzso factors that act on these positive and negative zzso elements and regulate the cell zzso expression of the rat zzso zzso
