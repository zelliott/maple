Two types of the fast skeletal zzso heavy chain zzso genes were cloned from a zzso DNA library of carp zzso zzso zzso and named zzso and zzso which showed the sequence similarity to the zzso zzso predominantly expressed in carp zzso to 10 and 30 degrees C, zzso The zzso region of about 3 zzso in size each from zzso and zzso contained various zzso to bind to zzso regulatory factors such as zzso family and zzso zzso factor 2 zzso family zzso To zzso functional regions responsible for the zzso gene expression in a zzso manner, a series of deletion zzso were prepared from the zzso region, inserted upstream the zzso gene in a commercially available zzso and injected into the zzso fast muscle of carp zzso to 10 and 30 degrees zzso The sequence of zzso to zzso zzso with the zzso activity in zzso was identified as an zzso binding zzso While the activity given by a sequence of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso contained only a zzso box, that of the activity of the zzso zzso construct from zzso was markedly higher in carp reared at 10 degrees C than fish reared at 30 degrees zzso On the other hand, no zzso zzso regulation was observed for zzso even with the full-length construct of zzso zzso The DNA zzso of zzso to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso binding site in zzso zzso with nuclear proteins extracted from carp fast skeletal muscle as revealed by zzso mobility shift zzso The signal intensity of a complex formed between the DNA zzso of zzso and nuclear extracts from the 10 degrees zzso carp were higher than those with extracts from the 30 degrees zzso zzso Although zzso site in zzso could form complex with nuclear extracts from the 30 degrees zzso zzso the same or stronger signals were detected in complex formed with extracts from the 10 degrees zzso zzso
