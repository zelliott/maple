We have applied the arbitrarily primed zzso chain reaction zzso technique to the analysis of the relationships among six zzso and zzso zzso and four wild species of zzso Chosen were four zzso of arbitrary sequence that gave multiple amplification products when rice DNA was used as zzso Among a total of 50 bands zzso 44 were zzso which was sufficient to distinguish the species used in this zzso It is apparent from the comparisons of genetic distances that cultivated rice zzso zzso exhibits closest molecular affinity to wild zzso zzso suggesting that the origin of cultivated rice is from zzso zzso In a zzso of cultivated rice and zzso zzso from different regions, zzso and zzso rice were most closely clustered with zzso zzso from China and India, zzso zzso and zzso subspecies showed closer affinity with zzso zzso from different origins than with each other, supporting a hypothesis of zzso of the origin of rice zzso
