Very poor feather development has been observed in chickens of the zzso strain, originating from zzso The wing of the newly hatched chick does not show any primary or covert zzso this zzso will be referred to as zzso zzso zzso As adults, chickens are feathered but tail feathers are short and zzso An experimental population was set up at the National Institute of zzso Research zzso zzso from one zzso male and four zzso zzso zzso observations did not support the hypothesis of a zzso dominant mode of inheritance for the zzso zzso A restriction zzso length zzso zzso study using five restriction zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso specific for the zzso viral locus zzso showed the presence of the expected 3' junction fragments for the zzso occupied site but failed to reveal the expected zzso junction fragments for zzso in zzso zzso The unoccupied site corresponded to the zzso unoccupied repeat zzso of type a zzso A deletion in the zzso region of the zzso and of the zzso site was indicated by the zzso analysis and confirmed by a zzso zzso zzso were designed in order to amplify a zzso junction zzso specific to the modified zzso found in the zzso zzso The sequence of this amplified product showed that the deletion started zzso zzso upstream of the zzso site of zzso and ended within the pol gene of the viral zzso This deletion represents a new zzso zzso at the zzso zzso site zzso zzso that appears insufficient to produce a complete zzso Current data do not show a clear zzso relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso The presence of zzso may be required but is not in itself sufficient to obtain the zzso zzso The genetic relationships between zzso and the altered zzso zzso of zzso chickens will be investigated further in families segregating for the zzso zzso using the zzso zzso test developed as part of this zzso
