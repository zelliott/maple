A search for zzso zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso revealed the presence of two distinct zzso spaced zzso zzso acids apart, toward the zzso regions of these zzso Each of the two common motifs contains an zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso The zzso zzso function in diverse zzso including the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso of microbial zzso yet they have a common reaction mechanisms, which requires the binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso The two regions of zzso and specifically the identical zzso potentially represent functionally important sites related to their zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso function in the zzso site of these zzso zzso zzso was prevented by the presence of zzso but not by the zzso zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso in the zzso motifs may function as zzso zzso
