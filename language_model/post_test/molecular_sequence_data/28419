The zzso acid zzso of spinach zzso zzso delta are identified which are accessible and thus exposed within the zzso structure of the zzso complex on the zzso zzso Two types of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso described in the previous publication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were separated by virtue of their different affinity to zzso zzso and used for specific analysis of the products of zzso zzso of delta in zzso zzso delta in zzso zzso within the zzso zzso complex on the zzso is not susceptible to zzso by zzso M and zzso but is shortened by about 1 zzso by zzso Y and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso on delta reacting with the zzso zzso from serum zzso is lost after these zzso treatments and therefore situated on zzso zzso Since zzso destroys this zzso only after prolonged incubation and with at least 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of delta probably is zzso in zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso of spinach zzso zzso delta is exposed on the zzso zzso with the zzso face directed to the outside, and that zzso delta starts to be zzso within the zzso structure of the zzso zzso complex between zzso and zzso The zzso face of the zzso zzso may be part of the binding surface towards zzso zzso from serum zzso inhibit the PMS zzso zzso zzso by reacting with zzso zzso of zzso
