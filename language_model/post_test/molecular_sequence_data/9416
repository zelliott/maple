As zzso of zzso zzso A zzso statins have zzso zzso effects, such as zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the short-term beneficial effects of statins on modulating the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso cells zzso Human zzso vein zzso were treated with zzso for 30 zzso or 2 zzso zzso proteins were isolated and examined by quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso of identified proteins in zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were associated with inflammation and cell zzso Among proteins verified by Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso protein 46 zzso showed increased level in zzso zzso with zzso Further, zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso as shown by reduced zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and zzso experiments revealed that zzso increased the association of zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso assembly with its regulatory zzso such as zzso and zzso Our results reveal a novel zzso role of zzso by promoting the membrane zzso of zzso and its binding with zzso to inhibit zzso activity in zzso which may offer another insight into the zzso functions of zzso
