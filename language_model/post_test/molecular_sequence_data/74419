zzso of the zzso disease resistance genes zzso identified in plants zzso zzso binding site zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso zzso have only been isolated on a limited scale from sunflower zzso zzso zzso and most of the previously identified zzso are members of two large zzso clusters harboring zzso zzso zzso We zzso the sunflower zzso database and used comparative zzso approaches to develop a deeper understanding of the diversity and distribution of zzso zzso in the sunflower zzso zzso 630 zzso zzso were identified, 88 by mining a database of zzso sunflower zzso and zzso by sequencing zzso zzso DNA zzso isolated from common and wild sunflower zzso DNA markers were developed from 196 unique zzso sequences and facilitated genetic mapping of 167 zzso zzso The latter were distributed throughout the sunflower zzso in 44 clusters or zzso Wild species zzso were a particularly rich source of novel zzso zzso many of which were tightly linked to previously mapped zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA sequence and mapping resources described here should facilitate the discovery and isolation of zzso zzso guarding sunflower from a broad spectrum of economically important zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid sequences have been deposited in zzso under zzso numbers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
