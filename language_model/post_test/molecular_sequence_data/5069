In an attempt to characterize a zzso of which the expression is zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library constructed from zzso zzso of zzso or zzso guinea zzso On Northern zzso analysis, three transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso encodes four direct repeats of the 76 zzso acid zzso sequence with seven additional zzso zzso zzso at the zzso The transcript zzso appears to comprise more than five repeats of the zzso zzso The zzso encodes a zzso zzso fused to an 80 zzso acid extension exhibiting zzso zzso acid sequence identity to the human zzso zzso The zzso gene was expressed zzso The zzso zzso levels decreased under zzso conditions, and increased under zzso conditions, whereas zzso zzso remained zzso at low levels under the feeding conditions used zzso
