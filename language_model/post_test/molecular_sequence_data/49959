Type I zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that are organized into zzso each of which minimally contains a zzso zzso an zzso zzso and an zzso carrier zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster from zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso six zzso zzso none of which contain the zzso AT zzso The only AT activity identified within the zzso gene cluster is a discrete AT protein zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso in zzso showed that it efficiently and specifically loaded zzso zzso to all six zzso zzso These findings unveiled a previously unknown zzso architecture that is characterized by a zzso zzso acting AT protein that loads the zzso units in trans to zzso zzso type I zzso proteins for zzso zzso This zzso structure provides opportunities for zzso engineering as exemplified by zzso zzso to improve zzso zzso
