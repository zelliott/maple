zzso is a zzso hormone which is produced by the zzso of zzso and controls the blood zzso level in the human zzso zzso modification of human zzso using zzso and zzso B generally causes high zzso of insulin zzso leading to more complicated zzso zzso A simple method including zzso and zzso in the zzso modification process was developed for the reduction of a major zzso zzso human zzso zzso of zzso g zzso zzso per g protein into the reaction solution led to the zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso and reduction of relative zzso insulin content from zzso to zzso After the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso and restored by adjusting pH to 2-3 at 25 degrees zzso Combination of hydrogen zzso addition and zzso of zzso expressed in zzso zzso coli remarkably improved the conversion yield of insulin from zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocked the unexpected zzso of human zzso by zzso minimized the formation of zzso insulin and hence increased the production yield of active zzso
