The objective of these studies was to test the hypothesis that proteins that contain potential zzso recognition sequences zzso in their zzso domain can bind to the zzso zzso zzso carrier lipids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A number of zzso and zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso to be the active zzso binding zzso To study this problem, we first determined the zzso structure of a zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso generated distance constraints derived from nuclear zzso enhancement and zzso angle constraints derived from zzso zzso were used for restrained molecular dynamics and energy zzso zzso zzso models of the zzso zzso were built based on calculations of energy zzso using the zzso program zzso zzso models of zzso zzso and zzso were built based on our zzso zzso nuclear zzso enhancement zzso zzso results and refined by energy zzso with respect to all atoms using the zzso zzso modeling with energy zzso force zzso Our energy zzso studies were carried out on a zzso model of zzso that was originally derived from zzso X-ray scattering and molecular mechanics zzso These results revealed that the zzso are zzso nearly identical zzso zzso with their three zzso arranged in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides in the presence of zzso confirmed a highly specific interaction and identified key contact zzso acids in the zzso zzso that constituted a binding motif for interacting with the zzso These studies also showed that subtle zzso changes occurred within both the zzso and the zzso zzso after zzso zzso structures of the resulting molecular complexes revealed that each zzso could bind more than one zzso zzso These studies thus represent the first evidence for a direct physical interaction between specific contact zzso acids in the zzso peptides and the zzso and supports the hypothesis of a zzso role for the zzso The central idea is that these zzso may serve as a structural scaffold to organize and stabilize in functional zzso zzso proteins within zzso complexes that participate in zzso and zzso zzso
