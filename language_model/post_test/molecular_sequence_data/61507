Two novel human zzso zzso zzso class II zzso have been identified in routine typing of bone zzso donors for the Australian Bone zzso zzso zzso in Sydney, zzso zzso analysis of zzso 2 of both the zzso and zzso genes revealed the novel zzso A silent substitution of G to A at zzso position 210 has been identified for the zzso zzso when compared to the closest matched zzso zzso There is no associated zzso acid difference between the translated products of the two zzso The second new zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified with three zzso zzso compared to the closest matched zzso zzso There is a silent zzso at zzso position zzso G to C and two zzso at adjacent zzso positions 344 and 345, T to G and G to zzso zzso The latter two zzso result in an zzso acid change from zzso to zzso at position 86, implicating a different specificity and affinity of zzso zzso
