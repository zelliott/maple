The analysis of pea zzso promoter sequence showed that zzso was necessary for the control of zzso gene expression by zzso zzso a zzso protein that interacts with zzso in zzso is a good candidate for being a zzso molecular switch controlling gene zzso However, the relationship between zzso activity and zzso gene zzso still remains zzso Because no marked de zzso synthesis was detected after light treatment, light may induce zzso modifications of zzso such as zzso or zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso of zzso can be zzso by various zzso zzso activities in zzso Whereas zzso by zzso zzso II had no apparent effect on zzso DNA zzso zzso by zzso zzso II zzso increased the binding activity zzso Mass zzso analyses of the zzso zzso showed that amongst the 6 potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso and zzso are heavily zzso zzso of zzso altered at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso can account for most of the stimulation of zzso activity by zzso indicating that this zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso We further showed that nuclear zzso zzso activity to zzso was reduced by treatment with calf zzso zzso in extracts prepared from zzso plants but not from zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso may act as a molecular switch modulated by zzso zzso and zzso in response to light zzso
