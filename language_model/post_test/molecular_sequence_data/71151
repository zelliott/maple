The zzso promoter of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is expressed at high level along the growth zzso This zzso is dependent on the positive regulator zzso activated by zzso The zzso factor zzso 38 is required for expression in early stationary phase and zzso To test whether zzso 70 was involved in zzso zzso in exponential phase, we have followed zzso synthesis in a zzso zzso zzso No difference in zzso zzso was found between the wild type and the zzso strain at the restrictive temperature of 42 degrees C, indicating that zzso was independent of the zzso factor zzso zzso However, zzso levels of zzso expression from zzso in this strain in exponential phase were more than twofold higher at 42 degrees C, suggesting involvement of zzso 32 in zzso zzso In a zzso background, no expression of zzso took place in the exponential phase, whereas it increased during stationary phase, and in a zzso zzso double zzso no activity from the zzso promoter was detected along the growth zzso We have shown that the increase in the amount of zzso 32 factor necessary for zzso in exponential phase is provided through induction of the heat shock response by the presence of the zzso zzso which is also required for zzso of the positive regulator zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso zzso is achieved through a switch between two zzso factors, zzso 32 in exponential phase and zzso 38 in stationary zzso In both cases, zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso and presents the same zzso start zzso
