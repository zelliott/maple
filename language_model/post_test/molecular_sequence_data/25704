Chemical modification studies provide evidence that zzso zzso can form stable zzso triple zzso Two zzso of opposite polarity were zzso each composed of a zzso hairpin stem linked to a zzso sequence which is capable of folding back on the hairpin stem and forming specific zzso hydrogen zzso Using zzso zzso as a chemical modification zzso we have found that two zzso of sequence composition type zzso and zzso undergo dramatic structural changes consistent with zzso DNA zzso formation induced by lowering the pH or raising the zzso zzso The zzso DNA triple zzso is sensitive to base zzso
