The zzso family of zzso factors are found throughout the animal kingdom and are important in a variety of zzso zzso Genome analysis has identified 20 Sox genes in human and zzso which can be subdivided into 8 groups, based on sequence comparison and zzso zzso Most of the zzso groups identified in zzso are represented by a single zzso sequence in zzso model organisms, suggesting a zzso and divergence mechanism has operated during zzso zzso We have now zzso the Sox gene complement in the zzso zzso zzso in order to shed further light on the diversity and origins of the Sox gene zzso Major differences were found between the Sox family in zzso and those in humans and zzso In particular, zzso does not have zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which appear to be specific to zzso while zzso found in zzso and zzso but absent in zzso seems to be specific to zzso Six zzso Sox genes are represented by two copies each in zzso indicating a large-scale gene zzso in the fish zzso These findings point to recent Sox gene loss, zzso and divergence occurring during the evolution of zzso and zzso zzso and provide further evidence for large-scale zzso or a zzso zzso occurring early in the radiation of zzso
