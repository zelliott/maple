zzso arthritis zzso represents a zzso disease characterized by chronic zzso Most patients with adult zzso inherit zzso or zzso major zzso complex zzso zzso While the molecular basis for this genetic predisposition is unknown, the major function of these zzso molecules is to present peptides to T zzso It is hypothesized that an zzso or environmental zzso zzso a zzso immune response zzso by T zzso which is followed by a chronic inflammatory reaction involving many cell zzso In chronic zzso previous or ongoing zzso zzso might result in zzso skewing of the peripheral zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate a marked expansion of V alpha zzso zzso T cells in the peripheral blood zzso zzso range, zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso A major proportion of these patients shared zzso in addition to the expected high frequency zzso and zzso zzso zzso molecular analysis in three of the zzso patients with elevated V alpha zzso T cells identified repeated zzso alpha chain sequences consistent with zzso V alpha zzso T cell zzso In addition to shared zzso V alpha zzso zzso gene usage among unrelated subjects, a zzso J alpha motif was also zzso Together, these results suggest an zzso mechanism of T cell expansion in these patients and may offer a new approach in examining specific zzso that stimulate T cells in zzso
