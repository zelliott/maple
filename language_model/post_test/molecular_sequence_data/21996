zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and protein folding are essential processes in the zzso of zzso zzso In a systematic approach to characterize essential proteins involved in these zzso we identified a novel essential protein of the zzso zzso which is highly zzso from zzso to human and which we termed zzso zzso of zzso caused a strong reduction in the levels of the zzso proteins zzso and the zzso zzso and a massive decrease in the zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of iron into the zzso protein zzso and formation of the zzso cluster containing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were inhibited in the absence of zzso This strongly suggests that zzso is required for the assembly of zzso zzso We show that zzso forms a stable complex with zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso machinery for zzso cluster zzso In the absence of zzso zzso is prone to zzso We propose that zzso acts together with zzso in an early step in the zzso of zzso zzso
