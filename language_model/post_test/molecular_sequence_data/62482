A zzso zzso method was developed for efficient identification of zzso zzso zzso and their environmental zzso in about 3 h without conventional DNA zzso The following three steps were zzso or developed: zzso a simple, zzso direct cell zzso protocol as a zzso zzso for generation of zzso zzso an improved zzso zzso amplification protocol with a broader species specificity using newly designed zzso targeting a zzso region of the zzso heat shock protein zzso gene and optimal zzso amplification conditions, and zzso a zzso restriction analysis of the zzso product for conclusive identification of the unknown zzso zzso
