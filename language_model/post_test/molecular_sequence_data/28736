To obtain a zzso active human zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and to establish an efficient zzso method for screening zzso zzso zzso 

zzso domain of human zzso zzso was expressed in E coli and characterized to establish a zzso screening zzso using a zzso zzso A set of zzso pure compounds and zzso were zzso 

We have constructed an efficient E coli system for this human protein zzso and the zzso zzso protein was zzso to zzso using zzso zzso after in zzso zzso from inclusion zzso The yield of active zzso protein was 23 zzso from one liter of E coli culture after zzso zzso and zinc zzso were required both in zzso and zzso activity, but high concentration of zinc inhibited the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso several synthetic zzso including a zzso zzso and zzso peptides with optimal activity around pH zzso zzso of zzso compounds and zzso led to identify 27 pure compounds and 14 natural products with zzso activity higher than 80 % at 20 zzso 

An efficient expression and zzso method for zzso protein has been established, and the zzso is effective, reliable, and fast in identifying the zzso protein zzso
