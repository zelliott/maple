A novel method for the identification of zzso B virus zzso zzso was zzso The zzso chain reaction zzso distinguished the sequences of two zzso from the zzso showing a change at zzso zzso within the region coding for the surface protein a zzso zzso One sequence was derived from a child previously zzso with zzso zzso while the other, reported here for the first time, was from a chronic zzso zzso variations within the target sequence at, or up to 3 bases from the point of zzso inhibited the zzso The zzso zzso variations in as little as zzso zzso DNA and will permit the rapid detection of zzso zzso in molecular zzso zzso
