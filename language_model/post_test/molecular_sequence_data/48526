zzso primates zzso carry zzso such as zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso and zzso zzso viruses zzso Here, we revisited zzso from Cambodia to assess the prevalence and diversity of these zzso using updated viral detection zzso We screened blood from 118 zzso consisting of six species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by using a zzso multiplex zzso zzso that allows the detection of all known zzso and zzso zzso We also used highly sensitive zzso zzso to detect each zzso zzso zzso Positive zzso products were zzso and zzso analyzed to zzso evolutionary zzso zzso of 118 zzso zzso tested positive for zzso by zzso and zzso zzso all from zzso zzso were zzso The 8 novel zzso sequences formed a highly supported distinct lineage within a zzso composed of other zzso zzso We observed no zzso or molecular evidence of zzso infection among the 118 zzso samples zzso Four of 118 zzso zzso were zzso for zzso including one zzso zzso one zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the four novel zzso belonged to the zzso zzso outside the African radiation of zzso like all Asian zzso identified so zzso zzso analysis of the whole zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso revealed a genetic structure characteristic of zzso zzso analysis comparing the zzso zzso sequence with zzso zzso showed that zzso is closer to zzso than to all other types across the entire zzso In conclusion, we showed a high frequency of zzso infection but found no evidence of zzso infection in zzso from zzso We identified for the first time zzso in a zzso zzso and in two zzso zzso
