zzso virus zzso is the type species of the zzso zzso and produces zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso encodes a zzso with remarkable zzso to zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso and also to zzso proteins zzso by zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that can exert either zzso or zzso effects on many cell zzso We have expressed and zzso zzso zzso and zzso versions of zzso and shown that zzso zzso zzso mast cells zzso and zzso zzso necrosis zzso synthesis in activated mouse zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that although zzso is structurally similar to zzso it has evolved a different spectrum of zzso zzso does not stimulate the proliferation of zzso or mast cells whereas zzso has both of these zzso Recent studies show that the critical difference in molecular structure of human zzso and zzso which may be the basis of their functional differences, is linked to a single zzso acid zzso zzso with the activity spectrum reported here for zzso the viral gene encodes the critical zzso acid seen in human zzso Although the zzso gene has clearly undergone significant evolutionary change at the zzso level compared with zzso zzso it has largely retained the zzso structure and functional characteristics of its zzso counterpart, suggesting that zzso of the gene to a potentially more potent zzso form may compromise the zzso of host and zzso
