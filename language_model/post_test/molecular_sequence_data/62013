zzso interference zzso is the mechanism of zzso zzso gene zzso initiated by short interfering zzso zzso zzso to the gene being zzso zzso which mediate zzso zzso degradation, are duplexes of about zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso or expressed by zzso zzso However, these systems rely on zzso for delivery and cannot generate long-term gene zzso in zzso This obstacle may be zzso by recently developed zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso system for delivery of zzso into cells, which can substantially zzso the expression of human zzso gene in human zzso zzso What's more, the zzso and S zzso of cell cycle change dramatically in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso may be used in functional zzso and in gene zzso
