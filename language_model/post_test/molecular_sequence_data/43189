Individual zzso coli strains produce several cell surface zzso In zzso coli zzso the his region of the zzso contains the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region of the zzso coli zzso reflect extensive zzso diversity in the zzso Previously, we reported a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso formation, upstream of zzso in strain zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that one of the zzso copies is flanked by zzso zzso providing a potential mechanism for the gene zzso zzso to zzso on the zzso segment is a further open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is responsible for the production of zzso acid, a precursor required for zzso zzso zzso Construction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the essential role for zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso and confirmed that there is no additional functional zzso copy in strain zzso zzso amplification and Southern zzso were used to examine the distribution of zzso elements and zzso genes in the vicinity of zzso in other zzso coli zzso producing different group zzso K zzso The relative order of genes and, where present, zzso elements was established in these zzso The regions adjacent to zzso in these strains are highly variable in both size and gene order, but in all cases where a zzso zzso was present, it was found near zzso The presence of zzso elements in the zzso regions of several of these strains provides a potential mechanism for zzso and deletion events which could contribute to the zzso diversity seen in surface zzso
