The zzso of distinct forms of the zzso chain zzso protein from a unique gene as the result of differential zzso patterns has been observed in humans and zzso However, there have been no reports on the existence of zzso zzso in avian zzso In the present study, we identified two chicken zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and examined the zzso gene copy number, zzso expression and protein expression by Southern zzso Northern zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso named zzso was zzso zzso in zzso and had an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso in agreement with a previously identified chicken zzso zzso the other, named zzso was zzso zzso long and had an zzso of zzso zzso Southern zzso confirmed that these zzso were derived from a single copy zzso Northern zzso performed with total zzso from various zzso of 6-week-old chickens revealed high levels of zzso and zzso zzso expression in the zzso and zzso of zzso and low levels of zzso expression in the zzso heart and liver, while zzso was not expressed in these zzso High levels of expression of both zzso zzso were detected in the zzso and zzso of zzso during late zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso proteins were expressed in the cell zzso of the zzso These data suggest that chicken zzso exists in two zzso resulting from alternative zzso and is strongly expressed in the major immune zzso
