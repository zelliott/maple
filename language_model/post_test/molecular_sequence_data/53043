zzso is one of a variety of human tumors that exhibit a very high density of zzso receptors and in many cases show a true positive zzso zzso zzso However, the level of expression of individual zzso zzso proteins in zzso has not been zzso We have recently developed a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso that effectively stain zzso zzso tumor tissue zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have used these zzso to determine the zzso zzso status of 40 randomly selected zzso zzso zzso for all zzso receptors was clearly located at the plasma membrane of the tumor cells and completely blocked with zzso zzso The vast majority of tumors (29 zzso zzso were positive for zzso zzso among these, 20 zzso tumors showed high levels of zzso zzso In contrast, all other zzso receptors were only detected zzso and none of these cases revealed a particularly strong zzso However, it is uncertain to what extent zzso zzso zzso intensity may translate into zzso zzso protein expression on the tumor zzso zzso in a prospective study, 16 surgically removed zzso were collected, and the level of zzso expression was determined using Western zzso zzso Whereas zzso was readily zzso as a broad band zzso at Mr 70,000 in 12 zzso of these tumors, 8 tumors zzso showed particularly high levels of zzso zzso zzso There was an excellent correlation zzso zzso zzso between the level of zzso protein expression detected in Western blots and the zzso zzso zzso seen in tissue zzso Thus, the frequent zzso of the zzso zzso may explain the high zzso zzso often observed in zzso patients during zzso zzso zzso Moreover, this simple zzso method could prove useful in identifying those cases of zzso disease that may possibly respond to therapy with zzso zzso
