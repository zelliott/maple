A stable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso bound to the ends of the zzso DNA promotes zzso Assembly of this active zzso complex from zzso of zzso requires an intricate array of zzso zzso sites on zzso DNA, zzso metal zzso and the zzso coli zzso zzso Under altered reaction conditions, many of these factors stimulate assembly of the zzso zzso but are not essential, allowing their role in formation of the complex to be zzso zzso zzso sites and zzso metal zzso are most critical and probably promote a zzso change in zzso that is necessary for zzso Multiple zzso sites on the DNA contribute zzso to zzso zzso DNA zzso assists zzso between the sites on the two zzso DNA ends if they are properly zzso zzso specifically promotes assembly involving the left end of the zzso zzso In addition to zzso the assembly pathway, these data demonstrate that the zzso zzso is intrinsic to zzso and constitutes the form of the protein active in zzso
