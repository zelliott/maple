zzso of the tobacco zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso in transgenic tobacco plants causes mild, zzso and no zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso and adjacent zzso zzso are highly zzso and the zzso zzso zzso also are moderately zzso To investigate the contributions of both the zzso and divergent regions to the severity of zzso zzso we generated zzso proteins by exchanging different regions of zzso zzso and zzso The severity of the abnormal zzso was dependent upon the synergistic action of both the N zzso containing the zzso domain, and the C zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso analysis focusing on the C zzso revealed that the zzso half of the zzso domain is more effective in inducing the abnormal zzso than are the zzso For the N zzso severe zzso zzso were induced by exchanging a part of the zzso domain of zzso with the corresponding region of zzso This limited region in the zzso domain of all zzso proteins includes a predicted zzso region, but only that in zzso is predicted to form a typical zzso zzso We discuss the possibility, based on these results, that the secondary structure of the zzso domain is important for the induction of abnormal zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso
