The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso major zzso zzso reveals the presence of characteristic zzso zzso zzso acid zzso However, the open reading frame is of an unusually small size for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso because it lacks the coding potential for the central zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso present in other zzso Here, we provide zzso evidence that the zzso protein is indeed a zzso major nuclear zzso zzso and that it is zzso expressed during the life cycle of the zzso Due to its high zzso content, the zzso protein can be zzso to a high degree from zzso major nuclear zzso with zzso zzso acid, a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso this protein is detected as a 17 zzso or as a zzso zzso zzso in the nuclear zzso in different zzso major zzso The nuclear zzso of the zzso protein is further supported by zzso zzso During in zzso zzso growth, both the zzso zzso zzso and its protein progressively accumulate within zzso from early log phase to stationary zzso Within zzso the high level of zzso expression is maintained but decreases when zzso differentiate into zzso Together, these observations suggest that the different levels of this zzso zzso protein could influence the varying degrees of zzso zzso during the zzso of the zzso and provide us with tools to study this zzso
