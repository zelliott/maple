zzso of zzso has been implicated in the regulation of the binding of zzso to zzso We show that zzso zzso is zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso and that these sites can be zzso in zzso by zzso zzso II zzso analogous to chicken zzso An efficient method to study DNA binding properties of full-length zzso and zzso zzso under zzso conditions was zzso It was found that a zzso zzso in which zzso and zzso were replaced with Ala zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bound to the A site of the zzso promoter with decreasing zzso In agreement with this finding, zzso zzso zzso better than zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso promoter or a synthetic zzso zzso Similar observations were made for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso or an zzso activity abolished partially the differences seen with the zzso zzso suggesting that the reduced DNA binding due to negative charge at positions 11 and 12 can be compensated for by zzso Since no direct interaction of zzso and zzso was observed, we propose that the zzso is zzso by a third zzso Our data offer two possibilities for how zzso zzso II zzso can influence zzso zzso first, by reducing zzso DNA binding and thereby influencing zzso and second, by enhancing the apparent zzso between zzso and zzso or an zzso zzso
