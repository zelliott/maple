Cellular pathways involving zzso zzso seem to be zzso for development of Parkinson's zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso appear to be important for the zzso function of the protein and influence the pathological zzso of zzso leading to the formation of zzso zzso Upon membrane binding the zzso zzso folds into zzso zzso In our work we characterized the penetration depth and zzso the local environment of zzso introduced along the zzso zzso We could show that while the entire zzso is well embedded in the zzso zzso segments with a zzso penetration and zzso higher flexibility zzso
