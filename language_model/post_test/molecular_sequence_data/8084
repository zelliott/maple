zzso transcribed in a zzso zzso zzso system has been modified in such a way that zzso have randomly replaced unmodified zzso These zzso serve as sites for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso in a reducing environment, causes zzso of nearby zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso when bound in zzso to the zzso and zzso of 70 S zzso cause zzso mainly in zzso I, III and V of 23 S zzso zzso zzso The zzso sites in domain V predominantly occur very close to or in the zzso zzso The regions of domain I and III that are zzso are apparently folded in the 50 S zzso zzso so as to be zzso to the zzso zzso Most of the zzso events occur whether the zzso zzso is bound to zzso alone, or zzso zzso is also present in the zzso hybrid zzso zzso that occur only in the absence of zzso zzso are limited to the zzso region of domain II, and the zzso region of domain zzso zzso that occur only in the presence of zzso occur in the zzso region of domain zzso The regions of 23 S zzso in which zzso induced zzso occur complement those sites shown by chemical protection and zzso to be in a close proximity to the zzso However, the zzso approach allows a more versatile and expanded view of the near neighborhood of zzso surrounding the zzso These results provide considerable information which will allow a more detailed modeling of the zzso structure of the 50 S zzso zzso
