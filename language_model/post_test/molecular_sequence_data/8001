For the zzso control of tuberculosis it is necessary to use specific markers for strain zzso The analysis of the restriction zzso length zzso zzso by using the zzso sequence zzso as a probe, allows us to establish accurately the strains which are around in a zzso Our study evaluates the efficiency of this marker in 136 strains of zzso tuberculosis isolated from our zzso A standardized protocol is used, and a computerized system to analyze the images is zzso 

DNA restriction was done with zzso The filters were revealed by following a zzso method using a zzso zzso probe, which is located to the right of the zzso site zzso The comparison of the patterns obtained was done in a zzso The zzso of zzso was calculated to express the similarity of the profiles given by two zzso The strains were clustered by the zzso zzso The graphic representation of the clusters was done by means of zzso zzso 

124 different patterns were obtained from which 118 strains had a unique pattern while 18 shared zzso The index of discrimination was zzso zzso two percent of the strains had more than 6 bands and none had no zzso The median of zzso was zzso in 8 of the patients, 2 consecutive zzso were studied with the result of no variation seen on the zzso 

zzso has shown very effective because of its stability and high zzso zzso The standardized protocol together with a computerized analysis of the images obtained allows comparison of results, zzso to establish zzso data zzso This would be very useful for zzso studies of tuberculosis and the chase of strains with special zzso
