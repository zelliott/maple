During an zzso battle, the zzso zzso of the human pathogen zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso into the zzso of zzso enemy cells and zzso their zzso However, for its own benefit, zzso zzso produces and zzso the zzso zzso into its own zzso where in prevents accidental zzso and zzso zzso Here we present the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso and describe the mechanism by which zzso zzso the zzso acid zzso bond of zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso of zzso zzso but is unique among described members of this family of which the structure was zzso since it is a single domain protein without any putative zzso zzso Most importantly, we present the crystal structure of zzso bound to its zzso zzso as well and describe the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso the active site of zzso and zzso its zzso activity by forming a hydrogen bond to a zzso important zzso zzso in zzso Based on our structural findings in combination with a zzso approach we also identified a related system in zzso zzso Not only do our findings point to a common zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso but we can also show that it is distinct from other members of this zzso Furthermore, we provide strong evidence that the mechanism of zzso zzso between zzso zzso is zzso This work is the first structural description of an entire zzso pair injected by the zzso zzso Moreover, it is also the first example of a member of the zzso zzso which becomes inhibited upon binding to its zzso immunity zzso
