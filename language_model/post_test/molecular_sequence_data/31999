zzso human zzso zzso zzso typing results are essential in determining the degree of zzso between donor and recipient in both solid organ zzso and zzso stem cell zzso zzso Current zzso typing zzso can generate ambiguous results which may need zzso This zzso sequencing approach allowed investigation into the presence of the low zzso zzso zzso and the rare zzso zzso in a SO transplant recipient and a zzso transplant recipient, zzso zzso amplification of zzso was zzso zzso 2 and 3 were zzso in both directions followed by zzso sequencing to resolve zzso zzso sequence data of zzso 2 generated from the zzso zzso indicated the presence of the zzso zzso zzso was identified by sequencing the zzso in isolation over zzso 2 and 3 and allowed confirmation of this zzso sequence with the zzso database zzso number zzso This approach is cost efficient and can be modified to sequence zzso at other zzso zzso It has also been adapted to characterize the novel zzso zzso zzso number zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso making it a useful tool to augment existing typing zzso
