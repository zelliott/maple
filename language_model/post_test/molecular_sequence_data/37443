Memory zzso zzso responses against respiratory zzso virus zzso were evaluated in peripheral blood zzso cells of healthy blood donors with gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were detected in every donor at levels varying between zzso and zzso of zzso T zzso For all donors tested, a considerable component of the zzso zzso response was directed against the fusion zzso protein of zzso We characterized a set of 31 zzso zzso peptides targeted by zzso T cells in the context of the most prevalent zzso class II molecules within the Caucasian zzso Most zzso peptides were zzso zzso whereas two dominant zzso peptides were also zzso The zzso peptides identified were located across the entire sequence of the F zzso Several peptides were presented by more than one major zzso complex class II zzso Furthermore, most donors recognized several F zzso zzso knowledge about zzso zzso peptides will facilitate the ability to monitor zzso zzso responses in patients and the measurement of zzso of protection in vaccinated zzso
