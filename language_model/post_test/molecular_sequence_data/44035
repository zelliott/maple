The zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be associated with zzso acute zzso The zzso gene involved in other zzso abnormalities was also rearranged by this zzso We analyzed two patients with zzso syndrome with zzso and showed that the zzso gene on zzso was fused with zzso protein zzso gene on zzso in these zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso protein and it is zzso in patients with zzso zzso The zzso gene is also involved in acute zzso leukemia zzso with zzso zzso zzso fusion transcripts combine the zzso zzso motifs and DNA zzso zzso region with a largely intact zzso Our results combined with the finding of the zzso fusion in zzso suggest that the zzso gene may be associated with zzso through zzso
