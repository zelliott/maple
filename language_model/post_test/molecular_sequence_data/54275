zzso zzso are major components of the fish zzso in both Central America and the zzso To examine the evolutionary patterns of how zzso zzso both of these regions, we reconstructed the zzso relationships among 23 zzso zzso We used three zzso novel nuclear markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso in combination with sequence data from seven other gene regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso the species tree of these zzso The species examined represent major heroine lineages in South America, Central America, and the Greater zzso The individual gene trees of these groups were zzso quite zzso zzso we combined the genetic partitions and zzso the species tree using both zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The two resulting zzso zzso were largely zzso but differed in two fundamental zzso First, more zzso in the zzso tree were supported with substantial or zzso zzso zzso support than in the zzso zzso Second, there was a minor, but zzso critical, zzso difference between the zzso and zzso zzso Nevertheless, both analyses recovered zzso consistent with the Greater zzso heroines being zzso zzso within the largely Central American heroine zzso This study suggests that reconstructions of zzso zzso and historical zzso should account for the vagaries of individual gene zzso
