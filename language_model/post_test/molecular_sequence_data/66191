zzso often undergo extensive cellular processing prior to zzso These zzso processing events occur in zzso of the zzso or regulated zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between zzso modifications and the zzso pathways taken by peptides derived from zzso the zzso of zzso which in zzso is zzso by cells of the zzso zzso and stimulates the release of gastric zzso zzso zzso to compartments of the early zzso zzso shows that zzso processing is initiated in a zzso network compartment of zzso but not zzso zzso The resulting zzso fragments of zzso are zzso via the zzso pathway, whereas zzso processed zzso fragments are zzso via the regulated or zzso zzso zzso fragments derived from zzso differ in characteristic manners in levels and patterns of zzso and zzso zzso in accordance with the zzso zzso zzso Point zzso introduced into a sorting motif disrupt these patterns, suggesting that differences in zzso modifications are attributable to differential zzso sorting of zzso The results suggest a zzso sorting mechanism for zzso leading to differential zzso of processed fragments via different zzso zzso
