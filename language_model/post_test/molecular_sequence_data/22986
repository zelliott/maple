zzso gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso have an extremely poor zzso however, their zzso and genetic features have not been assessed zzso and the mechanisms responsible for their high zzso potential remain zzso We examined the zzso differences between gastric zzso and zzso zzso in the liver of four patients who had undergone a zzso zzso for zzso liver zzso We also carried out genetic analysis of the tumors in three of the four zzso In all cases, the zzso profiles, including zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similar between the gastric and zzso tumors, but the zzso labeling index in the zzso zzso was higher than that of the primary zzso Interestingly, in the case who had received zzso zzso therapy before zzso its therapeutic effect was observed in most of the primary zzso with the exception of a specific small area with high zzso zzso analysis revealed no acquired zzso in the zzso or zzso genes in the zzso zzso in any of the patients, but loss of zzso zzso of the zzso gene was observed mainly in the zzso tumors in two of the three zzso Furthermore, in the case of zzso zzso therapy, zzso of the zzso gene was shown in the high zzso area in the primary zzso and zzso liver zzso It is suggested that zzso of the zzso gene is an important event that leads to zzso resistance and zzso progression of zzso In conclusion, both gastric and zzso zzso had almost the same zzso features, except for their zzso activity, and zzso of the zzso gene played an important role in the process of liver zzso
