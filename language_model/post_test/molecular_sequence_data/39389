zzso zzso is a large protein of zzso zzso zzso whose function and regulation have not been well zzso zzso zzso expansion in the N zzso of zzso causes the neurodegenerative disorder Huntington disease zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is modulated by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso generating zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso may zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we have mapped the major zzso sites of zzso using cell culture models zzso and zzso zzso expressing full-length zzso zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was subjected to mass zzso analysis including zzso laser zzso mass zzso and zzso tandem mass zzso used in conjunction with zzso alkaline zzso and zzso zzso We have identified more than six novel zzso zzso sites within zzso one of which lies in the zzso zzso zzso Three of the sites have the consensus sequence for zzso zzso and addition of zzso inhibitor blocks zzso at those zzso Other observed zzso sites are possibly zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso which is located in the zzso zzso domain, to zzso acid, inhibited zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso The results presented here represent the first detailed mapping of the zzso sites in full-length zzso zzso of zzso modifications in zzso may provide clues to Huntington disease zzso and targets for therapeutic zzso
