zzso pore function at the zzso channels of zzso microbial zzso proteins is important in understanding their role in the management of zzso zzso The zzso pores are called zzso because of the structural resemblance to the zzso channels of zzso zzso used for iron entry and exit to and from the protein zzso In zzso zzso charged zzso lining the pores generate a negative zzso zzso that guides iron zzso toward the zzso centers for zzso with zzso and destined for the zzso zzso To establish whether the set of three zzso zzso that line the pores in zzso zzso zzso act in a similar fashion, zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso zzso of iron zzso and the size distribution of the iron mineral in the protein cavity were zzso The results, discussed in the framework of crystal growth in a confined space, indicate that iron uses the zzso zzso pores to traverse the protein zzso For the first time, the strength of the zzso potential is observed to zzso kinetic zzso in the iron zzso processes and accordingly the size distribution of the zzso iron minerals in the zzso protein zzso
