A novel zzso regulated zzso junction protein zzso protein of 24 zzso zzso has been identified that shows zzso to the zzso protein zzso membrane protein zzso family of cell junction zzso which are involved in the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso protein contains four predicted zzso zzso and a zzso zzso interaction zzso These zzso are characteristic of the four zzso spanning zzso family of zzso which includes zzso protein 22, and are involved in cell zzso at tight, gap and zzso zzso zzso profiling analyses show that zzso is highly expressed in zzso heart, kidney and zzso zzso Cellular studies confirm that the zzso protein zzso to zzso junctions and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso protein but not with tight zzso zzso of zzso results in decreased zzso between cells, and functional zzso flux studies confirm that zzso of the zzso protein zzso the zzso barrier zzso These data therefore suggest that zzso is a novel, zzso regulated zzso zzso junction protein that zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso
