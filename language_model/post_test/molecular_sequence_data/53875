zzso zzso zzso are a group of zzso catalyzing the conversion of zzso to the corresponding zzso In zzso and zzso at least two zzso of zzso are known to be involved in ethanol metabolism zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso have previously been identified in several plants, such as zzso and zzso it is unclear whether zzso zzso zzso also exist in zzso In this study, we identified and characterized a zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso from rice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of this clone did not contain a typical zzso targeting zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso using green fluorescent protein zzso suggested that zzso is a zzso zzso rather than a zzso zzso A zzso Southern zzso indicated that sequences zzso to the zzso gene are present in at least two regions of the rice zzso zzso by zzso showed that zzso is expressed strongly in roots, but not in leaves, of rice zzso suggesting that zzso functions in zzso
