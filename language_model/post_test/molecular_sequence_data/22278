We investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the functioning of the rat zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot transport zzso or give rise to zzso leak and zzso currents even though they are targeted to the plasma zzso zzso experiments of zzso and zzso zzso suggest that zzso is a functional zzso though it requires zzso assembly for membrane zzso We determined the accessibility of zzso by investigating the impact of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso engineered in close proximity to zzso The effect of these zzso indicates that zzso faces the external zzso zzso The introduction of a zzso hindrance close to zzso by means of zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso altered the affinity of the zzso for zzso Taken together, these results suggest that this irreplaceable zzso is involved in the interaction with sodium or in maintaining the zzso accessibility to the zzso
