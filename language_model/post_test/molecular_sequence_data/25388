To examine whether the zzso bridge between zzso 65 and 81 can be replaced by a non-native zzso bridge in the zzso zzso zzso and whether the formation of such a new zzso bridge affects the folding of the zzso zzso scanning zzso has been performed within two zzso segments zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The position of the zzso zzso at 65 or 81 was continuously shifted by zzso zzso Of the zzso only substitution of zzso for zzso allowed the zzso of zzso zzso into the medium in a sufficient amount for zzso After the zzso the zzso zzso was obtained as two components zzso and zzso The only difference between A and B was that A had a zzso bond zzso between zzso and zzso A non-native zzso bridge between zzso zzso was found in both zzso Little difference was observed in CD zzso among zzso and zzso zzso It is likely that the zzso structure of the zzso zzso might be distorted at the location, because the directions of zzso acid side chains at positions of 64 and 81 are shown to be opposite to each other in zzso zzso by X-ray zzso zzso
