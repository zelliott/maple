A zzso inhibitor from zzso zzso present throughout the animal, was zzso by zzso zzso followed by four zzso zzso By zzso the molecular mass of the native form was determined to be zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence was determined by protein sequencing, but appeared to be partial because the theoretical molecular mass of the protein was zzso Da too zzso zzso treatment gave rise to several fragments each containing a single zzso zzso By sequence analysis and zzso zzso zzso bridges could unequivocally be assigned to connect the pairs zzso zzso and zzso The structure of the inhibitor is zzso to zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor constant, zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso were not zzso To reveal the complete sequence the zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor was zzso This zzso of zzso zzso predicts a protein of 82 zzso acid zzso including a 20 zzso acid signal zzso Moreover, the zzso predicts a zzso extension of 11 zzso acids compared to the part identified by protein zzso The molecular mass calculated for this predicted protein is in accordance with the measured zzso This zzso sequence is unusual for zzso zzso zzso and has apparently been lost early in zzso The high degree of conservation around the active site strongly supports the importance of the zzso zzso
