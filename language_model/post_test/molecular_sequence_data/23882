zzso 315 in factor zzso zzso belongs to a zzso loop involved in direct interaction with the zzso zzso factor, zzso in transmission of zzso effects and potentially in zzso zzso Natural zzso zzso at position 315 provide peculiar models for zzso zzso 

We characterized a mild zzso zzso zzso associated with reduced zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso zzso were searched by zzso gene zzso zzso zzso were created by zzso of zzso zzso and characterized through expression in zzso cells followed by functional zzso zzso zzso in media was estimated by zzso while zzso activity was assessed by zzso based and zzso generation zzso zzso zzso were injected into mice to investigate their recovery and zzso zzso zzso was used to test statistical zzso 

The patient was double zzso for a novel zzso zzso and for the zzso substitution zzso zzso previously demonstrated to impair zzso zzso The zzso zzso was normally expressed in medium but showed a markedly reduced zzso function zzso and activity towards factor X (FX) in plasma zzso Moreover, the zzso showed significantly decreased recovery of the protein zzso and a slightly shorter zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also studied the conservative zzso change that was responsible for low recovery zzso and a decreased zzso (7 zzso of a zzso zzso with virtually normal zzso zzso and activity zzso 

These findings suggest a dual role of zzso for zzso function and zzso and indicate that zzso at this position have appreciable effects on human zzso biology, compatible with residual zzso function and thus with mild zzso zzso
