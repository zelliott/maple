Loss of zzso on zzso where the zzso tumor zzso and the zzso cell cycle regulator genes are located, is a common genetic zzso in zzso zzso However, it has been difficult to demonstrate zzso deletions and zzso zzso in either of these two genes in primary transitional cell zzso zzso of the zzso Similarly, colon zzso cell lines have shown no zzso deletions of the zzso locus in contrast to a wide variety of zzso cell zzso We have investigated abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso islands of the zzso and zzso genes as an alternative mechanism of zzso of these genes in zzso and colon zzso De zzso zzso of the zzso zzso island of zzso was observed in 12 of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso and in 2 of 3 zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, only 1 of 10 zzso colon zzso showed zzso of the zzso zzso island of zzso It was striking to find that this region was extensively zzso and the gene not expressed in the normal zzso zzso of 6 of 10 zzso patients with colon cancer, whereas 5 of the corresponding colon tumors showed no zzso and high levels of zzso zzso Our data show a significant correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso between the absence of zzso expression and zzso of its zzso zzso island in zzso tumors, cell lines, and normal colon zzso In contrast, no association was observed between expression and zzso status of the zzso zzso island of zzso Our results suggest that the zzso tumor zzso gene may be zzso by zzso of its zzso zzso island in zzso of the zzso We also present evidence of zzso of the zzso zzso island in this zzso gene in normal zzso zzso
