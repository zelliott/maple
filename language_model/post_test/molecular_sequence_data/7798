An element, zzso to zzso base pairs zzso in the minimal zzso zzso zzso promoter binds zzso zzso zzso zzso and is important for both zzso expression and zzso negative zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso An element on the zzso strand of the zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso element, has single strand binding zzso It is distinct from the zzso site, as evidenced by competition experiments using gel shift zzso but the association of the two elements is not zzso Thus, the single strand binding protein zzso element also exists zzso to the zzso of an upstream zzso site, zzso to zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso in each zzso element results in the loss of zzso binding and zzso zzso experiments indicate that full, zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso cells requires the binding of both zzso and zzso since zzso of either element halves zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso of both decreases promoter activity to values near those of a control zzso zzso experiments with rat liver cells support their independent activities and show that the zzso site contributes to zzso gene expression in zzso zzso The zzso function zzso with zzso in zzso zzso negative zzso of the zzso Thus, zzso or zzso zzso cells zzso decrease zzso zzso levels and zzso DNA binding to both the zzso and zzso also the zzso zzso decrease in gene expression requires both zzso The zzso effect in each case is inhibited by zzso the zzso decrease in zzso complex formation requires the presence of insulin or calf serum, exactly as does zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In sum, full, zzso expression of the zzso in zzso cells requires zzso and the zzso to bind separate, zzso elements on the zzso zzso zzso decreases the binding of each factor to its respective site, thereby decreasing zzso gene zzso The role of the zzso and zzso sites in zzso zzso expression and in zzso negative regulation of the zzso is, therefore, additive and zzso
