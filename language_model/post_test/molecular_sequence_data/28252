The zzso 1 zzso gene is an alpha zzso zzso and started to diverge from the other members of the alpha zzso family 260 million years zzso DNA sequencing and zzso analysis indicated that it is functional in zzso cells of the higher zzso but not in zzso and zzso The zzso 1 promoter region of higher primates including man consists of zzso sequences characteristic of zzso gene zzso and zzso and zzso boxes located further zzso It is shown here that the zzso gene zzso region of human zzso 1 contains two zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso Of these, zzso interacts with nuclear zzso present in the zzso zzso cell line zzso before and after zzso zzso zzso however, interacts with nuclear zzso only present in zzso zzso zzso These factors are different from previously reported zzso zzso factors, and are not zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the sequence of the motif zzso and its location relative to zzso zzso have been zzso among all known zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso Finally, and most interestingly, the zzso box of zzso 1 is contained within a 38 zzso internal segment of zzso repeat zzso Immediately upstream from this zzso zzso zzso repeat segment is a zzso zzso zzso repeat pointing in the opposite zzso The conservation of this novel arrangement among the higher primates suggests that an inserted zzso family repeat and its zzso zzso sequence have zzso for at least 30 million years, to provide the zzso zzso and zzso promoter elements of the zzso 1 zzso genes in higher zzso
