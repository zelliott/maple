Because the northern elephant seal zzso zzso was heavily exploited during the 19th century, it experienced an extreme population zzso Since then, under legislative protection in the United States and Mexico, northern elephant seals have recovered dramatically in number, although their zzso diversity was greatly reduced, apparently as a consequence of the zzso In this study we investigated DNA sequence diversity in two zzso regions (the control region and zzso zzso and found low genetic variation in the northern elephant zzso there were only two control region zzso zzso difference zzso zzso which was consistent with an extreme founder event in the recent history of the northern zzso We also reaffirmed the lack of zzso diversity in this zzso In contrast, the southern elephant seal zzso zzso which though similarly exploited never fell below 1,000 animals, had 23 control region zzso zzso zzso sequence difference zzso zzso To investigate the extent of the founder event in the northern elephant seal we devised a simulation model based on extensive demographic zzso This allowed a statistical analysis of the likely outcome of bottlenecks of different size and zzso Given these historical data, our results indicate zzso zzso zzso a bottleneck of less than 30 seals and 20-year zzso or, if hunting was the primary pressure on the population, a zzso bottleneck of less than 20 zzso
