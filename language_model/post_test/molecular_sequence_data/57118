zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is also present in the major pathological zzso of Alzheimer's disease in an zzso zzso state as paired zzso filaments zzso We have investigated the zzso state of control zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso samples were zzso with zzso separated by zzso zzso liquid zzso and analyzed by mass zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso with zzso of human zzso zzso was zzso on bovine and zzso zzso and up to two zzso were present on a zzso of zzso acids zzso of bovine zzso zzso of human zzso zzso The zzso within the zzso motif was not zzso on bovine or zzso zzso zzso fragments, isolated from zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid region within the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso analysis showed no zzso was present and a second zzso zzso was identified at zzso zzso zzso and zzso which recognize zzso and peptides zzso at the sequence zzso both reacted with bovine and zzso zzso even though the zzso sequence was not zzso These data indicate that the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso from zzso is not zzso and the zzso equivalent to zzso of human zzso is zzso in bovine and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso react with zzso zzso that are not unique to zzso and that are not necessarily at the zzso zzso
