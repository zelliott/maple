zzso flying insects play a key role in the transmission of pathogens of zzso zzso However, at least for the case of avian malaria zzso the vast majority of studies focus on the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso but there is a lack of information regarding the interaction between the zzso and the insect zzso Here, we identified the presence of malaria and zzso zzso lineages zzso by the potential zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, we identified some zzso of the transmission network connecting zzso zzso potential insect zzso and avian hosts by comparing zzso and zzso lineages isolated from insects with those infecting wild birds in this and previous zzso 

Using a molecular approach, we zzso the presence of blood zzso in a total of 97 biting zzso trapped in the zzso National Park zzso zzso and surrounding zzso Also, 123 blood samples from 11 bird species were analyzed for the presence of blood zzso zzso Blood zzso zzso and zzso were identified by amplification of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso b zzso 

Thirteen biting zzso zzso blood zzso including six zzso and two zzso zzso supporting the potential role of these insects on zzso zzso Moreover, ten zzso birds carried blood zzso Seven zzso and one zzso lineages were isolated from zzso Overall, six new zzso lineages were described in this zzso Also, we identified the transmission networks of some blood zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identical to those isolated from zzso zzso in southern Spain and zzso zzso in Bulgaria, zzso Furthermore, the new zzso lineage zzso showed a zzso similarity with a lineage found infecting captive penguins in zzso 

The comparison of the zzso lineages isolated in this study with those previously found infecting birds allowed us to identify some potential zzso in the transmission network of avian blood zzso zzso These results highlight the complexity of the transmission networks of blood zzso in the wild that may involve a high diversity of susceptible birds and insect zzso
