Lon zzso are a family of zzso zzso involved in protein quality control, with a unique zzso domain and an zzso zzso associated with various cellular zzso module zzso within a single zzso zzso They were classified into two types as either the ubiquitous soluble zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso forms, a number of medically and ecologically important groups of bacteria zzso a third type of zzso proteins in which the zzso zzso domain is fused to a large zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso Here we showed that these zzso zzso formed a zzso distinct from zzso and zzso zzso of one such zzso zzso from zzso zzso indicated that it formed a zzso assembly with a hollow chamber similar to zzso The zzso was devoid of zzso activity but retained an ability to bind zzso six zzso per zzso zzso zzso alignment suggested possible existence of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso or unfolded protein and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results highlight a new type of Lon zzso that may be involved in breakdown of excessive damage or unfolded proteins during stress conditions without consumption of zzso
