The zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso was genetically incorporated into zzso coli zzso zzso protein zzso in bacteria in response to an amber nonsense zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing zzso formed a zzso complex with a DNA zzso containing the consensus operator sequence upon zzso zzso Because this zzso acid can be genetically incorporated into any zzso protein in zzso coli, zzso or zzso cells with minimal zzso of protein structure, this method should be generally useful for investigating zzso zzso
