zzso zzso zzso zzso is often found in zzso China, and other Southeast Asian zzso The zzso gene is strongly linked to an alpha gene deletion and has important implications in the identification and diagnosis of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was previously mapped to the alpha 1 gene in a study of Chinese zzso In this paper, a Thai patient with zzso zzso H disease and his mother were studied at the DNA level, and the gene organization of zzso zzso in the Thai patient was found to be the same as that of Chinese patients zzso the zzso zzso gene is located on the alpha 1 gene of zzso zzso while the zzso zzso or zzso deletion involves the alpha 2 zzso Also, the zzso zzso proposed at zzso 74, has been confirmed by DNA sequencing and a simple and accurate method for diagnosis of the zzso zzso zzso has been developed based on restriction zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso generates new cutting sites for both restriction zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification of a specific region around zzso 74, followed by zzso with these zzso and zzso gel zzso of the zzso products, permits rapid and accurate identification of zzso zzso
