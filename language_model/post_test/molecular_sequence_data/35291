zzso zzso play key roles in cancer development and zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in the progression and zzso of zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso was frequently zzso in zzso tumors and cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines significantly inhibited cell zzso migration, and invasion in zzso and tumor growth and zzso in a zzso mouse zzso zzso was identified as a target of zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso by direct binding to its 3' untranslated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso whereas restoration of zzso in zzso zzso cells reversed the zzso effects of zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso acts as a tumor zzso and its zzso in tumor zzso may contribute to the progression and zzso of zzso through a mechanism involving zzso suggesting zzso as a potential new diagnostic and therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
