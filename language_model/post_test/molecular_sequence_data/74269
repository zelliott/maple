zzso zzso zzso was described to regulate cellular functions zzso DNA zzso inflammation and cell differentiation by zzso different zzso zzso Using an in zzso and in zzso approach, we identified zzso as a new zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Site directed zzso indicated that zzso 36 and 37, located in the nuclear zzso signal of zzso are the main targets for zzso and zzso activity in zzso Interestingly, zzso of the same two zzso zzso reduces the DNA binding and zzso activity of zzso Finally, zzso with zzso zzso 36 and 37 showed reduced zzso when compared to wild type zzso Together, our results provide evidence that zzso of zzso is a key zzso modification that may regulate DNA binding and consequently also the zzso activity of zzso
