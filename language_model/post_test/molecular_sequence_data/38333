zzso zzso code for zzso and zzso regulatory zzso one of which is the early region 3, zzso protein zzso zzso which has been shown to inhibit tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso In an effort to understand the mechanism of action of Ad zzso we previously searched for cell proteins with which it zzso Three Ad zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso is a small zzso which was used in this report as bait in the zzso zzso system to find other interacting cell zzso The search resulted in the isolation of a zzso which we called zzso zzso zzso that subsequently was shown to be identical to one of the zzso components of human zzso zzso zzso was able to bind both zzso and Ad zzso simultaneously and was necessary to form a complex in which the viral protein was associated with a zzso motor zzso The functional significance of these interactions is discussed with respect to the steps of the Ad life cycle which are zzso zzso
