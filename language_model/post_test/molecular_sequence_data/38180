The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso the restriction sites zzso and the coding region zzso Similar to other zzso counterparts, including human, the gene has a single coding zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso The predicted protein of zzso zzso acids is also highly zzso compared to other zzso zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso zzso was localized to the zzso region of mouse zzso 16, which is zzso to human zzso zzso An increased zzso copy number may explain the increased levels of zzso in the brains of zzso 16 mice and the increased rate of transport of zzso into cultured zzso derived from zzso 16 zzso
