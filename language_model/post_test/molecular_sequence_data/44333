The coat protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso inserted into the bacterial inner membrane with a single zzso anchor sequence in the zzso zzso The zzso sequence immediately zzso the membrane anchor contains one zzso charged zzso whereas the zzso zzso segment has two positively charged zzso To investigate how the orientation of this protein is zzso the three zzso charged zzso acid zzso were zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso using the accessibility to zzso added zzso and in zzso by testing the zzso into zzso zzso coli membrane zzso In both systems, the orientation of the protein was completely reversed for the zzso charged zzso coat protein zzso zzso In addition, we show in zzso that the zzso membrane potential is necessary for the zzso of both the zzso and the zzso zzso coat zzso suggesting that membrane zzso is driven by zzso zzso
