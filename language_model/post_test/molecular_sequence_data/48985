zzso is a small 6 zzso zzso zzso member of the insulin zzso that is principally produced in the corpus zzso of the zzso and which plays a key role in zzso tissue zzso during zzso Like insulin, it is produced on the zzso as zzso that zzso zzso folding and subsequent zzso processing to yield the mature zzso zzso In contrast to the now considerable insight into insulin chain folding and zzso comparatively little is known about the folding zzso of zzso A series of synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared, and their zzso behavior was studied both on their own and in the presence of native zzso zzso It was observed that native zzso zzso oxidized rapidly to a zzso product, whereas individual formation of each of the zzso zzso bonds between zzso and zzso and the native zzso and zzso was considerably zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso bond formed most zzso although circular zzso zzso analysis showed this product to be devoid of secondary zzso This suggested that it may in fact be an intermediate in the subsequent formation of the native zzso zzso zzso Combination of the native zzso with the zzso proceeded rapidly as compared with the zzso analogue that lacked the zzso zzso bond suggesting that this latter element is required as a first step in the folding zzso It is therefore probable that zzso is generated from its constituent A- and zzso in a zzso organization manner similar to that of insulin chain combination and zzso Further studies showed that the efficiency of combination of zzso to zzso was not markedly influenced by reaction temperature and that a reasonable yield of zzso could be obtained on combination of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso
