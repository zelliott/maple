The Family B G zzso zzso zzso is an important drug zzso The aim of this work was to zzso the molecular mechanism of action of zzso zzso zzso acting at this zzso comparing it with the action mechanism of the zzso natural zzso zzso zzso responses to four zzso zzso and zzso were studied in zzso cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso zzso All compounds were full zzso at the zzso zzso with no activity at the zzso zzso Only zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited responses to any of these zzso We progressively truncated this domain and tested zzso for zzso zzso Although zzso was able to activate the zzso zzso fully with the first 58 zzso zzso its potency was 3 orders of magnitude lower than that at the zzso zzso After zzso of 114 zzso there was no response to zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were fully active at receptors having up to 149 zzso zzso zzso Those compounds finally became inactive after zzso of 153 zzso zzso and/or zzso replacement of the region of the zzso zzso between zzso 150 and 153 resulted in marked reduction in zzso responses to these compounds, with some zzso differences observed, supporting a critical role for this zzso zzso studies further supported distinct sites of action of small molecules relative to that of zzso These findings focus attention on the potential importance of the zzso region of the zzso zzso of the Family B zzso zzso for zzso drug zzso
