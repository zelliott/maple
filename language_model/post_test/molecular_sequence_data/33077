zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso the zzso agent of zzso disease in cattle and zzso has unique iron requirements in that it is zzso for zzso in zzso The zzso regulator zzso is a zzso global regulator responsible for maintaining iron zzso in zzso tuberculosis zzso We identified an zzso segment in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso % zzso acid identity to zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso protection zzso confirmed that zzso binds the 19 zzso consensus motif zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of zzso from multiple zzso revealed a zzso change zzso exclusive to sheep zzso zzso gene zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso in two diverse zzso strains and in an zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso suggested that both sheep zzso zzso zzso and cattle zzso zzso zzso repress zzso zzso at high iron zzso and relieve repression at low iron zzso On the other hand, zzso (an iron storage zzso was zzso by zzso when presented with zzso or the cattle zzso zzso promoter, and was zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso or sheep or cattle zzso zzso zzso at high iron zzso The differential iron regulatory mechanisms between zzso genes across strains may contribute to the differential growth or zzso characteristics of sheep and cattle zzso zzso Taken together, our study provides a possible reason for zzso dependency and suggests strong implications in the differential iron acquisition and storage mechanisms in zzso
