The zzso zzso species complex is currently known as zzso zzso groups I and zzso Here we describe zzso zzso group II as a new species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as new a variety of zzso zzso group I using zzso and molecular zzso These zzso and other relatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be differentiated by the commercial methods now used for zzso zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differed from the other zzso of zzso zzso in the sequence of the internal transcribed zzso zzso regions of the nuclear zzso gene zzso The new species and the new variety have a zzso zzso profile, which includes high zzso of zzso B zzso mean zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Identification of these species should be based on molecular methods, such as sequence analysis of ITS regions and zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso
