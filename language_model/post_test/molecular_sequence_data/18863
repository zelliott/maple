zzso X receptors zzso are zzso partners for several other nuclear zzso and they play a key role in several signaling zzso Despite being a zzso zzso partner, this nuclear zzso is a target of therapeutic intervention through zzso using selective zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso a large zzso change in the zzso that allows for zzso recruitment to its surface and enhanced zzso Here we reveal the structural and zzso changes produced when a zzso zzso binds to the human zzso zzso binding domain containing two clinically relevant zzso zzso and zzso Our results show that the structural changes are very similar for each zzso and similar to those for the zzso zzso zzso The four structural changes involve key zzso on zzso 3, zzso 4, and zzso 11 that move from a zzso environment to one that interacts extensively with zzso zzso zzso exchange mass zzso reveals that the dynamics of zzso 3, 11, and 12 are significantly decreased when the two zzso are bound to the zzso When the zzso zzso acid is bound to the zzso only the dynamics of zzso 3 and 11 are zzso The four structural changes are zzso in all zzso structures of the zzso zzso domain in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso They serve as hallmarks for how zzso changes zzso and dynamics in the presence of zzso and zzso to initiate zzso
