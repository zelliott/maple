An zzso approach to the identification of neuroendocrine cells in the zzso of the chicken was taken based on a novel zzso zzso against turkey zzso A zzso a classic marker protein for neuroendocrine zzso zzso cells were readily observed in the zzso and were typically confined to the zzso side of the zzso junction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed local production of zzso in the zzso The majority of zzso cells were small and round or oval in shape but some cells were larger and had conspicuous zzso zzso double zzso experiments with zzso against zzso zzso and with a neural crest marker zzso indicated no zzso overlap between the zzso cells and either of the above cell zzso demonstrating the existence of three distinct zzso cell populations in the avian zzso
