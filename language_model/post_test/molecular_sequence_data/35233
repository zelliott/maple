zzso branches in higher plants are often maintained at specific angles with respect to gravity, a quantity known as the zzso zzso angle zzso zzso Despite the importance of zzso control as a fundamental zzso of plant form, the mechanisms underlying zzso angled growth are not zzso Here we address the central questions of how stable zzso growth of a branch at a zzso angle is maintained and of how the value of that angle is zzso We show that zzso lateral root and shoot branches are distinguished from the primary axis by the existence of an zzso zzso offset mechanism that operates in tension with zzso response to generate angled zzso zzso Further, we show that the zzso of lateral roots and shoots is dependent upon the magnitude of the zzso offset zzso Finally, we show that zzso specifies zzso values zzso throughout development by regulating the magnitude of the zzso offset component via zzso zzso signaling within the zzso cells of the root and zzso The involvement of zzso in controlling zzso is yet another example of zzso remarkable capacity to zzso in development zzso and provides a conceptual framework for understanding the zzso of zzso throughout zzso
