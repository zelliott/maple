We have investigated zzso interactions and the incorporation of zzso into the guide zzso and zzso components of the zzso in a zzso extract from zzso zzso The terminal zzso zzso complex zzso is probably involved in the maturation of the zzso tail of the zzso but the biological function and zzso nature of the remaining zzso is not zzso We have found that the relative extent of labeling of the zzso components is dependent on the zzso concentration: at low levels, the main zzso zzso components labeled are the zzso in zzso at higher levels, the zzso in all of the zzso are zzso zzso We also show a tentative correlation in the migration pattern of zzso zzso and complexes which bind zzso labeled zzso The relative extent of binding to specific complexes is dependent upon the type of zzso Most of the interactions between the labeled zzso and proteins can be disrupted by zzso or a large excess of zzso but two labeled complexes were resistant to zzso Most of the binding of labeled zzso zzso is disrupted by competition with a large excess of zzso but zzso of the extract with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso uncovered a high affinity complex, which involves at least two proteins interacting with the bound zzso A knowledge of the zzso and protein components may aid in understanding the biological roles of these zzso zzso
