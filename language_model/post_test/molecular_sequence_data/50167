zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene family from zzso zzso was investigated in response to treatment with the heavy metal cadmium zzso A fourth member of the SAT gene family, zzso was also cloned and the complete SAT gene family from zzso zzso is zzso Northern analysis of the gene family revealed zzso expression patterns for each zzso zzso zzso plants grown under 50 zzso zzso for a 24 h time course were also used for northern zzso zzso of all SAT genes was increased to some extent by zzso zzso zzso expression showed particularly high levels of induction in the leaves of treated plants and was chosen for study by in zzso zzso zzso expression was induced in the root and stem zzso and the leaf zzso and zzso in response to heavy metal zzso SAT and its product zzso have previously been shown to be implicated in the control of zzso reduction and zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that specific SAT zzso have a role in increasing zzso production under conditions of zzso stress when increased zzso of zzso and zzso is required for zzso zzso
