To begin to understand the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso infections, we constructed zzso defective in expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was used to identify a LOS zzso of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso produced a LOS zzso that lacked the zzso zzso zzso zzso and migrated with an increased mobility on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the principal LOS zzso contains zzso A, zzso and two of the three core zzso zzso zzso was transformed with a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso DNA, and a clone producing the zzso LOS was zzso zzso analysis of the zzso insert revealed one open reading frame zzso that encodes a protein with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso A second zzso had zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Individual zzso zzso lacking expression of the putative zzso zzso zzso III, the putative zzso and both zzso were constructed and zzso Each zzso was zzso with the representative zzso genes in trans to restore expression of parental LOS and confirm the function of each zzso zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso analysis identified several unique LOS zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso repeats added to the terminal region of the main LOS branch zzso by the zzso III zzso These novel zzso zzso zzso provide important tools for studying the regulation of LOS assembly and zzso
