The zzso zzso is a two zzso bridge zzso 16 zzso acid long zzso toxin isolated from the marine snail zzso zzso This toxin has been found to be a highly selective and potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso of the zzso zzso To improve the zzso of this zzso two zzso zzso of zzso have been zzso the first by zzso zzso acid zzso to the N zzso zzso and the second by replacing zzso in the zzso sequence with this zzso acid zzso Both zzso linear peptides were then oxidized under standard zzso zzso zzso shift analysis of these peptides and comparison with the native zzso zzso showed that the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso was consistent with that of the native zzso whereas the zzso analogue formed the correct zzso bridges but failed to adopt the native zzso zzso zzso The N zzso zzso was also found to inhibit zzso of the zzso zzso with equal potency to the parent zzso whereas the zzso analogue showed no zzso zzso The active zzso analogue was found to exhibit significantly improved zzso across zzso cell zzso compared to the native zzso and both peptides showed negligible zzso
