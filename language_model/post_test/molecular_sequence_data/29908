We determined the zzso sequences of the long terminal repeats zzso from mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso acquired in two zzso mouse zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso from zzso contained a zzso deletion from zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso region of the zzso whereas the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso involved both a similar zzso deletion and generation of a tandem repeat region consisting of sequences of zzso zzso To assess the function of the rearranged zzso we constructed plasmids in which normal and rearranged zzso drove the reporter zzso zzso gene and zzso them into zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso tumor cell line zzso Both rearranged zzso were zzso active, but normal zzso were not active in either the presence or absence of zzso in all zzso zzso In zzso cells, however, the zzso zzso zzso showed the same zzso or zzso zzso activity as did normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso acquired a novel zzso by zzso and thus had a high zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso using plasmids with various zzso zzso zzso revealed that the rearranged zzso had lost their negative regulatory element and contained an zzso element that was highly zzso to the zzso A element of zzso (from zzso 525 to zzso zzso but not zzso mouse zzso contained this zzso These results zzso some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the selection of zzso zzso with rearranged zzso in zzso zzso
