zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso mechanism that involves breaking and reforming of zzso interactions at the interface of the zzso and zzso channel zzso We found previously that the head domain of the single copy C zzso zzso binds one zzso zzso zzso with high affinity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we generated a zzso construct of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso A zzso molecular envelope was calculated for the zzso zzso using small angle zzso scattering zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso binds the zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso of 22 and 33 zzso zzso We speculate that the spatial closeness of the zzso zzso and zzso binding sites in the intact zzso results in a zzso interaction that is able to resist the zzso of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso is initiated by breaking either the zzso or zzso interaction by an zzso unknown signaling zzso
