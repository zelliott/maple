zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso thereby changing their physical properties and preventing their action via the zzso zzso These zzso steroids no longer diffuse freely across the zzso zzso instead, they are exported by members of the zzso cassette family, such as zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the regulation of zzso and zzso during human zzso zzso zzso zzso The transcripts for zzso and zzso were cloned by zzso and the regulation of their zzso was studied in zzso zzso obtained during zzso at 0, 12, 24, 30, 33, 36, and 39 h after zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso analyses showed significant changes in zzso levels of both zzso and zzso zzso after zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, a significant increase in zzso transcript was observed zzso h after zzso Similarly, zzso transcript levels were induced in zzso cells zzso h after zzso In contrast, no significant changes in either zzso or zzso were detected in zzso zzso samples after zzso The increase in zzso and zzso transcripts observed in zzso cells was reflected in preparations of intact zzso walls, suggesting that the zzso cell layer contributes the majority of zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso zzso is accompanied not only by a decrease in 17 zzso zzso but also by an increase in expression of genes responsible for zzso zzso and elimination from zzso cells, such as zzso and zzso zzso
