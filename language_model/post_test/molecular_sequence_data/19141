zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso zzso domain have been implicated in zzso interactions and zzso To determine the role of these proteins in the mold pathogen zzso zzso we deleted the entire family of three zzso genes zzso zzso and in all zzso We found an additive increase in the zzso of the single, double and triple zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso compounds zzso Red zzso and zzso White zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso proteins are involved in stabilizing the cell zzso No defects in growth or zzso were observed, indicating that zzso proteins do not have an essential role in the zzso of zzso zzso Unlike in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins were not implicated in zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso deletion strain did not exhibit altered zzso in either insect or zzso models of infection, suggesting that zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso zzso domain are not a significant zzso factor in zzso zzso
