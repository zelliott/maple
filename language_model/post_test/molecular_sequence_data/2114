The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso is necessary for the proper development of the embryonic zzso and adult zzso We have identified the lab zzso unit within the zzso portion of the zzso Complex zzso by mapping the molecular zzso associated with zzso rearranged lab zzso We present its molecular structure, zzso zzso and zzso pattern of zzso In addition, using zzso generated against a fusion zzso we show that in the zzso the lab protein is distributed in neural and zzso cells of the zzso zzso in a discrete loop of the zzso and in specific zzso sensory cells of the zzso zzso zzso and tail zzso The regions of lab expression in the developing zzso represent zzso zzso that are anterior to and largely zzso with the zzso of expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso two other zzso zzso of the zzso that also function to direct the development of head zzso Furthermore, lab head expression is associated with the complex cellular movements of head zzso a process that not only is defective in lab zzso but the failure of which appears to be largely responsible for the defects observed in zzso zzso Finally, we suggest that lab head expression provides a molecular marker for an zzso segment, an ancestral segment that has become zzso zzso during the evolution of the insect zzso
