The zzso sequence and the predicted zzso acid sequences for open reading frames zzso zzso in the zzso D zzso of zzso zzso DNA show an organization and conservation of potential zzso between zzso and zzso Five zzso zzso within early region 3 zzso and shared with the corresponding region of zzso can be zzso four of these potential coding regions also share zzso to zzso found in zzso of zzso and zzso The fiber gene of late region 5 zzso is also apparent within this zzso zzso mapping experiments show that the zzso and 3' boundaries of the main zzso in fiber zzso lie at each end of the proposed fiber zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence for zzso fiber shares zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso but only zzso to zzso zzso Surprisingly, there are three regions of partial zzso acid zzso near the zzso and zzso of the predicted fiber gene sequences from zzso zzso zzso and zzso these zzso regions may be important for interaction with zzso base, for proper folding of the zzso of the zzso or for recognition of the cellular zzso to which zzso zzso during zzso
