The zzso gene encodes one of the two major small heat shock proteins of zzso zzso zzso accumulates zzso in zzso cells exposed to heat zzso zzso zzso stress, and high zzso of alcohol as well as in zzso zzso We have cloned an extended zzso region of the zzso gene in order to identify zzso elements involved in regulation of this highly expressed stress zzso A detailed analysis of the zzso promoter region revealed that five repeats of the zzso zzso motif zzso element zzso are essential to zzso zzso induced levels on a reporter gene upon zzso heat zzso and entry into stationary zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes leads to a dramatic decrease of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, whereas overproduction of zzso produces a fivefold increase in zzso induced levels upon a shift to a high salt zzso On the other hand, zzso resulting in high protein zzso A zzso activity reduce or abolish the zzso of the zzso zzso in stressed zzso zzso zzso containing defective zzso zzso zzso exhibit high zzso levels of zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is a target of the zzso zzso zzso response zzso under negative control of the zzso zzso Furthermore, they confirm earlier observations that zzso sequences are responsive to a broad range of stresses and that the zzso and zzso pathways have zzso effects upon zzso zzso
