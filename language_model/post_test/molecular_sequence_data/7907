Many features of Down syndrome might result from the zzso of only a few genes located in a critical region of zzso zzso To search for these zzso zzso mapping in this region were isolated and used for zzso zzso One of the trapped zzso obtained has a sequence very similar to part of the zzso single-minded zzso zzso a master regulator of the early development of the fly central nervous system zzso zzso data indicated that this zzso sequence is only present in the Down zzso region in the human zzso zzso of this zzso sequence with human fetal kidney zzso zzso revealed two transcripts of 6 and zzso zzso In zzso zzso of a probe derived from this zzso with human and rat fetuses showed that the corresponding gene is expressed during early fetal life in the central nervous system and in other zzso including the zzso skull, zzso and vertebra zzso The expression pattern of this gene suggests that it might be involved in the zzso of some of the zzso features and brain anomalies observed in Down zzso
