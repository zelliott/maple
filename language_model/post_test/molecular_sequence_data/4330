Four members of the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso family have been characterized so far, designated as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are capable of zzso the activities of all known zzso zzso zzso and as such play a key role in maintaining the balance between zzso zzso zzso deposition and degradation in different zzso zzso zzso breakdown of zzso occurs in various pathological zzso including zzso chronic degenerative diseases and tumor zzso zzso and zzso can inhibit tumor growth, invasion, and zzso in experimental models which has been associated with their zzso zzso zzso Recent developments in zzso research suggest that zzso and zzso are zzso proteins with diverse zzso Both zzso exhibit growth zzso activity and can inhibit zzso zzso studies have separated the zzso zzso activity of zzso from its growth promoting zzso zzso has also been implicated in zzso zzso and as a cellular zzso zzso zzso is the only member of the zzso family which is found exclusively in the zzso zzso zzso It is regulated in a cell zzso fashion in certain cell types and may serve as a marker for terminal zzso The most recently discovered zzso zzso may function in a zzso fashion in zzso zzso zzso The main aim of this article is to review recent literature on zzso with special emphasis on their biological activities and the possibility that they may have paradoxical roles in tumor zzso
