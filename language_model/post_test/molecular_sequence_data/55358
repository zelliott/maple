zzso and zzso are zzso zzso proteins functioning in the zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso They harbor an zzso zzso domain zzso a mobile evolutionary unit that has been found in a number of other zzso proteins and zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso related to zzso in zzso proteins zzso folate receptors and zzso proteins zzso and zzso Type C1 proteins zzso referred to as zzso exhibit similar structures and zzso connectivity patterns compared with zzso We used zzso analyses to expand the zzso set of zzso and zzso providing a better understanding of their evolution and zzso First, zzso proteins with various domain compositions were identified in several major zzso lineages including plants and zzso revealing a wider zzso distribution of zzso than previously zzso Second, two new and distinct groups of highly divergent zzso were found by sensitive similarity zzso One of them is present in the calcium channel component zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso proteins in zzso Members of the other new zzso group occur in the zzso zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso proteins that are putative tumor zzso acting as zzso of zzso zzso Finally, sequence and three-dimensional structural comparisons helped us uncover a divergent zzso in zzso which are important zzso zzso zzso zzso Such a finding reinforces the evolutionary ties between the zzso and zzso signaling pathways and underscores the importance of gene zzso in creating essential signaling components in zzso zzso
