zzso zzso is one of the main mechanisms of regulation of genes involved in zzso acid metabolism in zzso zzso zzso regulatory sites consist of zzso sequence and zzso secondary structure zzso Using a set of known zzso sites, we constructed the common pattern and used it to scan available bacterial zzso New zzso were found in various zzso bacteria, some zzso bacteria zzso and some other bacterial groups zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso genes zzso zzso zzso Two other groups of zzso genes are zzso acid zzso genes and zzso as well as genes with unknown zzso Analysis of candidate zzso sites resulted in new functional zzso We assigned the zzso acid specificity to a large number of candidate zzso acid zzso and a possible function to zzso acid zzso zzso We then studied the evolution of the zzso Analysis of the constructed zzso trees demonstrated that in addition to the normal evolution consistent with the evolution of regulated zzso zzso may be zzso transferred to other zzso and change zzso We observed several cases of recent zzso zzso expansion following the loss of a previously existing regulatory system, in particular, zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Finally, we described a new structural class of zzso containing duplicated zzso elements and unusual reduced zzso regulating initiation of translation in the zzso
