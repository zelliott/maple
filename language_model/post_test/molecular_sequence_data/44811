The zzso zzso zzso is characteristically expressed on a series of cell zzso molecules and also on some zzso in the nervous system over a wide range of species from insect to zzso The zzso zzso is involved in zzso and/or zzso interaction and recognition during the development of the nervous zzso In this study, we isolated a novel zzso from rat brain, which is a key zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso on zzso Based on the partial zzso acid zzso we isolated zzso zzso the zzso The primary structure deduced from the zzso sequence predicted a type II zzso protein with 347 zzso acids and had no zzso similarity with any other proteins of known functions, including zzso of the liver and zzso zzso zzso of a soluble zzso form of the zzso in zzso cells produced an active zzso The selective expression of the zzso gene in the nervous system was consistent with the almost exclusive zzso of the zzso zzso in the nervous zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso cells induced not only expression of the zzso zzso on the cell surface but also marked zzso changes of the cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso associates with the zzso zzso
