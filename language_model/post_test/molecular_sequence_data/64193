zzso zzso that can identify the presence of zzso virus zzso sequences in an unknown DNA sample were developed using principles established for the amplification zzso zzso system zzso The zzso specificity zzso unique single zzso zzso zzso identified among zzso zzso zzso of the zzso virus Copenhagen strain zzso and zzso zzso When a zzso virus specific primer was used with a consensus primer in an zzso zzso with different zzso zzso a zzso product was only amplified from zzso virus zzso zzso a second consensus primer into the zzso produced a multiplex zzso that provided zzso generic and zzso products with zzso virus zzso We tested two single zzso zzso with a panel of 43 zzso virus zzso collected over 40 years from countries across the world, and have shown that they provide reliable markers for zzso virus zzso The zzso virus specific zzso did not produce zzso with either zzso format when tested with 50 other zzso DNA zzso Our analysis shows that these two zzso were zzso in zzso virus zzso and provide a reliable signature of zzso species zzso
