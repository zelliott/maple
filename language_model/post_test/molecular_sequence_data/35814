The in zzso effect of three zzso peptides on zzso release from term zzso tissue was zzso These peptides were zzso for zzso receptors of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and delta zzso zzso All peptides zzso zzso release and their zzso zzso were bell zzso Their order of potency was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso release by any of the peptides was totally reversed by zzso antagonists, indicating that the action of peptides is zzso by zzso zzso zzso In order to confirm the specificity of zzso regulation of zzso release, three zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso with binding proteins and receptors known to be present in zzso tissue zzso were also zzso zzso of zzso release caused by certain zzso of zzso drugs was not reversed by zzso antagonists, demonstrating that their effect is not zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso curve of zzso was zzso suggesting the presence of a mechanism regulating zzso release that is not zzso by zzso zzso zzso Data presented in this manuscript indicate that zzso zzso receptors mediate one of the mechanisms regulating zzso release from zzso tissue and confirm our earlier results using zzso zzso
