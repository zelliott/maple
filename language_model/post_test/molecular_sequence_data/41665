We previously developed a screening method to identify proteins that undergo zzso through zzso by zzso zzso and found that rat zzso I is a target protein for zzso zzso et zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized another zzso protein from a rat zzso preparation that has a zzso mass of zzso thereby zzso its zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and subsequent zzso mass zzso using zzso laser zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso revealed that the zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso zzso With zzso rat zzso we found that zzso is zzso bound to zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in the zzso of its zzso activity, release of zinc zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso which zzso the active site zinc zzso and zzso play a crucial role in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso markedly prevented zzso of zzso Such a protective effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso caused by zzso is zzso
