There has been growing interest in the role of the zzso zzso regulatory zzso family of zzso factors in the regulation of immune responses, zzso zzso and zzso These members are characterized by their zzso DNA binding zzso at the zzso zzso Here we report the zzso A resolution crystal structure of the DNA binding domain of one such family member, zzso bound to zzso The structure reveals its recognition zzso zzso zzso recognized bases are zzso and in bold, and N indicates any zzso and its cooperative binding to a tandem repeat of the zzso core sequence induced by DNA structure zzso These facts explain well the diverse binding properties of the zzso family members, which bind to both single and zzso repeated zzso Furthermore, we also identified the zzso zzso at the C zzso of the recognition zzso as a metal binding site that is commonly found in certain classes of zzso zzso Our results provide new insights into the structure and function of this family of zzso zzso
