The zzso of zzso mouse zzso cells for zzso zzso virus zzso infection is due to a failure of such cells to transcribe the zzso zzso genes following viral zzso We have zzso both zzso cells and zzso cells with zzso in which each of the 5 zzso promoters drives expression of the readily zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These experiments show that the lack of zzso gene zzso in zzso cells is due to the weak activity of the five zzso promoters in these cells compared to that observed in a range of zzso cell zzso This effect is zzso both by zzso elements and by sequences present in the minimal zzso The different effects of DNA concentration on the activities of the minimal and complete promoters suggests that the zzso sequences act by binding a zzso factor present in zzso cells whilst the weak activity of the minimal promoter results from the absence of a positive factor in such zzso
