zzso of growth of the malaria zzso zzso zzso by known zzso antibiotics has generated interest in understanding their action on the translation apparatus of the two zzso containing zzso of the malaria zzso the zzso and the relic zzso zzso We report zzso activity of zzso zzso proteins that are targeted to the zzso and further use these to test the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso on the zzso zzso Our results monitoring zzso of zzso onto surrogate zzso coli zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso by the factor indicate that zzso has a greater effect on zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso of a three zzso acid zzso sequence in the switch I loop that is zzso in proteins of the zzso zzso family and the zzso zzso factor, but is absent in zzso zzso demonstrated that this motif contributes to differential zzso of the two zzso by zzso Additionally, the drug zzso that is known to target the zzso and zzso enhanced retention of only zzso zzso on zzso providing support for the reported effect of the drug on zzso zzso zzso
