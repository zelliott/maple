To zzso the mechanism for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso via feedback zzso we constructed several zzso zzso between zzso zzso AK II, a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso each having the same zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso named zzso composed of the zzso alpha zzso that comprises of the zzso zzso region from zzso zzso AK II and the zzso region from zzso zzso and the beta zzso from zzso zzso was inhibited only by zzso Another zzso zzso zzso which has a similar structure to that of zzso but lacks the beta zzso having zzso zzso structure, was also responsive only to zzso However, the addition of zzso enhanced the activity of zzso These results indicate the regulatory function of zzso region and beta zzso in zzso zzso showed extremely high zzso comparable to that of zzso zzso suggesting that the beta zzso also contributed to the stability of the zzso
