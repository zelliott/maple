Different species of zzso are responsible for the diverse zzso associated with zzso including zzso zzso which results in fatal visceral infection and zzso major which causes zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to identify zzso differences between these related Old World zzso species which contribute to their distinct zzso zzso we have introduced a zzso zzso zzso library into zzso major to select for zzso zzso sequences which may increase zzso major zzso in zzso zzso Through this approach, we have identified a region of the zzso zzso zzso which increased zzso in both visceral and zzso sites and was divergent from the corresponding region of the zzso major zzso When these zzso zzso sequences were reintroduced into zzso major, they enhanced the overall zzso of zzso major, increasing its ability to survive in both visceral and zzso zzso The region responsible for increased infection levels was determined to be the zzso gene array derived from zzso 36 of zzso zzso Pulse field zzso revealed that zzso zzso contained zzso gene sequences in several zzso locations as opposed to zzso major which contains zzso gene sequences only in zzso zzso Because of the requirement for zzso transcripts in maturation of zzso in zzso this observation suggests that the increased expression of zzso genes is associated with increased zzso As the zzso sequence for zzso becomes available, the in zzso selection procedure described within will be useful to identify additional zzso sequences responsible for different zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso
