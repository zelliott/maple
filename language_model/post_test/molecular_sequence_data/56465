We present a case of a 27-year-old female suffering from chronic zzso zzso with diabetes zzso zzso examinations and zzso pancreatic function tests revealed considerable zzso of pancreatic ducts with large zzso zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso zzso Recent literature indicates that a decrease in the activity of pancreatic stone protein zzso which zzso zzso crystal formation in pancreatic juice, is closely related to the development of chronic zzso zzso The patient had no apparent cause or family history of zzso We therefore investigated the possibility that zzso in the zzso gene might explain the chronic zzso seen in this zzso Six zzso of the zzso gene amplified by zzso chain reaction were directly zzso but there was no apparent base zzso zzso Furthermore, Southern zzso analysis revealed neither zzso nor deletion of the zzso gene in the zzso DNA of this zzso However, this genetic approach will be useful for future study of the zzso of zzso zzso
