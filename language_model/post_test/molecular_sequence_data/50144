The zzso gene has a pair of alternatively spliced zzso The smooth muscle zzso zzso is zzso in most cell types by zzso tract binding protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family zzso zzso regulators whose activities are altered in zzso dystrophy, were found to zzso regulate selection of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated the zzso zzso and along with zzso they were also able to repress zzso of the zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was associated with displacement of zzso from the zzso tract by binding of zzso at adjacent zzso Our data provides direct evidence for the activity of zzso proteins as both zzso and zzso of zzso within a zzso system of alternative zzso and suggests a model zzso zzso alternative zzso is regulated by synergistic and zzso interactions between members of the zzso and zzso zzso
