zzso of three clones zzso zzso and zzso selected from a chronic zzso leukemia zzso library was studied by zzso acid zzso in human zzso leukemia cells zzso treated with chemical zzso of cell differentiation and in primary cells derived from 27 patients with leukemia or zzso zzso The differentiation of zzso cells into zzso cells upon induction by zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by rapid induction of the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The levels of expression of the zzso gene were not altered during zzso or zzso differentiation of zzso zzso The expression of the zzso and/or zzso gene was induced by zzso in four of 6 samples derived from patients who achieved complete zzso but not in any of the acute zzso leukemia samples from patients who failed to achieve complete zzso These findings suggest that expression of the zzso and zzso genes is related to zzso differentiation and that zzso of these gene expressions in fresh leukemia cells after one hour of zzso treatment are of zzso significance in predicting the response to zzso
