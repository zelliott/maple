We have cloned the human zzso alkaline zzso zzso gene using a zzso zzso zzso as a zzso The gene is divided into 12 zzso and is likely to exist as a single copy in zzso zzso As compared with the gene isolated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso another leader zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso was assigned about zzso zzso upstream from zzso 2 and the alternative zzso in the first zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that three species of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in liver and zzso zzso
