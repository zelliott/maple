To study zzso by short zzso chain zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso 

We screened four zzso acid zzso of zzso that are adjacent to the zzso ring of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by using multiple sequence alignment and zzso zzso zzso were introduced by zzso zzso The zzso proteins were zzso zzso and zzso 

The relative activities of zzso zzso and zzso against the zzso zzso zzso decreased to 51% and zzso respectively, and against the zzso zzso zzso decreased to zzso and zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso might be related to zzso zzso The relative activity of zzso zzso and zzso lost zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that the processes of zzso transfer from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso were blocked in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso located at the activity center of zzso and play roles as zzso sites for the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
