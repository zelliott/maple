In this study we have examined effects of synthetic zzso fragments of zzso on the kinetic properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the loss of zzso of zzso activity after zzso zzso at the zzso portion of zzso and a systematic search for synthetic peptides with zzso activity spanning the zzso zzso we concluded that the zzso domain is the most important in the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, there are multiple attachment sites in zzso for its interaction with zzso and these sites reside in the zzso sequences of zzso Probably for this reason the intact zzso exhibited higher zzso potential than its zzso zzso Based on the deduced zzso zzso derived for the synthetic zzso we concluded that zzso is likely to exhibit a zzso role in regulating zzso activity since the derived zzso zzso for the zzso interaction are within the zzso concentration range of plasma zzso In addition, as the synthetic zzso lacks the zzso zzso we also concluded that the presence of the zzso in native zzso is not essential for its zzso activity on zzso The fact that the zzso zzso for zzso of zzso at 50% zzso decreases for zzso when zzso in the presence of zzso indicated that the zzso actually caused an increased affinity between zzso and zzso and demonstrated that zzso does not compete for the zzso site of zzso
