zzso zzso hormone zzso in zzso cells of the zzso of zzso zzso was detected by zzso in zzso zzso zzso using two zzso zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso Two distinct clusters of positive cells were observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Only one of them gave a strong zzso after incubation with a specific zzso zzso serum and corresponded to the conventionally described zzso producing zzso The significance of the cells reacting positively in zzso but not in zzso zzso is zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso confirms the specificity of the zzso and indicates an approximate size of zzso zzso for zzso zzso
