In our efforts to explore possible roles of proteins with a zzso domain, which is a zzso zzso zzso in differentiation and zzso in the zzso we have cloned a human zzso gene and identified two alternative zzso zzso and zzso which are probably due to variation in zzso zzso The former encodes a protein containing two zzso zzso a zzso domain, and a zzso domain, while the latter has only one and half zzso zzso The predominance of the two transcripts appears to be regulated in a zzso zzso zzso of the regulation is also observed in some cancer cell zzso zzso studies have shown an association of zzso and zzso proteins with the zzso and zzso zzso the former is distributed in the zzso and nucleus and the latter occurs mainly in the zzso and is scarcely zzso to the zzso In contrast, a truncated zzso has a nuclear location, not showing the protein zzso
