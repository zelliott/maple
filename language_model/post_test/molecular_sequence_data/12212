All the cloned zzso of zzso receptors zzso belong to the type II zzso zzso family zzso Although three members of zzso zzso on human zzso 21 share a 50 zzso acid zzso zzso domain (the zzso zzso a fourth zzso the second cloned chain of the type I zzso zzso contains a zzso 20 zzso acid stretch of high similarity to the zzso domain that stops zzso zzso of the zzso portion of the zzso zzso domain with sequence databases revealed a very high similarity to zzso repeat zzso We provide evidence that all but 18 zzso acids of the predicted zzso domain of the zzso chain are zzso by an zzso cassette in its zzso zzso zzso of an zzso cassette into the zzso chain is proposed to occur by a zzso zzso All previous zzso examples of zzso of an zzso zzso cassette into an open reading frame have involved alternative zzso Thus, we predict the existence of an alternatively spliced product of the zzso chain with a substantially different zzso zzso
