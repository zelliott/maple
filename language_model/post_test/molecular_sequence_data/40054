zzso characteristically possess a zzso shell and show an extensive reduction of the trunk zzso To gain insight into the evolution of this animal group, we focused on the underlying mechanism of the zzso zzso pattern associated with the zzso zzso which zzso into both skeleton and zzso We isolated zzso a member of the zzso gene family expressed in the zzso from the Chinese zzso turtle zzso zzso We detected a deletion of 12 sequential zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso which appears to be shared by the turtle zzso The expression pattern of zzso in zzso zzso zzso differed from those of its zzso in other zzso especially in the zzso region of the zzso We also identified two zzso of the zzso zzso a normal form similar to those of other zzso and a short form produced by a zzso zzso The short zzso showed weaker zzso activity in cultured cells than that of the normal zzso although the tissue distribution of the two zzso overlapped zzso We propose that the unusual features of zzso may be related to the unique zzso patterns of this animal group, and constitute one of the molecular bases for their evolutionary zzso
