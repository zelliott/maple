We have recently isolated a zzso circulating protein of human zzso zzso zzso as the natural zzso of the orphan zzso zzso Here we describe a simplified method for the isolation of zzso zzso protein from Chinese zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Using a zzso column followed by two reversed phase zzso steps resulted in the isolation of pure biologically active zzso Two processed zzso forms of Chinese zzso zzso were identified by zzso sequencing and zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso mass fingerprint analysis, representing the zzso acid zzso zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with the predicted zzso indicates a zzso or modification within the zzso end of the zzso
