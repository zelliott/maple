The biological effects of zzso Y zzso rat pancreatic zzso zzso hybrid zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso fragments of zzso were studied in the zzso rat zzso zzso zzso The results were correlated with zzso binding experiments in zzso and zzso zzso zzso on rat zzso cells and zzso receptors on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso induced zzso in the zzso zzso with an zzso of 25 and 22 zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso could not totally block muscle zzso The zzso action of the long zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso indicated that zzso acts through a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The structural basis for the differential recognition of zzso and zzso by zzso receptors and partly also by zzso zzso could be defined with hybrid zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso reacted in the zzso zzso preparation in accordance with their relative potency in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which bound to the zzso zzso like zzso was also able to block the part of the zzso response which was resistant to zzso It is concluded that in the zzso zzso zzso peptides act through two types of zzso zzso and zzso and that zzso in the zzso part of the molecules determine the differential recognition of the peptides by these zzso zzso
