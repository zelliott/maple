The correspondence between the zzso ratio and the neighboring base composition in zzso DNA is zzso For 18 zzso regions of the zzso zzso alignments between rice zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were generated by two different zzso zzso of aligning zzso DNA are discussed, and the alignments are analyzed in a manner that reduces alignment zzso zzso divergence is zzso zzso so multiple zzso at a site are assumed to be zzso zzso zzso were analyzed with respect to the zzso content of the two immediately zzso zzso It is shown that as this content increases, the proportion of zzso also zzso When both the zzso and zzso zzso are G or C zzso content of zzso only zzso of the observed zzso are zzso However, when both the zzso and zzso zzso are A or T zzso content of zzso 57% of the observed zzso are zzso zzso the influence of zzso base composition on zzso previously reported for a single zzso region, is a general feature of the zzso zzso
