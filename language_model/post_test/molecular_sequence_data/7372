zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that plays a role in cell wall growth and zzso To study its regulation, we isolated a zzso defective in zzso release under certain growth zzso This zzso had cell walls which apparently lacked zzso zzso but which accumulated two zzso fragments of 32 and 43 zzso which exhibited zzso activity in the membrane zzso By zzso zzso we identified a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso containing a gene cluster coding for proteins of 58 to 137 zzso zzso One of these genes zzso which zzso a zzso zzso was shown to complement the zzso of the A9 zzso in zzso We propose that this gene may be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
