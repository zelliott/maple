zzso zzso of Wilson disease zzso gene in 16 Japanese patients with Wilson disease was zzso A truncated size in a region of zzso 4 to 6 was found by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso covering entire 21 zzso except zzso 1 for liver zzso of one patient with a late onset zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso revealed that this zzso was occurred by skipping of zzso 5, though any zzso in zzso 5 of zzso DNA was failed to zzso T to G zzso in 5 zzso upstream from a junction of zzso 4 and zzso 5 was found in zzso DNA of the zzso Further, results obtained by zzso and the sequence analysis in zzso 4 indicate that the zzso of the patient is zzso Since same zzso in one zzso of another patient out of 15 patients was found, zzso frequency of the zzso zzso in Japanese patients is zzso These results suggest that the point zzso in zzso 4 of zzso gene causes the skipping of zzso 5 and the zzso zzso affects the zzso of Wilson zzso
