zzso cell division requires proper zzso placement and functioning of the zzso apparatus that zzso the zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso encodes a novel zzso component of the zzso required for zzso positioning and zzso zzso To gain further insights into zzso function, we screened for dominant zzso of the partial zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso ), and isolated 68 suppressing zzso Eight out of the ten zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso immediately upstream of the zzso in zzso zzso These probably help to stabilize zzso interactions zzso by the zzso zzso This domain was found to be required for binding to several putative zzso interacting zzso proteins identified in zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, interaction with the zzso protein zzso was specifically reduced by the zzso ) zzso and restored by a representative zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso and zzso may zzso around the zzso zzso during zzso indicating potential interaction in zzso The zzso domain of zzso was also found to mediate zzso while the zzso region of zzso was sufficient for interaction with zzso a recently identified component of a zzso zzso zzso A single zzso substitution in the zzso region of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso abolished all zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the zzso functions of zzso depend on interactions with multiple protein partners, and that these interactions are zzso through several different zzso of zzso
