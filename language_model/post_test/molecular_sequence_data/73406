The sites of linear zzso in a variable region of the attachment zzso zzso of respiratory zzso virus zzso that are zzso by the human zzso response were zzso Two sets of overlapping zzso peptides each representing the zzso 84 or 85 zzso acids of the G protein of two group A zzso of human zzso were zzso These peptides were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso for their reactions with zzso obtained from infants with primary zzso zzso Four pairs of overlapping peptides were found to react variously with the zzso the reactions depending on the infecting zzso of zzso Further zzso peptides based on natural zzso in the zzso areas were then zzso to determine the specificity of the human zzso response and it was found that single zzso acid changes could abrogate recognition by these zzso zzso All the linear zzso found are involved in potential zzso sites in at least some zzso of zzso
