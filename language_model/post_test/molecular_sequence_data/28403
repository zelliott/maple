An expression library established in zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso of the human upper zzso tract was screened with an zzso raised against zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso from the most strongly reacting plaque was zzso and compared to known type I zzso zzso The highest degree of zzso was detected with the zzso zzso type I zzso which we consider to be the counterpart of human zzso zzso zzso peptides of zzso 13 were separated on a zzso column and one zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequence obtained supports the identity of the zzso An eight zzso motif has been zzso repeated in the zzso of zzso zzso In spite of substantial divergence by point zzso and zzso the remaining sequence zzso suggest that the zzso of both the human zzso 13 and the zzso zzso protein have originated from a common zzso
