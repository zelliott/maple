The evolution of the zzso zzso zzso locus of zzso 6 zzso zzso was investigated by analyzing sequence variation within three zzso zzso genes from 102 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso variation within these zzso genes was related to the genetic zzso of the zzso determined by zzso sequence zzso and to the zzso patterns of recent evolutionary zzso explored using the zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes had a low percent zzso and there was a low level of sequence diversity in this region among zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was also little sequence divergence between these zzso suggesting a single introduction of an ancestral zzso zzso followed by slight divergence to create zzso zzso and zzso A minority of zzso zzso zzso had zzso sequences zzso 2 zzso that were approximately zzso divergent from those of other zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and which may have arisen by a second, more recent introduction from a related but distinct zzso zzso of a zzso zzso or zzso capsule correlated perfectly with a single zzso zzso within zzso the zzso zzso zzso In addition to ample evidence of the horizontal transfer of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso locus into unrelated zzso there was evidence for relatively frequent changes from zzso zzso to zzso and vice versa, among very closely related zzso and examples of recent zzso events between class 1 and 2 zzso zzso 6 zzso
