The steroid zzso zzso gene is selectively expressed in the adrenal zzso and is zzso regulated by zzso We examined the role of the zzso sequences of zzso in this regulated expression by analyzing their ability to direct the expression of a human growth hormone zzso reporter gene upon zzso into zzso mouse zzso tumor zzso The 330 zzso of zzso sequences directed zzso and zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells, but did not direct expression in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso expression required a functional zzso protein zzso These results indicate that the first 330 zzso of zzso sequences of the zzso gene contain sufficient information for zzso and zzso regulated zzso and that this expression requires the integrity of zzso protein zzso zzso lower expression of zzso was seen when 156 zzso of zzso sequences were placed in front of the reporter zzso suggesting that sequences between zzso and zzso are essential for zzso The addition of sequences from zzso to zzso to the zzso zzso in either the correct or the reverse orientation, restored promoter activity to approximately the level obtained with the 330 zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, the addition of sequences from zzso to zzso increased by zzso the expression of zzso driven by the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we conclude that an zzso element is contained within the sequences from 230 to 150 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation zzso
