zzso proteins seem to play important regulatory roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, a large family of zzso zzso zzso peptides is crucial for the differentiation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is currently the only reported zzso zzso transfer protein necessary for successful zzso zzso in addition, zzso shares several characteristics with zzso zzso a small size, a zzso zzso zzso an zzso signal zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso expression is not restricted to the root zzso and is induced during the early zzso of zzso in root hairs and zzso zzso Recently, zzso was determined to be involved in the regulation of root tissue invasion; while, it was zzso for zzso zzso zzso Here, we discuss the hypothesis that zzso zzso in linking the progression of bacterial invasion with restricting the competence of root hairs for zzso
