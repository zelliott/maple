In zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso form aligned groups of cells, with a characteristic bipolar zzso subsequently become zzso begin to express skeletal zzso and zzso We were interested in whether members of the zzso zzso were involved in zzso We found that the zzso expressed multiple zzso zzso from at least five different classes of the zzso zzso zzso I, II, zzso zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso to zzso regions of zzso All of these zzso zzso were expressed most highly in zzso and their expression decreased as they differentiated into mature zzso by zzso protection zzso and Western zzso However, only zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with zzso zzso in response to the zzso state of the zzso In single cells, zzso I alpha was found at the leading edge, in rear zzso and had a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso as previously described for zzso In aligned groups of cells, all these proteins were found at the plasma zzso zzso for skeletal zzso II, and zzso I alpha showed that zzso I alpha also appeared to be expressed at higher levels in zzso zzso that had begun to express skeletal zzso prior to zzso In early zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso remained localized at the zzso All of the other zzso zzso we looked at, zzso zzso zzso IX and a second zzso of zzso I zzso zzso to zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso which did not change as the zzso zzso In conclusion, although we found that zzso express many different zzso of the zzso zzso only zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to play any direct role in zzso
