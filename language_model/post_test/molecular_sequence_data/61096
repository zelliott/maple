Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that zzso can selectively damage the tight junctions between zzso cells in zzso Recently, we have obtained evidence suggesting that this effect may involve the interaction of zzso with zzso a zzso cell zzso zzso that is localized at the adhering junctions of zzso zzso To begin to determine whether or not zzso might interact directly with the zzso zzso we studied the binding of zzso to zzso B, a zzso zzso zzso that zzso to one of the zzso zzso binding regions of mouse zzso (also known as zzso The binding of zzso to zzso B was evaluated by using an equilibrium zzso technique and the radioactive isotope zzso The effects of the binding on the zzso of the zzso were evaluated by circular zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso bound to zzso B, with a maximum of one zzso binding site per zzso and an apparent zzso constant zzso of 640 zzso The binding of zzso was reduced in the presence of excess zzso an effect that was overcome by raising the concentration of zzso Both zzso and zzso caused a shift in the CD spectrum of the zzso However, the shift produced by zzso was about 3 times the magnitude of that produced by zzso These results indicate that zzso can interact with the zzso binding site on the zzso B zzso and distort the secondary structure of the zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso may be a direct molecular target for zzso zzso
