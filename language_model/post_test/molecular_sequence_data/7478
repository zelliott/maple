zzso was recently demonstrated to be the major target zzso engaged by zzso zzso T zzso zzso We examined zzso expression on various cloned T cell zzso and their zzso to zzso by zzso or zzso zzso A zzso relationship in zzso and zzso expression was observed in zzso T helper zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was predominantly detected in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was principally found in zzso zzso The two zzso clones tested expressed both zzso and zzso but only one exhibited zzso activity, whereas both were sensitive to zzso zzso A functional consequence of the inverse zzso expression pattern was that zzso and zzso cells were sensitive to zzso by both zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso clone in a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso cells may play an zzso role, regulating a zzso response by zzso zzso
