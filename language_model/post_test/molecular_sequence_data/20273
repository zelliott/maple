In zzso zzso interference zzso is a major mechanism of defense against viruses and zzso elements as well of regulating translation of zzso zzso The zzso systems recognize the target zzso molecules via small guide zzso that are completely or partially complementary to a region of the zzso Key components of the zzso systems are proteins of the zzso family some of which function as zzso the zzso that cleave the target zzso that is zzso to a guide zzso Numerous zzso possess the zzso system zzso of defense against zzso and plasmids that is, in part, mechanistically analogous but not zzso to zzso zzso zzso Many zzso also zzso zzso of zzso proteins but their functions remain zzso 

We present a detailed analysis of zzso protein sequences and the zzso neighborhoods of the respective genes in zzso Whereas zzso zzso proteins always contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso fall into two major groups in which the zzso domain is either present or zzso The zzso of each group is supported by a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Almost all zzso that lack a zzso domain appear to be zzso and the respective genes are associated with a variety of predicted zzso in putative zzso An zzso zzso domain that is fused to various zzso appears to be a unique signature of zzso zzso the short zzso zzso zzso zzso By contrast, almost all zzso containing zzso are predicted to be active zzso Some proteins of this group zzso that from zzso zzso have been zzso shown to possess zzso activity, and are not typically associated with genes for other zzso zzso Given these zzso the apparent extensive horizontal transfer of zzso zzso and their common, statistically significant zzso in zzso neighborhoods enriched in genes zzso proteins involved in the defense against zzso and/or zzso we zzso that zzso are key components of a novel class of defense zzso The zzso containing zzso are predicted to directly destroy virus or zzso zzso acids via their zzso activity, whereas the apparently zzso zzso zzso could be structural zzso of protein complexes that contain, as active zzso the putative zzso that we predict to be zzso with these zzso All these zzso are predicted to be DNA zzso so it seems most probable that the putative novel zzso system targets zzso DNA rather than zzso Given that in zzso zzso systems, the zzso domain binds a guide zzso and positions it on the complementary region of the target, we further speculate that zzso function on a similar principle (the guide being either DNA or zzso and that the zzso domain found in putative zzso with the short forms of zzso is a functional substitute for the zzso zzso 

The hypothesis that zzso are key components of a novel zzso immune system that employs guide zzso or DNA molecules to degrade zzso acids of invading mobile elements implies a functional zzso with the zzso zzso and a direct evolutionary connection with zzso zzso The predictions of the hypothesis including both the activities of zzso and those of the associated zzso are readily amenable to experimental zzso
