In a blood zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso are zzso zzso by activated factor zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso To determine the functional significance of zzso zzso zzso we have developed an in zzso model which allows the incorporation of zzso zzso zzso molecules into a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso expression system, we have expressed zzso zzso composed of the zzso zzso region and the first 11 type III repeats zzso with zzso in the zzso at positions 3 and 4 zzso or at 3, 4, and 16 zzso zzso of the zzso incorporation of these zzso into zzso clots confirms that zzso 3 and 4 are major participants in zzso zzso as the zzso of these sites reduces zzso efficiency by zzso Additional zzso of the zzso at position 16, however, eliminates zzso of zzso suggesting that it also may be factor zzso zzso When the zzso zzso clots were used as zzso for cell zzso there was a decrease in both cell attachment and spreading when compared with the zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that for zzso cell attachment to a zzso zzso zzso must be zzso to zzso by factor zzso
