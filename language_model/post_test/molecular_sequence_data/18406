A zzso environment, such as the zzso stationary phase of a zzso zzso zzso may induce zzso structures in potentially zzso zzso If a zzso becomes zzso on binding and contains a preferred binding domain, as in the case of an zzso zzso then some zzso may not be contributing to the same extent to the overall zzso of the zzso zzso zzso structures may play an important role in protein folding and the interaction of zzso zzso with a zzso surface during zzso is likely to be a good mimic of their zzso interactions with other zzso regions in the folded zzso We have designed and zzso two sets of model peptides of 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 zzso having the same composition but different sequences zzso and zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that both sets of peptides had a high potential to form zzso structure in a zzso environment, one set representing zzso zzso structures and the other set representing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that all of the peptides in both sets were zzso when bound to a zzso zzso and also under the conditions used for circular zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso acid composition and similar secondary structure could be separated by zzso zzso The difference in retention time between peptides of the same length increased with the zzso chain zzso ranging from a difference of zzso zzso on a zzso column for the two zzso peptides up to a maximum difference of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso From the observed and predicted retention times of these two sets of peptides during zzso zzso we have demonstrated that it is possible not only to predict the retention behavior of zzso zzso during zzso zzso but also to deduce the presence of zzso zzso structure in peptides based upon their retention zzso If from studies such as these we are eventually able to zzso from only zzso acid sequence information, the secondary structure of a zzso on binding to a zzso zzso we may be able to extrapolate this zzso facility to the zzso of the same sequence in larger zzso or zzso
