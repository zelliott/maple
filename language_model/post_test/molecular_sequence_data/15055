Human zzso virus zzso has been shown to undergo self-destruction upon treatment of zzso zzso with partially zzso zzso targeting the zzso tract zzso of the viral zzso in the virus zzso The zzso forms a local hybrid with the zzso zzso the viral zzso H to prematurely cleave the zzso zzso Here we are describing the self-destruction of a zzso zzso harboring the zzso of zzso in a mouse zzso zzso We showed a decrease in viral zzso levels in zzso virus particles and a reduction reverse transcribed complementary DNA zzso in zzso human and primary zzso cells by incubation with zzso In the zzso simultaneous, zzso or therapeutic zzso treatments led to a significant reduction in viral zzso zzso Our finding may have some relevance for the design of other viral self-destruction zzso It may lead to a zzso for reduction of sexual and zzso zzso
