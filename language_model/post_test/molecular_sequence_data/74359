zzso of animal zzso zzso is very important to understand their molecular evolution as well as for zzso and population genetic zzso The zzso encompasses more than 160,000 described species and is one of the largest insect zzso To date only nine zzso zzso zzso have been fully and two others partly zzso zzso the zzso sampling is very zzso Thus advance of zzso zzso deeply requires new zzso derived from a broad zzso zzso In present work we describe the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a circular zzso zzso zzso zzso It includes the entire set of 37 genes usually present in animal zzso zzso It contains also 7 zzso zzso The gene order of the newly zzso zzso is that typical for zzso and differs from the insect ancestral type for the placement of zzso The zzso zzso content of its alpha strand is the lowest among known zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso exhibits one of the most marked zzso among available insect zzso zzso The zzso genes have typical zzso start zzso except for zzso that present an unusual zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibits the less biased synonymous zzso usage among zzso Comparative zzso analysis study identified zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as potential markers for population zzso zzso A peculiar feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso it that the zzso zzso are mostly made by repetitive zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is the first representative of zzso zzso that account for about zzso of all described zzso New zzso shares many features with other known zzso zzso It differs however for its low zzso content and marked zzso Compared to other zzso zzso it is less biased in synonymous zzso zzso Comparative evolutionary analysis of zzso zzso zzso allowed the identification of previously neglected coding genes as potential zzso zzso zzso of repetitive elements in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso supports the role of DNA zzso as possible mechanism to produce zzso during zzso
