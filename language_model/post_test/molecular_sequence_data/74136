The zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria, protects against zzso but not zzso challenge in an experimental animal zzso We report the crystal structures of complexes formed between zzso zzso and two synthetic zzso a zzso and a zzso that were previously shown to be both zzso and zzso mimics of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to an zzso contained within two consecutive zzso zzso zzso repeat units zzso Six sugar zzso from a zzso zzso segment make direct contacts with the zzso including the zzso zzso and both branching zzso zzso from the two zzso The zzso zzso whose position of attachment to the zzso backbone of the zzso defines the zzso zzso zzso is critical for recognition by zzso Although the complete zzso is visible in the electron density zzso the last four zzso zzso from the reducing end, which do not contact the zzso could not be zzso Although considerable mobility in the free zzso can thus be expected, the zzso similarity between the individual zzso both within and between the two complexes, suggests that short-range transient ordering to a zzso zzso might occur in zzso Although the observed zzso includes the terminal zzso zzso binding to internal zzso within the zzso chain is not zzso Our results have implications for vaccine development because they suggest that a minimum of two zzso of synthetic zzso zzso zzso is required for optimal mimicry of zzso zzso
