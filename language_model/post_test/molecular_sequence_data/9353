To identify novel as well as zzso zzso in zzso deep sequencing of small zzso library combined with zzso was performed in precocious zzso orange (an early flowering zzso of zzso orange, zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of a total of 114 zzso zzso belonging to 38 families and 155 novel zzso The zzso star sequences of 39 zzso zzso and 27 novel zzso were also discovered among newly identified zzso providing additional evidence for the existence of zzso Through zzso sequencing, zzso and 149 genes were identified as targets of zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso GO and zzso zzso revealed that high ranked zzso genes were those implicated in biological and zzso zzso To characterize those zzso expressed at the juvenile and adult development stages of zzso further analysis on the expression profiles of these zzso through zzso the commercial zzso and real-time zzso was zzso The results revealed that some zzso were zzso at adult stage compared with juvenile zzso zzso comparison of the expression patterns of some zzso and corresponding target genes revealed the negative correlation between them, while few of them are positively zzso
