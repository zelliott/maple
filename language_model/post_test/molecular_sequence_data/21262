The zzso regulatory cascade is poorly characterized in zzso zzso in part because swarming and zzso zzso hallmarks of the zzso zzso by this scheme of gene control, and zzso sensing seems to be silenced in many zzso In these studies, we examine a zzso virulent strain and identify an zzso zzso of the zzso regulator zzso that is demonstrated to produce a zzso active mimic of zzso We find that zzso affects the expression of three small regulatory zzso zzso and the activity of a zzso fusion in zzso the output zzso Tests for zzso showed that zzso is dominant over zzso and that zzso is dominant over zzso Thus, information flow through the central elements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is proven for the first zzso zzso output was explored using zzso zzso the zzso zzso encompasses zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and type III zzso system 1 zzso zzso One novel discovery is that zzso strongly and zzso regulates two type VI zzso systems zzso New functional consequences of zzso control were zzso zzso increases the cellular zzso zzso zzso level, positively controls zzso DNA zzso and profoundly blocks zzso toward host zzso In expanding the previously known zzso effects beyond the induction of the capsule and the repression of swarming to zzso the global scope of genes in the zzso zzso this study yields many clues to distinguishing traits of this zzso zzso it underscores the profoundly divergent survival strategies of the zzso zzso phase zzso
