zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of aromatic zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso reactions that govern the disposition and toxicity of many drugs and zzso The human zzso genes and zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso and constitute one of the best studied examples of the genetic control of drug zzso zzso occurring human zzso zzso provide limited insight into the relationship between zzso zzso acid sequence and zzso zzso We have shown previously that the expression of zzso zzso in bacterial tester strains results in greatly enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso compounds (which are reduced to zzso zzso by bacterial zzso We hypothesized that random zzso combined with rapid screening could be used to identify functionally significant zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were generated by zzso chain zzso random zzso of the complete coding zzso zzso induced by a zzso zzso zzso was used as the basis for screening these pools to identify zzso with altered zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by quantitative zzso zzso and zzso kinetic zzso This approach can provide new insight into the zzso of zzso involved in the zzso zzso of zzso
