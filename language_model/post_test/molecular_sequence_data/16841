zzso is an intermediate zzso produced through a variety of pathways including zzso of zzso and zzso of odd chain fatty acids and select zzso zzso Previously, we found that disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which blocks zzso zzso as well as growth on zzso impaired production of several zzso typically derived from zzso and zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso and the zzso zzso Here we describe three lines of evidence that demonstrate that excessive zzso levels in the cell can inhibit zzso zzso First, zzso of a putative zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso restored zzso production and reduced cellular zzso content in a zzso zzso Second, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which is also involved in zzso zzso restored zzso production in the zzso zzso Third, zzso growth on several compounds zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso whose zzso includes the formation of zzso were found to inhibit ST and zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that excessive zzso levels in the cell can inhibit zzso zzso
