The hybrid origin of a zzso zzso isolate belonging to the zzso zzso group zzso 3 is reported in this zzso Moreover, new data supporting the hybrid origin of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are provided as well as information about putative zzso Thus, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found harboring multiple sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso the internal transcribed sequences zzso and zzso of the zzso genes and of a zzso zzso sequence provided molecular zzso for the zzso hybrid origin of those zzso zzso analysis suggests that some of zzso zzso may have resulted from zzso events between a zzso zzso isolate of zzso and/or zzso and, probably, a closely related zzso to zzso zzso but not this zzso Similarly, zzso analysis and zzso markers indicated that a zzso zzso zzso isolate might have arisen from a zzso event between a zzso zzso zzso isolate and as yet unidentified zzso This second parental probably does not belong to the zzso zzso according to the gene sequences zzso found between the zzso isolate and zzso zzso These results suggest an important role of zzso in diversity and evolution in the zzso zzso and show that zzso hybrids within this zzso may not be rare in zzso
