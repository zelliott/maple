zzso clones zzso the bovine major zzso complex zzso class II zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a primary translated product of 260 zzso zzso which included a signal zzso of 26 zzso acids and a mature zzso of 234 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a primary translated product of 262 zzso zzso with a signal zzso of 18 zzso acids and a mature zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the sequences and construction of a zzso tree revealed that both clones are more closely related to human and mouse zzso genes than to genes for conventional bovine class II zzso and zzso Thus, since the bovine zzso and zzso genes are so different from other class II sequences and show evidence of strong conservation zzso zzso among the zzso mouse and human zzso it seems likely that each of these zzso clones encodes a functional product, which might perform an important function, as previously established in studies in mouse and zzso
