To evaluate the effects of a zzso gene zzso on cell proliferation and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso was constructed and compared with a previously studied zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso of normal and tumor cells of lung and zzso zzso origin with zzso resulted in high levels of zzso gene zzso which was comparable to that induced by zzso zzso and zzso inhibited growth of all cells zzso tumor cells devoid of zzso zzso zzso or cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso were more sensitive to the zzso effect than tumor zzso or normal zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis of zzso cells indicated a decline in the cell number in S phase and a significant increase in cell number in zzso zzso zzso infection also led to a decline in the percentage of cells in S phase and a significant zzso of cells in zzso zzso failed to induce zzso in any of the cells zzso In contrast, zzso induced zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso induction and zzso are likely to be associated with zzso cell cycle zzso However, because zzso of zzso protein failed to induce zzso zzso effects on zzso apparently require cellular factors in addition to zzso zzso
