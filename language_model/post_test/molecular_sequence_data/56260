zzso zzso routinely undergo zzso differentiation from zzso to zzso during their life zzso This process involves both zzso and zzso zzso To study such changes, we used a zzso culture system which permits the continuous generation and cycling of zzso zzso from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso libraries were constructed from zzso zzso isolated from both the zzso and zzso zzso Using differential zzso zzso techniques, 3 unique zzso clones zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso zzso To assess whether these clones were zzso expressed by the zzso zzso forms, they were zzso to zzso isolated from each of these zzso forms in Northern and zzso zzso of these analyses showed that zzso had zzso zzso higher levels of the zzso and zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso higher levels of the zzso zzso than zzso zzso sequence analysis and comparison with those in Gene bank, revealed that the 3 zzso represent unique zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that zzso open reading frame zzso had significant similarity with a soybean zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso spore zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso protein zzso It is of interest to note that, of the 3 zzso identified, the zzso protein was recognized by zzso from patients with clinically active visceral zzso and was zzso by a single copy zzso
