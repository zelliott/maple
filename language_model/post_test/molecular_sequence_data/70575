We have changed nine zzso aromatic zzso acids by zzso zzso of the cloned zzso protein gene to determine if any of these zzso form an obligatory zzso for electron transfer within the zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Greater than zzso of the zzso activity was retained for all of the zzso zzso zzso except for those containing a zzso and a zzso double zzso for which the activity was approximately zzso The crystal structures of the zzso complex indicate that zzso and zzso are at the surface of the zzso protein near the surface of zzso zzso but not directly in a linear zzso between the zzso cluster and the zzso zzso The zzso rates of reduction of zzso b and zzso in zzso in which zzso and zzso were changed to zzso zzso were approximately zzso of the zzso zzso There was a large decrease in zzso protein levels in zzso zzso resulting from the zzso zzso and the zzso double zzso and a small decrease for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso This indicates that the decreases in activity resulting from these zzso acid changes are due to instability of the altered zzso These results show that these aromatic zzso acids are unnecessary for electron transfer, but several are required for structural zzso
