The nervous system and the immune system share several functional molecules involved in various zzso interaction zzso In this study, we used in zzso zzso to identify immune molecules that are expressed by a restricted population of zzso in the mouse brain and found that zzso for the beta zzso of zzso zzso zzso was predominantly and strongly localized to zzso in deep layers of the cerebral zzso and zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression started at embryonic day 15 in the zzso zzso and at zzso day 1 in the cerebral zzso The level of zzso zzso in the zzso subsequently increased until zzso day 21, and it remained high in the zzso zzso analysis revealed that only the zzso segment of zzso not the zzso or zzso zzso was expressed by the brain zzso By the zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends method, we determined a zzso zzso start site in the zzso region zzso not in the zzso region zzso Furthermore, we confirmed that the zzso zzso around the zzso region took place only in zzso and zzso in transgenic zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso machinery for zzso zzso expression is shared by the nervous and immune systems and raise a possibility of gene zzso in zzso under certain zzso
