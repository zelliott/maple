A zzso was zzso from the leaves of zzso zzso and corresponding gene was zzso The zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso protein and similar to a typical garlic leaf zzso It was zzso as 177 zzso acid zzso zzso which consisted of 28 and 43 zzso acid long N and zzso signal zzso zzso The plant expressed this protein more in zzso and flowers in comparison to the bulbs and zzso zzso activity (with rabbit zzso was zzso fold higher as compared to zzso zzso leaf zzso zzso although, the zzso activity against cotton zzso zzso zzso was relatively zzso zzso array revealed that AAA had higher affinity towards zzso as compared to zzso zzso analysis showed zzso similarity with other zzso zzso The mature protein was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion with zzso zzso in soluble and biologically active zzso zzso protein retained high zzso zzso
