By using zzso zzso zzso D3 zzso as a probe, two zzso D3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso library constructed with zzso liver zzso Physical mapping and DNA sequence analysis revealed that these clones contain approximately zzso zzso uninterrupted linear sequence similar to zzso zzso D3 zzso indicating that the zzso zzso sequence is a processed zzso for zzso zzso When the zzso sequence of the zzso D3 zzso was compared with that of zzso D3 zzso at the zzso level, the zzso contained 229 zzso of zzso and 371 zzso of zzso regions, and a recognizable complete coding region that is zzso identical to zzso zzso zzso This sequence is bounded by the repeat sequence zzso which is common to many processed zzso However, multiple genetic zzso including zzso deletion and/or zzso events that result in modification of the reading frame were found in the zzso zzso The zzso appeared to accumulate 67 random point zzso in the functional coding region composed of zzso zzso zzso It is thus estimated that the zzso D3 zzso arose approximately 11 million years zzso zzso These data provide the first characterization of zzso zzso D3 zzso and insight into its evolutionary zzso
