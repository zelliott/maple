Members of the class IV zzso domain zzso factors are important regulators of neural zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are essential for the normal differentiation and maturation of retinal zzso cells zzso and hair cells of the auditory system, zzso In this report, the cloning and expression profile of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso were assessed as the first step for understanding its role in the development of sensory zzso Two zzso alternative transcripts exhibited different onset of expression during development but shared overlapping expression zzso in the adult visual zzso The zzso expression in the zzso zzso was consistent with a zzso role in differentiation and maintenance of zzso zzso was also observed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was prominently expressed in the zzso zzso lateral line zzso and zzso zzso For comparison, zzso expression was limited to the zzso zzso and was not detected in the lateral line during embryonic zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso lateral line of fish suggests a zzso function of a class IV zzso domain zzso factor in sensory system zzso
