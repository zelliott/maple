zzso has been zzso from canine zzso zzso as a protein complex with three zzso zzso of 66, zzso and 48 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were found to be identical to zzso I and II, zzso The zzso are integral membrane zzso that were previously shown to be localized exclusively to the rough zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex is not a zzso and is not recognized by zzso to either zzso Here, we describe the characterization of a zzso clone that encodes zzso Like zzso I and II, zzso was found to be an integral membrane zzso with the majority of the zzso located within the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso does not show significant zzso acid sequence zzso to either zzso I or zzso A zzso integral membrane zzso designated zzso from the zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso identical in sequence to zzso Recently, zzso was shown to be essential for in zzso and in zzso expression of zzso activity in zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso are zzso gene zzso
