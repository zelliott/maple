zzso transition protein 1 zzso is a 54 zzso acid zzso highly basic zzso protein found in zzso during the brief period when zzso are being replaced by zzso in the zzso phase of zzso Using a zzso clone as probe, we have isolated the gene zzso coding for rat zzso from a population of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence was established from a point 126 zzso upstream from the zzso cap site to a point about 30 zzso downstream from the predicted site of zzso The gene contains a single zzso separating the zzso for zzso 45 of the mature zzso zzso of the zzso sequences for zzso and the mouse gene coding for zzso zzso suggests a possible evolutionary zzso Southern zzso zzso to zzso DNA isolated from a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids zzso mapped zzso to mouse zzso zzso
