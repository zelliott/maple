zzso between different inwardly zzso zzso zzso channel zzso is an important mechanism for the generation of functional zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms that control this process and that prevent zzso interactions in cells that express many different zzso zzso In this study, we have examined the zzso assembly of zzso with other zzso zzso and have shown that this zzso exhibits a highly selective interaction with members of the zzso zzso and does not physically associate with other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, we have identified regions within the zzso zzso that appear to govern the specificity of this zzso These results help us to understand the mechanisms that control zzso zzso recognition and assembly and how cells can express many different zzso channels while maintaining distinct zzso of zzso and zzso channels within the zzso
