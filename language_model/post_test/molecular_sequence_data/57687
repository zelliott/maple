zzso zzso of zzso zzso or substance P zzso zzso binding in the presence of low zzso of zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso and zzso neither zzso zzso nor substance P increased zzso binding in the presence of zzso stimulating zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso completely inhibited the zzso zzso zzso There was an apparent decreased potency of the zzso binding zzso curve for zzso acid, but not zzso or zzso in the presence of either zzso zzso or substance zzso The compounds do not appear to act through the zzso zzso binding site because neither zzso zzso nor substance P displaced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso up to 10 zzso did not stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso could not be tested because they formed large zzso zzso in the zzso The data indicate that zzso zzso or substance P does not stimulate zzso binding at either the zzso zzso or zzso binding zzso Furthermore, the zzso substance P zzso zzso zzso zzso did not block zzso zzso or substance zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect is not due to an interaction between the substance P receptors and the zzso zzso zzso Finally, if these observations can be verified using single-channel recording techniques, they may have implications in the pattern of selective zzso loss observed in patients with neurodegenerative processes such as zzso Parkinson's, and zzso zzso
