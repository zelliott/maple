A gene zzso a new zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and we characterized the zzso expressed in zzso zzso The zzso DNA of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso The transformed zzso coli was selected by its zzso activity, which carries the zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso was capable of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso It was active over a pH range of zzso and its optimum temperature was 50 degrees zzso The molecular weight of the zzso was zzso and the zzso point was zzso It zzso soluble starch by zzso zzso units zzso but did not attack zzso The zzso also zzso zzso to zzso units zzso In the presence of zzso however, it transferred the zzso zzso to zzso with the formation of zzso The specificity of transferring activity is evident from the result of the zzso reaction which produces zzso from zzso and zzso The molecular structure of the zzso deduced from the zzso sequence of the clone maintains limited similarity in the zzso regions to the other zzso zzso
