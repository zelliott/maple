Here we report the discovery and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is transcribed in an unusual embryonic pattern of zzso stripes which are generated in response to the zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso encodes a putative zzso protein containing zzso zzso repeats characteristic of numerous cell surface receptors and zzso zzso Its expression is correlated with aspects of zzso and zzso including the formation of zzso sensory mother cells, and peripheral zzso zzso zzso for a zzso lethal zzso zzso zzso exhibit defects in the position and number of cells within peripheral sense zzso the zzso of peripheral nerves, and the organization of zzso within the central nervous zzso zzso are also defective in muscle zzso These results suggest that zzso is required for cell surface interactions important for normal organization of zzso and zzso zzso
