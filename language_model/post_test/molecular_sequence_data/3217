To study the route of zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso 

Seven hundred and zzso cervical samples from in women and 105 matched zzso zzso samples composed of cervical samples, zzso blood, zzso fluid, zzso and zzso samples of zzso were detected by zzso and DNA sequencing zzso 

CT were detected in 87 of zzso zzso cervical zzso In the 81 matched zzso samples from pregnant women with cervical zzso CT were not detected in all of the zzso blood zzso In the 30 zzso zzso samples, 26 were from cases of zzso delivery and 4 from cases of zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a significant difference between the groups of zzso section and the zzso delivery zzso zzso zzso Four of 11 zzso fluid samples with zzso were obtained during zzso section in which 3 were without premature zzso of zzso zzso zzso patients were same between maternal samples and matched zzso zzso The sequences of amplified DNA fragments also showed the same results between maternal and match zzso zzso No samples were found zzso in 24 matched zzso samples from cervical zzso zzso 

An ascending transmission from zzso to zzso cavity was the major route for CT zzso zzso zzso passage of zzso infection was not zzso Rates of vertical transmission were significantly lower in zzso section group than that of zzso delivery group with maternal cervical zzso zzso
