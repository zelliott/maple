zzso and zzso zzso zzso preparations each consist of a zzso core and a set of three zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso Despite this structural zzso the zzso from either zzso type are functionally zzso as is reflected by their different promoter usage and the tight zzso association in the zzso but not the zzso zzso We tested whether these differences are related to zzso Treatment of the zzso zzso with protein zzso converted it to an zzso form and vice versa, treatment of the zzso zzso with zzso generated zzso zzso Although both the core zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso targets, only the zzso seem to zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso interference and zzso I footprint patterns in the zzso promoter region were found to correlate with the zzso state of the zzso and zzso zzso
