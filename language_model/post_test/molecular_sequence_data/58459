The zzso gene was found at the zzso zzso in Ewing zzso and the zzso gene was found at the zzso of zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso These genes zzso proteins that carry a highly zzso zzso binding zzso Fusion proteins made of the zzso half of zzso or zzso and zzso regulatory zzso also derived from genes located at zzso have been suggested to be involved in the zzso of zzso By zzso amplification of human zzso cell zzso using zzso zzso made from the zzso zzso acid sequences in the zzso binding domain of zzso and zzso we obtained a zzso zzso zzso zzso the predicted zzso acid sequences of which were similar but not identical to those of zzso and zzso Using this zzso as a probe, we obtained two zzso of zzso consisting of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which zzso proteins consisting of zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences of zzso protein have a zzso zzso zzso and zzso region in the zzso region, an zzso binding domain and a zzso finger motif in the central region, and zzso repeats of zzso sequences in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was observed in all of the human fetal and adult zzso zzso as was the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso zzso to zzso
