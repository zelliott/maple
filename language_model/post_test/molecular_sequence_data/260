A novel, strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from human zzso zzso this strain was largely zzso and was zzso Growth of strain zzso zzso in zzso extract broth produced no visible zzso and a trace amount of zzso was detected as an end product of zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso zzso was related most closely to the type strains of zzso species, with zzso % sequence zzso zzso analysis of these and other related sequences confirmed that strain zzso zzso was zzso most closely associated with zzso species, but formed a separate zzso indicating that strain zzso zzso represents a novel member of the family zzso zzso acid analysis demonstrated the presence of a high concentration of zzso : zzso (75 % of the zzso The main respiratory zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso content of the DNA was zzso zzso These results suggest that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
