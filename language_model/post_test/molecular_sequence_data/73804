We have identified a new member, zzso of the general stress zzso controlled by zzso in zzso zzso As with other members of the zzso zzso zzso is expressed during the stationary phase of cell growth and zzso of this gene produces no obvious zzso during cell growth or early zzso zzso lies zzso from the zzso gene zzso which is zzso during stationary zzso
