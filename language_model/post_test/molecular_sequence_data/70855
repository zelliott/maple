We found that human peripheral B and T cells differed in the surface expression of zzso zzso type 2 chain zzso In contrast to B cells, T cells expressed only zzso with repeated zzso zzso zzso This finding was based on the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that, in addition to their common requirement of an zzso bound terminal zzso acid for zzso the zzso displayed preferences for the length of the zzso zzso Some of them bound mainly to 2-6 zzso with one zzso zzso unit zzso zzso others zzso to 2-6 zzso and 2-6 zzso with two and three zzso units, respectively zzso and zzso and one of them exclusively to very polar zzso zzso type 2 chain zzso zzso such as to 2-6 zzso and even more polar zzso with three and more zzso zzso These zzso could be correlated with the cellular binding of the zzso as zzso whereas all zzso bound to human CD 19 positive peripheral B cells, their zzso with zzso positive T cells was either nearly lacking zzso zzso intermediate (about zzso zzso zzso or strongly positive zzso zzso Thus, the binding of the zzso to 2-6 zzso zzso with multiple zzso units appeared to determine their binding to zzso
