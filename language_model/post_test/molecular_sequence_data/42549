The zzso of the primitive South American zzso fish zzso zzso have been analyzed by classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A highly repetitive DNA family has been cloned and zzso It is a zzso repeated sequence of about zzso zzso yielding an overall base pair composition of zzso AT with long runs of zzso 50% As and zzso zzso Analysis of sequence variation has allowed the further categorization of zzso satellite DNA into two evolutionary related zzso A and B, distinguishable by characteristic insertions and deletions within this zzso zzso zzso A satellite is found (in zzso zzso at the zzso of most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are clustered on specific zzso zzso zzso B satellite is highly specific for the zzso zzso on one particular zzso pair by zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso satellite DNA family has evolved in a concerted manner predominantly via zzso events involving zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso The clones isolated here may be useful for the zzso zzso and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso
