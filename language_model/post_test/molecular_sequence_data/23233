zzso basic protein zzso is one of the major components of the zzso sheath that zzso zzso In the central nervous system, zzso is zzso by zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso is regulated mainly at the zzso zzso The zzso family of zzso factors has been shown to be important in the regulation of many zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso box in the zzso zzso promoter has been shown to be indispensable for the zzso of zzso gene zzso Previous results from our laboratory have shown that the increase in zzso that accompanies zzso differentiation is paralleled by an increase in zzso We also have shown that the increase in zzso expression resulting from elevated zzso levels is zzso through zzso and that this effect occurs specifically in zzso In this study, we found that increased expression of zzso together with the zzso zzso factor zzso can activate the zzso promoter even in zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso cell type specificity on the expression of zzso Both zzso and zzso can enhance zzso promoter activity when expressed zzso zzso of plasmids zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso of the zzso promoter over expression of either zzso factor zzso This effect is not limited to zzso cell lines, in that zzso and zzso can also zzso activate the zzso promoter when expressed in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter eliminates zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso promoter is zzso at least in part, through zzso interactions between zzso and zzso
