zzso zzso enjoy one of the longest life spans of any human pathogen due to effective immune evasion strategies developed by the zzso Among the various immune evasion strategies exhibited by the zzso zzso 10 zzso productions and zzso zzso immune suppression has significant negative impact on the host immune zzso Recently, we identified a small heat shock protein expressed by zzso zzso zzso that can bind to soluble human zzso zzso alpha zzso and activate zzso zzso effects in cell zzso In this study we show that the zzso binding region of zzso is localized to its zzso zzso This region has significant sequence similarity to the zzso binding region of human zzso In zzso studies confirm that the zzso region of zzso zzso has zzso like activity and the region containing the alpha zzso domain and zzso of zzso zzso has no zzso like zzso However, zzso contains B cell, T cell and zzso zzso Members of the zzso families are excellent vaccine zzso zzso of zzso samples from zzso immune endemic normal zzso subjects showed zzso and zzso zzso against zzso and these zzso were involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccination trials with zzso in a mouse model using a zzso prime boost approach showed that zzso protection can be achieved against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presented in this study thus show that the zzso zzso of zzso has zzso function, zzso the zzso zzso of zzso has significant vaccine zzso
