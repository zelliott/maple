Secondary zzso is a common disease of water zzso and is characterized by the deposition of zzso zzso of zzso A zzso protein in the liver and certain other zzso Neither the normal role of serum zzso A zzso a major acute phase response zzso nor the causes of secondary zzso are well zzso To investigate a possible genetic contribution to disease zzso we cloned and zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso of domestic zzso This revealed that the three zzso zzso acids of zzso are removed during conversion to zzso AA zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sequences from several animals identified a distinct genetic zzso that may be relevant to zzso to secondary zzso zzso The duck zzso contained a single copy of the zzso gene that was expressed in liver and lung tissue of zzso even in the absence of induction of acute phase zzso zzso analysis of zzso indicated that only one zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso of zzso from adult ducks displaying early symptoms of zzso revealed what appear to be zzso deposits within zzso that are expressing unusually high amounts of zzso zzso This observation suggests that zzso deposition of AA may represent an early event during development of secondary zzso in older zzso
