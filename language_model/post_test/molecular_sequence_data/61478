zzso of zzso zzso collected from a field site which had previously been treated with the zzso zzso zzso were found to demonstrate a high level of resistance to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in plate zzso In order to determine the genetic basis for this zzso resistance a partial length clone of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso DNA of a zzso zzso zzso isolate using zzso zzso by zzso Analysis of the zzso gene structure indicates the presence of six 90 zzso acid repeat zzso upstream of a zzso domain as found in the zzso zzso genes from other zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the presence of zzso leading to premature termination of the translated zzso zzso The possible role of the zzso zzso in the development of zzso resistance in zzso zzso is zzso
