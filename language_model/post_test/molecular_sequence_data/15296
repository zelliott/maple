The zzso tree black locust zzso zzso zzso seems to affect zzso zzso colonization and disease severity of Japanese black pine zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of black locust on the distribution of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso DNA was extracted from soil at depths of zzso and zzso zzso collected from the border between a Japanese black zzso and a black zzso forest, and the distribution of these zzso was investigated by zzso zzso gel zzso The effect of soil nutrition and pH on zzso distribution was also zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 2 were not detected from some subplots in the Japanese black zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso were dominant in black zzso subplots and very little in the Japanese black zzso zzso zzso the distribution may be influenced by the distribution of zzso potential, although we could not detect significant relationships between the distribution of zzso zzso on pine zzso and in zzso The other zzso zzso were detected in zzso in subplots where the zzso zzso was not detected on pine zzso and there was no significant correlation between the distribution of the zzso zzso on pine zzso and in zzso zzso zzso potential seemed to not always influence the zzso community on zzso The distribution of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 in soil at a depth of zzso zzso positively correlated with soil zzso zzso P) and that of zzso zzso 2 also positively correlated with soil nitrogen zzso zzso These results suggest the possibility that the distribution of zzso potential of the zzso zzso was affected by soil N and soil zzso Although the mortality of the pine zzso was higher in the black zzso area than in the Japanese black zzso area, a zzso fungus of pine zzso zzso zzso was detected in soil at depths of zzso and zzso zzso from both these zzso This indicates that the disease severity of pine zzso in this study was influenced by environmental conditions rather than the distribution of zzso zzso
