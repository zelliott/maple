The zzso zzso peptides are known to play a significant role in the zzso and/or mediation of numerous environmental or experimental zzso However, the specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved, under what zzso conditions they are engaged and within which regions of the zzso is not well zzso We therefore examined the effects of both a chronic and an acute zzso water deprivation and a single zzso foot shock on zzso zzso binding in 17 specific rat brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to label delta and zzso zzso zzso Foot shock induced profound zzso as measured by zzso zzso which outlasted the zzso by several zzso However, only the zzso responded with a decrease in zzso binding to this type of zzso zzso No other zzso in either zzso or zzso binding were seen in response to foot zzso In contrast, water deprivation induced increases in zzso binding in the zzso as well as increases in zzso binding in the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso mild stress of handling in the foot shock control group was sufficient to decrease zzso or delta zzso binding in seven out of 17 brain regions investigated (including the frontal zzso and zzso zzso where both zzso and delta binding were zzso when compared to zzso deprivation control zzso These changes in zzso zzso binding may have been the result of zzso in zzso zzso release, zzso regulation, or interactions with other released neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
