We have investigated the change in DNA zzso in zzso zzso after exposure to different kinds of zzso No or only minor effects are induced by zzso zzso and heat shock result in plasmids which are less zzso zzso Cold shock and salt stress result in an increase in negative zzso The reduction of linking number starts immediately after addition of zzso and reached a zzso value after 2 zzso zzso extension experiments revealed that the zzso level of the zzso gene is not specifically changed by zzso The response in zzso zzso is inverse to the response in zzso We discuss the possible effects of these inverse in zzso and in zzso responses for zzso zzso
