The zzso zzso codes for S zzso zzso which constitute adherence factors of zzso zzso coli zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso is transcribed from three zzso zzso zzso and zzso In comparison with the promoters zzso and zzso promoter zzso which is located in front of the structural gene zzso showed very weak zzso Here we have determined the exact positions of the zzso start points by primer extension zzso We have also shown that zzso of 500, 700 and zzso bases can be detected using zzso zzso specific for the genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are positive regulators influencing zzso and the production of the zzso zzso which is zzso by the gene zzso located in the zzso half of the zzso In addition, it is demonstrated that zzso and zzso interfere with the regulatory effect of the zzso protein zzso zzso by a locus termed zzso or zzso In a zzso strain the regulators are necessary for zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso expression is zzso in a zzso zzso In this latter genetic background, a substantial fraction of the zzso transcripts is initiated from promoter zzso On the basis of these data we discuss a model for the regulation of this zzso zzso
