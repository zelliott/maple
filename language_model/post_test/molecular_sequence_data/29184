We determined the zzso prime or zzso primary and secondary structures required for replication of zzso yellow dwarf virus zzso zzso in zzso zzso Computer predictions, zzso zzso zzso zzso and replication zzso of specific zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso prime or zzso 109 zzso zzso form a structure with three to four zzso followed by a zzso stacked zzso incorporating the last four zzso zzso zzso upstream of the zzso region also contributed to zzso zzso The zzso but not the sequences or zzso in the stems were essential for zzso but any changes to the zzso prime or zzso zzso destroyed zzso The two zzso prime or zzso zzso tolerated all changes, but the two zzso prime or zzso zzso gave most efficient replication if they fit the zzso zzso A zzso lacking the zzso prime or zzso zzso produced elevated levels of zzso minus zzso and no zzso zzso We propose that a zzso structure is the origin of zzso zzso zzso which is zzso regulated by the zzso zzso of the zzso prime or minute zzso thus favoring a high zzso zzso zzso This zzso prime or minute structure and the zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso is more closely related to the zzso family than to other zzso zzso
