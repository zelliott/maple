The envelope zzso zzso of classical zzso fever virus zzso plays multiple roles in the viral life cycle, interaction with host and zzso We zzso the zzso gene of 34 zzso zzso from zzso China for analysis of genetic diversity in this particular zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso viruses became zzso in zzso China with 33 zzso clustered in zzso and only 1 isolate belonged to zzso zzso comparisons demonstrated zzso in this study showed a zzso of zzso to Chinese zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso The minimum similarity within the zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the full length zzso zzso acid sequences of 45 zzso zzso representative of three main groups of zzso including 19 from zzso China during zzso and 26 from other parts of China and other countries was analyzed by the differences between zzso zzso and synonymous zzso rates and the zzso zzso Two variable and three zzso regions as well as some specific positions under positive selection were zzso Our results suggest that recent zzso from zzso China have shifted away from historical zzso zzso including the vaccine strains probably as a result of their zzso abilities to the selection forces within the zzso
