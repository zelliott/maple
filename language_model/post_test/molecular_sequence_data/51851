zzso and its synthetic zzso were studied for their effect on zzso water flux in zzso urinary zzso As compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso was about 40 times less effective in stimulating zzso water zzso The zzso zzso obtained by modification in positions 1 and 2 were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and those modified in position 4 were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Any of the above zzso did not influence zzso but antagonized zzso water zzso zzso extended zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso water flux to the same extent in concentration 200 times higher as that of zzso We conclude from these studies that zzso zzso zzso competitively antagonize zzso zzso activity in zzso urinary zzso probably at the zzso zzso zzso and/or V2 zzso zzso zzso extension of the zzso zzso did not influence the capacity of zzso to induce V2 zzso action, even when used at higher zzso
