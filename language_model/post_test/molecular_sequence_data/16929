zzso protein zzso zzso compose a family of zzso zzso that function in many signal zzso pathways and affect various cellular zzso Despite the abundance of available data, the exact role of each zzso zzso is not completely zzso in part because of the inability to activate zzso zzso molecules individually and zzso Based on zzso zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Capone, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we designed and constructed single and multiple zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Single zzso zzso and zzso and subsequent double zzso and zzso zzso acquired high intrinsic activity independent of any upstream regulation and reached levels of 10 and zzso respectively, in reference to the zzso zzso wild type zzso The active zzso zzso have retained high specificity toward zzso zzso and were inhibited by the specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also show that similar zzso can render zzso active as zzso Based on the available structures of zzso and zzso we have analyzed the zzso zzso and identified a zzso core stabilized by three aromatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the vicinity of the zzso loop zzso Upon zzso a segment of the zzso loop, including zzso becomes zzso zzso analysis suggests that the active zzso zzso emulate the zzso changes imposed naturally by dual zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Essentially, the zzso core is an inherent stabilizer that maintains low zzso activity level in zzso zzso
