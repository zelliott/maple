The zzso zzso zzso is a short-lived protein that is maintained at low levels in normal cells by zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso of zzso is crucial for its zzso zzso zzso However, the precise mechanism by which zzso zzso levels are regulated in zzso is not completely zzso By mass zzso of zzso zzso factors, we have identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso even in the presence of excess zzso and also zzso zzso cell growth repression and zzso zzso zzso has an intrinsic zzso activity that specifically zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso In contrast, expression of a zzso inactive point zzso of zzso in cells increases the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings reveal an important mechanism by which zzso can be stabilized by direct zzso and also imply that zzso might function as a zzso zzso in zzso through the stabilization of zzso
