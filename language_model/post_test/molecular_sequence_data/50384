zzso from zzso zzso transgenic mice undergo zzso or programmed cell death, when chicken zzso zzso is administered in zzso Using zzso mice zzso we have now developed a simple in zzso model system that zzso the in zzso zzso zzso When transgenic zzso were zzso with zzso B cells, or zzso nurse cell lines (all bearing zzso in the presence of chicken zzso deletion of the transgenic zzso zzso was seen within zzso zzso zzso designed to bear zzso on their surface could mediate the deletion zzso Thus, zzso zzso deletion entirely depends on the stage at which the zzso are vulnerable to the onset of zzso rather than on the nature of the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso nurse cell line zzso could cause zzso strongly suggesting that some zzso zzso components are potentially capable of participating in negative zzso In all cases zzso little deletion could be induced at a zzso concentration less than 10 zzso thus defining the minimum amount of zzso zzso required for negative zzso The zzso in zzso zzso system will allow further dissection of the molecular and cellular processes involved in zzso deletion due to zzso in the zzso
