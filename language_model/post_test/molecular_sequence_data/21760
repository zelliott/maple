zzso recognition proteins zzso are innate immune molecules that are present in most zzso and zzso zzso have four zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 from the esophagus of adult zzso The length of the complete open reading frames of zzso zzso and 4 are identical and contain zzso zzso 374 zzso acid zzso The zzso acid sequences of these two proteins were more similar to their human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than to their mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and 4 were more strongly expressed in zzso zzso especially the zzso than in immune zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso in both newborn and adult zzso To analyze the zzso distribution of zzso zzso we constructed zzso cell zzso Western zzso and flow zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso and 4 are not only zzso but also expressed on the cell surface, unlike zzso and zzso These results should help contribute to the understanding of zzso and zzso immune responses via their recognition of zzso zzso in newborn and adult zzso
