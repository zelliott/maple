Using high-resolution zzso zzso mass zzso along with an zzso zzso source zzso accurate molecular weights of 13 steroid zzso extracted from the zzso of zzso zzso were acquired and the corresponding molecular zzso zzso In order to zzso the fragmentation pathways of steroid zzso in zzso zzso 10 authentic samples were investigated using zzso In addition, atmospheric pressure chemical zzso mass zzso combined with zzso trap tandem mass zzso zzso was used to analyze the structures of 13 steroid zzso in zzso zzso Through the analysis of their tandem mass data, diagnostic zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso steroid zzso in zzso zzso were detected as zzso zzso and zzso In addition, four pairs of zzso were detected and the possible structures of four unknown steroid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have proved to be effective tools for research on fragmentation mechanism of steroid zzso and the rapid determination of native steroid zzso in extract mixture, thereby avoiding tedious derivation and separation zzso
