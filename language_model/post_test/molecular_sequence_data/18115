The function of the 28 zzso zzso zzso box element found in the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in controlling gene expression has been zzso zzso tobacco plants containing 124 zzso of zzso zzso zzso sequence including the zzso box and all sequences downstream to the start of zzso failed to activate the zzso as judged by zzso and northern zzso zzso was first detected in a promoter zzso construct which contained zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These two promoter zzso zzso were additionally examined for their ability to interact with pea seed nuclear zzso The use of zzso binding and mobility shift zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso which included the zzso box did not bind nuclear zzso In contrast, nuclear proteins were shown to strongly bind to the zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso The correlation of transgenic plant analysis with DNA binding zzso indicates that the highly zzso 28 zzso zzso box element is not the sole promoter zzso in zzso gene zzso
