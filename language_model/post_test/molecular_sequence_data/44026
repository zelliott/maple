The structural basis of zzso of proteins is of great scientific and zzso zzso zzso in the X-ray zzso of zzso proteins from zzso and zzso organisms can indicate crucial stabilizing zzso To this end the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso derived from the zzso replacement method and was refined at zzso A zzso The comparison to the known zzso A structure of zzso from zzso coli zzso shows that zzso has the complete zzso or zzso zzso fold, whereas zzso zzso in zzso is replaced by a zzso The zzso of zzso associate via the zzso faces of their central zzso Two long, zzso zzso that zzso zzso into cavities of the other zzso provide for multiple zzso zzso Moreover, the side chains of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of both zzso are immobilized in a zzso zzso and the number of salt bridges is increased in zzso These features appear to be mainly responsible for the high zzso of zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso at 25 degrees C is zzso more efficient than zzso mainly due to its small zzso value for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Kirschner, zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso The increased number of hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso and zzso compared to zzso could be responsible for this zzso
