To assess the distribution and diversity of members of the recently identified bacterial kingdom zzso members of this kingdom present in 43 environmental samples were surveyed by zzso zzso A primer designed to amplify zzso gene sequences zzso zzso zzso from most known members of the kingdom was used to interrogate bulk DNA extracted from the zzso Positive zzso results were obtained with all temperate soil and zzso samples tested, as well as some hot spring samples, indicating that members of this kingdom are very widespread in zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for four zzso zzso within the kingdom were used in similar zzso All four zzso were detected in most neutral zzso and some zzso while only two of the groups were seen in most zzso zzso The combined use of these zzso allowed identification of a novel lineage within the kingdom in a hot spring zzso zzso analysis of zzso sequences from our survey and the literature outlines at least six major zzso within the zzso Taken together, these data suggest that members of the zzso kingdom are as genetically and metabolically diverse, environmentally widespread and perhaps as ecologically important as the well-known zzso and zzso bacterial zzso
