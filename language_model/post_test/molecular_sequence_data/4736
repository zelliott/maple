The crystal structure of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso from wheat kernel was determined by the zzso replacement method coupled with density modification and zzso symmetry averaging and then refined by simulated zzso using zzso data to zzso A resolution (R zzso zzso free R zzso zzso The zzso unit has four molecules of zzso zzso each comprised of 124 zzso acid zzso zzso density for zzso zzso and zzso is absent in all zzso probably because of the intrinsic flexibility of these zzso Each zzso has four major zzso and one zzso zzso which are arranged in the up-and-down manner, maintaining the favorable packing modes of the zzso zzso zzso however, has two short zzso zzso All 10 zzso zzso in zzso zzso form zzso bonds zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistent with the assignments made zzso for zzso zzso from wheat kernel and by zzso analysis of the zzso zzso inhibitor from zzso seeds zzso The zzso bond patterns in these zzso are similar to those in the zzso protein from soybean zzso which lack only the bond corresponding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso interactions occurred between particular pairs of zzso zzso zzso mainly involving zzso zzso Comparisons of the structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that the arrangements of the major zzso are similar but the zzso of the remaining zzso differ zzso The present X-ray analysis for zzso zzso and the zzso analysis for zzso suggest that all the zzso in this family have a common zzso The zzso binding site is discussed on the basis of the zzso and zzso structures of zzso zzso together with zzso and zzso data for zzso
