The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of orphan receptors and acts as a zzso zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso To understand the basis of this activity, we constructed a zzso model of zzso using the closely related zzso as a zzso zzso modeling suggested that bulky zzso side chains occupy the zzso zzso cavity leaving a small but distinct cavity that may be involved in zzso zzso This model was subject to zzso simulation with a zzso zzso from the steroid zzso zzso zzso zzso which delineated a zzso binding surface consisting of the signature motif spanning zzso 3-5 and zzso 12 zzso function 2 zzso zzso this surface with scanning zzso zzso showed structural and functional zzso between zzso zzso of zzso and zzso This was surprising zzso that zzso is a zzso zzso whereas zzso has an absolute requirement for zzso and prompted us to use molecular modeling to identify differences between zzso and zzso in the way that the zzso zzso interacts with the rest of the zzso Modeling highlighted a zzso zzso acid in zzso 11 of zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso at the N zzso of zzso which we suggest 1) ensures that zzso is locked permanently in the zzso described for other zzso receptors and thus 2) enables zzso recruitment of zzso zzso with this, zzso of zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso reduced and zzso zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso Furthermore, we were able to zzso zzso activity for both a deletion zzso of zzso lacking zzso and zzso by zzso of a zzso fusion zzso demonstrating zzso recruitment of zzso and a role for zzso in recruiting zzso
