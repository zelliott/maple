To construct a zzso carrying small interfering zzso zzso targeting human zzso gene zzso zzso and test its effect on zzso expression at the zzso level in human colon cancer cell lines zzso cells that highly express zzso 

A zzso cell line that highly expressed zzso was selected using zzso zzso The zzso zzso targeting human zzso zzso and the negative control zzso were cloned into zzso zzso and after identification and sequence analysis, the constructed zzso zzso was zzso into the selected zzso cell zzso 

The zzso zzso was successfully constructed and zzso transferred into zzso zzso The zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso protein expression in the zzso cells, as shown by Western zzso 

The zzso zzso we constructed can be zzso zzso into zzso cells to inhibit the expression of zzso zzso and can be useful in further studies of increasing the zzso of zzso cell zzso
