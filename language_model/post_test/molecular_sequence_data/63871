zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso is a protein that is highly zzso and essential for cell zzso This factor is the only protein known to contain the unique and essential zzso acid zzso zzso This work focused on the structural and functional characterization of zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure of zzso zzso was modeled based on the structure of its zzso zzso zzso and this model was used to predict the structural zzso of new zzso and randomly generated zzso Most of the 40 new zzso exhibited zzso that resulted from zzso zzso zzso Our data provided evidence that the zzso zzso present in zzso zzso is an essential structural element, whereas the zzso zzso 10 zzso acid extension not present in zzso zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, the zzso containing zzso at or in the vicinity of the zzso modification site displayed zzso or zzso zzso and were defective in zzso zzso Interestingly, two of the zzso strains produced stable zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed defects in protein synthesis at the restrictive zzso Our data revealed important structural features of zzso that are required for its vital role in cell viability and underscored an essential function of zzso in the translation step of gene zzso
