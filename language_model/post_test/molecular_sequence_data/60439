The Holliday junction is an essential intermediate of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso are structural and functional zzso These proteins play a pivotal role in the formation of Holliday junctions from two zzso DNA zzso zzso is a specific zzso that resolves Holliday junctions in zzso A Holliday zzso activity has been found in both zzso and zzso zzso To examine whether the paradigm of zzso zzso apply to zzso we zzso and found the activity to resolve a synthetic Holliday junction in crude extract of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso junction zzso encodes a protein composed of 123 zzso zzso whose sequence is not similar to that of any proteins with known zzso However, all four zzso whose total zzso sequences have been published, have the zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso formed by zzso in zzso These results support the notion that the formation and resolution of Holliday junction is the common mechanism of zzso zzso in the three zzso of zzso
