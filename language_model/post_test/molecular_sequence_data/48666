The DNA mismatch repair zzso system is a major DNA repair zzso whose function is critical for the correction of DNA zzso zzso zzso is initiated by the binding of zzso proteins to zzso and zzso zzso followed by the recruitment of zzso zzso The major zzso activity in zzso is performed by zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso and plants and zzso in zzso We here report the effect the expression of zzso zzso protein exerts on zzso zzso zzso zzso A strain carrying specific zzso instability reporter systems was chosen for the zzso The plant protein failed to complement the zzso zzso of a zzso deficient strain but increased approximately zzso and zzso the zzso rates of zzso and zzso 14 zzso of zzso zzso strains when compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso strain generated an increase in zzso rate comparable to that of zzso expression zzso zzso of the zzso zzso implicated in zzso interaction and including the putative zzso sequence of zzso completely eliminated the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the plant proteins affect zzso zzso stability, very possibly altering zzso interactions that are necessary to complete zzso
