Proper regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathways is critical for normal development and the prevention of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso that zzso exchange on Ras and zzso Although the zzso role of zzso and its zzso domain in zzso Ras zzso is well established, the in zzso function of its zzso zzso zzso domain is less zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso that promotes zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling in zzso Our data indicate that a major zzso function of the zzso domain is to inhibit zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso by the zzso domain is equal to that of established zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, including zzso and zzso and more than that of zzso zzso In conjunction with molecular zzso our data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso as well as an equivalent zzso in human zzso activates the zzso zzso by zzso an zzso function of the zzso domain on Ras zzso Our work suggests that functionally similar point zzso in humans could directly contribute to zzso
