The insulin zzso zzso and the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso are zzso zzso proteins that bind insulin and zzso with differing zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the first three zzso zzso of human zzso at zzso A resolution and compare it with the previously determined structure of the corresponding zzso of zzso The most important differences seen between the two receptors are in the two regions governing zzso zzso The first is at the corner of the zzso surface of the zzso domain, where the side chain of zzso in zzso forms part of the zzso binding surface involving the second zzso zzso This is very different to the location of its counterpart in zzso zzso which is not involved in zzso zzso The second major difference is in the sixth module of the zzso domain, where zzso contains a larger loop that zzso further into the zzso zzso This zzso which zzso zzso zzso shows negligible sequence identity, significantly more zzso an additional zzso bond, and opposite zzso potential compared to that of the zzso
