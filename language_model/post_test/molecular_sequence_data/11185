We have reported two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso which are structurally zzso Here we cloned three additional zzso family genes zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of an expression sequence tag zzso database zzso We also found at least two additional candidates of this gene family in the zzso These genes were induced by zzso and zzso colony stimulating factor in certain zzso cell zzso The zzso domain and a zzso 40 zzso acid region, designated the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso are highly zzso in this family, while the zzso regions of these proteins share little zzso A zzso zzso zzso and in zzso and in zzso binding zzso revealed that in addition to zzso zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso although the interaction of zzso with the zzso domain was much weaker than that of zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso but not other zzso strongly inhibited leukemia zzso factor zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso leukemia cells prevented zzso differentiation and growth zzso Although the zzso function remains to be investigated, zzso family genes could play a role in the negative regulation of zzso signaling by interacting with specific zzso
