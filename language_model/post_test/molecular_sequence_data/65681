While numerous strategies exist for zzso discovery, the bottleneck to product development and routine use at the clinic is in the zzso phase of candidate zzso The aim of this study was to establish a robust and zzso product zzso monitoring zzso zzso that is potentially capable of rapidly zzso candidates from discovery phase zzso Using zzso zzso zzso a model zzso and a routinely used mass zzso for discovery platforms, an zzso trap zzso zzso the utility of this instrument to perform zzso was zzso The zzso doubly charged intact zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso A limit of detection of 10 zzso with a zzso of variation zzso of zzso was obtained for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from serum using a zzso zzso on a zzso zzso plate, followed by zzso on the zzso enabled zzso of zzso down to less than 1 zzso with a limit of detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso searching and zzso ratio confirmation further supported the conclusion that the zzso zzso in serum was the zzso zzso We conclude that this methodology could be adapted quickly and easily to other candidates, thus providing a much needed technology to bridge the gap between discovery and validation zzso
