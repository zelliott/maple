Three groups of T4 DNA zzso zzso were prepared and zzso In the first group, Ala and zzso were zzso for four zzso zzso in the zzso domain that were chosen on the basis of their sequence alignment with the zzso zzso from zzso coli DNA zzso zzso Two zzso metal zzso required for catalyzing the zzso zzso reaction are zzso by zzso groups from these zzso zzso and zzso zzso The Ala and zzso replacements have a profound effect on the zzso activity of T4 DNA zzso and also have a zzso but less pronounced influence on its zzso activity which is located in a domain zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso values for the zzso reaction were reduced by zzso orders of magnitude by these zzso but the values of zzso did not differ greatly from the zzso zzso The second group consists of replacements of other zzso that are zzso in the zzso domain of zzso DNA zzso but do not contribute to zzso metal zzso zzso Many of these zzso resulted in decreased zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso in the third group have zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso domain which diminished zzso and altered zzso zzso Our results, combined with structural data on zzso of protein zzso a truncated form of T4 DNA zzso zzso et zzso zzso show that: zzso the reduction in the relative specific zzso activities of zzso in the first group was significantly less than that of zzso in the zzso fragment, despite the nearly identical geometric arrangement of the metal zzso groups in two zzso zzso altered zzso that affect zzso and/or zzso activities in zzso of the second group, cluster within a small area of the zzso domain, suggesting that this area may be directly or indirectly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the third group, which affect zzso and zzso activities, may participate in DNA and zzso zzso Our results point to the functional zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in T4 DNA zzso a property not observed with the zzso zzso
