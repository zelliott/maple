Sex determination and X zzso dosage compensation in zzso zzso are directed by the zzso zzso zzso In part, zzso functions by regulating the zzso of the zzso zzso by binding to a 3' zzso site zzso zzso zzso tracts are essential for zzso of zzso zzso To unravel the mechanism of zzso regulation at zzso tracts we analyzed the interaction of zzso with zzso The zzso binding activity of zzso was mapped to the two zzso consensus sequence zzso of the zzso zzso of binding showed that both zzso binding zzso zzso were required in zzso for zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso zzso with zzso more zzso and had lost the ability to discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elements in one of the zzso that are likely to interact with a zzso tract were identified using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso In addition, our data suggest that multiple zzso zzso of the zzso zzso tract were involved in hydrogen zzso Interestingly, in zzso zzso bound with equal affinity to zzso tracts of zzso that it does not regulate in zzso We discuss the implications of this finding for the mechanism through which zzso may gain selectivity for particular zzso tracts in zzso
