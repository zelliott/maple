The core of zzso contains a highly zzso low molecular weight, basic protein that binds zzso acids and is essential for zzso zzso zzso The 56 zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso has the zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc zzso motif shared by all zzso zzso zzso The native protein and five modified peptides containing the zinc binding domain were zzso by solid phase in order to investigate the structural and zzso role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The purity of the synthetic molecules was verified by zzso and their sequences were confirmed by zzso acid analysis and sequencing in the case of zzso zzso dosage agreed with the theoretical value of free zzso for all these zzso Fluorescence zzso performed on synthetic zzso and zinc finger fragments showed that the zzso quantum yield was zzso allowing a zzso zzso for the complex to be zzso The apparent affinity constant of zzso for the metal was estimated to be superior to zzso zzso The synthetic zzso in the presence of zzso zzso possesses all the biological properties of zzso isolated from zzso It zzso both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the replication primer zzso onto zzso zzso
