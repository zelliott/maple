zzso zzso zzso such as zzso autonomously replicating circular molecules zzso and double minute zzso are common early, and in some cases initial, zzso of gene amplification in many drug-resistant and tumor cell zzso In order to gain a more complete understanding of the amplification process, we investigated the molecular mechanisms by which such zzso elements are generated and we traced the fate of these amplification zzso over zzso The model system consists of a Chinese zzso cell line zzso created by gene transfer in which the initial amplification product was shown previously to be an unstable zzso element containing an zzso zzso spanning more than 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that these molecules were formed by a process involving zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso was performed at multiple time points on cells with amplified zzso These studies reveal that the zzso molecules rapidly integrate into zzso often near or at zzso and once zzso the amplified sequences are themselves zzso These data provide a molecular and zzso zzso for gene amplification in this model system; an early event involves deletion to generate zzso zzso and subsequent integration of these elements zzso a cascade of zzso zzso
