Terminal zzso acid sequences were determined for all 11 segments of the zzso strain of group B zzso Consensus sequences were defined at both ends of the zzso zzso strands as zzso zzso zzso The zzso and 3' terminal sequences of the zzso strand zzso zzso were not complementary to one zzso The zzso terminal sequences and those of group A zzso zzso were similar in that each of the zzso strands began with zzso and ended with zzso Otherwise, the zzso terminal sequences did not match the consensus sequences that have been reported for the ends of the zzso zzso zzso
