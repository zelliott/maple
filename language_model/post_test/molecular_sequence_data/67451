zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso are one of the most frequent zzso zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso Internal tandem zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso activate survival and proliferation zzso and are associated with a poor prognosis in zzso We suspected that zzso of small zzso zzso zzso expression in these leukemia cells is involved in the transformation process and used zzso zzso to determine the zzso signature from total zzso harvested from zzso expressing zzso cells zzso This revealed that a limited set of zzso appeared to be affected by expression of zzso compared to the control group consisting of zzso parental cells zzso with an empty zzso zzso Among zzso expressed zzso we selected zzso zzso and zzso to validate the zzso data by quantitative real-time zzso showing a high degree of zzso We further analyzed zzso expression with zzso zzso in zzso expressing zzso zzso was found to be one of most significantly zzso zzso in zzso expressing cells and was zzso upon zzso zzso The data suggests that zzso is acting as a zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to target multiple zzso computer models from public zzso resources predicted a potential regulatory mechanism between zzso and zzso zzso In support of this interaction, zzso was shown to suppress zzso reporter gene zzso Further, our data demonstrated that zzso of zzso mimics suppressed zzso expression in zzso cells suggesting that increased zzso expression contributes to depletion of zzso after zzso zzso and that zzso repression may be associated with zzso zzso in zzso expressing zzso
