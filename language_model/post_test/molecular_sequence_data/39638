zzso zzso replication is essential for viral or zzso infection, as well as for regulation of cellular gene zzso zzso zzso motifs likely regulate various aspects of this zzso zzso of the zzso family, as represented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso replicate in the nucleus by utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the role of the loop E zzso motif of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso A zzso model of this zzso zzso by comparative sequence analysis and comparison with nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray crystal structures of loop E motifs in other zzso is presented in which core zzso base pairs are precisely zzso zzso zzso analysis of these base pairs showed that the model accounts for the reported natural sequence variations and viable experimental zzso in loop E motifs of zzso and other zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso analysis allowed us to design zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso loop zzso zzso analyses of such zzso by in zzso and in zzso experiments demonstrated that loop E structural integrity is crucial for zzso specifically during zzso Our results suggest that the zzso loop E motif exists and functions in zzso and provide zzso genetic evidence for the essential role of a zzso zzso three-dimensional motif in zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso analysis of zzso base pairing to zzso zzso of zzso motifs and systematic in zzso and in zzso functional zzso of zzso offers a novel, comprehensive approach to zzso the zzso relationships for zzso motifs of general biological zzso
