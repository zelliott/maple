zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by zzso We studied the molecular bases of zzso I zzso in a newborn Japanese girl with zzso zzso Northern and Western blots revealed a marked decrease in zzso I zzso and zzso protein but with a size similar to that of the control, zzso zzso of the patient's zzso revealed a zzso deletion at position zzso zzso analysis of the zzso DNA revealed a G to C zzso at position zzso the last zzso of an zzso in the zzso donor zzso This substitution altered the consensus sequence of the zzso donor site and the newly zzso donor site in the zzso caused the zzso zzso zzso This report seems to be the first complete definition of zzso I zzso at the molecular zzso
