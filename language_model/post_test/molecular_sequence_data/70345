Genes of three protein families, which are in part specifically expressed in the course of terminal differentiation of human zzso have previously been mapped to zzso zzso Here we show that these genes are physically linked within zzso zzso of zzso The order is zzso I light chain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso in the zzso region together with their functional zzso during zzso differentiation raises the question whether these genes share regulatory elements which control their zzso zzso As several of them are potential candidate genes for zzso skin diseases, this physical map should be of great value for genetic linkage zzso
