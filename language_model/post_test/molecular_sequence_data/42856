zzso zzso are regions of DNA containing tandem repeats of a short sequence zzso they occur abundantly in all zzso zzso and have been shown to be a rich source of highly zzso genetic markers in humans and other zzso These zzso are particularly suitable for population studies because they can be relatively easily scored using a combination of zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of each locus followed by zzso to separate zzso This paper details a method for finding these zzso in any zzso This method demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso are abundant and highly zzso in the social zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso reveals very little zzso The first six zzso examined were all zzso with a mean observed zzso of zzso in comparison average zzso of 33 zzso was zzso We suggest that this method can be used to detect variation where other methods have failed, making it an ideal tool for population and conservation zzso who must deal with populations lacking other types of genetic zzso
