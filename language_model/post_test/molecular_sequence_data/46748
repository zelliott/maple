The zzso zzso 1 zzso protein of zzso functions as a molecular switch for the zzso zzso zzso zzso under light conditions and zzso in zzso The zzso protein contains a zzso zzso zzso finger motif found in diverse groups of regulatory zzso To understand the role of the zzso zzso finger in zzso zzso interaction, we have performed a zzso zzso screen and isolated a novel protein with a zzso zzso a zzso type of the zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso is zzso by a single copy gene and localized to zzso in a transient zzso In addition to the zzso zzso the predicted protein has a C4 zinc finger, an zzso region, a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso zzso finger and the zzso zzso zzso are sufficient for their interaction with each other both in zzso and in zzso whereas neither motif displayed significant zzso Moreover, zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the expected zzso zzso of the zzso finger and zzso fingers are essential for their zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso finger zzso in this case, serves as autonomous zzso interaction zzso The zzso specific effect of zzso zzso on the zzso protein zzso in zzso indicates that its stability in zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso
