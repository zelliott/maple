zzso zzso is a highly infectious zzso causing the zzso disease zzso In zzso this zzso zzso zzso survives and replicates mainly in the zzso of infected zzso We have recently identified a genetic zzso designated zzso that is important for stress resistance and zzso survival of zzso zzso In the present work, we used tandem affinity zzso coupled to mass zzso to identify in zzso interacting partners of three proteins zzso by this zzso the zzso zzso zzso and two proteins containing motifs predicted to be involved in zzso zzso bearing von zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso The three proteins were designated here for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with 31 zzso including various zzso zzso zzso with fewer zzso but these included the zzso component of zzso zzso and zzso The protein zzso zzso with one hundred zzso including the E1 and zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes, and their common zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of either zzso or zzso impaired zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities, supporting the hypothesis of a functional role for the interaction of zzso and zzso with these zzso Altogether, this work highlights possible links between stress resistance and metabolism in zzso zzso zzso
