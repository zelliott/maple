Within a mixture of zzso minor zzso components are difficult to identify using a conventional zzso zzso Their identification generally requires zzso separation steps, before or after zzso zzso followed by sequence analysis of the zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the potential of tandem mass zzso for protein characterization by identifying the zzso hybrid human zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso occurs mainly in zzso where it comprises approximately zzso of the total zzso the dominant zzso being the normal beta zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso has an average molecular mass zzso zzso that is only 2 Da lower than that of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso it cannot be resolved from the normal zzso by mass zzso Here we show how zzso zzso was identified directly from the diluted blood of a zzso by analyzing the product zzso from the zzso and normal zzso zzso without prior separation of the individual zzso This study shows the potential of the tandem mass zzso for identifying a minor component in an zzso mixture of zzso
