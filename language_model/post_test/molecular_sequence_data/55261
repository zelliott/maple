The zzso zzso of proteins is closely related to their zzso In this work, we propose a novel approach based on zzso motifs to improve the accuracy of predicting zzso zzso of zzso bacterial zzso Our approach performed well on a zzso cross validation with an overall success rate of zzso Besides, the overall success rate of an independent testing zzso was zzso Moreover, our approach was tested using a new zzso set of zzso bacteria proteins and achieved an overall success rate of zzso
