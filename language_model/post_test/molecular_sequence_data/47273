We previously reported the cloning of the thousand and zzso acid protein zzso 1 zzso a rat zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso sterile 20 zzso Here we report the complete sequence and properties of a related rat protein zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso selectively activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, 4, and 6 of the zzso zzso protein zzso pathways in zzso and zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso To examine zzso interactions with zzso the zzso binding domain of zzso was localized to an approximately zzso sequence just zzso to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso this zzso binding domain associated with zzso 3 and 6 but not zzso 1, 2, or zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso N zzso was sufficient for binding to zzso zzso activity of full-length zzso enhanced its binding to zzso However, neither the zzso of the zzso binding domain of zzso nor the activity of zzso itself was required for zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso proteins lie in zzso zzso zzso and define a mechanism by which these zzso may organize downstream zzso
