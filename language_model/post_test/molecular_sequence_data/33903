We describe a syndrome of primary zzso with simplified zzso pattern in combination with severe infantile zzso zzso and zzso permanent diabetes in two unrelated zzso families with at least three affected zzso zzso analysis revealed a region on zzso 18 with a significant zzso score of zzso In this area, two zzso zzso zzso zzso in immediate early response 3 interacting protein 1 zzso were found in patients from both zzso zzso is highly expressed in the fetal brain zzso and fetal zzso and is thought to be involved in zzso zzso stress zzso We reported one of these families previously in a paper on zzso syndrome zzso zzso is characterized by increased zzso cell death as part of an uncontrolled unfolded protein zzso Increased zzso has been shown to be a cause of zzso zzso zzso An autopsy zzso from one patient showed increased zzso in the cerebral zzso and zzso beta cells, implicating premature cell death as the zzso zzso Both patient zzso and control zzso treated with zzso specific for zzso showed an increased zzso to zzso cell death under stress conditions in comparison to zzso This directly implicates zzso in the regulation of cell zzso Identification of zzso zzso sheds light on the mechanisms of brain development and on the zzso of infantile zzso and zzso permanent zzso
