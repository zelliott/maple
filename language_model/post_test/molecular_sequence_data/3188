The zzso for the zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso associates the low affinity binding component zzso and the high affinity zzso zzso Both are members of the zzso receptors family characterized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, which consists of two zzso zzso of around 100 zzso acids zzso The zzso is among the very few members of this large family to contain two zzso zzso The zzso one zzso called zzso is followed by an zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain called zzso and three type III zzso zzso A minimal zzso zzso is required for binding zzso By using zzso forms of deletion zzso in zzso zzso we demonstrated that removal of D1 led to spontaneous zzso of the zzso and that this property was devoted to a zzso sequence localized within the last 42 zzso acids of the zzso module of zzso By using soluble forms of deletion zzso made by progressive zzso from the end of the zzso fragment, we demonstrated that the zzso module of zzso was zzso for zzso binding and that the correct zzso of the zzso zzso required a full zzso module of zzso zzso the two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso fulfill two distinct roles in zzso function, zzso in stabilizing the zzso of zzso allowing zzso binding and in zzso the zzso
