The mouse zzso gene is expressed exclusively from the inactive X zzso and may be implicated in initiating X zzso To better understand the mechanisms underlying the control of zzso zzso we investigated the upstream regulatory region of the mouse zzso zzso A zzso upstream region of the zzso gene was zzso and promoter activity was studied by zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The region analyzed zzso to zzso showed no in zzso zzso promoter zzso However, a minimal constitutional promoter was assigned to a region from zzso to zzso and a zzso element from zzso to zzso regulates promoter zzso We showed that a nuclear factor binds to an element located at zzso to zzso zzso A second sequence at zzso to zzso does not act as an zzso and is unable to zzso zzso activity to the zzso gene on its zzso A third region from zzso to zzso is needed for correct zzso zzso of the segment zzso to zzso is associated with an increase in zzso activity and may represent a zzso zzso
