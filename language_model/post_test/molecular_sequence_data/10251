Panhandle zzso zzso zzso DNA with known zzso and unknown 3' sequences from a template with an zzso loop zzso shaped like a pan with a zzso We used zzso zzso to clone zzso zzso zzso in two pediatric zzso zzso The zzso in a case of zzso acute zzso leukemia showed the zzso Panhandle zzso amplified the zzso zzso at position zzso in zzso 6 in the zzso zzso zzso cluster region zzso The zzso in a case of zzso acute zzso leukemia was normal, but Southern zzso analysis showed a single zzso gene zzso Panhandle zzso amplified the zzso at position zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell hybrid and radiation hybrid zzso by zzso and reverse zzso analysis of the zzso cells indicated that zzso zzso identified a fusion of zzso zzso 6 with a previously zzso sequence in zzso zzso 1, consistent with a partial zzso In both cases, the zzso in the zzso zzso were in zzso repeats, and there were zzso repeats in proximity to the zzso in the partner zzso suggesting that zzso sequences were relevant to these zzso This study shows that zzso zzso is an effective method for cloning zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of additional pediatric cases will determine whether zzso distribution deviates from the zzso for 3' distribution in the zzso that has been found in adult zzso
