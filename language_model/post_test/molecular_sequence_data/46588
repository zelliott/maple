An zzso was zzso around zzso DNA thanks to triple zzso zzso Short zzso are known to be able to form DNA triple zzso by binding into the DNA major groove at an zzso zzso After zzso recognition of a zzso DNA target through triple zzso formation, the ends of the zzso zzso were joined through the action of T4 DNA zzso thus creating a circular DNA zzso zzso to the zzso containing the target zzso The labeling of the zzso DNA sequence has been carried out without any chemical or zzso modification of this zzso These zzso zzso provide a tool to attach a zzso tag in an irreversible way to zzso zzso or other zzso zzso Such a complex may find applications in the development of new techniques for duplex DNA detection or zzso delivery methods for gene zzso
