The bacterial community structure within a uranium ore was investigated using zzso and zzso clone library analysis and zzso zzso gel zzso of zzso zzso zzso The major zzso zzso bacteria were isolated and identified, and their resistance to uranium and other heavy metals was zzso Together with near neutral zzso moderate organic carbon content, elevated U and other heavy metals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ore showed high microbial counts and zzso zzso The bacterial community mainly consisted of zzso zzso with the predominance of zzso - over zzso - and zzso zzso along with zzso and zzso A zzso study revealed that nearly one-third of the community was affiliated to as yet zzso and unidentified bacteria having a closer relationship to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were relatively more abundant in the total community, while zzso affiliated to zzso and zzso and zzso were detected in the zzso zzso More than 50% of the bacterial zzso affiliated to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed resistance to uranium and other heavy zzso The study showed for the first time that uranium ore harbors major bacterial groups related to organisms having a wide range of environmentally significant functional zzso and the most abundant members are possibly new zzso These findings provide new insights into zzso zzso that could be useful in zzso and zzso zzso
