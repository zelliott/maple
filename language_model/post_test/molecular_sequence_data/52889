zzso library zzso techniques were used to identify transcripts expressed by activated mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells, a subset of natural killer T zzso zzso The most frequent zzso identified included the zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a zzso We also identified a new member of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso was designated class zzso T zzso zzso zzso as a result of its restricted expression pattern in T zzso Human zzso was also identified, and shares the same expression pattern as the mouse zzso zzso and zzso exhibit the same expression pattern in T cells, suggesting the existence of a gene expression program common to class zzso T zzso
