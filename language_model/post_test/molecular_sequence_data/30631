The zzso zzso of avian zzso virus causes acute zzso leukemia in chickens and zzso avian zzso cells in zzso Its protein product zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein which activates gene expression in transient DNA zzso zzso To investigate the relationship between transformation and zzso by zzso we constructed 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso The 12 zzso which transformed zzso cells also zzso gene zzso whereas the 3 zzso which did not transform also did not zzso This implies that zzso is required for transformation by zzso One of the zzso zzso localized to the cell nucleus but failed to bind zzso The other two zzso zzso localized to the cell nucleus and bound DNA but nevertheless failed to zzso These latter zzso define two distinct zzso of zzso which control zzso by zzso zzso one within the zzso zzso domain itself and one in a zzso domain which is not required for DNA zzso
