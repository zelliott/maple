zzso zzso undergo thousands of zzso DNA deletion events during the programmed development of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Two deletion zzso zzso and zzso were identified in the zzso zzso zzso 156 zzso Here, we report the characterization of both elements in zzso strain zzso and show that they display zzso deletion patterns when compared with those of strain zzso The zzso ( zzso ) element is defective for zzso The zzso ( zzso ) element is excised utilizing two alternative boundaries on one side, both are different from the boundary zzso to zzso the zzso zzso By crossing the 156 and zzso zzso we demonstrate that the definition of all deletion zzso are each controlled by zzso zzso zzso rather than by zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of all deleted DNA segments indicates that the zzso sequence is strictly required at their zzso zzso the identity of the first eight base pairs of these ends to a previously established consensus sequence zzso with the frequency of the corresponding deletion zzso Our data implies the existence of an zzso zzso evolution of these zzso deleted DNA segment end zzso
