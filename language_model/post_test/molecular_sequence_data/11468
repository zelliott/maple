The zzso chain reaction zzso allows the in zzso amplification of DNA fragments starting with tiny amounts of biological sample and zzso zzso derived from sequence zzso Since the technique is fast and easy, zzso has taken the zzso to the routine zzso We present a survey of the following applications of zzso 1) The amplification of gene fragments as fast alternative of zzso 2) The modification of DNA zzso 3) The sensitive detection of zzso zzso if desired followed by an accurate zzso 4) DNA analysis of zzso zzso 5) The detection of zzso relevant for inherited diseases, zzso transformation or tissue zzso 6) The analysis of genetic markers for forensic applications, for zzso testing and for the mapping of zzso zzso 7) The zzso amplification of DNA segments between zzso zzso 8) The study of gene zzso
