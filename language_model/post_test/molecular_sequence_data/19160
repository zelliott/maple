The efficacy of zzso treatment in multiple sclerosis has renewed interest in the role of B cells in zzso zzso In this study, we show that B cells are the zzso zzso class zzso subset in the zzso zzso in mice, and they zzso express zzso zzso zzso of experimental zzso zzso induced by adoptive transfer was significantly reduced in zzso zzso (B zzso mice, suggesting an important role for zzso B cells in initiating inflammatory zzso zzso T cell zzso of the zzso occurred normally in zzso zzso however, lack of production of T cell zzso and other immune zzso indicated impaired T cell zzso zzso recruitment of immune cells from the periphery driven by this initial T cell zzso did not occur in zzso zzso B cells required zzso zzso to reactivate zzso but not zzso cells in zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso cells zzso the zzso was selectively impaired compared with zzso cells in zzso mice, causing an increased zzso ratio in the zzso at experimental zzso zzso onset and enhanced brain zzso These studies reveal an important role for B cells within the zzso in zzso T cells and influencing the clinical manifestation of zzso
