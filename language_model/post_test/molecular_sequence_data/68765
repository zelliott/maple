We report here that zzso and zzso zzso cells express zzso an alternatively spliced transcript of plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso pairs were designed based upon unique regions of the zzso zzso known zzso zzso zzso and used as zzso in zzso amplification of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cell zzso A product was observed only when zzso zzso were zzso no products were seen with zzso or zzso zzso unless zzso zzso from rat brain zzso was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the C zzso of zzso from zzso zzso cells revealed that the zzso is spliced to yield the zzso zzso a zzso containing a consensus zzso site for zzso protein zzso A and a modified zzso binding zzso zzso was also detected in zzso zzso cells and zzso primary rat zzso zzso These results suggest that the regulation of zzso function by agents that act via zzso pathways may involve zzso in the activity of the plasma membrane zzso
