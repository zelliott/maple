Type IV zzso systems direct transport of protein or zzso complexes across the cell envelopes of zzso donor and zzso or zzso recipient zzso The process is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Potential zzso belonging to the zzso family are an essential part of the zzso zzso Three representatives of these zzso originating from the zzso transfer regions of plasmids zzso zzso and zzso zzso and from the zzso zzso island of zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso in native zzso The proteins display zzso activity with distinct zzso zzso in zzso zzso shows its highest specific zzso activity with zzso and the preferred zzso for zzso is zzso Analysis of defined zzso zzso altered in motifs zzso within the zzso protein family shows that there is a correlation between the loss or reduction of zzso activity and transfer zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suggests that both interact with zzso zzso changing their zzso zzso activity of both proteins was zzso by the addition of certain zzso According to our results, zzso proteins seem to most likely be involved in the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso
