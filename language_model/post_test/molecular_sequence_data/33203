zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated and described from dry zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of both species clearly demonstrate that they belong to the zzso zzso zzso zzso They differ from its only described member, zzso zzso (as well as from species of zzso in the relief of the zzso surface of the test, revealed by scanning electron zzso which can represent a good characteristic for species zzso They also differ in the structure of the zzso part of the test wall (especially zzso zzso Small zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso analyses show that zzso is a deeply branching lineage of the zzso without any close zzso zzso gene sequence analysis places this zzso within the zzso close to two other zzso lineages but without forming a zzso group with zzso These data together strongly suggest that the lack of resolution in the zzso molecular zzso is due to serious zzso of zzso a limited number of sequence data, and high divergence rates in most of the zzso
