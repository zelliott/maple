zzso zzso is an emerging human pathogen with the smallest zzso found among zzso zzso zzso presents a complex zzso with a differentiated zzso known as the terminal zzso This polar structure plays a central role in functions essential for the zzso of the zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso A zzso Enriched in zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso box, is present in many of the proteins found in the terminal zzso We determined the crystal structure of the zzso domain from zzso zzso that contains an zzso zzso This structural information is the first at near atomic resolution for the components of the terminal zzso The structure revealed a zzso stabilized by a compact zzso core that extends throughout the zzso zzso zzso present a new fold that contains an accurate zzso symmetry relating two conspicuous zzso Some features, such as the domain plasticity and the presence and organization of the zzso and zzso symmetry zzso support a role for the zzso box in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of zzso zzso lacking the zzso box containing domain confirm the relevant and specific association of this domain with cell zzso
