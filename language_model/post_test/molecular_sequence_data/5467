We have isolated zzso of the human gene for high mobility group protein zzso using the method of direct zzso zzso The gene maps to zzso band zzso and is located within 40 zzso from marker zzso at a distance of zzso zzso from the zzso The deduced human zzso protein sequence has a length of 199 zzso acids and is zzso identical to the sequence of chicken zzso The 3' untranslated regions of the zzso gene in both species are highly zzso zzso identical zzso and are even more zzso than the coding sequences zzso identical zzso In addition, a partial zzso sequence of the putative zzso gene from mouse was zzso The 3' untranslated regions from human and mouse are zzso zzso We conclude that the 3' untranslated sequences have been under strong selective pressure during zzso Whereas expression of the chicken zzso gene has previously been demonstrated in liver of newly hatched chicken, the human zzso gene is transcribed mainly in zzso
