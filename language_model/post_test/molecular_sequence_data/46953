We have previously reported that the zzso zzso whose zzso expression is zzso by zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso has the ability to suppress transformation by zzso in a rat cell line zzso We have now isolated a human zzso of this gene zzso and found that the expression of zzso zzso is markedly zzso in a variety of human cancer cell lines including those of the zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the function of the zzso gene as a tumor zzso in human cancer cells, we constructed zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso introduced this virus into human cancer cell lines whose zzso expression was zzso and found that zzso has the ability to suppress zzso growth of these cells without disturbing cell zzso zzso with deletion zzso of the zzso gene revealed that both the zzso region inside the zzso domain and three consensus repeats in the zzso region are essential for the suppression of zzso growth of the zzso We also found that the zzso progression of the cell cycle and expression of zzso A zzso were significantly suppressed in zzso cells expressing the zzso gene under zzso culture zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso D and E and the zzso of zzso protein were not affected by zzso expression of the zzso zzso suggesting that an zzso zzso of zzso A is involved in the suppression of zzso growth by means of the zzso zzso
