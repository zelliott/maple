At promoters of the zzso coli zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso interacts with the zzso zzso to form zzso inactive zzso or zzso zzso Here, using zzso zzso analysis, we show that only one zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso to zzso functionally interacts with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Our results provide information about the architecture of zzso and zzso complexes and rule out the proposal that masking of zzso region 2 of zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso
