A penalty function for zzso zzso zzso has been applied in molecular dynamics simulations as an experimental zzso The function is based on the difference between the zzso constant calculated from the zzso angle and the zzso measured zzso zzso The method is illustrated on a model zzso zzso for which zzso alpha and zzso zzso both about the zzso backbone zzso angle, have been zzso The function is efficient in producing structures consistent with the zzso zzso but removed from the zzso observed in zzso This arises from the lack of J restraints for the zzso zzso zzso zzso with both nuclear zzso effect zzso and zzso restraints illustrates small but significant differences from simulations using only zzso
