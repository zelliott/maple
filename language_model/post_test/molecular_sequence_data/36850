The zzso mixture of zzso zzso zzso obtained from the single site of zzso of chicken zzso was resolved by a combination of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso gel zzso for zzso in conjunction with zzso Two zzso of similar size but with different zzso in zzso were zzso and characterized by sequential zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso PAGE system, as well as by zzso zzso The two zzso of identical size are distinct and have structures zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Man zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso (R zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that two-dimensional PAGE is zzso to the separation and characterization of complex zzso of zzso The procedure is zzso sensitive, and convenient for zzso zzso and for the zzso and structural characterization of zzso Furthermore, the zzso can be characterized with affinity zzso such as zzso and by zzso zzso
