Recently it has been reported that zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso growth factor zzso gene occur in a subset of patients with lung cancer showing a dramatic response to zzso zzso zzso zzso To gain further insights in the role of zzso in lung zzso we zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain using total zzso extracted from zzso 277 patients with lung cancer who underwent surgical zzso and correlated the results with clinical and zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in 111 patients zzso zzso were zzso deletions around zzso zzso in zzso 19, 54 were point zzso including 49 at zzso zzso in zzso 21 and 4 at zzso zzso in zzso 18, and 5 were zzso mainly in zzso zzso They were significantly more frequent in female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and smoking status zzso zzso zzso but not with female gender zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in well to moderately differentiated tumors zzso zzso zzso but were independent of patient age, disease zzso or patient zzso zzso and zzso zzso were present in 13 and zzso zzso zzso zzso never occurred in tumors with zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso were independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso define a distinct subset of pulmonary zzso without zzso zzso which is not caused by tobacco zzso
