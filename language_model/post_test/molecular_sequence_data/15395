zzso zzso channels zzso are reported to be zzso zzso diffusion zzso They are prominently localized in the outer zzso membrane and are involved in zzso exchange between the zzso and the zzso In this study, we have investigated a family of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We have shown that the zzso expression of zzso proteins can functionally complement a zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso were localized to zzso in both zzso and plant zzso We also looked at the response of zzso to zzso and zzso stresses and found that four zzso transcripts were rapidly zzso in response to a bacterial zzso
