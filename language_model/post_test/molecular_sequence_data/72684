To clarify the role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso nitrogen zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene region was carried zzso First, the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream of the zzso gene was zzso Genes zzso to zzso from the zzso gene regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the mop genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster were identified within the zzso zzso For zzso analysis the zzso zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In zzso the zzso coding region is disrupted by an zzso whereas zzso is deleted for a zzso zzso zzso encompassing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso for zzso but not for the other genes located further zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso of these zzso strains showed that zzso is necessary for maximum zzso activity and optimal growth under zzso conditions, but not absolutely essential for zzso zzso The role of alternative electron donors for zzso which might substitute for zzso is zzso Iron zzso (1 zzso zzso sufficient to induce synthesis of the zzso cell zzso did not stimulate zzso growth of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso was not replaced by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso indicated that one of the genes located downstream of zzso might also play a zzso role in nitrogen zzso
