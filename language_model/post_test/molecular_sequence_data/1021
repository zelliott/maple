We have investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the influence of the zzso gene on the production of three different bacterial symbiotic zzso zzso factors, signal responsive zzso zzso and zzso zzso The presence of multiple copies of zzso (in zzso zzso zzso the zzso of all the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or its zzso zzso of zzso altered the amount of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso produced zzso factors carrying zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which never have been detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the amounts of zzso produced by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso production of zzso and zzso but the presence of zzso reduced this zzso The presence of zzso zzso clearly decreased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso decreased the capacity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso carrying zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso capacity with zzso zzso The zzso gene was positively identified in all zzso zzso strains investigated, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Apparently, zzso zzso zzso does not contain this zzso
