zzso zzso are involved in most zzso processes and in numerous zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso have therefore a wide therapeutic zzso While screening for zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso A preliminary zzso relationship study suggests that this family of compounds can be zzso to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso were tested for their zzso activity and the results show that several of them displayed a significant zzso effect on zzso zzso The most active compound zzso was also tested against the brain zzso zzso and zzso and proved to be a good inhibitor of both of zzso On the contrary, none of the compounds showed any activity in the zzso zzso zzso As an additional approach, affinity zzso on immobilized zzso will be used to identify the zzso targets of this family of zzso
