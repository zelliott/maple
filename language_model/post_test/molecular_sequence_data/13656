We have zzso a protein of approximately zzso previously observed to zzso with the alpha 3 beta 1 zzso in zzso of surface zzso human zzso The zzso protein only appeared when zzso were harvested with zzso prior to zzso and a protein of similar molecular mass could be zzso from human zzso zzso following treatment of the cells with zzso N terminal sequencing established that the zzso protein had zzso with the alpha 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to confirm that the protein comprised the zzso zzso of alpha 3 and established that the site of zzso was after zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso could be zzso with alpha 3 beta 1 using an zzso to the zzso domain of the alpha 3 zzso showing that the zzso remained zzso with intact alpha 3 beta zzso When zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso of alpha 3 were used to label human zzso by zzso the zzso patterns were indistinguishable and there is therefore no evidence that zzso of alpha 3 plays a role in zzso detachment from the basement membrane during terminal zzso Whether the zzso zzso has any effects, positive or negative, on alpha 3 beta zzso zzso remains to be zzso
