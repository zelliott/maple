In recently published studies, we show that zzso II zzso generated from an engineered rat zzso zzso and maintained zzso is growth zzso for a rat zzso cell zzso In the present study, we report that zzso of zzso fused to zzso fluorescent protein zzso and zzso type I zzso fused to yellow fluorescent protein zzso enhances proliferation of zzso and zzso cells by 59% and zzso respectively, compared to cells expressing the corresponding independent proteins zzso zzso zzso for zzso This effect is inhibited by zzso suggesting (as in our previous published zzso that zzso is zzso by the cells, via zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso zzso The growth effect is independent of zzso zzso suggesting that it does not reflect zzso zzso into the culture zzso zzso is also zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso scrambled sequence zzso fused to zzso has no effect upon cell zzso zzso also alters the cellular zzso of zzso zzso is concentrated in the nucleus, but shows diffuse zzso zzso as zzso zzso expressed zzso is visible in the zzso zzso and zzso apparatus of zzso and zzso cells as early as zzso zzso At 72 zzso it is visibly associated with the plasma zzso By 144 zzso zzso of the cells show zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in cells that express zzso and zzso both proteins accumulate in the nucleus and only zzso of the cells show visible plasma zzso yellow zzso at 144 h zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with zzso stimulates zzso response zzso protein zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly significantly increases zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
