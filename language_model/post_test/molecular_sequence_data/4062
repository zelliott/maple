The zzso tails of the core zzso play important roles in zzso regulation, but their zzso of action are poorly zzso Here, pure zzso templates assembled with varied combinations of zzso zzso and zzso core zzso have been employed to ascertain the role of individual zzso tails, both in overall zzso patterns and in zzso In zzso zzso show an indispensable role for zzso and zzso tails, especially major zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso tails by zzso These results zzso first, that constraints to zzso are imposed by zzso zzso components other than zzso zzso tails and, second, that the zzso zzso tails have selective roles, which can be modulated by targeted zzso in zzso zzso by zzso
