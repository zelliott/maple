zzso X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental zzso in zzso The disease is associated with expansion in the number of tandem zzso zzso repeats in the zzso untranslated region of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals who are unaffected carriers of the disease, show a moderate increase in the number of repeat units, while fully zzso males show a major expansion in repeat zzso Major expansion of the repeat in affected males is correlated with zzso of certain restriction zzso recognition sites in the zzso zzso island containing the zzso repeat in these zzso zzso expression of the zzso appears to be due to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We now report direct high resolution zzso analysis of the zzso repeat and its zzso regions using zzso zzso zzso zzso We find the zzso zzso of all zzso zzso examined within and surrounding the zzso zzso repeat to be zzso in the DNA of normal male zzso and zzso male zzso these same zzso are zzso in affected male zzso in a zzso cell hybrid containing a fragile X zzso from an affected male, and in a zzso cell hybrid containing a normal inactive X zzso The zzso pattern of the zzso zzso zzso island in affected patients as determined by zzso sequencing is remarkably similar to that seen for the zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso islands on the inactive human X zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
