The membrane zzso of the zzso zzso transport protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by constructing deletion derivatives of the protein and genetically fusing them to zzso or zzso zzso The zzso activities of the hybrid proteins indicate that zzso is a zzso integral membrane protein consisting largely of two independent zzso The first zzso zzso acids form a large, highly charged domain within the zzso while the remaining 61 zzso form a small membrane domain containing two zzso zzso The overall orientation towards the zzso is consistent with the ability of zzso to facilitate zinc zzso
