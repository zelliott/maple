The canine disease, zzso progressive retinal zzso zzso is similar to human zzso an zzso form of zzso zzso and maps to the same region in the X zzso Analysis of the physical map of the zzso and zzso intervals shows a high degree of conservation in terms of genes and their zzso We have found different zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso gene in two distinct zzso dog strains zzso zzso zzso resulting in a premature stop or a zzso zzso result in very different retinal zzso which are zzso and consistent for each zzso The zzso associated with the zzso zzso in zzso is very severe and zzso during retinal zzso the zzso resulting from the zzso nonsense zzso is expressed only after normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso transcripts in zzso is complex, and either zzso zzso or zzso 19 can be a terminal zzso The zzso transcript contains zzso as a terminal zzso and is expressed in normal and zzso zzso The zzso zzso dramatically alters the deduced zzso acid zzso and the protein zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The cellular and molecular results in the two canine zzso zzso zzso zzso have implications for understanding the zzso zzso found in human zzso families that carry similar zzso
