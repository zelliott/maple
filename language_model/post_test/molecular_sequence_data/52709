zzso signal recognition particle zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays an essential role in targeting zzso proteins to the zzso apparatus in the cell zzso The zzso zzso increases the affinity of zzso for signal peptides and is essential for the interaction between zzso and its zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso also interacts with zzso factor G zzso in the zzso and this interaction is required for efficient zzso 

We have determined by multiple anomalous zzso zzso with zzso the zzso A crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso containing binding sites for both zzso and zzso This zzso consists of three zzso connected by a zzso and an zzso internal zzso In contrast to zzso structures reported zzso the zzso loop is entirely constituted by zzso base zzso These pairs continuously stack and project unusual sets of zzso donors and zzso into the shallow minor zzso The structure can therefore be regarded as two double zzso rods hinged by the zzso loop that zzso from one zzso 

Based on our crystal structure and results of chemical protection experiments reported zzso we predicted that zzso binds to the minor groove of the zzso zzso An identical zzso sequence is found in the zzso binding sites of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso structure in the zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso complex zzso suggests how zzso zzso and zzso zzso might interact with zzso and function in translating zzso
