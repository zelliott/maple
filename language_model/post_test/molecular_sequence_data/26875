To identify the zzso genetic zzso among the known cataract candidate genes underlying the observed zzso in a zzso family, with zzso nuclear zzso 

Because of the small family size, we used the functional candidate gene analysis zzso We screened a zzso family, clinically documented to have zzso nuclear zzso for zzso in the candidate genes zzso zzso & zzso zzso gamma C and zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso junction zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso alpha A and zzso alpha B), zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso & zzso zzso beta B1 and zzso beta zzso through zzso chain reaction analyses and zzso 

zzso screening identified only one significant zzso in zzso 6 zzso of zzso with a substitution of zzso to zzso at position zzso This zzso zzso in all five affected family members but it was not observed in any of the unaffected persons of the zzso The putative zzso led also to the appearance of a new zzso restriction site in the samples of the affected family members that was not present in 100 randomly selected DNA samples from zzso normal individuals and in 40 unrelated senile cataract patients of the same ethnic background as the family zzso 

This study identified a zzso zzso in zzso in a family of zzso with zzso dominant zzso cataract zzso In zzso we believe this new zzso zzso is the probable zzso molecular zzso for the observed zzso in this zzso
