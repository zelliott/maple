The development of zzso trachea is under the control of zzso and/or zzso regulated activity of zzso zzso zzso which is also essential for zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified the minimum zzso region of zzso cloned the zzso zzso gene zzso and showed zzso and genetic evidence that zzso expression in developing trachea is regulated by direct interactions between zzso zzso and three central zzso elements zzso situated in the minimum zzso zzso Our results also showed that zzso zzso which are essential for zzso expression in zzso precursor cells, share DNA targets in common with zzso indicating that two different basic zzso protein complexes act through the same target sites in zzso
