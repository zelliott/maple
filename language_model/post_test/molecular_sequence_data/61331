zzso zzso is vital for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso anchors linked to complex carbohydrates in zzso zzso All these cellular components are thought to play important roles in zzso interactions and in the survival of the pathogen within the zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso in zzso tuberculosis is not zzso To delineate the pathways for zzso formation, we employed a unique combination of zzso structure prediction and zzso functional zzso Here, we describe the identification of the gene for zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso distinct in many respects from the zzso zzso
