zzso the zzso of individual zzso response properties, has dramatic consequences for neural network function and is a phenomenon observed across all brain regions and zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso are made complex by the diversity of zzso receptors expressed within a neural zzso In this study we begin to examine the zzso basis for zzso zzso in the zzso lobe of zzso zzso To this end we cloned all four known insect zzso zzso types from zzso (the zzso We used zzso analyses to zzso the zzso and to establish their relationships to other insect zzso zzso other insect zzso receptors and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that each zzso was selective for zzso over other zzso zzso and that zzso had a similar potency at all four zzso The pharmacological zzso also identified several zzso and zzso of the different zzso Finally, we found that the zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso of zzso local zzso suggesting that the zzso are likely expressed zzso within the zzso lobe based on functional zzso zzso
