The zzso of the soybean pathogen zzso zzso contains nearly 400 genes zzso candidate zzso proteins carrying the host cell entry motif zzso Here, we report a broad survey of the transcription, variation, and functions of a large sample of the zzso zzso candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso genes showed high levels of zzso among zzso zzso zzso and significant evidence for positive zzso Of 169 zzso tested, most could suppress programmed cell death triggered by zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso while several triggered cell death zzso Among the most strongly expressed zzso one zzso class was highly expressed even prior to infection and was further induced zzso to zzso following zzso A second early class, including several that triggered cell death, was zzso expressed prior to infection but induced zzso to zzso during the first 12 h of zzso The most strongly expressed zzso zzso could suppress the cell death triggered by several early zzso and most early zzso could suppress zzso cell death, suggesting the two classes of zzso may target different functional branches of the defense zzso In support of this hypothesis, zzso of key zzso and early zzso severely reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
