zzso zzso is a zzso skin zzso first reported from rainbow trout zzso zzso Identification of the zzso based on zzso zzso is unreliable because zzso zzso is similar to several other zzso that share host species and geographic zzso The only zzso gene sequence available for zzso zzso is from zzso zzso zzso zzso but these data are not linked with any information on spore zzso Here we provide a supplemental description of zzso zzso from its type host, zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequence zzso Our zzso sequence data were only zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso sequence from zzso zzso which raises the possibility of zzso We suggest that zzso salmon are not a host of the zzso as no infections were found in current stocks or in zzso zzso of historical data from zzso fish held in waters that zzso zzso zzso in rainbow trout, and we could find no zzso report of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our complementary zzso and molecular data sets will facilitate zzso future identification of zzso zzso
