zzso zzso zzso is one of the novel zzso peptides found in molecular cloning of a zzso zzso zzso library from Asian scorpion zzso zzso zzso Based upon its zzso acid zzso the zzso was proposed to adopt a classical zzso for zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and investigated its action on zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively inhibited the delayed zzso zzso zzso but did not affect the fast transient zzso zzso The zzso of zzso on the delayed zzso zzso current was zzso and zzso The zzso did not affect the zzso zzso of the zzso but caused a zzso shift (about 9 zzso of its zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso scorpion zzso
