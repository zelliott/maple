A random amplified zzso DNA zzso procedure was used to identify a specific zzso zzso DNA zzso unique to zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was evaluated as a specific DNA probe and used to design zzso zzso for zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The zzso sequences adjacent to this DNA zzso were determined by inverse zzso allowing the identification of a zzso zzso zzso Analysis of this revealed a complete open reading frame zzso with a high similarity to an alkaline zzso from zzso zzso The molecular weight of the zzso derived from the predicted zzso acid sequence is zzso zzso its zzso is zzso The predicted zzso sequence of the zzso contains a signal sequence indicating that the zzso is exported by the zzso Since zzso have important protective and cell regulatory roles in the zzso we suggest that this zzso may have a role in the zzso of zzso It is the first completely zzso gene described for zzso zzso
