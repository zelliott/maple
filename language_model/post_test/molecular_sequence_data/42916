The zzso B virus 17 zzso zzso gene product expressed in bacteria zzso a human zzso promoter three- to zzso in an zzso manner in zzso cell zzso extracts containing zzso zzso zzso zzso However, if added prior to zzso zzso zzso the zzso Both the zzso dependent zzso of zzso zzso observed in transient zzso analysis, and the zzso observed in zzso is dependent on the presence of an upstream zzso zzso zzso is incorporated via zzso interactions into DNA complexes containing the zzso zzso of zzso and into a stable zzso zzso zzso This is consistent with a role as a zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso We propose that the zzso dependent zzso and repression of zzso zzso occurs by changes in the zzso factor limiting zzso and propose that zzso may have a dual role in the regulation of zzso in zzso
