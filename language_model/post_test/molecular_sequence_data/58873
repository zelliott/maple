zzso is a mouse B cell surface zzso that zzso a zzso signal and is implicated in the zzso decision of B zzso zzso has tandem repeats of a zzso motif in the zzso domain that is expected to be involved in zzso zzso In the present study, a zzso clone zzso the human zzso of zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequence of human zzso is highly zzso to that of mouse zzso with zzso identity, and the zzso repeats are well zzso The expression of the human zzso transcript was detected in some B cell lines, a zzso leukemia cell line, and peripheral blood zzso We also determined the zzso locations of the mouse zzso gene zzso zzso and the human zzso gene zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso analysis was used to map the zzso locus at the zzso region of zzso zzso The human zzso locus was localized to zzso by zzso in zzso zzso confirming the zzso relationship between these regions of the mouse and human zzso
