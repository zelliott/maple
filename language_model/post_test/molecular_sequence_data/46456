zzso of zzso the insect steroid hormones controlling gene expression during zzso and zzso takes place primarily in the zzso zzso zzso The activity of the PG is regulated by various zzso In the zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso both hormonal and zzso pathways to regulate the activity of the zzso making the insect an excellent model system to investigate the complex signaling network controlling zzso zzso Here we report another group of zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso Using direct mass zzso profiling of the zzso associated with the zzso we detected several zzso zzso which zzso to zzso gene products in addition to the previously described zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso are produced in the prominent zzso cells in the zzso zzso as well as in numerous small zzso throughout the central nervous system and in zzso zzso zzso One of the two pairs of zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and these zzso project zzso through the zzso nerve and terminate on the surface of the zzso Using an in zzso PG zzso we show that zzso have a clear zzso activity and are able to cancel the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso whereas the zzso effect of zzso on zzso production remained unchanged in the presence of zzso The discovery of a second regulator of PG activity in these zzso further illustrates the potential importance of the PG zzso in the regulation of insect zzso
