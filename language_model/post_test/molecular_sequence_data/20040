zzso are zzso that form zzso side chains of variable lengths on zzso zzso of zzso is believed to regulate interactions of zzso zzso with zzso proteins and molecular zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso yet only one zzso zzso has been discovered in zzso In an attempt to better understand the zzso appearance of zzso zzso we searched for additional zzso and report here the identification of six zzso zzso Each of them has a characteristic mode of zzso and generates distinct patterns of modification on zzso which can be further diversified by cooperation of multiple zzso zzso are restricted to confined zzso and zzso of zzso by differential expression and zzso In conclusion, we propose a zzso mechanism of zzso that can explain how the diversity of zzso on selected types of zzso is controlled at the molecular zzso
