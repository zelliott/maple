zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins belong to one of the largest zzso zzso factor zzso families and play important roles in plant development zzso response to zzso and zzso cues and hormone zzso Our zzso analysis identified 110 zzso genes in potato zzso for 136 zzso including 14 zzso zzso The physical map positions of zzso genes on 12 potato zzso were zzso and 40 genes were found to be distributed in 16 zzso The zzso proteins were zzso clustered into 12 zzso zzso analysis of zzso along with their zzso and rice counterparts divided these proteins into 18 zzso Our comparative analysis has also identified 36 putative zzso zzso which appear to be restricted to zzso zzso In zzso expression analysis, using zzso zzso zzso data, revealed zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso expression profile of zzso zzso Several zzso zzso including zzso and zzso are zzso of known zzso zzso zzso TO zzso 26 zzso were identified as highly zzso stress zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction analysis largely zzso the expression profile of zzso genes as revealed by the zzso zzso Taken together, this analysis indicates towards putative functions of several zzso zzso which will provide zzso for their functional characterization and zzso in potato zzso
