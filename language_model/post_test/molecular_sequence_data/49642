The X-ray structure of zzso I zzso I) from zzso zzso was recently solved at zzso resolution zzso entry zzso It provides a structural model for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which comprise the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In a separate set of studies the three-dimensional solution structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso entry zzso and zzso zzso entries zzso zzso and zzso zzso were solved by zzso The zzso zzso of zzso I is a small zzso zzso protein that harbors binding sites for two zzso clusters zzso and zzso which are the terminal electron zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso structure in solution with that in the X-ray structure of zzso I reveals significant differences between them which are summarized and evaluated zzso Changes in the magnetic properties of zzso centers zzso and zzso are related to changes in the protein structure of zzso and they are further influenced by the presence of zzso Based on experimental evidence, three assembly stages are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studied by zzso has only a few elements of secondary structure and no stable three-dimensional structure in zzso When zzso is bound in zzso I, it has a zzso three-dimensional zzso For zzso the three-dimensional structure is very similar in solution and in the zzso zzso form, with the exception of two loop zzso We suggest that the changes in the structures of zzso and zzso are caused by the sequential formation of multiple networks of contacts between the zzso of the zzso zzso and between those zzso and the zzso core zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso were also analyzed and found to be significantly different from the binding sites of other proteins that contain zzso zzso zzso The aim of this work is to relate contact information to structural changes in the proteins and to propose a model for the assembly of the zzso zzso of zzso I based on this zzso
