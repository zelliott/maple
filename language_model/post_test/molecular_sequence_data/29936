zzso virus 40 zzso zzso zzso carries base pair zzso of zzso and zzso These zzso lie in a region of the zzso that encodes zzso acids common to the large and small viral tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and result in zzso acid zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso which produces large plaques that are clearly visible 8 days zzso zzso zzso is defective for productive infection, producing tiny plaques that arise at around 21 days zzso However, zzso is capable of replicating viral DNA and producing normal amounts of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso alter an activity of T zzso that is required subsequent to DNA zzso such as zzso viral zzso or release of zzso The zzso T zzso has normal zzso activity, is zzso in a manner that is indistinguishable from that of the zzso T zzso and retains the ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in T zzso host zzso helper function for productive zzso Thus, T zzso encodes two activities that affect at least two different steps in viral infection other than DNA zzso one zzso by zzso in the host zzso helper domain and one zzso by the zzso present in zzso The zzso T zzso is also defective for transformation of zzso cells when expressed from the normal zzso early promoter, although this zzso can be partially overcome by expressing the protein from stronger zzso
