zzso in the zzso zzso protein have been associated with both zzso and human zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso proteins may bear unique zzso zzso for immune recognition, such as by T cells, which have been implicated in host zzso zzso zzso peptides that mimic segments of zzso zzso zzso have been reported to be zzso in mice in zzso although detailed functional analyses remains zzso Here, in a zzso model, we explored and characterized distinct zzso properties of zzso T zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso which was consistent with the zzso T helper type 1 zzso zzso zzso mice zzso were zzso with a zzso zzso 13 zzso acids in zzso containing the substitution of zzso zzso to Val zzso at position 12, which is commonly found in human zzso An alpha beta T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso T cell line was established, which expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the production of zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cells incubated with zzso bound zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the corresponding point zzso zzso zzso was major zzso complex zzso class zzso as revealed by the absence of zzso against zzso class zzso zzso targets, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and induction of zzso against L cell targets zzso with E alpha A beta zzso Independent isolation of a second zzso zzso line revealed a very similar zzso and zzso class zzso zzso Overall, these data demonstrated that zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso response that specifically recognized tumor cells expressing zzso activated zzso zzso which may have implications for the development of zzso active zzso
