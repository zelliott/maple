We have cloned the putative shark promoter of protein zero zzso using a novel application of the zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso This method uses zzso zzso and subsequent zzso with a zzso primer and multiple specific zzso to generate zzso The method allowed us to amplify approximately zzso base pairs of shark zzso DNA sequence immediately upstream from the zzso end of our full-length zzso zzso The zzso promoter was shown to be directly linked to its first zzso contain a zzso initiation start site and sequences commonly found in zzso zzso This zzso walking technique will be useful for cloning zzso zzso sites, and other sequences of interest without the need for constructing and screening zzso zzso
