A portion of the active site of rabbit skeletal zzso near the zzso ring of zzso can be labeled by the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso was assured by first zzso zzso at the active site by use of zzso zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Five radioactive peptides were isolated by zzso liquid zzso after extensive zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Four of these peptides were zzso by zzso techniques, and all originated from a region with the sequence zzso which zzso to rabbit zzso heavy chain zzso zzso The fifth labeled zzso had an zzso acid composition appropriate for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso analysis, and sequence data indicate that zzso is the major zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso zzso evidence indicates that the zzso zzso group has inserted into a zzso bond from either the zzso or zzso of zzso These results place zzso at a distance of zzso A from the zzso zzso zzso of zzso bound at the active site of zzso
