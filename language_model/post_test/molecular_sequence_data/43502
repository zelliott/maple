zzso and functional studies of the zzso zzso upstream promoter elements were undertaken to zzso the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso germ zzso zzso zzso zzso gene walking techniques were exploited to isolate a zzso zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso promoter zzso DNA sequence analysis of this isolated zzso zzso indicated that the mouse zzso promoter contained zzso and zzso boxes as well as a zzso zzso zzso situated upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso in zzso zzso I zzso analysis of a 600 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promoter region zzso in isolated mouse zzso zzso identified a single footprint over the zzso zzso Three zzso I hypersensitive sites were also zzso in zzso in a region containing zzso repeats upstream from the zzso box zzso zzso characterization of the promoter region was carried out in a rat zzso zzso cell line and an zzso transformed germ cell line zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso These studies provide experimental evidence suggesting that zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is regulated by zzso zzso of the zzso proteins bound to the zzso motif zzso in zzso in zzso zzso
