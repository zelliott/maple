zzso zzso signal zzso activity was previously isolated as a complex of five zzso zzso zzso 21, 18, and 12 zzso Two of the signal zzso complex zzso zzso zzso and 21 zzso have been cloned and zzso One of these, the zzso zzso was observed to be a zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene product essential for signal zzso processing and cell growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso clones for the zzso zzso zzso have now been characterized and found to zzso a second zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso canine zzso zzso are integral membrane proteins by virtue of their resistance to alkaline zzso Upon zzso zzso both proteins are found in a complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the only zzso zzso containing zzso zzso No zzso pool of canine zzso zzso is detected in zzso zzso zzso extraction of zzso prior to zzso or zzso at alkaline pH causes partial zzso of the zzso The zzso zzso displaced from the complex under these conditions demonstrate no signal zzso processing activity by zzso The existence of zzso zzso is common to a number of known protein complexes and provides further evidence that the association between zzso proteins observed in zzso may be zzso relevant to the mechanism of signal zzso processing and perhaps protein zzso
