Crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli in space groups zzso and zzso have been refined to zzso of zzso and zzso against data to zzso and zzso A, zzso Bond lengths and angles zzso from expected values by zzso A and zzso degrees for the zzso crystal form and by zzso A and zzso degrees for the zzso crystal zzso The fold of the zzso chain is dominated by a central zzso which is composed of nine parallel strands and a tenth zzso zzso zzso off from this central zzso are four zzso The four zzso contribute zzso of zzso that are zzso or have high zzso zzso At least three of these zzso zzso 42 to 52, 120 to 131 and zzso to zzso contribute essential zzso to the putative active site of the zzso In the absence of zzso much of the active site of the zzso exists in an zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly independent regions contribute zzso to the interface between zzso chains of the zzso zzso A pair of zzso zzso and zzso interact with their zzso zzso by way of zzso that are not zzso amongst the known sequences of the zzso The second interface region involves zzso zzso belonging to structural elements that connect strands of the central zzso zzso zzso involved in the binding of zzso lie at or near the interface between zzso chains of the zzso Of the four sequence elements zzso common to all zzso zzso the zzso has only the zzso recognition element and a zzso loop zzso Although the base recognition element is essentially identical with those of the zzso zzso and G alpha zzso the zzso of the zzso is extended in size relative to the zzso of other zzso zzso The zzso has two acid zzso zzso and zzso which are found in the zzso of only the zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the stabilization of the enlarged zzso of the zzso whereas zzso may play a role in zzso and in the coordination of zzso The structural elements of the zzso zzso and G alpha proteins responsible for binding zzso are either absent from the zzso or unavailable for the coordination of metal zzso
