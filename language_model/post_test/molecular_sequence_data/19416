zzso zzso zzso play a pivotal role in determining the fine structure of starch by catalyzing the zzso of zzso zzso They are the members of the zzso family and have four zzso regions in a central zzso barrel, including the zzso zzso Although the role of the zzso barrel domain of an zzso is known, that of its zzso and zzso regions remain zzso We have previously shown that the zzso regions of the two zzso zzso zzso as zzso and zzso from kidney bean zzso zzso zzso have different roles in branching zzso zzso To understand the contribution of the zzso region to zzso six zzso zzso were constructed between zzso and zzso Only one zzso zzso in which a portion of the zzso region of zzso was zzso by the corresponding region of zzso retained zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso truncated form zzso lacking 46 zzso zzso of zzso lost zzso activity and stability to zzso To investigate the possible function of this region, three zzso zzso zzso and zzso among these 46 zzso were subjected to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed nearly the same zzso values as zzso but had lower zzso values and heat zzso than zzso These results suggest that the zzso region of the kidney bean zzso is essential for maximum zzso activity and zzso
