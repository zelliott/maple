zzso infections cause substantial morbidity worldwide and effective prevention will depend on a zzso Since zzso immunity is T zzso a major impediment to developing a molecular vaccine has been the difficulty in identifying relevant T cell zzso In this study, we used a combination of affinity zzso and tandem mass zzso to identify 13 zzso peptides among 331 zzso presented by zzso class II zzso molecules from bone zzso zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso These zzso class zzso peptides were recognized by zzso zzso T cells harvested from immune mice and adoptive transfer of zzso cells zzso ex zzso with the peptides partially protected mice against zzso and zzso tract zzso zzso The results provide evidence for lead vaccine candidates for a T zzso zzso molecular vaccine against zzso infection suitable for human zzso
