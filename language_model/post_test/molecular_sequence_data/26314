The zzso zzso zzso gene was expressed at high level in zzso coli zzso when placed under the zzso and zzso control of zzso in zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso expression of full-length and truncated forms of zzso was regulated by zzso zzso active zzso E zzso produced by zzso coli was subject to zzso zzso The main protein species produced from full-length and truncated forms of zzso was around 40 zzso in size and had an zzso zzso acid sequence corresponding to that derived for mature zzso from the zzso zzso in addition, larger species of about 75 zzso presumably corresponding to full-size zzso were produced by zzso coli containing the full-length zzso zzso Even after removal of the signal zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso coli was zzso into the zzso Up to 157 zzso could be deleted from the zzso end of the zzso gene without affecting the zzso activity of zzso produced by zzso zzso A zzso of Mr 86 zzso zzso with zzso zzso was demonstrated in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso culture zzso
