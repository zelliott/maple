By analysis of the existing available data, we have found that the locations of zzso zzso in zzso zzso genes are distributed in a zzso zzso Most occur in zzso 1 and 7 which zzso the highly zzso zzso and zzso rod domain sequence regions of the zzso zzso Recent structural studies have suggested these sequences define an important overlap between neighboring molecules in zzso intermediate zzso In order to better map the extent of these overlap sequences and zzso to identify those sequences likely to be sensitive to zzso we have used a series of synthetic peptides in an established filament zzso zzso Thus zzso positions zzso of the zzso and positions zzso of the zzso rod domain segments describe the extent of the molecular overlap window wherein zzso in zzso (and perhaps zzso intermediate filaments are most likely to alter filament stability and lead to zzso
