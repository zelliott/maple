New zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and used to prepare zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso acid zzso First, the chemical synthesis and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Second, zzso zzso buffer type and zzso and ratio of zzso to zzso to zzso were varied to obtain zzso with different chemical and physical zzso Third, two new zzso are described to monitor the stability of zzso toward zzso zzso and other zzso These zzso were used to evaluate the stability of zzso zzso to zzso solutions and different pH zzso zzso zzso gave the most stable gels, and the zzso of the gels to zzso was independent of zzso zzso zzso does not significantly penetrate the zzso and acts primarily at the zzso zzso The zzso are stable in acid environments and zzso gradually above pH zzso
