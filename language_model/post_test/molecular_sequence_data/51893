zzso precursor cells in zzso acquire their identity early during their zzso In an attempt to determine whether all neural precursors share a set of genetic machinery, perhaps to control properties of differentiation common to all zzso we used the zzso method to identify several genes zzso zzso that are expressed in all zzso and/or their zzso One of the zzso genes is zzso which encodes a zzso protein closely related to the product of the zzso gene zzso The function of deadpan is essential for viability and is likely to be involved in the functional rather than the zzso differentiation of zzso
