DEAD box proteins are putative zzso unwinding proteins found in organisms ranging from zzso to zzso While some DEAD box genes expressed in higher zzso are zzso others have distribution profiles that suggest a zzso zzso or zzso zzso The DEAD box zzso zzso was identified by differential screening of a zzso zzso zzso zzso A limited survey of human fetal zzso indicated that zzso zzso has a widespread distribution but is not zzso expressed in all zzso To further document the spatial and zzso distribution of zzso during embryonic development, we cloned the chicken zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of chicken zzso was zzso identical to that of human zzso All DEAD box zzso as well as a zzso domain, were present in chicken zzso Northern and Western zzso analyses showed highest levels of zzso at early stages of zzso zzso maturation was generally accompanied by a decrease in zzso although zzso levels remained elevated in late embryonic zzso and zzso In zzso zzso of retinal tissue sections revealed widespread distribution of zzso zzso at early zzso stages with preferential expression in zzso and zzso cells of the differentiated zzso zzso expression of zzso was also observed in specific areas of the brain in older zzso such as the external zzso layer of the zzso These results suggest a specific role for zzso in zzso of differentiated cells as well as a more general role in zzso zzso
