The reverse zzso zzso of the human zzso virus zzso is a proven target for therapeutic intervention of zzso zzso We have found several new zzso zzso of zzso zzso that differ significantly from the zzso zzso found zzso along with a wide variety of zzso zzso One zzso zzso and three novel zzso were studied in more zzso Each specifically zzso DNA zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso to 20 zzso zzso but not that of zzso derived from zzso or zzso The minimal binding element of each isolate was determined by deletion analysis and by gel zzso of zzso partially zzso zzso zzso of three of the zzso bound nearly as well as (or better zzso the parental zzso while most deletions in the fourth caused substantial disruption of zzso The truncated versions of two zzso were subjected to six rounds of secondary zzso after zzso them zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso yielded structural models consistent with zzso and 3' boundary zzso for these zzso Among the four zzso studied in detail, the first is confirmed as being a zzso albeit with substantial structural differences as compared to the zzso zzso identified zzso The second forms a zzso structure with additional zzso sequences required for zzso zzso structural models for the other two zzso are zzso The minimal fully active zzso of each of these four zzso compete with each other and with a classical zzso zzso for binding to zzso zzso suggesting that they all recognize the same or overlapping sites on the zzso in spite of their apparently dissimilar zzso We model their interactions with zzso as mimicking the 40 to 45 degrees bend in zzso zzso with zzso
