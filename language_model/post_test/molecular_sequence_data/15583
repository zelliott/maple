Several zzso strategies have been developed targeting specific zzso acid zzso and/or zzso zzso specifically tailored for the qualitative and sometimes quantitative determination of zzso have zzso Many research groups have focused their attention towards zzso zzso developing various zzso for their zzso while direct zzso has remained zzso So far the zzso chemistry has been limited to primary zzso Here, we report a new strategy based on the use of zzso zzso coupled to zzso analysis for the selective zzso of zzso zzso This method was proved to lead to the simultaneous zzso and zzso of zzso sites both in model proteins and in biological zzso
