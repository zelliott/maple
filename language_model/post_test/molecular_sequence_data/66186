Despite over a decade of research, only recently have the mechanisms governing transient zzso potential channel zzso channel function begun to emerge, with an essential role for accessory proteins in this zzso We previously identified a zzso zzso event as critical in the plasma membrane zzso and zzso of zzso channels following zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso To further characterize the signaling events underlying this process, a zzso hybrid screen was performed on the C zzso of zzso The zzso zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso zzso was used to screen a human brain zzso zzso Two members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso were identified as binding zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso acids zzso of zzso as critical for the interaction with this region located within a zzso domain, zzso the zzso and zzso region zzso zzso This region is deleted in the proposed zzso zzso zzso form, which failed to undergo both zzso membrane zzso and zzso providing a genetic mechanism for regulating channel zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso following zzso application is accompanied by zzso from zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso by small interference zzso reduces the zzso surface expression of zzso and prevents the enhanced membrane zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso did not affect the expression of the delta zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that a direct interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso surface expression and zzso
