Many natural products contain unusual aromatic zzso acids or zzso derived zzso The zzso of these zzso acids was first zzso during a zzso study of the zzso zzso zzso zzso when an zzso zzso was discovered to convert zzso to zzso zzso is similar in sequence and structure to zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso use the zzso power of the zzso group to catalyze the release of zzso from aromatic zzso acids to generate zzso zzso acids as final products, zzso retains the zzso zzso acid and zzso as zzso and zzso the zzso group to the zzso zzso a zzso acid as the final zzso The study of zzso led to the subsequent discovery of other zzso zzso with altered zzso specificity and product zzso including zzso from the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This chapter describes protocols for the zzso and structural characterization of these zzso zzso as exemplified by zzso and zzso These protocols are zzso to the study of other zzso
