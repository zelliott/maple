We have performed a zzso analysis of the promoter for the chicken zzso zzso zzso factor, and have investigated in detail the interaction of the factor with an upstream zzso element zzso We find that a single zzso zzso binding site of the ARE is required for promoter activity in primary zzso zzso however, this minimal promoter is inappropriately active in zzso At least two molecules of zzso can interact with the zzso and sequences outside of the consensus site appear critical for the zzso activity of the bound zzso Finally, we provide evidence for complex zzso interactions at the zzso including the ability of zzso to bend zzso
