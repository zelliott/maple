The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing a zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso The gene was expressed from its own regulatory region in zzso coli and a putative consensus promoter sequence was identified upstream of a zzso binding site and a zzso start zzso The complete zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was deduced and showed no significant zzso to zzso from other zzso Two zzso active sites were found in the zzso third of the zzso In zzso coli the cloned zzso A protein was zzso into the zzso The lack of a typical signal zzso and the results of zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso is zzso by a mechanism other than a leader zzso
