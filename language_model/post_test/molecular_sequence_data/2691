zzso of zzso zzso DNA generated by partial zzso with zzso were cloned into zzso zzso A zzso zzso E alpha zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso The E zzso gene is part of the zzso B zzso The gene was zzso and was found to contain seven intervening zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the gene has a zzso zzso at the zzso The E zzso gene has much in common with the N zzso gene cloned into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso Cox zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the gene products E zzso and N zzso differ in zzso acid sequence near to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso acids zzso of E zzso and zzso zzso to zzso acids zzso of N zzso were zzso and used to raise zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were used to show that on two-dimensional gel zzso N zzso travels to the alpha 1 position and E zzso moves to the alpha 2 zzso zzso DNA zzso were used to show that transcripts of the E zzso gene were present in the zzso but not in the zzso phase of the life zzso The zzso and zzso detected E zzso and N zzso in zzso but not in zzso confirming that the expression of the E zzso and N zzso genes is regulated during zzso E zzso and N zzso were shown to be components of zzso zzso by indirect zzso zzso
