A zzso region is present following the zzso sequence in the zzso portion of all known zzso zzso zzso To assess the functional significance of the zzso zzso in this region, we systematically altered these zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso one, two, and three zzso zzso out of the five in the region were exchanged for zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso proteins were expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso proteins were all highly expressed in the zzso cells zzso of the total membrane zzso The expressed zzso zzso showed a typical carbon monoxide difference spectrum of zzso and the activity of testosterone zzso whereas all the zzso proteins constructed in the present study showed no characteristic zzso spectrum, suggesting that the substitution of the zzso zzso in this region resulted in a zzso of proper zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso proteins in which more than one zzso zzso had been exchanged were more sensitive to zzso zzso than the wild zzso From these results, we propose that the zzso zzso in the zzso region are crucial for the formation of the correct zzso of zzso zzso zzso
