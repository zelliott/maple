Genome analysis of zzso zzso zzso has been recently zzso One of its zzso zzso zzso encodes the protein having the zzso domain of zzso zzso family zzso Its zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed using an zzso coli expression system, resulting in poor production of zzso zzso protein due to inclusion body zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso was improved with high concentration of zzso in zzso possible zzso zzso induction by zzso alcohol, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was an zzso with broad zzso specificity toward both homogeneous and zzso zzso This zzso displayed higher specificity (in terms of zzso toward zzso zzso and zzso than other natural zzso having an zzso linkage at the zzso end, which suggests that these zzso are candidates for zzso contributing to the growth of zzso zzso To our knowledge, zzso is the first bacterial zzso to be characterized with a high zzso value for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso produced two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso and zzso properties of zzso are different from those of mold zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso family zzso
