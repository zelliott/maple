zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso are infectious only when the viral coat protein binds to the zzso 3' zzso The crystal structure of an alfalfa mosaic virus zzso complex reveals that zzso zzso repeats and zzso coat protein zzso acids zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso have opposite orientation, and they base pair in different adjacent zzso zzso zzso backbone zzso stabilized by zzso interactions place the zzso and zzso in reverse order in the zzso The results suggest that a uniform, organized 3' zzso similar to that found on viral zzso with transfer zzso ends, may be essential for zzso
