zzso maintenance of zzso zzso proteins form a zzso zzso in which a central hinge domain connects two zzso arms, each having an zzso binding head domain at its zzso zzso Here, we show that the hinge domain plays essential roles in modulating the zzso cycle of zzso zzso An initial interaction of the hinge domain with DNA leads to opening of the arms by triggering zzso of zzso bound to the head zzso which are located approximately 50 zzso away from the zzso This zzso change allows the inner surface of the hinge domain to zzso interact with DNA by an zzso mechanism and zzso zzso engagement between the liberated head zzso either zzso or zzso zzso a variety of hinge zzso drastically alter DNA binding properties of zzso proteins through distinct zzso Our results suggest that zzso proteins possess an intrinsic property to change their own zzso upon binding to zzso
