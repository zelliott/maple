In order to detect a large spectrum of small zzso zzso zzso for zzso were chosen in zzso parts of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso virus zzso and of the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso This set of zzso was tested in six different zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso virus zzso of Dutch, American and Swiss zzso The zzso zzso allowed the detection of the corresponding fragments of all zzso The zzso zzso allowed amplification of the corresponding fragments of all but the Swiss zzso virus strain zzso Using the zzso zzso one zzso and two zzso zzso virus strains were detected after one round of zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso amplification products and comparison to zzso zzso virus and zzso strain CO revealed total zzso of 38% for the zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso The virus strains studied fall into two groups which are more closely related to one another than to zzso zzso zzso
