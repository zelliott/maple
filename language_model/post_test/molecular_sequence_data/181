Get into the zzso The first high-resolution structure of a zzso bound to a protein target is described (see zzso zzso in zzso The zzso consists of zzso and zzso acid zzso and is bound to the zzso protein zzso The overall binding mode and key interactions observed in the zzso complex mimic those seen in complexes of zzso with natural zzso zzso Additional contacts in the zzso complex involving zzso acid zzso appear to contribute to binding zzso
