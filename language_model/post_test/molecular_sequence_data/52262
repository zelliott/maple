A zzso acid zzso class I zzso zzso has been split into three inactive zzso The three peptides spontaneously assemble in zzso to zzso active zzso Active zzso complexes were demonstrated in zzso The zzso assembly of this zzso increases by zzso the size of a zzso that has been demonstrated to be assembled from more than two constituent zzso The results indicate that contemporary zzso zzso zzso or other large proteins could in principle develop from zzso composed of zzso zzso of multiple zzso
