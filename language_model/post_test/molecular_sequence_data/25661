zzso studies of zzso zzso were conducted to characterize the structural basis for the zzso zzso observed between human and zzso A alpha chains when employing an zzso to the zzso human zzso zzso zzso fragment, A alpha zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso with this zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso It was further zzso by sequential zzso zzso on zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso fragment, designated zzso alpha zzso identified one major sequence whose first three zzso zzso were identical with those of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were resolved by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the separated components were characterized by zzso acid analysis and automated zzso zzso A total of 34 zzso and 20 zzso zzso peptides yielded sequence information that permitted the alignment of zzso zzso zzso with zzso A alpha zzso from the zzso two-thirds of the human A alpha chain so that zzso of the possible matches were zzso Other features of interest included zzso an zzso acid substitution in which the zzso zzso at A alpha zzso in the human A alpha chain was replaced by a zzso zzso thus accounting, in part, for the larger zzso alpha zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zzso and zzso a region of striking zzso in which 36 successive zzso corresponding to A alpha zzso in the human A alpha chain, were identical in both zzso These findings, together with available structural data for the zzso portion of the rat and bovine A alpha zzso indicate that the region corresponding to zzso A alpha zzso represents a zzso portion of the zzso zzso This may, in turn, explain the difficulties encountered when trying to raise zzso zzso to zzso regions that are contained within the zzso two-thirds of the human A alpha zzso
