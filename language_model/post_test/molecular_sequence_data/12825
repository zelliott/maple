A DNA segment containing the zzso region and zzso terminal reading frame of the gastric intrinsic factor gene was cloned from rat and its zzso sequence was zzso zzso mapping demonstrated that the zzso initiation site is located downstream of the second zzso zzso Similar sequence motifs to those in the zzso genes transcribed in gastric chief cells were found in the deduced zzso suggesting that the rat intrinsic factor gene is transcribed in these zzso The genes for the intrinsic factor and its zzso protein zzso I were apparently derived from a common zzso zzso since the positions of their zzso insertions as well as the zzso acid zzso are zzso Northern zzso zzso showed that the gene for the intrinsic factor is transcribed in the stomach but not zzso in the zzso zzso zzso brain, heart, liver, zzso or zzso In zzso zzso using radioactive complementary zzso clearly indicated that the major zzso site in gastric zzso is chief zzso Different locations of expression of intrinsic factor proteins in various zzso were observed previously using zzso in rat zzso cells and chief cells, in mouse chief cells, and in human zzso zzso The present results clearly demonstrated the intrinsic factor zzso mainly in chief cells of adult rats, as in mice, suggesting that zzso regulation of the intrinsic factor gene is essentially the same in zzso
