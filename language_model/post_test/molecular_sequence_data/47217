A sensitive technique for the zzso of bovine zzso was developed using zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of the bovine zzso zzso gene on the zzso and zzso of zzso dairy zzso Cloning and DNA sequencing showed a zzso zzso between the fifth zzso of the zzso and zzso gene with multiple zzso A pair of zzso zzso was designed to allow amplification of a single zzso of zzso from the zzso of female cattle and two fragments of zzso and zzso from the zzso and zzso of male zzso The zzso were successfully applied to bovine zzso from single zzso isolated from zzso to zzso cow zzso by direct cell zzso and zzso Our protocol of zzso zzso should be zzso to the diagnosis of defective genes in zzso in human zzso and in other domestic or recreational zzso
