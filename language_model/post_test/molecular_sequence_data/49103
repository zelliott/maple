zzso displays a wide range of effects in cellular zzso Surprisingly, the structural consequences of zzso binding to peptides and proteins are poorly zzso This study zzso model zzso peptides containing two zzso zzso zzso in various sequential arrangements and spatial locations to study the structural effects of zzso zzso With zzso and i + 1, i + 2, or i + 3 arrangements, CD zzso shows that zzso coordination causes zzso zzso when zzso zzso are located at central or zzso regions of the zzso Interestingly, zzso binding to zzso i + 3 positions results in the elimination of zzso structure and the formation of a relatively stable alternate zzso In contrast, zzso stabilization is observed for peptides containing zzso i + 4 zzso zzso with corresponding zzso zzso interaction energies zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and central zzso zzso zzso affinities and association rate zzso show that zzso binding is comparatively insensitive to the location of the zzso zzso within these moderately stable zzso These data demonstrate that zzso binding can be a significant zzso of zzso secondary zzso
