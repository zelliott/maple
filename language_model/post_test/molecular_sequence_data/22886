The zzso protein sonic zzso zzso plays an integral role in forming the zzso zzso of the zzso central nervous system zzso In the absence of zzso function, zzso zzso development is zzso resulting in zzso zzso a structural zzso of the brain, as well as in zzso patterning and path finding defects along the length of the zzso zzso Central to the understanding of zzso neural tube development is how zzso zzso is regulated in the zzso To address this issue, we devised an zzso trap zzso to systematically screen 1 zzso of DNA surrounding the zzso locus for the ability to target reporter gene expression to sites of zzso zzso in transgenic mouse zzso This analysis uncovered six enhancers distributed over 400 zzso the combined activity of which covered all sites of zzso expression in the mouse embryonic zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso extent of the spinal zzso To evaluate the relative contribution of these enhancers to the overall pattern of zzso zzso individual elements were deleted in the context of a transgenic Bac reporter zzso zzso mechanisms were found to control zzso reporter activity in the zzso spinal cord, zzso and regions of the zzso whereas unique elements regulated zzso expression in the zzso zzso the majority of the zzso zzso and parts of the zzso Three zzso zzso enhancers locate on the zzso side of zzso zzso that occurred upstream of zzso in human cases of zzso suggesting that displacement of these regulatory elements from the zzso promoter is a likely cause of zzso in these zzso
