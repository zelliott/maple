zzso is a computer program that designs walking zzso for large-scale DNA sequencing zzso zzso zzso are predicted automatically, using quality information associated with each base call, eliminating the need for manually viewing the sequence traces or inspecting zzso zzso to determine appropriate locations for primer zzso This allows zzso to run in batch mode on an arbitrarily large number of zzso For shotgun sequencing, zzso reads assembled sequence zzso with corresponding base quality statistics and automatically designs walking zzso as needed to extend and join zzso or improve their overall zzso In the opposite extreme of zzso or completely directed sequencing, zzso reads the zzso sequence for each template and designs walking zzso for extending each zzso If the zzso software does not provide base quality statistics, zzso assigns its own measure of base quality determined by the shapes of individual zzso in the trace data for each zzso In this way, zzso can be used in the finishing stages of a shotgun sequencing project, in sequencing by directed primer walking, or in some intermediate zzso The code is written in zzso C and maintained in two zzso one for the Macintosh and the other for zzso
