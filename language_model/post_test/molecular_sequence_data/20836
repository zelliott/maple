zzso methods were used to predict the zzso acid sequences and gene locations for zzso zzso zzso zzso genes and proteins using zzso sequence zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso genes were located in tandem on zzso 11, while zzso and zzso genes were on zzso 15 and 12, zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were located in tandem with the zzso zzso gene on zzso 5 and contained 7 zzso and zzso or 8 zzso zzso An zzso acid sequence prediction for the zzso zzso zzso gave an extended zzso zzso similar to the human and mouse zzso zzso which may support the export of this zzso into zzso The zzso zzso contained at least 3 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies and sequence analyses indicated that zzso zzso and zzso genes are present in all zzso zzso zzso including a zzso species zzso whereas the zzso gene may have arisen more recently in zzso zzso
