Human zzso zzso factor zzso which promotes the cell survival and differentiation of motor and other zzso is a protein belonging structurally to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was subjected to three-dimensional structure modeling and zzso zzso to analyze its zzso zzso The replacement of zzso with any other zzso acid zzso resulted in zzso of neural cell survival activity, and some of the zzso zzso proteins had zzso to zzso higher biological zzso The D1 cap region zzso the boundary between the CD loop and zzso zzso of zzso including both zzso and zzso was shown to play a key role in the biological activity of zzso as one of the putative zzso zzso In this article, the D1 cap region of the zzso proteins is proposed to be important in zzso recognition and biological activity common to zzso zzso proteins zzso with zzso a component protein of the zzso
