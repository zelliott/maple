A zzso zzso gene was isolated from a rice zzso zzso zzso root zzso library that was prepared from plants grown under zzso zzso The zzso gene expression was induced in rice leaves and roots under several zzso stresses from zzso zzso and zzso drought zzso and metals zzso zzso zzso The results suggested that the zzso gene was expressed in response to environmental zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the final yield of the zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso zzso dry zzso zzso of zzso coli expressing zzso fusion protein to zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and cells dry weight increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 1 zzso culture treated with either zzso zzso or zzso respectively, compared with control after 6 h zzso
