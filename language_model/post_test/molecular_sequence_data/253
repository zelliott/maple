Two bacterial zzso designated zzso and zzso isolated from rat zzso were characterized by using a zzso zzso approach that included analysis of their zzso and zzso features, cellular fatty acid profiles, zzso profiles and zzso based on zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that these strains were members of the family zzso The strains shared 94 % zzso zzso gene sequence similarity with each other and were related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % sequence zzso The strains consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth of the strains was inhibited on medium containing 20 % zzso The two strains produced significant levels of zzso and zzso acids as end products from zzso Although the major cellular fatty acid of these two strains and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso : zzso strains zzso and zzso showed a higher level of zzso : zzso zzso and 74 zzso zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the ratios of zzso : zzso to zzso : zzso in zzso zzso of the two zzso were very much higher than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The major zzso of the zzso was zzso This zzso composition was different from those of other zzso of the family zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso composition is therefore an important zzso characteristic of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso have DNA zzso contents of 46 zzso On the basis of these data, strains zzso and zzso represent two novel species of a novel zzso for which the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, are zzso The type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
