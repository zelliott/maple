Defining the molecular mechanisms that prevent zzso zzso cells from maturing is important because defects in maturation contribute to the development of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso factor for zzso zzso cells in zzso and is required to maintain the zzso state in the zzso cell zzso The mechanisms employed by zzso to block zzso however, are not well zzso zzso cells are zzso zzso cells of zzso origin with high zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso Our laboratory has previously reported that zzso levels decreased as zzso zzso zzso cells underwent terminal zzso in zzso The effect of zzso upon the expression of genes associated with zzso differentiation has been zzso zzso Since zzso maintains high levels of zzso in zzso cells, we tested the hypothesis that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is correlated with premature expression of the primary zzso proteins zzso and zzso proteins not abundant in cells maintained as zzso by zzso zzso with human zzso in these cells suppressed premature zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was also found to accelerate zzso zzso differentiation in zzso cells zzso with zzso Since high expression levels of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso have been correlated with poor outcomes in acute zzso zzso zzso differentiation blockade by zzso may be one mechanism that contributes to zzso zzso
