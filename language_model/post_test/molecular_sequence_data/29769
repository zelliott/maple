We report the identification of a new zzso zzso from zzso zzso at the DNA and protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the protein zzso was identified via zzso zzso The sequence has a coding capacity of 594 zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso extracts showed that zzso generated against the zzso protein zzso a protein of approximately 80 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shares zzso identity with a mouse zzso identified as zzso zzso 5 zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has all structural and functional characteristics of this class of zzso It contains three zzso repeats zzso and a nuclear targeting sequence at its zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso results are compatible with the existence of zzso as a single copy zzso zzso zzso zzso like the native protein enriched from zzso zzso extracts exhibited zzso activity that can be enhanced by both zzso and zzso zzso but not by zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the activity is inhibited by zzso acid zzso with an zzso of 4 zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso to the zzso The function of zzso is presently zzso but like other zzso of many zzso organisms, it may have important regulatory functions in the zzso cell zzso
