zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the two zzso of the common zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolation, characterization and sequencing of zzso clones zzso for the two zzso chains of zzso are zzso A number of clones were isolated from zzso zzso libraries constructed with zzso from an zzso cell line, zzso and human zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells, and zzso zzso from zzso zzso and were selected for detailed zzso The identification of these as authentic zzso clones was based on zzso criteria and confirmed by the presence of zzso sequences in each insert zzso for known protein sequences of zzso zzso These clones contained zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with an overlapping sequence of 801 zzso The zzso sequence of the overlapping region was identical indicating that zzso cells produce a protein closely zzso if not zzso to zzso zzso The determined zzso sequence of two zzso included a coding sequence for zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso stop zzso and 185 zzso of 3' zzso sequence followed by a zzso zzso The coding sequence contained a portion of the heavy chain, the junction between the heavy and light chains and the entire light chain including a potential zzso domain and a short zzso zzso When these zzso were used to probe for zzso zzso a single zzso species of zzso zzso was identified in both zzso cells and human zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence for zzso with those of the alpha zzso of the zzso and the zzso receptors revealed extensive zzso These zzso further establish that zzso from zzso together with the zzso and the zzso zzso are members of a zzso family of zzso receptors with a recognition specificity for zzso zzso acid zzso
