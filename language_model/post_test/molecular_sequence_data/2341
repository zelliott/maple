We zzso cloned a number of BK virus zzso zzso from urine samples collected from a patient with systemic lupus zzso undergoing zzso zzso On the basis of the structure of the zzso regulatory region, cloned viral zzso were classified into a major group and several minor zzso The major group contained a single zzso zzso zzso element and a zzso sequence identified in the zzso of many zzso zzso Most of the minor groups retained a variety of zzso within the zzso control region and the origin of DNA zzso We zzso various cloned viral zzso for the capacity to induce viral growth in zzso human embryonic kidney zzso While major viral zzso induced slow viral zzso a minor viral DNA retaining partial zzso of the zzso element induced rapid viral zzso We concluded that zzso of the zzso element, which is required for efficient growth of zzso in cell culture, is not advantageous for replication of zzso in natural zzso
