The zzso zzso of steroid receptors convey zzso regulation to certain proteins to which they are zzso Here we characterize fusion proteins between a zzso zzso zzso and steroid zzso zzso zzso These proteins convert zzso binding into DNA zzso Thus, zzso binding is directly coupled to an zzso activity that is easily measured by DNA zzso or zzso genetic changes in marker gene zzso as opposed to the multiple events leading to zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso fusion is activated by all tested zzso whether zzso or antagonists, indicating that all induce zzso release from the zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso the distance between zzso and the zzso domain in the fusion zzso by reducing the included length of the zzso zzso D domain, affects zzso zzso A zzso with no D domain shows reduced zzso by zzso and, unexpectedly, complete zzso to induction by all zzso zzso A zzso including some D domain shows a zzso zzso intermediate to those displayed by zzso containing all or none of the D zzso Thus, we observed a zzso interference between zzso and the zzso zzso that differs depending on the distance between the two zzso the zzso induced by zzso or antagonists, and which presents a previously zzso distinction between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
