We report here the identification of a zzso system that, upon engagement, leads to the establishment of an zzso zzso Three closely positioned genes on human zzso 19 zzso distinct but zzso zzso which we designate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso The expression of zzso zzso was zzso by viral infection in several cell zzso We identified a distinct zzso complex that is zzso by all three zzso proteins for signaling and is composed of two zzso a zzso designated zzso (also designated as zzso and a second zzso zzso (also known as zzso Both zzso chains are zzso expressed on a wide variety of human cell lines and zzso and signal through the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This zzso system may contribute to zzso or other defenses by a mechanism similar to, but independent of, type I zzso
