zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso zzso can be packaged and zzso by the proteins of zzso necrosis virus zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso proteins cannot support the replication of an zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso proteins cannot efficiently package zzso zzso zzso The domain in zzso responsible for the specificity of zzso packaging was identified using zzso zzso expression zzso A competitive packaging system was established by generating a cell line that expresses one viral zzso zzso containing the zzso packaging signal zzso and another viral zzso zzso containing the zzso packaging signal zzso The zzso zzso expression zzso were introduced into the cells, and zzso zzso as well as the efficiency of zzso packaging were zzso Our data confirm that zzso is solely responsible for the selection of viral zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso domain in the zzso zzso is responsible for its ability to interact with both zzso E and zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso NC with the zzso NC generated a zzso zzso that could not package zzso zzso but retained its ability to package zzso zzso A construct expressing zzso zzso pol supported the replication of both zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the gag and pol gene products from two different viruses can functionally cooperate to perform one cycle of zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicated that zzso zzso elements are not ideal zzso for zzso pol gene products since infectious viruses were generated at a lower zzso These results indicate that the zzso recognition between zzso and zzso extends beyond the zzso interaction and also includes interactions between Pol and other zzso zzso
