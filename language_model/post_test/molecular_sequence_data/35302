In addition to their well-known zzso properties, zzso have the ability to efficiently zzso across biological zzso through still zzso zzso To date, most zzso studies addressing the mechanisms of zzso have focused on small synthetic peptides rather than full-length zzso zzso In this work, we characterized the zzso properties of chicken zzso 2 zzso zzso in zzso solution and in membrane zzso environments using circular zzso zzso fluorescence, and zzso zzso zzso adopts a zzso zzso bundle fold in zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is critical for zzso is fully buried in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveal that a zzso transition occurs in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso loses its native three-dimensional structure in zzso environments but, zzso zzso zzso secondary structures are zzso zzso interactions could be detected using zzso spin labels, indicating that the three zzso do not adopt extended zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded information about zzso positioning and unveiled the burial of critical aromatic and basic zzso within the zzso Our results suggest that zzso interactions with zzso may be zzso in inducing a zzso change enabling zzso to insert into zzso
