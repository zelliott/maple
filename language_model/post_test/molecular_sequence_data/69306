The intrinsic protein zzso zzso activity of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is necessary for zzso zzso To determine whether cellular protein zzso zzso are zzso for zzso zzso zzso proteins were isolated from zzso cells and zzso for zzso zzso activity using zzso zzso A zzso zzso activity that is distinct from the zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso columns and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso occurred within 1 zzso of cell stimulation with an zzso for zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was zzso by incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso but activity could be restored by incubation with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest a cascade of zzso zzso signaling analogous to well characterized zzso zzso zzso
