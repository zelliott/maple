Recent studies in this laboratory characterized the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso and showed that neither uses the traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rather, zzso uses zzso as preferred sugar donor and zzso uses zzso The zzso characterization of zzso zzso structural zzso and zzso gene analysis have now been employed to identify a zzso within the active site of these zzso that zzso their unique sugar zzso An zzso zzso in the zzso signature sequence of zzso is necessary for zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso favors zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso enhances its ability to zzso zzso and completely zzso its ability to use zzso An analysis of zzso models zzso with zzso donors indicates that zzso in zzso is able to accommodate the zzso group on C2 of zzso so that the zzso carbon atom zzso is zzso situated for zzso involving zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso at position 391 zzso this zzso productive orientation of zzso but allows a more optimal alignment of zzso for sugar zzso zzso sequence analysis reveals that only primates possess zzso sequences containing zzso suggesting that other zzso may not have the capacity to zzso small zzso In support of this hypothesis, zzso zzso forms from two zzso primates were found to use zzso whereas zzso zzso from zzso could not use this sugar zzso This work gives new insight into the zzso that zzso sugar specificity to zzso family members and suggests a zzso innovation in zzso of small zzso
