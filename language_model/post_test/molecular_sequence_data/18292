zzso is a positive zzso of zzso zzso synthesis in the zzso A zzso clone containing the zzso gene from zzso zzso was identified by its ability to restore zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso on a zzso zzso zzso that zzso with an zzso zzso zzso probe and zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso In addition, the cloned zzso zzso zzso gene zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso The zzso region was zzso and one open reading frame of 211 zzso acids was zzso The predicted protein sequence specified by this open reading frame was zzso zzso with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regions in the 3' and zzso ends of the two proteins were zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso of the cloned gene followed by zzso of the zzso into the zzso of zzso strain zzso The synthesis of both zzso and zzso was reduced by more than zzso in this zzso indicating common regulation of the two zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso on immature pear fruit was diminished but not completely zzso
