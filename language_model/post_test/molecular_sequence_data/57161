We have previously described a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from rat liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike a zzso zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso the zzso carries zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso does not zzso with the zzso zzso zzso distinguish between the zzso and another zzso zzso that tends to partially zzso with zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso indicates that it is distinct from previously described zzso and shows no zzso to any other known zzso In contrast, the zzso that partially zzso is similar but not identical to previously described zzso zzso from rat zzso The zzso is also expressed in several zzso cell zzso zzso studies indicate that the two zzso zzso arise from a single precursor of approximately 65 zzso which yields a core zzso of apparent molecular mass approximately 53 zzso upon zzso with zzso zzso zzso The protein quickly becomes partly resistant to zzso H but remains sensitive to zzso zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso processing during passage through the zzso After several hours, the precursor zzso zzso generating the mature zzso protein of approximately 58 zzso with zzso of approximately 38 and approximately 28 zzso A portion of newly zzso zzso is zzso into the medium intact, indicating that the zzso normally takes place after diversion from the zzso zzso These zzso changes and zzso distribution are reminiscent of some zzso acid zzso In fact, zzso studies and zzso zzso shift experiments suggest a zzso zzso for this zzso Additional evidence for this, and the role of the zzso in zzso zzso acid turnover are discussed in the accompanying paper zzso zzso Diaz, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
