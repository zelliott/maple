A zzso clone zzso a human T zzso and natural killer zzso zzso zzso was obtained by screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso library from zzso human peripheral blood zzso with the mouse zzso factor zzso zzso In an zzso zzso analysis, this human zzso factor zzso zzso with a zzso band in zzso zzso T cells and the zzso cell line, but this transcript was not zzso in normal muscle, liver, zzso or zzso By zzso zzso this zzso zzso with zzso from three zzso zzso clones and three zzso zzso clones grown in zzso as well as with zzso zzso natural killer cells and zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso from peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso cluster zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso clone encodes a predicted zzso zzso of 262 zzso zzso The predicted protein has a zzso acid zzso a zzso acid zzso and an active zzso of 234 zzso acids with a calculated zzso molecular weight of zzso The active zzso is zzso and zzso similar to the mouse sequence at the zzso acid and DNA level, zzso The human and mouse sequences conserve the active site zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and all 10 zzso zzso The gene for the human zzso factor zzso zzso is located on human zzso zzso We propose that this zzso zzso zzso may function as a common component necessary for zzso of target cells by zzso T zzso and natural killer zzso
