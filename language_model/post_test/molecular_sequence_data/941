Here we provide evidence for an zzso zzso trafficking of the human La zzso zzso known as transient interaction partner of a variety of zzso Among these, precursor transcripts of certain zzso are located in the zzso or zzso Here we examined which functional zzso of zzso are involved in its nuclear zzso By using green zzso fusion zzso we discovered a zzso zzso signal and demonstrated its functionality in a zzso zzso In addition, we revealed that the zzso motif of zzso is essential both for its zzso binding competence in zzso and in zzso and its exit from the zzso Our data imply that zzso zzso between different zzso zzso which depend decisively on a functional zzso zzso signal as well as on zzso zzso Directed trafficking of zzso is fully consistent with its function in the maturation of precursor zzso located in different zzso zzso
