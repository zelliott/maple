We have developed an in zzso zzso differentiation zzso In this model, differentiated zzso cells assemble zzso and zzso at zzso junctions and zzso and show zzso and functional evidence for tight zzso Using this zzso differentiation model with the differential display zzso zzso chain reaction zzso we identified two independently isolated gene fragments that showed near identity with the reported sequence for a human zzso clone named zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso during zzso differentiation was confirmed by zzso using two other sets of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells from zzso also express zzso zzso as indicated by zzso Mal was originally identified in a zzso zzso library as a human zzso zzso gene and was thought to be zzso zzso Our results identify zzso as a gene also expressed in zzso cells during differentiation and demonstrate the power of zzso for analysis of gene expression under these controlled zzso
