zzso (AP) sites are the most frequently found zzso zzso in DNA, and they arise mainly from spontaneous base loss or modified base removal by zzso DNA zzso zzso sites are zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso gaps in the DNA are repaired by DNA zzso zzso zzso We identified the gene product that is responsible for the zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we detected the physical interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso by a pull-down zzso and a surface zzso resonance zzso Interestingly, the associated zzso zzso activity, but not the zzso zzso activity, of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso experiments using the zzso zzso cell extracts supported the interaction between zzso and zzso in the zzso This is the first report describing the physical and functional interactions between an zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also detected the zzso complex of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This complex probably functions to enhance the repair of zzso DNA in zzso zzso zzso
