Animal zzso have evolved many zzso zzso species are especially common in three of the four main groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which together represent tens of thousands of species of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, despite their great diversity of body plans, there is no zzso evidence that any zzso is zzso We provide the first conclusive evidence that the zzso blind, and zzso zzso crustaceans are zzso and that zzso evolved in all four major zzso zzso We produced a three-dimensional reconstruction of the zzso delivery apparatus of the zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso can inject zzso in a controlled zzso A zzso profile of its zzso zzso shows that they express a unique cocktail of transcripts coding for known zzso zzso including a diversity of zzso and a probable zzso zzso very similar to one described from zzso zzso We screened a zzso library obtained from whole animals and identified a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso that is not expressed in the zzso zzso This allowed us to reconstruct its probable evolutionary origin and zzso the importance of incorporating data derived from zzso zzso tissue to zzso the evolution of candidate zzso zzso This first glimpse into the zzso of a zzso and zzso aquatic zzso reveals conspicuous differences from the zzso of other predatory zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and contributes valuable information for ultimately zzso the many factors shaping the biology and evolution of zzso and zzso zzso
