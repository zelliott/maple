zzso zzso zzso zzso contains six zzso zinc finger zzso and it has been suggested that the zinc finger domain itself may function as a zinc sensor in zzso expression of zzso zzso Previous work has shown that a subset ( approximately zzso of the zinc fingers in zzso play a structural role in folding and zzso zzso element zzso zzso while one or more other fingers have properties consistent with a zzso role zzso zinc binding affinity in the absence of zzso We show here that zinc fingers 5 and 6 zzso to the weak zzso fingers in zzso Limited zzso of a zzso complex gives rise to a highly zzso core zzso corresponding to zzso acids zzso or zzso zinc fingers zzso of zzso zzso of a collection of zzso (His zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso reveals that deletion of zinc fingers 5 and 6 to create zzso zzso zzso binding affinity ( approximately zzso while deletion of fingers 4-6 zzso results in a further zzso reduction of binding affinity with a nearly complete loss of zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso a dramatic zzso of the structure of the zzso from a zzso to a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparatively less zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso has been used to globally define the orientation of the zzso zzso on the zzso These experiments suggest that fingers zzso are oriented on the highly zzso zzso side of the zzso with fingers 5-6 bound at or near the zzso zzso These findings are consistent with a model in which the zzso zinc fingers in zzso are required for high affinity and specific binding to the consensus zzso core in a way which is subjected to structural and zzso zzso by the weak zzso zzso zinc zzso
