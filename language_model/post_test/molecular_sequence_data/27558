Cellular prion zzso zzso carrying the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso or zzso which zzso increased zzso to human zzso zzso zzso are known to form structures that include zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the interactions between zzso zzso and the zzso fragments zzso of the zzso mouse zzso zzso carrying the zzso acid replacements zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed only weak interactions with zzso zzso in zzso solution at pH zzso whereas discrete interaction sites within the zzso segment zzso were identified for all other aforementioned zzso zzso by zzso chemical shift zzso These model studies thus provide evidence that zzso acid zzso within the zzso segment zzso affect the interactions of zzso with zzso structures, which might in turn zzso the zzso function of the protein in health and zzso
