We have cloned a new zzso gene zzso from human and mouse that may represent the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso The zzso of these genes are highly similar to all other zzso zzso zzso and regions of similarity also exist between zzso zzso and a subset of zzso zzso genes downstream of the zzso The sequence divergence between human and mouse zzso in these regions is greater than that predicted from comparisons of other zzso zzso zzso however, and there is little sequence similarity upstream of the zzso both between these two genes and with other zzso zzso We present evidence for alternative zzso of mouse zzso upstream of the zzso that may account for some of this zzso We have mapped human zzso zzso to the zzso end of the zzso cluster at an estimated distance of between 1 and 2 zzso by zzso Both the human and the mouse zzso are shown to be closely linked to zzso in a zzso transcribed zzso These mapping results support the possibility that zzso zzso genes have been duplicated in concert with the zzso zzso
