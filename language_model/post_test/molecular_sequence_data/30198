Using the zzso domain of zzso zzso as a model system, we show that zzso in an zzso region at the extreme zzso zzso of the protein are important for determining its zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso acids are zzso when placed at the 5 zzso zzso positions, whereas charged and polar zzso are zzso The stabilizing effect of a single charged zzso is greatest when it is at the terminal position and diminishes with increasing distance from the zzso zzso The position of zzso sequences with respect to the free zzso zzso is important for their effect, but their distance from the folded portion of the protein is not zzso zzso degradation of proteins with zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in zzso using a partially zzso soluble zzso This degradation is not zzso Moreover, zzso domain zzso with zzso zzso zzso are still rapidly zzso in strains that are deficient in zzso of abnormal zzso These data suggest that the degradation of zzso domain zzso with zzso zzso zzso involves zzso components distinct from those known to be important for the turnover of unfolded proteins in zzso zzso
