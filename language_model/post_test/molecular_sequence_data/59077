A type 2 zzso gene from rice, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated in its zzso form and zzso By northern analyses zzso expression was shown to be induced under stress by zzso zzso heat shock and, to a lesser extent, zzso acid, but not excess metals, including zzso Its response to zzso zzso was transient and different from zzso a type 1 zzso gene of rice zzso by zzso These results suggest that while zzso is also involved in cellular response to stress, its function may be complementary to that of zzso
