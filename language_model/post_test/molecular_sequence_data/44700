The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene has been mapped to human zzso zzso and shown to exhibit no zzso with the zzso dominant disorder of zzso formation, zzso imperfecta type zzso In the current study, sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso clones has indicated that the human gene contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso which predicts a highly zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso sequence with that of the zzso zzso and cow indicated that the predicted protein contains a zzso zzso signal zzso sequence and an zzso cell attachment zzso The gene is zzso by six zzso the zzso phase of which is type 0, the first zzso containing solely zzso untranslated zzso zzso of each of the coding zzso in individuals affected by zzso imperfecta type II failed to reveal any zzso zzso suggesting that zzso in zzso are not zzso of this condition at least in the two families examined in this zzso
