zzso comparisons between zzso zzso and the satellite zzso zzso zzso revealed major differences in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso For example, zzso signaling is part of a negative signaling system that prevents zzso formation in zzso zzso whereas it plays a positive role in zzso zzso We wondered if the genetic control of the second major part of the zzso zzso system, the sex muscles, has zzso similarly between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sex muscles derive from the zzso M, which has an identical lineage in both zzso Here, we describe a large-scale zzso screen for zzso that disrupt the M lineage and the sex zzso zzso zzso We isolated and characterized zzso that result in a failure of proper zzso fate zzso and zzso migration and showed that the corresponding genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have additional defects in the zzso of the zzso precursor cells zzso zzso and experimental studies in the zzso zzso background indicate a complex set of zzso and zzso mechanisms required for zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cause similar zzso Thus, the molecular mechanisms of zzso cell zzso and migration are zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso
