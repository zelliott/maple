The zzso zzso of the alpha and beta zzso of the zzso antenna complex of zzso zzso are zzso zzso In both zzso two charged zzso acids are located close to the zzso and two of them are close to the zzso central zzso To test the hypothesis that charged zzso acids in the zzso have a function for zzso and assembly of zzso zzso charged zzso acids were replaced by zzso acids of opposite zzso The results show that an exchange of zzso acid positions 3 and 6 in alpha zzso or 2 and 5 in beta zzso zzso has little effect under zzso conditions on the formation of zzso but the additional exchange of positions 14 and 15 in alpha zzso zzso and/or 13 and 14 in beta zzso zzso zzso strongly under zzso dark and zzso light conditions the stable incorporation of the zzso into the membrane and the formation of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is able to grow without any zzso
