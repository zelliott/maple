zzso from the zzso zzso promoter zzso at two zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso dependent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All of these elements contain not more than one zzso from the earlier proposed zzso consensus sequence zzso a zzso zzso flanked on either side by two zzso zzso A point zzso analysis of these elements in various combinations was performed and revealed that the central zzso zzso and at least one of the 3' zzso zzso zzso of the zzso consensus sequence are essential but alone not sufficient to define a functional zzso zzso Multiple cryptic zzso start sites, which function independently whether they are located on the coding or the zzso zzso can replace the function of zzso zzso elements and therefore the overall level of zzso initiation is not zzso The sequence specificity is identical for zzso and zzso dependent zzso elements demonstrating that they are functionally zzso These findings imply that the role of zzso elements is to zzso the start zzso of zzso to distinct sites located in the region between the zzso of the assembly of the zzso complex and the start zzso of zzso
