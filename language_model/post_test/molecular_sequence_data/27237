To investigate the correlation between zzso in promoter, zzso and the zzso zzso overproduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso from 4 zzso coli clinical zzso were cloned upstream to the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso reporter zzso zzso strengths were measured by zzso zzso and gene sequencing was done on the cloned zzso promoter and zzso The strength of promoters from zzso zzso were 8- to zzso higher than those from a low-level zzso zzso In one of the zzso zzso the zzso were located at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In another promoter, the zzso were located at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the third promoter, zzso were found at positions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso coli promoter and zzso sequences promoted zzso zzso which may be the primary zzso mechanism for resistance to zzso zzso
