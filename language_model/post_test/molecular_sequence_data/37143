zzso is generated by zzso bacteria as a product of NO zzso In zzso zzso is zzso further by the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein which converts zzso into zzso and zzso The structure of zzso remained unknown until the recent zzso of the structure of the zzso isolated from zzso zzso In the present paper, we report the crystal structure of a blue form of the zzso that was zzso under zzso conditions from zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso stabilized by a multitude of interactions including two calcium sites located at the zzso zzso Each zzso is composed of two zzso a zzso zzso domain that carries the zzso electron entry site known as zzso and an zzso zzso zzso domain which hosts the zzso zzso zzso The electrons are transferred from zzso to zzso across the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso copper cluster in which the four copper zzso zzso to zzso are zzso by seven zzso zzso a zzso or water oxygen and a bridging zzso zzso A bound zzso zzso near the zzso active site shares one of the zzso zzso of zzso This arrangement probably influences the zzso potential of zzso so that this copper is stabilized in the zzso zzso The treatment of zzso with zzso or cyanide causes the disappearance of the optical band at 640 zzso attributed to the zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso soaked with zzso or cyanide suggests that an average of one copper of the zzso cluster has been zzso The lowest occupancy is observed for zzso and zzso A zzso experiment suggests that zzso binds between zzso and zzso so that the oxygen of zzso replaces the oxygen zzso of zzso Certain zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as well as of zzso are located at the zzso zzso Particularly those of zzso and zzso are parts of a bonding network which couples these zzso to the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This structure may provide an efficient electron transfer path for reduction of the bound zzso
