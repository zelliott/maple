zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is a highly regulated zzso zzso adjust levels of zzso zzso within the plasma membrane at multiple stages of the zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso fold and are largely retained in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit greatly reduced rates of zzso acid zzso due to lower levels of zzso in their plasma zzso To further our understanding of mechanisms affecting zzso zzso we identified zzso and zzso as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso levels, whereas the genetic zzso of these genes reduces zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of any of these zzso genes exerts a positive effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso primarily zzso to structures associated with the zzso however, zzso also zzso to zzso zzso Our findings are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso and presumably zzso function within the zzso trafficking pathway, where they affect events that determine whether plasma membrane proteins are zzso or routed to the plasma zzso
