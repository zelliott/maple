zzso zzso regulates the zzso abundance of proteins and controls cellular zzso by abrupt elimination of key zzso zzso A zzso system targets proteins for destruction through the zzso attachment of a zzso zzso The specificity and timing of protein zzso is controlled by zzso zzso such as the zzso box protein zzso zzso are major components of zzso complexes, and have been implicated in degradation of key regulatory molecules including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe the genetic identification and molecular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function has zzso effects during development, including defects in external sensory organ development, pattern formation and cell growth and zzso Loss or zzso of zzso causes an increase or decrease, respectively, in external sensory organ formation, implicating zzso function in regulating the commitment of cells to the neural zzso We also find that zzso function zzso zzso zzso by regulating the stability of full-length zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso function in eye discs but not other zzso discs promotes zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a zzso zzso of zzso in wing, zzso and leg, but not eye, zzso discs suggesting zzso regulation of zzso zzso The diverse nature of zzso zzso highlights the importance of targeted zzso during zzso zzso
