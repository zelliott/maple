Two novel biologically active zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a solitary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a small amount of the crude zzso gave two intensive zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso that were expected to be novel based on a zzso database zzso zzso of the crude zzso by zzso gave two zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined by zzso automated zzso degradation, and zzso acid zzso According to the high sequence zzso with those of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were labeled zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the first example of a zzso analog isolated from the zzso of a solitary zzso The zzso activities of these new peptides were more potent than that of zzso
