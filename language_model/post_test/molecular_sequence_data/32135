The diversity of zzso bacteria zzso inhabiting the extreme zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso of the northern arm of Great Salt Lake was studied by zzso zzso and zzso identification approaches involving zzso retrieval of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the latter zzso major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The majority zzso of zzso sequences retrieved directly from the zzso formed a lineage of high zzso diversity affiliated with the zzso zzso while others represented novel lineages within the families zzso and zzso or among zzso zzso Using the same zzso zzso enrichment cultures were established in parallel at 100 and at 190 g zzso zzso using different electron zzso After 5-6 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso profiling of these enrichment cultures recovered a zzso community composition zzso with the zzso profiling of the zzso zzso culture representatives of the zzso zzso lineage and of one of the zzso lineages were successfully zzso The growth performance of these zzso and of the enrichment cultures suggests that the zzso zzso community of the northern arm of Great Salt Lake consists of moderate zzso which are zzso at the in zzso zzso of zzso
