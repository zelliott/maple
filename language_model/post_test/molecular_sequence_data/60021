zzso a new zzso protein zzso extracted from zzso zzso pout is a single zzso divided into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso each of which has a high sequence identity with Type III zzso A zzso zzso zzso connects these two zzso in tandem and is thought to play a significant role in defining the nature of the intact zzso The present paper shows for the first time the solution structure and preliminary zzso backbone dynamics data of the zzso plus the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by employing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Forty zzso structures of zzso were successfully calculated by using a total of zzso zzso structural zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso has a zzso form zzso six zzso three type III turns, and several zzso which stabilize a flat, zzso site formed on one side of this zzso Further, the zzso portion appears to have a definitive structure, which is independent of the zzso zzso This definitive zzso is roughly divided into two short zzso zzso and zzso which are bent around zzso at an angle of approximately 60 zzso This zzso motif of the zzso may function to orient the two zzso sites of the zzso and zzso of zzso in the same direction, leading to their simultaneous interactions with the ice crystal zzso
