During zzso zzso zzso cell movements depend on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells from the zzso roof use zzso zzso to assemble a zzso zzso zzso on which zzso cells migrate using the same zzso zzso In this report, we show that the zzso zzso zzso can prevent zzso zzso formation when zzso in zzso cells resulting in delayed zzso In addition, isolated zzso cells zzso zzso are able to spread on zzso using the zzso zzso in the absence of zzso induction and before the onset of zzso We further show that while the zzso of zzso depends on the zzso activity of zzso induction of cell spreading does zzso Finally, while cell spreading is usually associated with cell migration, zzso promotes zzso cell spreading on zzso but also reduces cell migration in response to zzso suggesting an adverse effect on cell zzso We propose that zzso zzso adversely affect cell migration by preventing zzso of cells from the zzso
