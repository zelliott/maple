Unlike most other bacteria, zzso make fatty acids with the zzso zzso zzso fatty acid zzso I zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that the tuberculosis drug zzso and zzso target zzso zzso zzso studies have revealed that in addition to zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso fatty acid, while the zzso zzso zzso makes zzso fatty zzso In order to express zzso tuberculosis zzso in a rapidly growing zzso and to characterize the zzso tuberculosis zzso in zzso we constructed an zzso zzso zzso strain which contained the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso strain grew more slowly than the parental zzso zzso strain and was more susceptible to zzso Surprisingly, while the zzso zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso strain produced zzso it predominantly produced zzso These results suggest that the fatty acid zzso that produces zzso or zzso in zzso is due to a complex interaction among zzso zzso and zzso and possibly other systems and is not solely due to zzso zzso as previously suggested by in zzso zzso
