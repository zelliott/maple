zzso exchange may occur at zzso groups zzso by zzso The reaction, however, takes at least several days at room zzso The long-time exchanging reaction often prevents its application from protein zzso In this study, an zzso method utilizing zzso acid zzso was zzso After being dissolved in zzso zzso water containing zzso zzso acid, protein samples were exposed to zzso zzso zzso analysis of the resulted zzso zzso indicated that oxygen in the zzso groups from zzso acid, zzso acid, and the zzso zzso could be efficiently exchanged with zzso within less than 15 zzso The rate of back exchange was so slow that no zzso back exchange could be found during the zzso zzso
