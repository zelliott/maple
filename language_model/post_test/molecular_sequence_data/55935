More than 1 zzso of the zzso DNA of the human zzso zzso gene and of the zzso protein zzso gene have been zzso zzso features are the absence of a zzso and the presence of zzso elements in both upstream regions, the presence of several sequences with zzso to known regulatory elements zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and a high G + zzso and several putative zzso sites in the zzso zzso 1 zzso of the zzso upstream region was driving high-level growth hormone zzso reporter gene expression in human zzso and monkey zzso zzso zzso activity dropped to about zzso and zzso when only 252 zzso and 114 zzso respectively, of the zzso sequence were zzso In contrast to the zzso promoter, the zzso gene upstream region was driving zzso expression only in human zzso but not in monkey zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid to the zzso cells had minimal effects on both zzso leading to a zzso decrease of zzso The results show that the human zzso gene contains a strong and zzso active promoter, whereas the promoter of the zzso zzso gene appears to be regulated in a zzso zzso
