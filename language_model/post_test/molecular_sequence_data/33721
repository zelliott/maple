zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso polarized membrane zzso expressed in zzso distinct from those expressing other zzso Here, we determined the zzso structure of zzso zzso from adult rat brain and compared it with that of other zzso zzso were released by zzso F zzso and labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by high performance liquid zzso zzso and mass zzso The zzso obtained from rat brain zzso consisted of approximately zzso neutral, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared with the zzso structures of human zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso cells, or mouse myeloma cells and zzso isolated from human zzso rat brain zzso had less highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and Lewis X were more commonly found in rat brain zzso than in human zzso expressed in zzso cells, zzso cells, or mouse myeloma cells and zzso isolated from human zzso In addition, zzso zzso contained zzso zzso on the zzso terminal zzso Our data will be important for the zzso of the roles of the zzso expressed in neural cells, including those present on zzso
