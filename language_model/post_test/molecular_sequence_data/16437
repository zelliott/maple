We investigate whether the fourth zzso loop zzso of D1 and zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Using zzso receptors zzso and zzso we show that swapping of zzso leads to a switch in zzso affinity and zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso potency was reduced for both zzso in comparison with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso was drastically increased in cells expressing zzso when compared with those harboring zzso or zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso properties to highly zzso zzso zzso
