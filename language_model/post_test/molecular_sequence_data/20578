We evaluated the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso coding region of the pol gene for the presence of natural zzso in patients during early infection zzso and with zzso drug-resistant zzso zzso We analyzed selected zzso viruses containing zzso zzso zzso for zzso to a panel of strand transfer zzso zzso zzso A zzso sequence analysis of the zzso coding region was performed for 112 patients identified during acute or early infection and 15 patients with zzso zzso A zzso analysis was done on 10 zzso viruses derived from nine patients against a panel of six diverse zzso Few of the zzso associated with in zzso zzso resistance were identified in the samples from newly infected individuals or those patients with zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was the most common, seen in 63 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was the only naturally occurring zzso thought to contribute to resistance to zzso zzso and zzso None of the zzso viruses demonstrated any significant decrease in zzso to the drugs zzso In zzso the zzso coding region contains as much natural variation as that seen in zzso but zzso associated with high-level resistance to existing zzso are rarely, if ever, present in zzso zzso patients, especially those being used zzso Most of the highly prevalent zzso have little effect on zzso zzso in the absence of specific primary zzso zzso testing for zzso zzso in zzso patients is not currently zzso
