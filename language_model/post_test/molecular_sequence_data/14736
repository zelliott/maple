The zzso zzso zzso a small group of insects, are known as severe zzso on various zzso of the northern zzso Despite of this, little is known about their zzso zzso which are generally important for the biology and ecology of plant zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso species complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso identified based on their zzso and zzso zzso Each of these insect groups zzso two zzso different zzso zzso belonging to the zzso and the zzso respectively, as zzso from zzso analyses of zzso zzso gene sequences and demonstrated by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso of all three zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso share a common zzso and show a zzso zzso with that of their respective zzso Similarly, there is evidence for zzso between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is different from that of the other two zzso but shows a moderate relationship to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso All zzso were present in all zzso populations and life stages zzso suggesting vertical transmission from mother to zzso In sharp contrast to their sister group, the zzso zzso do not consistently contain a single zzso zzso zzso but have acquired zzso different bacterial zzso during their evolution, which included multiple infections and zzso zzso
