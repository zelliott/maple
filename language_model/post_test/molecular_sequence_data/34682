Knowing the entire sequence of the gene zzso the DNA zzso zzso A zzso of zzso zzso could be very useful for confirming the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso for the amplification of zzso were designed from consensus zzso sequences of zzso from 9 different zzso bacteria, including zzso zzso With these zzso DNA segments of the predicted size were amplified from the zzso DNA of zzso zzso and then the zzso sequences were determined by cassette zzso zzso chain zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was highly zzso to those of other bacterial species, in both the whole zzso frame and the zzso region zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso preceded by a putative promoter, zzso binding site and zzso repeated sequences for zzso structures of zzso However, the zzso sequence of the zzso region did not show any zzso with those of other bacterial DNA zzso zzso B genes zzso and suggested the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso All of the 12 zzso zzso examined have an zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that, in zzso zzso resistance to zzso is primarily related to zzso in zzso Transformation with the full sequence of zzso zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to complement the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso coli zzso strain and to induce increased resistance to zzso antibiotics at 42 degrees zzso
