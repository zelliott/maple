The zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated to explore the zzso binding mode of zzso zzso receptors zzso By zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso in the upper zzso zzso 6 zzso of the zzso as the first position that directly interacts with zzso 19 of the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso of zzso led to zzso which turned out to be a zzso active zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso at the top of zzso zzso 6 mimics zzso by interacting with additional binding partners in the zzso Next, we generated an initial comparative model of this zzso because no zzso zzso was required, and we selected the next set of zzso zzso to find the engaged partners of the binding zzso In an zzso process, we identified two zzso zzso and two zzso zzso that form the zzso zzso binding zzso As all zzso are localized on top or in the upper part of the zzso zzso we clearly can show that the zzso surface of the zzso is sufficient for full signal zzso for zzso zzso rather than a deep, zzso binding zzso This contributes to the knowledge of the binding of zzso zzso to zzso and might facilitate the development of zzso zzso but it also provides new targeting of zzso involved in zzso zzso
