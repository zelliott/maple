The soybean zzso has significantly impacted soybean production in the zzso zzso analyses were conducted for further insight into leads for potential novel management zzso 

zzso data were generated from whole zzso and from 2,000 zzso guts using an zzso zzso zzso The sequence data were assembled de zzso using the Velvet zzso In addition to providing a general zzso we demonstrate zzso the use of the zzso method for de zzso assembly of short read zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso for increased transcript zzso From 400,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hits were zzso zzso analysis of species zzso of top zzso zzso zzso of zzso hits zzso zzso of zzso were to the pea zzso or other zzso species, representing about half of the pea zzso zzso zzso comparison of relative depth of sequence coverage to relative transcript abundance for genes with high zzso zzso zzso N) or low transcript zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso of the genes from zzso zzso were zzso zzso identification of zzso and zzso as potential secondary zzso zzso alignment of full length sequences from zzso data for the putative zzso zzso protein zzso the zzso of which has potential for zzso management, and the putative zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso N and alkaline zzso 

THIS STUDY zzso THE MOST zzso DATA zzso TO DATE FOR zzso zzso zzso zzso This work also illustrates the utility of zzso zzso sequencing and the zzso method followed by zzso zzso for rapid identification of target genes for organisms for which reference zzso sequences are not available, and extends the utility to include the zzso of zzso
