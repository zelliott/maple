zzso inflammation in zzso is strictly dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso to egg zzso but its intensity is genetically zzso zzso and zzso zzso are strains of mice that develop large zzso they also strongly respond to the major egg zzso zzso We now show that the zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso cells from infected zzso mice is confined to zzso zzso zzso zzso which elicits an zzso zzso zzso Using a panel of zzso zzso we identified zzso as the main contact zzso with zzso On the other hand, three zzso contact zzso were essential to stimulate zzso T cell zzso for two zzso these were zzso zzso and zzso and for one, zzso zzso and zzso In one instance, zzso substitution for zzso generated an zzso that blocked subsequent stimulation with zzso zzso Most importantly, replacement of zzso zzso or zzso caused a profound loss of zzso zzso T cell zzso from zzso zzso This study identifies the critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso involved in the T cell response against the zzso egg zzso and suggests that suitable altered peptides may be capable of zzso its zzso
