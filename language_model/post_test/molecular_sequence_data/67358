zzso zzso is a large, zzso zzso isolated in 1983 from zzso zzso coli strains that carry a zzso acid zzso Here we report the zzso organization of zzso the zzso zzso reconstruction of its zzso and the zzso of its host zzso The zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence containing 248 potential open reading frames and 11 putative zzso zzso zzso were found for 130 of the predicted zzso Most of the zzso proteins showed significant sequence similarities to proteins of zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso is a new member of the novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso host specificity showed that the host range is not limited to zzso zzso zzso coli but includes most laboratory strains of zzso coli and many zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of four different types of tail fibers and/or zzso which enable the zzso to use attachment sites on zzso and zzso zzso With this report, we provide the first detailed description of a zzso zzso zzso armed with a host cell zzso apparatus resembling a zzso Swiss army zzso The zzso structure, and, in particular, the organization of the zzso of zzso demonstrate how a zzso can evolve into a zzso zzso
