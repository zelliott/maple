For the purpose of investigating the evolutionary relationships among strains of the human zzso zzso zzso we have determined the zzso zzso in 16 zzso zzso stocks, of a DNA zzso having approximately zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses show the presence of at least three major groups of zzso zzso zzso a result that contradicts previous zzso zzso based on zzso zzso We also performed an analysis of the relative extent of zzso divergence among zzso zzso strains compared to the divergence between zzso species, using the gene zzso zzso zzso The results presented in this work show that the divergence among the most distant zzso zzso strains is at least as high as the divergence between two different species complexes of zzso those containing zzso major and zzso zzso
