Recently, human and zzso zzso of zzso repair genes zzso and zzso have been identified and proposed to play roles in DNA zzso break zzso zzso In this study, cell zzso expression of human and zzso zzso and zzso proteins was monitored using two zzso First, flow zzso zzso of DNA content and zzso were used to determine the zzso levels of zzso and zzso protein expression in zzso and control zzso The expression of both proteins was lowest in zzso increased in S and reached a maximum in zzso No difference was found in the zzso level of zzso or zzso protein expression between zzso and control cell zzso Second, cell zzso protein expression was confirmed by Western analysis of populations synchronized in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso a zzso equivalent of zzso indicates that the protein level increases of zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso do not require zzso
