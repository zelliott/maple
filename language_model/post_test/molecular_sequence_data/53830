In the first section, the general three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain zzso of nuclear receptors zzso was briefly described on the basis of their zzso crystal zzso zzso was placed on the three major zzso of zzso and their role in the zzso zzso In the second part, the zzso relationship of vitamin D was analyzed based on the zzso structure, in particular by using systematic zzso analysis as a zzso On the basis of the zzso analysis of the vitamin D side chain and studies using zzso restricted synthetic vitamin D zzso we suggested the active space region concept of vitamin zzso The vitamin D zzso region was grouped into five regions zzso G, zzso zzso and zzso zzso orders, in terms of the spatial region, found by these studies are as zzso zzso for vitamin D zzso zzso zzso zzso for vitamin D binding protein zzso zzso zzso Target gene zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso Bone calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso In the third section, zzso modeling of zzso and zzso of the natural zzso zzso into the zzso binding cavity of the model are zzso zzso acid zzso forming hydrogen bonds with the biologically important zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso forms a zzso hydrogen bond with zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso This zzso zzso model was firmly substantiated by zzso zzso Using this zzso model, the zzso relationship of highly potent vitamin D zzso was zzso
