zzso zzso is a potent agent that zzso a wide range of biological zzso The action of zzso is zzso by surface zzso receptors zzso Two types of zzso receptors have been identified in zzso In this study we examined activity of zzso alpha in two zzso zzso lines that express different types of zzso zzso The T zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso expresses type I zzso that mediates zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso was previously shown to express type II zzso and responds to zzso alpha by expressing zzso zzso light chain zzso and increased levels of surface zzso We found that zzso alpha was as potent in inducing zzso expression in zzso cells as it was in inducing zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso alpha concentration sufficient to trigger zzso light chain gene expression in zzso cells was similar to the concentration of zzso alpha sufficient to trigger zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso In both cell lines, zzso alpha activated zzso zzso zzso activity but in zzso zzso zzso cells the zzso alpha concentration sufficient to induce zzso B response was zzso lower than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the type I zzso blocked zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso action in zzso cells, even though these cells predominantly express type II zzso zzso of the total zzso binding sites in zzso cells were recognized by zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso which binds to the natural zzso type I but not the type II zzso blocked zzso alpha responses in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although at low levels, Northern zzso analysis confirmed that zzso cells express low levels of type I zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that type I zzso are expressed and zzso zzso signals in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
