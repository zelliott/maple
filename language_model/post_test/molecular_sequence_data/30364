zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are normally expressed only during zzso It is possible to produce crystal protein during zzso growth by placing zzso zzso crystal protein genes downstream of a strong zzso zzso By removing a possible zzso zzso of the zzso resistance gene of zzso and inserting a multiple cloning site, zzso genes can be cloned downstream from the zzso resistance gene zzso This construct allows for zzso zzso from the strong zzso zzso Crystal protein is then produced during zzso growth as well as during zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso This construct also allows for production of zzso in zzso zzso strains that do not normally produce zzso because of a zzso in zzso
