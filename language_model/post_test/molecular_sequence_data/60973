To further understand how membrane proteins are sorted in the zzso system, we devised a strategy that involves the expression of a zzso zzso zzso in transgenic zzso The construct consisted of a signal zzso followed by the coding region of zzso zzso and the zzso domain and zzso tail of zzso The substitution of a zzso near the C zzso of zzso with a zzso acid zzso ensured progression through the zzso system rather than retention in or return to the zzso zzso In the transformed plants, zzso activity and a zzso zzso protein were found in the zzso This zzso zzso had zzso complex zzso indicating that transport to the zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso fraction contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso but was devoid of zzso zzso Our results indicate that this zzso protein proceeds in the zzso system beyond the point where soluble proteins are sorted for zzso and is detached from its membrane anchor either just before or just after delivery to the zzso
