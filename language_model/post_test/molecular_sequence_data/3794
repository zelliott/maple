We have recently described three group I zzso inserted into a single zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and suggested the presence of at least two additional zzso zzso in this zzso zzso Here we report that two previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso interrupt the zzso gene coding for the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso of zzso isolated from zzso zzso after zzso infection indicates that the zzso are removed from the primary transcript in zzso Both zzso zzso show sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting either a common origin of these zzso or zzso of zzso structural zzso zzso 2 encodes a DNA zzso zzso with similarity to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nicks only one strand of its DNA recognition zzso However, whereas zzso and zzso cleave the template strand in zzso 2, zzso zzso the coding strand in zzso zzso In each case, the 3' OH created on the cut strand is positioned to prime DNA synthesis towards the zzso suggesting that this reaction contributes to the mechanism of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso are inserted in highly zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso next to zzso for functionally important zzso
