The activity of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is increased by zzso of the protein zzso C zzso during zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso identified two zzso beta zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso acted in isolation as a zzso zzso zzso Both beta zzso and beta zzso which contain a consensus zzso site, were shown to bind directly to the product of the zzso zzso Both regions also bound a second factor, zzso zzso zzso of the beta zzso zzso site abolished the zzso of the beta zzso zzso beta zzso and beta zzso zzso site zzso also profoundly affected activity and zzso of the zzso In contrast, zzso activity but not its zzso was affected by zzso of the beta zzso zzso factor zzso zzso studies showed that zzso specifically zzso activity of the zzso beta zzso element and the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso These data show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso responds to protein zzso zzso zzso signals via a functional domain, composed of two zzso which contains binding sites for zzso zzso factors and which is zzso regulated by zzso
