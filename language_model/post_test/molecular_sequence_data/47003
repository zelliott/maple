zzso genes zzso a family of highly zzso zzso zzso zzso These proteins play key roles in regulating a number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in eye defects in flies, mice, and humans, and zzso expression of this gene can trigger the development of zzso compound eyes in zzso Likewise, zzso of other zzso genes in zzso results in the failure of specific differentiation zzso causes skeletal zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso or zzso neural crest zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tooth zzso Although this class of genes is obviously required for the normal differentiation of a number of distinct organ systems, they have not previously been demonstrated to be capable of directing the embryonic development of zzso in zzso In this report, it is demonstrated that zzso plays such a role in the establishment of the zzso embryonic zzso the zzso However, in order to efficiently direct cells to form zzso zzso zzso requires zzso one of which may be the zzso zzso factor zzso These two genes are initially expressed in overlapping zzso in late zzso and cells expressing both genes will go on to form the zzso zzso expression of either gene alone has a moderate effect on zzso zzso while zzso of zzso plus zzso results in the development of embryonic zzso of up to five times normal complexity and also leads to the development of zzso zzso zzso This effect was synergistic rather than zzso zzso can also zzso with zzso but the expression profile of this gene indicates that it normally functions later in zzso development than does zzso Together these data indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso is a key early step in the establishment of the zzso zzso
