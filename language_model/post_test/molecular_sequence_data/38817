Large zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso By zzso zzso of zzso zzso lethal toxin and zzso zzso toxin B fragments, we identified zzso 102, which is located in a zzso region within the zzso domain of all zzso zzso to be crucial for zzso zzso Exchange of zzso with zzso decreased the zzso activity by about zzso and blocked zzso activity after zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso caused a zzso reduction in zzso activity, indicating a partial compensation of the zzso function by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso activity was caused predominantly by an increase in the zzso for zzso of these zzso The data indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the binding of the zzso zzso by large zzso zzso Data bank searches revealed different groups of proteins sharing the recently identified zzso motif zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Munro, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso region defined by a zzso zzso equivalent to zzso of zzso zzso lethal zzso From our findings, we propose a novel family of zzso which includes both zzso and zzso zzso
