The function of the zzso zzso pandemic zzso zzso in zzso zzso has remained zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso sequencing to map the zzso of the master zzso regulator zzso we identify a zzso zzso small zzso that reduces the expression of a previously zzso zzso zzso factor termed zzso zzso zzso the expression of several zzso genes including one that encodes a novel class of zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso a previously zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is required for efficient zzso colonization and zzso zzso zzso a zzso previously associated with zzso This zzso couples the actions of previously disparate zzso islands, defines zzso as a zzso island in zzso and implicates its occurrence in zzso pandemic strains as a benefit for host zzso the production of a regulatory zzso zzso
