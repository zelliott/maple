The zzso for the 33 zzso protein from the zzso complex of spinach together with the coding region for the zzso zzso part of the transit sequence was cloned into the expression zzso zzso The 33 zzso protein precursor was expressed in zzso coli, zzso into the zzso and correctly processed to the mature 33 zzso zzso Thus the zzso domain of the transit zzso preceded by a zzso and two zzso zzso can function as a bacterial signal zzso The zzso proteins were released from the cells by zzso shock and the expressed protein was zzso by zzso exchange zzso The protein was identified by zzso and Western zzso zzso sequence analysis showed that the zzso of the signal zzso occurred at the correct zzso The expressed protein could be rebound to zzso zzso particles and oxygen evolution was restored in equal amounts by the 33 zzso protein from both zzso coli and zzso
