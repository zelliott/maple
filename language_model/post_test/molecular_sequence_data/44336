The activity of zzso zzso or zzso is essential for zzso Multiple zzso participate in zzso in zzso cells but how many zzso are involved and what is their relative contribution to cell death is poorly zzso To identify zzso activated in zzso cells, we developed an approach to simultaneously detect multiple active zzso Using tumor cells as a model, we have found that zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso 6) are the major active zzso in zzso cells, and are activated in response to distinct zzso stimuli and in all cell lines zzso Both zzso and zzso are present in zzso cells as multiple active zzso In a given cell line these species remained the same irrespective of the zzso stimulus zzso However, the species of zzso and zzso detected varied between cell lines, indicating differences in zzso zzso The strategy described here is widely zzso to identify active zzso involved in zzso
