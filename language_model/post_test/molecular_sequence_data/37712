zzso relationships among the five groups of extant seed plants are presently quite zzso For example, zzso studies consistently identify the zzso as the extant sister group to zzso (the so-called zzso zzso whereas a number of molecular studies recover zzso zzso and few agree with the zzso placement of zzso To better resolve these and other zzso issues, we have generated a new molecular data set of zzso small zzso zzso zzso and have analyzed these data together with comparable data sets for the nuclear small zzso zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso All nuclear analyses strongly ally zzso with a zzso zzso whereas all zzso analyses and those zzso analyses that take into account zzso of zzso position transitions actually place zzso within zzso as the sister group to the zzso Combined analyses of all three genes strongly support this latter relationship, which to our knowledge has never been suggested zzso The combined analyses also strongly support zzso of extant zzso with zzso identified as the zzso group of zzso zzso as the next zzso and all zzso except for zzso as sister to the zzso + zzso zzso According to these findings, the zzso may be viewed as extremely divergent zzso and the many zzso similarities between zzso and zzso zzso double zzso and zzso zzso zzso arose zzso
