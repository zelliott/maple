zzso against zzso major wheat germ zzso zzso were used to select from a zzso zzso zzso expression library a clone coding for a zzso major zzso The partial DNA sequence indicated the presence of a mosaic of repetitive zzso Southern zzso zzso on zzso DNA using the cloned gene as a probe at high stringency suggested a single zzso which was zzso to zzso band zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso major zzso detected a major transcript of zzso zzso and a minor zzso zzso zzso zzso on the fusion protein identified a complex of two zzso zzso zzso of approximately 96 zzso and 92 zzso in zzso major zzso and zzso They also zzso zzso in other zzso species, in zzso zzso and very zzso in zzso The apparent molecular weight of these zzso while zzso within each species, varied between zzso A zzso map of the two zzso from zzso major generated an identical pattern suggesting a close zzso at the protein zzso This protein complex was not zzso by zzso and was not affected by zzso but treatment with zzso hydrogen zzso suggested that it is zzso The zzso zzso appears to be zzso and zzso zzso was capable of adding zzso to zzso This was susceptible to beta elimination and zzso zzso Taken together, the data indicates that zzso belongs to the newly described class of zzso and nuclear zzso containing zzso zzso
