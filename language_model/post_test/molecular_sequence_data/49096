Natural killer T zzso cells play an important role in controlling zzso infectious diseases and zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso is a useful zzso model for many human diseases such as infectious and zzso diseases, little is known about their zzso zzso We analyzed V alpha zzso T cells from zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso zzso possess V alpha zzso T cells, suggesting that recognition of zzso is highly zzso between zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso junction for the V alpha zzso of zzso zzso and human zzso cells are highly zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of both species are highly zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso is a useful zzso model for understanding the contribution of zzso cells to the control of human zzso
