zzso clusters are prosthetic groups composed of sulfur and iron that are found in respiratory chain complexes and numerous zzso zzso clusters are zzso in a zzso process that zzso zzso zzso scaffold zzso zzso and iron zzso Assembly of zzso clusters occurs in the zzso zzso of zzso cells, but zzso zzso of three major zzso zzso cluster zzso assembly components have been found, raising the possibility that de zzso zzso cluster zzso also occurs in zzso The human zzso zzso zzso has two zzso one of which targets to the zzso whereas the other less abundant form is zzso and zzso The zzso frame of zzso zzso zzso begins at the second zzso of the transcript and lacks zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso experiments have suggested that the human zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be zzso To evaluate function of zzso we zzso the human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and showed that the zzso form of zzso is an active zzso zzso that zzso binds zzso acquired from zzso of zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso as efficiently as bacterial zzso and formed a complex in zzso with zzso zzso human zzso When incubated with iron regulatory protein 1, zzso and iron, the zzso forms of zzso and zzso facilitated efficient formation of a zzso cluster on zzso Thus, the zzso form of zzso is a functional zzso zzso that can collaborate with zzso zzso to promote de zzso zzso cluster zzso
