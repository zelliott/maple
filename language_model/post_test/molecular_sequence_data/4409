An zzso coli clone was detected in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library capable of degrading soluble zzso zzso zzso of its zzso zzso indicated that the zzso responsible for zzso degradation was localized on a zzso zzso zzso zzso This region was zzso in its entirety and shown to zzso a large zzso capable of zzso a protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequence showed only weak similarity with known zzso significant sequences identity was apparent with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso potato zzso and zzso coli zzso The zzso gene zzso zzso was followed by a second zzso which, through its zzso to the equivalent zzso of zzso coli and zzso pneumoniae, was deduced to zzso zzso zzso zzso The translation stop zzso of zzso overlapped the translation start zzso of the putative zzso zzso suggesting that the two genes may be both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reaction in which single or multiple zzso units from zzso are transferred to the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso could act as zzso whereas of the three only zzso could act as zzso The zzso therefore shares properties with the zzso coli zzso zzso but differs significantly from the zzso of zzso zzso which is unable to use zzso as donor or zzso as zzso Physiologically, the concerted action of zzso and zzso zzso provides zzso zzso with a mechanism of utilizing zzso with little drain on cellular zzso zzso
