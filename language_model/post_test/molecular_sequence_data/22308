A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported to convey zzso degradation when fused to proteins expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso or when fused to green fluorescent protein zzso and expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) Science zzso zzso We find that expression of the zzso in zzso zzso muscle or zzso results in the formation of stable zzso zzso Similar zzso deposition of zzso was also observed upon zzso of primary rat zzso zzso or mouse zzso zzso The zzso of this observation was supported by zzso of zzso zzso cells with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso is less soluble than unmodified zzso and zzso the small zzso protein zzso which zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso muscle leads to rapid paralysis, demonstrating the in zzso toxicity of this zzso zzso This paralysis is suppressed by zzso of zzso which dramatically alters the zzso distribution of zzso Our results suggest that in zzso zzso and perhaps in zzso cells, the zzso zzso is not a specific zzso signal but acts instead by altering zzso secondary or zzso structure, resulting in an zzso form recognized by the zzso zzso This altered form of zzso can form toxic zzso if its expression level exceeds the capacity of zzso degradation zzso zzso may serve as an zzso zzso zzso control protein for studies of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
