zzso occurring peptides and proteins consist almost exclusively of linear or zzso zzso zzso Our group explores the chemical space of peptides by redesigning their zzso through the introduction of branching points in the zzso zzso zzso peptides are generally resistant to zzso and display remarkable biological properties by zzso effects zzso zzso and zzso rigidity zzso zzso We review our recent progress in zzso zzso as zzso models, zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso agents, and in the synthesis and characterization of zzso peptides as new scaffolds for drug zzso
