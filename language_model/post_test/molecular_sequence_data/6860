zzso infection with a zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso encephalitis in resistant strains of zzso In the present study we have examined transcripts of various zzso during acute and chronic stages of zzso zzso zzso In the brain of infected animals, zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were induced to a significant extent, but only low levels of zzso zzso were zzso A similar zzso profile was observed in the zzso However, in contrast to the brain, the increase of zzso zzso was particularly pronounced in the zzso whereas the opposite was found for zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso involved in zzso proliferation were more prevalent in the zzso but in the brain, where zzso actively zzso the zzso molecules zzso and zzso were zzso zzso In addition, a detailed analysis of zzso zzso levels in major zzso complex zzso strains of zzso and B10 mice revealed that the genetically regulated zzso to zzso was correlated with the amount of zzso produced zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso Mice with a strong increase of these zzso zzso were significantly better protected against zzso This indicates that the outcome of zzso may be critically dependent on an adequately regulated zzso immune zzso
