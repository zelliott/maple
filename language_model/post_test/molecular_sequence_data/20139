The zzso hormone zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso factor and plays a central role in regulating zzso zzso Previous studies with zzso cells have suggested that zzso is involved in zzso zzso through zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and examined its expression in relation to zzso zzso of zzso in A6 cells, a zzso zzso cell line, resulted in the decrease of zzso status of zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicating that the protein of cloned zzso was functionally zzso The expression of zzso at zzso levels was zzso in the body skin and the zzso during natural and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells at the zzso stage were identified as the zzso zzso At the zzso climax stage the zzso cells of adult zzso zzso cells also expressed zzso whereas those of the adult zzso zzso cells did zzso We propose that zzso zzso in the regulation of metamorphosis through zzso or another zzso zzso zzso zzso
