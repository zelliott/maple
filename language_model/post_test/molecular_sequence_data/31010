The zzso acceptable structures of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistent with zzso data including zzso constants, temperature zzso of chemical shifts for zzso zzso and zzso values have been found by use of energy calculations in terms of rigid zzso geometry and refined by the zzso zzso It has been shown that the major zzso (with respect to zzso zzso of zzso in solution zzso only to the zzso type of zzso zzso and the minor zzso of zzso zzso only to the zzso zzso The less zzso rigid zzso analogue apparently exists in solution in the dynamic zzso equilibrium with preference of zzso type of the backbone zzso The obtained data on zzso and zzso space structures have been used for zzso results of their biological zzso
