The purpose of this study is to clone and characterize the expression pattern of a zzso gene zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fast-growing zzso plant valued for its zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso for zzso zzso zzso The full length of the zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The full-length zzso zzso consists of a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso 518 zzso acids zzso zzso number zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed that zzso zzso had the highest similarity zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso was conducted using quantitative real-time zzso during the zzso stages of various zzso and in response to various zzso zzso The highest transcript level of the zzso zzso was observed in immature flower zzso and in early stage (6 zzso of stem zzso with a certain level of expression in all zzso zzso The highest transcript level of zzso zzso was observed at the late time points after treatments with zzso zzso wounding zzso cold zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso
