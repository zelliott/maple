zzso protein zzso zzso has long been suggested to play an important role in modulating synaptic zzso We have created a strain of mice that lacks the gamma zzso of zzso to evaluate the significance of this zzso zzso zzso in synaptic zzso zzso mice are viable, develop zzso and have synaptic transmission that is indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is greatly diminished in zzso animals, while two other forms of synaptic zzso long-term depression and zzso zzso are zzso Surprisingly, when zzso to evoke zzso was preceded by a low frequency zzso zzso animals displayed apparently normal zzso We propose that zzso gamma is not part of the molecular machinery that produces zzso but is a key regulatory zzso
