zzso zzso containing the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was transferred by zzso from zzso coli to zzso zzso zzso The structural properties of the zzso protein were studied by one-dimensional and two-dimensional zzso A zzso in the folding of the zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso was observed for the oxidized zzso zzso pH and zzso studies indicated that the zzso does not result from an intermediate in the protein unfolding process, but derives from two zzso which are not in dynamic zzso
