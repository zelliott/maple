zzso dynamics simulations have been used to investigate the relationship between the zzso zzso of the zzso calcium binding loop of zzso and the overall plasticity and flexibility of the zzso The first simulation modeled the transition from zzso to zzso coordination by varying the van der zzso parameters for the bound metal zzso The zzso at position 12 could be accurately and zzso seen to be a source of selective zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso A second simulation correlated well with the experimental observation that an zzso substitution at zzso loop position 12 results in a dramatically less tightly bound zzso zzso coordination by zzso A final set of simulations investigated zzso binding in the zzso zzso loop in the presence of applied external forces designed to impose zzso zzso The results of these simulations illustrate that the zzso is capable of attaining a suitable orientation for zzso zzso thus zzso that it is the inherent rigidity of the loop that prevents zzso coordination in the zzso zzso zzso
