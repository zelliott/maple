A specific zzso mechanism for the replication of an infectious protein is zzso The feedback mechanism requires the infectious agent to induce concerted zzso during the translation of a cellular zzso Each module of the tandem repeat region of the gene zzso the prion protein zzso associated with zzso zzso contains multiple sites of potential zzso zzso It is proposed that some zzso zzso of zzso containing zzso peptides within the zzso repeat region of the protein backbone are able to replicate and cause zzso by interfering with the translation and simultaneous zzso of nascent zzso molecules into the zzso of the zzso zzso The model provides a plausible explanation for the zzso of zzso zzso strains as well as the zzso of zzso zzso The hypothesis that a zzso zzso is the zzso agent can also explain discrepancies between the published zzso acid sequence of zzso and the sequence deduced from the zzso
