In the present study, we used a zzso approach to identify zzso proteins from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were extracted from the cell surface using a mild wash in zzso buffer and zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso bands were excised and zzso zzso with zzso The resulting peptides were zzso by zzso The zzso sequences were used for a database search and allowed identification of a total of 29 zzso many of which could potentially be involved in the action of zzso in the gastrointestinal zzso The results provide the basis for future studies on the molecular mechanisms of zzso
