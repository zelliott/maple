zzso proteins are often zzso unless cellular systems prevent their zzso Data presented here uncover a mechanism by which defects in zzso proteins lead to a dramatic reduction in their zzso and protein zzso When zzso signal sequences fail to bind to the signal recognition particle zzso at the zzso exit site, the nascent chain instead contacts zzso zzso and the zzso zzso are specifically zzso zzso of signal sequence zzso correlated with increased proximity of zzso to nascent chain and zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited degradation of the zzso zzso while zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso promoted degradation of zzso protein zzso The results reveal a previously unappreciated general mechanism of zzso quality control, in which specific zzso degradation zzso regulates zzso protein production zzso
