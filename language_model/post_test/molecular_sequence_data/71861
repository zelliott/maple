In the zzso zzso plays an important role in development of the skeletal muscles of the zzso elements of the nervous system and zzso zzso It is expressed in the brain and skeletal muscles of the limbs in the mature zzso Recently, we have identified alternate transcripts that differ by inclusion or exclusion of a zzso and/or a zzso in the paired domain zzso zzso zzso of the paired box in zzso DNA from zzso and zzso mice reveals that the zzso and zzso are generated by selection of alternate zzso sites at the 3' zzso of each of the two paired box zzso zzso The zzso 3' zzso site of the first zzso which includes the zzso in the mature transcript, is zzso selected in skeletal muscle and zzso By contrast, the zzso 3' zzso site of the second zzso which results in inclusion of the zzso in the mature transcript, is zzso selected only in skeletal zzso The zzso alternate 3' zzso site, which results in exclusion of the zzso in the mature transcript, is zzso selected in the zzso These findings raise the possibility that there may be zzso factors that influence the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso to the structure of the proposed primordial form of zzso suggests that the ability to zzso the alternate zzso sites that generate inclusion of the zzso and the zzso in the mature transcripts may have occurred in recent evolutionary zzso
