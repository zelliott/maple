zzso encodes a zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso genes in zzso zzso The zzso product is a positive regulator required for increased synthesis of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to act indirectly by zzso zzso negative regulators of zzso expression under zzso zzso however, zzso can also suppress the effects of zzso zzso under zzso zzso These results imply that the zzso product can promote either repression or zzso of zzso expression depending on zzso acid zzso We present a complete physical description of the zzso gene and its transcript, plus zzso of zzso expression at the zzso and zzso levels under different growth zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with no significant zzso to any other known protein zzso zzso zzso contains no leader zzso zzso and no potential zzso binding sites were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso with the absence of these regulatory sequences found at other genes in the general control system, zzso zzso and a zzso fusion zzso are present at similar levels under both zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso regulatory function in response to zzso acid availability occurs zzso A zzso deletion leads to unconditional zzso in a zzso zzso supporting the idea that zzso is expressed under normal growth conditions and zzso with the zzso product under these circumstances to carry out an essential cellular zzso We describe a point zzso that adds three zzso acids to the zzso zzso of zzso which zzso its positive regulatory function required under zzso conditions without zzso its ability to promote functions carried out by zzso under zzso zzso
