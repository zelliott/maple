The northern Florida Everglades has been subject to zzso in recent years, resulting in well-documented changes in microbial ecology and a shift in the dominant plant zzso This study investigated effects of plant quality and zzso on activities and composition of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Most probable numbers of zzso bacteria in zzso zzso and transition zzso zzso were zzso higher than in zzso zzso zzso Higher potential zzso was observed from cellulose in zzso with zzso from F1 and zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso status of soil, rather than plant type, was the major factor controlling zzso rates, although numbers of zzso bacteria were higher in zzso supplemented with ground zzso zzso in F1 and zzso than with zzso zzso component of soil in zzso regardless of soil zzso DNA sequence analysis indicated zzso zzso composition zzso with soil zzso zzso
