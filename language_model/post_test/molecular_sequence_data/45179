zzso zzso zzso infections suggest involvement of zzso zzso molecules in zzso and zzso zzso was previously identified as a zzso zzso Our recent studies suggest the protein is an zzso that is recognized by the zzso immune zzso In this study we examined the interactions of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso The cloned gene was expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso zzso protein zzso strong zzso responses in mice and was zzso with rabbit zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso bound to immobilized zzso and to zzso in a zzso manner and to zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso and zzso binding zzso of human zzso and in particular the zzso repeat module as primary binding sites for this zzso Furthermore, zzso binding to the above zzso fragments could be inhibited by zzso suggesting a common binding site involving the zzso repeat module on the zzso domain of zzso zzso of intact zzso zzso to zzso was inhibited by increasing zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso effectively with zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso is an zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso zzso and they zzso the zzso repeat module as an important binding site for this zzso on the zzso zzso These interactions may be important initial steps leading to bacterial attachment and colonization that promote the establishment of zzso zzso infections in zzso
