The hairpin loop structure and the downstream zzso element of zzso zzso precursors are both needed for efficient 3' end formation in zzso and in zzso Though generally considered as a single processing zzso these two motifs are involved in different types of interaction with the processing zzso Whereas zzso duplex formation between the downstream zzso element and the zzso small nuclear zzso is essential for processing, we show here that base pairing between the zzso zzso structure and the zzso zzso is not zzso Our experiments demonstrate that a processing factor other than the zzso zzso makes contact with the highly zzso hairpin structure of the zzso zzso The recognition of the target site by the processing factor is structure and sequence zzso Prevention of this interaction results in an zzso decrease of 3' zzso efficiency in zzso The hairpin binding factor is zzso and can be partially separated from the zzso small nuclear zzso particle on a zzso Q zzso
