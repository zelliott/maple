In zzso zzso most zzso induced by a wide range of zzso arise during zzso replication employing the zzso gene product and DNA zzso zzso As part of an effort to investigate zzso zzso mechanisms, we have identified zzso clones of the human zzso of the zzso zzso genes and examined their function in zzso zzso Previously, we described the isolation of a human zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso of pol zzso and here report the identification and sequence of a human zzso of zzso zzso This gene was isolated by identifying an expressed sequence tag zzso a zzso with similarity to the C zzso of zzso zzso followed by sequencing of the clone and retrieval of the remaining zzso by zzso rapid amplification of zzso zzso The human gene encodes an expected protein of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The proteins share two zzso regions of approximately 100 zzso with zzso and zzso identity, a region of approximately 320 zzso with zzso identity, and a central motif in which 11 of 13 zzso are zzso Human cells expressing high levels of an zzso zzso zzso grew zzso and were not more sensitive to the zzso effect of 254 zzso zzso radiation than cells lacking zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso resistance zzso induced by zzso in the cells expressing zzso zzso zzso were significantly lower than in the control zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the human gene has a function similar to that of the zzso zzso
