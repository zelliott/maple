Two approaches have been used to zzso the role of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison of the primary structure of zzso zzso zzso derived from a 2 zzso partial zzso sequence with the zzso fish, zzso and insect counterparts revealed an overall zzso of zzso Whereas the zzso domain was not zzso at all, the zzso binding domain zzso zzso showed more than zzso identical zzso acids in all zzso Together with the similar zzso properties of the zzso the genetic conservation zzso the notion that zzso plays a major role in various cellular zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso embryonic stem cells by zzso zzso led to mouse strains with a complete lack of nuclear zzso These zzso zzso mice were viable and fertile indicating that zzso is zzso in mouse zzso Moreover, repair of zzso and zzso induced DNA damage was not affected in zzso like zzso as measured by zzso of in zzso damaged reporter plasmids and unscheduled DNA zzso However, about zzso of the zzso zzso mice developed pathological skin aberrations on a mixed zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso These mice will be extremely useful to define the precise biological role of zzso
