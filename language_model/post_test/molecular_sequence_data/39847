Renal zzso cells elicit zzso responses following exposure to zzso such as zzso One response is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to 10 zzso cadmium demonstrated induction ( approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using a zzso human zzso zzso promoter zzso the importance of a previously identified cadmium response element zzso in zzso cells was verified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction with this sequence was demonstrated using nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso zzso screen of a human kidney zzso library resulted in the identification of zzso a unique zzso zzso zzso as an interacting protein with the cadmium response element and was confirmed by zzso zzso in zzso and gel shift zzso with zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso The specificity of the zzso interaction was verified by the absence of a binding complex when the core sequence of the cadmium response element was zzso or zzso In addition, zzso another zzso zzso did not interact with the cadmium response zzso zzso of zzso resulted in increased activity of the zzso human zzso zzso promoter construct but failed to activate this construct when the cadmium response sequence was zzso The findings demonstrate the important and previously zzso role of zzso as a zzso protein interacting specifically with the cadmium response element of the human zzso zzso zzso
