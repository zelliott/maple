zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in proteins of either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso They principally function in zzso trafficking and membrane zzso Both zzso and zzso possess zzso zzso but only zzso incorporates a zzso motif zzso To better understand the origins of zzso proteins and their functions, we performed detailed comparative zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is an architecture restricted to zzso and zzso Further, we undertook functional analysis in zzso zzso zzso zzso a divergent zzso possessing a single zzso protein zzso zzso has a cellular location similar to both zzso and zzso at plasma membrane zzso budding sites and zzso zzso and associates with zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso of zzso leads to a significant decrease in the zzso pools of multiple surface zzso without affecting bulk membrane zzso zzso despite lacking the zzso zzso maintains a similar role to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso We suggest that recruitment of a zzso to the zzso proteins was not essential for participation in zzso of zzso zzso and is presumably a specific innovation restricted to higher zzso
