zzso the evolutionary response of zzso zzso strains to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso I and II, Israel, we report here on presumably zzso differences in fatty acid zzso content that correlate with one particular feature of the zzso temperature zzso These two zzso represent similar ecological sites, separated by 40 zzso in which the orientation of the sun yields a strong zzso and hot zzso zzso slope versus a rather cooler and zzso zzso north-facing slope within a distance of only zzso zzso Among 131 zzso which are identical in their zzso zzso those assigned genetically to the zzso zzso express zzso generally more zzso zzso zzso than strains assigned to the zzso zzso when grown at 20 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 40 degrees zzso zzso zzso lineages express larger amounts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso when grown at the same zzso Moreover, zzso zzso show a stronger adjustment of their zzso and zzso zzso in response to low temperatures, which suggests that, as a result of temperature adaptation, zzso and zzso zzso have evolved different reaction norms within their zzso plasticity zzso Thus, bacterial zzso zzso may include such zzso and highly complex zzso as the bacterial cell zzso The results contribute to our understanding of the zzso process among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
