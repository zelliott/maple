The importance of zzso calcium channels zzso in basic zzso processes such as cardiac and neurological function has generated intense interest in these proteins as targets of pharmacological zzso zzso calcium channels are a subset of zzso distinguished by their zzso pharmacology and significance to the pathology of chronic zzso Despite decades of investigation, only a single drug targeting zzso channel function has entered the zzso This review will zzso our current understanding of the biology, physiology and pharmacology of zzso calcium channels and the implication of these features for therapeutic zzso From this basis of understanding, recent efforts to discover and develop zzso based and small zzso zzso of zzso calcium channel function will be zzso
