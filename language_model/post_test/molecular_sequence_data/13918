The zzso sequence of the DNA replication origin region of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance has been zzso This region of 1934 zzso presents some characteristics similar to those of other replication zzso zzso It contains a large open reading frame which could zzso a basic zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso of this zzso exist an zzso region, three direct repeats zzso of 21 zzso multiple zzso binding sites, and sites, and sites for the integration host factor zzso Moreover, the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso protein shows similarities with those of other zzso proteins zzso by plasmids of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and two cryptic plasmids from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso can be expressed in an zzso coli in zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso replication origin did not replicate in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso replication region with the corresponding regions of other zzso zzso plasmids was also studied by Southern zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso gene of zzso zzso is zzso to that of zzso zzso but not of zzso zzso The replication region of zzso zzso was zzso and showed about zzso identity at the zzso level with that of zzso A small zzso cloning zzso zzso of entirely defined zzso sequence was constructed for zzso zzso
