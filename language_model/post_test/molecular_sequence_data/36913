zzso zzso DNA elements were found to be shared by the upstream regions of the mouse zzso and zzso related protein zzso zzso Several nuclear proteins were shown to bind to both of these upstream zzso Shared zzso DNA elements were also found in the zzso zzso sequences of Japanese quail and snapping turtle zzso zzso Shared zzso zzso sequences were found to be scattered like an zzso in the zzso upstream regions of mouse and human zzso zzso Comparisons between Japanese quail and snapping turtle zzso genes gave similar zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and snapping zzso zzso genes did not show significant zzso in their zzso upstream zzso In contrast, coding sequences in the first zzso of zzso zzso genes and their deduced zzso acid sequences were found to be highly zzso except for their putative leader zzso zzso
