Two zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from a salt mine in zzso zzso zzso Both strains showed almost the same zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel strains grew at zzso degrees C, pH zzso and zzso % zzso zzso optimum growth was observed at zzso degrees C, pH zzso and zzso % zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were zzso The two strains were closely related to each other with a zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of 100 zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed high zzso values zzso zzso between strains zzso zzso and zzso zzso which suggested that these two new strains constituted a single zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that the two zzso formed a loose cluster with members of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but were clearly separated from this zzso The levels of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between the two zzso and members of the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The major polar lipids comprised zzso zzso zzso and four unknown zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso The sole respiratory zzso was zzso and the zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso The distinct zzso position and a combination of zzso and zzso characteristics supported the proposal of the new zzso as representing a novel species in a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso
