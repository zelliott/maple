The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned by zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso DNA libraries constructed with two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the ability to pit zzso media at pH zzso and zzso yielded several overlapping clones of the same DNA zzso zzso zzso focusing gels, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that this region zzso a single zzso zzso zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso and zzso revealing it to zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family, with highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso A zzso probe zzso at high stringency in DNA gel blots with total DNA from zzso zzso zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tomato, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso sequence revealed an zzso signal zzso whose processing in zzso coli was confirmed by protein sequence zzso zzso was similar to zzso zzso zzso in its zzso preference and ability to reduce the zzso of zzso and to zzso potato zzso zzso A zzso omega zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso into the zzso expression zzso zzso under control of the zzso zzso promoter, and then transformed into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce a strain zzso zzso zzso zzso developed in zzso following zzso with all of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regardless of their zzso zzso However, only zzso infected with zzso strains showed evidence of zzso and yielded zzso activity upon zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced no symptoms in cucumber zzso Thus, zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to alter the final symptoms in infected cucumber zzso without contributing to zzso or altering host zzso
