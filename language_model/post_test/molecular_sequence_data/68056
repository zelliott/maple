zzso zzso in the presence of zzso In the case of zzso zzso + 30 zzso the first product is an 80 + 18 zzso species which has an intact large zzso and the zzso zzso domain of the small zzso It was possible to bind zzso into the active site of zzso in the presence of zzso before zzso of either zzso zzso This suggests that the active site is functional before any zzso has occurred and that zzso is not a zzso zzso zzso generates several fragments including a 42 zzso zzso domain zzso that showed no zzso activity and zzso domain zzso Some of the zzso domain fragments were found to exist as zzso zzso + 18 zzso and 22 + 18 zzso with the zzso domain of the large zzso interacting with the zzso domain of the small zzso These species were true zzso as they showed zzso of the two zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of both zzso with an zzso specific for the zzso zzso zzso The generation of the zzso species after only 15 zzso zzso suggests that the interaction between the zzso zzso is present in the native zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso was investigated using an zzso based on binding to zzso and a competitive binding zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments generated by zzso were zzso zzso bound to zzso in the presence of zzso however, the isolated zzso 80 zzso large zzso zzso zzso a 42 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain fragments of zzso did zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso but with an affinity reduced by approximately two orders of magnitude when compared with native zzso
