zzso of the two genes zzso the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli yielded fully assembled zzso complexes zzso Surprisingly, also separate expression of both genes resulted in formation of zzso complexes zzso zzso in the bacterial zzso On electron zzso these complexes were indistinguishable from each other and from the native zzso The zzso zzso as well as the native zzso could be zzso in zzso from their zzso zzso in the presence of zzso
