zzso zzso factor zzso is a potent zzso of the growth of normal and zzso zzso cells and zzso with other factors such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso The action of zzso is zzso through a specific membrane zzso however it is not clear if all of the effects of zzso are direct or zzso As a step towards addressing this problem, a zzso diphtheria toxin zzso human zzso fusion protein has been constructed and zzso from zzso zzso The 70,000 zzso zzso protein has zzso zzso characteristic of both zzso and zzso At high zzso zzso is zzso towards zzso zzso cells, but not factor independent zzso zzso colony formation by zzso zzso blasts from a patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso was also zzso The zzso fusion toxin displayed zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to an zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in the ability of zzso to stimulate normal bone zzso colony zzso These results suggest that fusion of zzso to zzso sequences interferes with some of the activity but not the specificity of the zzso binding domain of the zzso Nevertheless, zzso may be included with the increasing number of other zzso fusion proteins whose toxicity is directed towards specific zzso cells, and may represent a novel approach towards the study and treatment of zzso
