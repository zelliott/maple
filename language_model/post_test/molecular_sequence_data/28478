A molecular clone of the zzso isolate of zzso zzso was rendered replication defective by an zzso deletion in either reverse zzso zzso or zzso zzso genes for use as DNA zzso To test the ability of these zzso vaccines to protect against two zzso zzso virus zzso zzso of differing zzso cats were zzso using either DNA vaccine alone or zzso with zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso Animals were challenged zzso with zzso zzso an zzso isolate of relatively low zzso and subsequently with the more virulent zzso A proportion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were protected against primary challenge with zzso Five of the zzso cats were zzso with zzso four (all zzso remained free of zzso whilst all zzso controls became zzso Following subsequent challenge with the more virulent zzso these four zzso animals all became zzso but showed lower zzso loads than zzso zzso This study suggests that while our current DNA vaccines may not produce zzso immunity against more virulent zzso of zzso they may nevertheless significantly reduce the impact of zzso
