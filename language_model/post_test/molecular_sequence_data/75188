The products of the zzso resistance zzso of resistance zzso zzso form an zzso system for zzso zzso results from active zzso of the zzso preventing their concentration from reaching toxic zzso The largest zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was zzso From zzso sequencing the zzso zzso termed the zzso zzso was shown to zzso to the product of the zzso zzso The zzso protein was demonstrated to bind zzso by two zzso First, a zzso of the protein with zzso was formed by zzso at 254 zzso Second, the zzso protein bound a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso affinity of 2 zzso By both zzso competition was observed with zzso or zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso or zzso In both zzso binding zzso zzso was required, but neither zzso nor zzso had any zzso In contrast, the zzso protein exhibited an zzso activity which was dependent on the presence of zzso or zzso The results suggest that the zzso protein is the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso
