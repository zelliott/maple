The Lon zzso are a unique family of zzso zzso with a built-in zzso zzso associated with diverse cellular zzso zzso Here, crystal structures of a unique member of the Lon family with no intrinsic zzso activity in the zzso active form are reported both alone and in complexes with three zzso zzso two zzso and one derived from a natural zzso This work reveals the unique architectural features of an zzso Lon that selectively degrades unfolded protein zzso zzso these results provide zzso insights into the recognition of zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso zzso chamber, which may aid the development of specific zzso zzso
