The present studies demonstrate zzso sequencing, tissue distribution, and functional expression of a zzso zzso which was isolated from a rat zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso recognizes two transcripts in zzso zzso from the stomach, zzso zzso liver, large zzso and zzso Based on deduced zzso acid zzso this clone shares sequence zzso with the other known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso except for its zzso zzso Overall, the protein exhibits zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso profile of the predicted protein shows 10 zzso zzso suggesting a protein with transport zzso The tissue distribution differs from that of the other zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to two closely related transcripts in the zzso of these zzso which suggests that the zzso transcript of this clone is alternatively zzso zzso of this zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in functional zzso exchange zzso These data suggest that we have cloned a member of the zzso zzso family with zzso zzso We suggest the designation of zzso for this zzso zzso
