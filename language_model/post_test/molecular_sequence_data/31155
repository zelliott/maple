zzso is a very important component of the zzso zzso zzso have many sites of zzso in zzso and can change their zzso Perhaps the process of zzso integration has some zzso To study this problem we zzso the zzso region of zzso zzso The analysis of this sequences reveals the following zzso zzso The zzso sequences contain 7 zzso 5 of which form a zzso zzso The zzso sequences contain zzso block which is similar to zzso for zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso The zzso region are rich in repeated zzso the longest of which zzso zzso and zzso zzso are on the zzso and on the zzso respectively, so that the whole structure is: zzso where N is some zzso zzso sequences are zzso while the zzso contains 10 consecutive zzso 4 zzso apart from zzso The zzso and zzso zzso share several common repeats in the zzso zzso the longest of which zzso is 63 bases upstream zzso and 11 bases upstream zzso zzso This sequence differs strongly from the consensus zzso zzso
