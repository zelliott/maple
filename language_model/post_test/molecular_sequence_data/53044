The relationship between the zzso mobility, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso state, and solution zzso of the all zzso 1, the corresponding zzso zzso 2, and several truncated zzso zzso has been investigated under low pH buffer conditions by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with coated zzso The results confirm that, under these conditions, the all zzso 1, and its zzso zzso 2, exhibit zzso zzso zzso and thus different zzso zzso At higher pH values, zzso pH zzso the zzso behavior of this zzso zzso pair, however, zzso These results indicate that variations in the zzso characteristics of the zzso main chain and subtle differences introduced by the spatial constraints of the zzso zzso replacement lead to differences in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso Since the observed zzso zzso zzso reflect the mean of the zzso of each charge species participating according to their zzso radius or their intrinsic charge and mole fraction zzso the results confirm that zzso zzso zzso with unmodified zzso and zzso zzso are zzso This outcome was achieved despite their zzso topographical and zzso similarities as assessed from zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso
