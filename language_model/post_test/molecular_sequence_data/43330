The mechanisms by which zzso zzso ends are fused to form circles after infection and are zzso by zzso from zzso DNA are zzso We used the simple structure of guinea pig zzso zzso which have either one repeated DNA sequence at each end or one repeat at one end and no repeat at the other, to study these zzso In circular DNA, two restriction fragments contained fused terminal sequences and had sizes consistent with the presence of single or double terminal zzso This result implies a simple zzso of zzso ends and shows that zzso does not occur by zzso of zzso terminal repeats formed by zzso zzso zzso to form the two zzso types occurred at two sites, and zzso between these sites identified two potential zzso elements that may be necessary for zzso One element coincided with the zzso region of a zzso sequence and had 9 of 11 bases identical between the two zzso The second element had six bases identical at both sites, in each case 7 zzso from the zzso To confirm the presence of zzso zzso zzso a zzso virus in which foreign sequences displaced the 6- and zzso elements 1 zzso from the zzso point was zzso zzso at the disrupted site did not zzso In a second zzso virus, restoration of 64 bases containing the 6- and zzso elements to the disrupted zzso site restored zzso zzso zzso zzso elements exist within this zzso region, and sequence conservation suggests that they are the 6- and zzso zzso
