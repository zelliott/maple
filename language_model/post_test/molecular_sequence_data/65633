We zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso type 9 zzso zzso and zzso junctions of 71 patients with familial zzso zzso in whom LDL zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso The previously reported zzso and zzso zzso were found in South African families, whereas new zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in families from New zzso Only, the zzso and zzso zzso modify a highly zzso zzso and segregate with the FH zzso We zzso those zzso in zzso cells and found that both zzso and zzso have reduced zzso activity compared with zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso is processed zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were not zzso from cells, unlike the zzso zzso and zzso zzso By zzso we showed that the expression of the zzso was reduced by zzso in cells zzso zzso or zzso zzso and further reduced by zzso when the zzso or zzso zzso were zzso zzso the zzso levels, LDL cellular binding decreased by zzso upon zzso zzso or zzso zzso and by zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso Our study therefore indicates that zzso zzso zzso of the zzso does not require zzso zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso may also function zzso
