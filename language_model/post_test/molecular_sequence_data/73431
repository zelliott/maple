zzso and polarity of zzso type 5 DNA packaging are believed to be directed by an interaction of putative packaging factors with the zzso zzso packaging domain located within the zzso left end zzso zzso to zzso In previous studies, this packaging domain was zzso dissected into at least seven functional elements called A zzso These zzso albeit redundant in function, exhibit differences in the ability to support viral packaging, with elements I, II, zzso and VI as the most critical zzso zzso packaging was shown to be sensitive to spatial changes between individual A zzso To study the importance of spatial constraints in more detail, we performed zzso zzso of the zzso zzso regions separating A repeats I and II, as well as A repeats V and zzso The results of our zzso analysis reveal previously zzso sequences that are critical for DNA zzso in zzso On the basis of these results, we present a more complex consensus motif for the zzso packaging elements which is zzso in zzso DNA zzso is compromised by changes in spacing between the two zzso parts of the consensus zzso rather than between different A zzso zzso evidence implicating packaging elements as independent units in viral DNA packaging is derived from the selection of zzso from a zzso zzso zzso of packaging repeats is sufficient for the evolution of zzso zzso Finally, we identify minimally sized segments of the zzso packaging domain that can zzso viability and packaging activity to viruses carrying gross zzso within their zzso zzso zzso experiments using the zzso as well as the zzso zzso viruses strengthen existing arguments for the involvement of limiting, zzso components in viral DNA zzso
