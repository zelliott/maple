Group B zzso detected in Bangladesh in 2000 and 2001 were analyzed genetically to clarify zzso to human group B zzso reported previously in China and India, and to animal group B zzso zzso gene sequences of the zzso group B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were almost identical to each other and also showed high sequence identity to the Indian strain zzso zzso and Chinese strain adult zzso zzso zzso zzso while identities to bovine and zzso viruses were considerably low zzso Other genes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso through zzso also showed much higher sequence identities to those of zzso zzso than to those of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso suggested that all the gene segments might have evolved zzso at similar zzso rates, while some of the gene segments zzso zzso zzso were suggested to be more zzso than zzso In conclusion, group B zzso detected in Bangladesh represented by zzso and the Indian virus zzso were considered as virtually identical viruses which are distinct genetically from zzso and it was suggested that zzso zzso group B zzso zzso zzso might be distributed primarily in an area around the Bay of zzso
