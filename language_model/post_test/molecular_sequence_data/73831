zzso is an essential gene required for initiation of DNA replication in the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts genetically with zzso and zzso both members of the zzso family of genes which have been implicated in the licensing of DNA zzso In this report, the isolation of zzso is zzso The zzso gene is linked to an essential open reading frame on zzso zzso zzso was found to be cell cycle regulated and zzso zzso levels are zzso zzso encodes a protein structurally related to zzso a protein required for DNA replication in zzso zzso zzso also interacts genetically with zzso the gene zzso the second zzso of the origin recognition complex, zzso and zzso another member of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a zzso maintenance zzso which is rescued by the addition of multiple potential origins to the zzso
