We describe the rapid isolation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso format from a zzso zzso library created in our zzso Such zzso library has demonstrated to be a versatile tool and enabled the isolation of several different zzso for any of the six proteins panned in zzso The zzso specific for human zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso were successively analyzed in more detail and resulted suitable for both western zzso and zzso zzso Several milligrams per liter of zzso were zzso by affinity zzso and used for kinetic and zzso zzso Their zzso was in the zzso range and they apparently bound a zzso zzso 1 domain not overlapping the region recognized by its zzso zzso zzso Altogether, the collected data indicate that the new library can enable the recovery of zzso of high zzso specificity and functionality in the conventional zzso tests, avoiding the necessity of further maturation zzso Such results confirmed recent reports of high affinity zzso zzso and supported the choice of using large zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries as an alternative to the preparation of immune libraries for selecting zzso zzso at convenient cost and time zzso
