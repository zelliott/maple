A high copy shuttle zzso was used to express a zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso to examine regulatory responses to a high gene zzso zzso analyses utilizing reverse zzso amplification and restriction zzso length zzso indicated that the zzso gene was both zzso and highly expressed and that downstream processing and/or termination were critical to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, direct zzso of the total cellular zzso zzso showed essentially normal levels of mature zzso although zzso of precursor levels confirmed a highly expressed gene zzso Taken together, the results indicated that the steady state amounts of mature zzso zzso were primarily regulated at the zzso zzso This regulatory mechanism prevents zzso of the cellular zzso zzso and can efficiently degrade zzso zzso zzso Together with past studies on other 3' extended zzso zzso the results support zzso regulation as a quality control mechanism in which appropriate amounts of functional zzso are stabilized by protein interaction while excess or defective zzso is rapidly zzso zzso processing in zzso and zzso analyses were consistent with this zzso
