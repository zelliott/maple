A recently developed procedure to predict backbone structure from the zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is fine tuned to identify protein zzso of length zzso zzso that adopt zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso These segments are obtained by requiring that their predicted lowest energy structures have a sizable energy gap relative to other zzso zzso zzso this procedure to 69 proteins of known structure, we find that regions with largest energy zzso having highly preferred zzso also the most accurately predicted zzso On the basis of previous findings that such regions correlate well with sites that become structured early during zzso our approach provides the means of identifying such sites in proteins without prior knowledge of the zzso zzso Furthermore, when predictions are performed so as to ignore the influence of zzso zzso each segment along the zzso a situation akin to zzso the considered zzso from the rest of the chain, they offer the possibility of identifying protein segments liable to adopt zzso zzso on their zzso The described approach should have useful applications in experimental and theoretical investigations of protein folding and stability, and aid in designing zzso drugs and zzso
