Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is caused by the zzso coronavirus zzso which uses zzso zzso 2 zzso as its zzso for cell zzso A group of zzso zzso zzso has been identified in zzso zzso zzso and zzso share identical zzso organizations and high sequence zzso with the main exception of the N zzso of the spike protein zzso known to be responsible for zzso binding in zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso usage of the zzso S by combining a human zzso zzso zzso system with cell lines expressing the zzso molecules of human, zzso or zzso zzso In addition to full-length S of zzso and zzso a series of S zzso was constructed by inserting different sequences of the zzso S into the zzso S zzso Several important observations were made from this zzso First, the zzso S was unable to use any of the three zzso molecules as its zzso Second, the zzso S failed to enter cells expressing the bat zzso Third, the zzso S covering the previously defined zzso domain gained its ability to enter cells via human zzso albeit with different efficiencies for different zzso Fourth, a minimal insert region zzso acids 310 to zzso was found to be sufficient to convert the zzso S from zzso binding to human zzso zzso indicating that the zzso S is largely compatible with zzso S protein both in structure and in zzso The significance of these findings in relation to virus origin, virus zzso and host switching is zzso
