To probe the complex zzso acid binding zzso of zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso we have isolated in the presence of zzso zzso molecules that selectively bind to zzso Pol zzso A class of zzso molecules was found to bind and strongly interfere with zzso interaction but not with zzso chain zzso zzso one selected zzso zzso was a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso Pol zzso zzso zzso Pol I and Pol III and Pol II from zzso zzso or wheat germ cells were not zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso the largest zzso of Pol II and, to a lesser extent, with zzso the second largest zzso The selected zzso was expressed in zzso cells under the control of a Pol III zzso zzso cells that expressed the zzso II zzso grew zzso However, a cell growth zzso was observed when expressing the zzso zzso in cells having an artificially reduced level of Pol zzso
