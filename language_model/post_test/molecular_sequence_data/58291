zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso found in a variety of organisms that span the zzso tree from humans to zzso Although its zzso function is not clearly zzso zzso is a potent regulator of zzso cell zzso it is one of the major zzso found in blood zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso elicits zzso zzso zzso This zzso like other effects of zzso is consistent with a plasma membrane zzso zzso of G zzso signal zzso zzso zzso we report the identification of a complementary DNA from zzso that encodes a functional zzso zzso zzso The predicted structure of this protein of zzso zzso acids contains features common to members of the seven zzso zzso zzso with a predicted zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso derived from the first 5-11 predicted zzso zzso selectively inhibited the expression of the zzso zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso whereas the same zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the full-length zzso in zzso led to an increase in zzso zzso current due to increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso but zzso of the zzso zzso was, again, zzso zzso expressing zzso prepared from this clone showed no response to other zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor, suggesting that the zzso is highly selective for zzso
