We applied zzso biology to identify the linear zzso acid sequence recognized by a mouse zzso zzso raised against the full length zzso zzso zzso zzso search for the zzso zzso used two zzso the capability of zzso peptides to bind to zzso class II zzso and the similarity level of the zzso sequence to the mouse zzso We report that zzso zzso recognized the zzso having both high binding potential to zzso II molecules and low level of molecular mimicry to mouse zzso zzso ability to bind to zzso II molecules appears a necessary but not sufficient condition to determine zzso zzso by needing to be supported by a low degree of zzso similarity to the zzso zzso
