The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is distinct from other zzso zzso in possessing a zzso tail 40 zzso acid zzso long zzso Jones and zzso zzso DNA Cell zzso 14, zzso Such extensions from the core zzso domain have been found in a subset of known zzso zzso where they have been shown to have diverse roles including target recognition, membrane attachment and zzso In the present study we used zzso in zzso to examine the role of the tail in specific aspects of zzso structure and zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso reveal that it forms zzso and probably zzso The zzso tail of zzso has an important role in this interaction because deletions of the tail significantly decrease, but do not zzso this zzso zzso zzso zzso show that, in addition to accepting a zzso zzso at its active site, zzso is zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso the site of zzso to zzso in the zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso tail of zzso is important both for its zzso structure and zzso modification in zzso
