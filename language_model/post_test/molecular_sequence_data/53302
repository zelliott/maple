Plasma and tissue distribution of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso either bound directly or through three types of zzso zzso was studied after intravenous injection to rats bearing Walker 256 zzso and compared with that of zzso In contrast to zzso each zzso retained high levels of zzso in the zzso form in plasma and displayed high zzso in the tumor at 6 h after the zzso zzso characteristics of zzso in rats bearing Walker 256 zzso indicate that zzso which had molecular weight over 50 zzso is a suitable zzso carrier for tumor targeting in cancer chemotherapy by zzso We find that the in zzso zzso effect of the zzso depends on the tumor zzso of free zzso released from the zzso zzso zzso were also distributed in the zzso zzso such as liver, zzso and bone zzso however, the tissue zzso of the zzso in the heart, lung and muscle were lower than those of zzso We next investigated the effect of the zzso contents of zzso zzso on their body distribution in rats bearing Walker zzso The half life of zzso zzso in plasma were shorter and the zzso had greater zzso in the zzso system, while they showed lower zzso in the tumor with increasing zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso were reduced and the lethal zzso of zzso zzso were amplified with increasing zzso zzso
