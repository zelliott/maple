zzso bind zzso very tightly in a closed zzso zzso by the coordination of four protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and of a synergistic zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso undergo a large scale zzso zzso the zzso structure with an opening of the zzso zzso is transformed into the closed zzso structure, zzso initial zzso binding in the open zzso To solve the zzso zzso structure, an zzso zzso crystal that had been grown as the zzso form was soaked with zzso and its structure was solved at zzso A zzso The zzso form showed almost exactly the same overall open structure as the zzso zzso zzso The electron density map unequivocally proved the presence of an iron atom with the coordination by the two protein zzso of zzso and zzso Other zzso coordination sites are occupied by a zzso zzso which is stabilized through the hydrogen bonds with the zzso zzso groups of zzso zzso and zzso and a side chain group of zzso There is, however, no clear interaction between the zzso zzso and the synergistic zzso binding site, zzso
