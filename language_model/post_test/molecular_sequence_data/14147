zzso and an zzso zzso nuclear gene zzso zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and zzso from the marine red zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso sequence of zzso is readily zzso with those of other known zzso 26 of 27 zzso zzso and 19 of 26 zzso zzso are identical between zzso of zzso zzso and/or animals and green zzso A partial zzso sequence of a second zzso gene zzso presumably zzso zzso zzso was recovered by zzso and demonstrated by zzso analysis to be red zzso no zzso zzso or zzso clones could be zzso zzso Southern analysis demonstrated that at least two zzso genes are present in the nuclear DNA of zzso zzso
