The structural gene for the type 24 M protein of group A zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the gene and the 3' and zzso zzso regions was zzso The sequence includes an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso acids and a predicted Mr of zzso The structural gene contains two distinct zzso reiterated zzso The first repeated element consists of zzso units, and the second contains zzso zzso Each element shows little variation of the basic zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of the zzso protein with the sequence of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Scott, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that these molecules have are zzso except in the regions coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and they have three regions of zzso within the structural zzso 38 of 42 zzso acids within the zzso terminal signal zzso the second repeated element of the zzso protein is found in the zzso zzso at the same position in the zzso and the zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso including a membrane anchor zzso are zzso in both zzso In addition, the sequences zzso the two genes are strongly zzso
