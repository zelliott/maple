Range expansion from zzso zzso and anthropogenic influences contribute to the present distribution pattern of zzso zzso We scored a zzso set of zzso and found two markers with an zzso geographic distribution across the zzso range of the zzso zzso around the two zzso were zzso in 98 zzso including newly collected plants from Middle Asia and Western zzso These regions zzso to a gene ( approximately 1500 zzso and a zzso region ( approximately 500 zzso 300 zzso apart on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso fragments were zzso and zzso The zzso of both sequences belonged to one of two groups: a rather uniform zzso and a more variable zzso zzso group, on the basis of zzso clusters of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso occurs where they zzso Especially in the zzso zzso many rare zzso zzso representing independent zzso are scattered among the shared zzso zzso This agrees with previous suggestions of two large zzso groups in zzso zzso and the zzso colonization of central Europe from the east and the zzso A clear correlation between zzso factors and the zzso distribution may reflect the zzso history rather than local climate zzso The pattern of zzso variation within the zzso sequences explains why only a minority of zzso selected across the zzso show evidence of this geographic zzso
