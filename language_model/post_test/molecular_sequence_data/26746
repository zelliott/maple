We describe two new species of zzso allied to the zzso zzso species complex by the presence of single and long zzso zzso and a triangular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by having small to medium size zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso length plus zzso length corresponding to more than zzso of zzso zzso a broad head zzso zzso corresponding to zzso of the zzso zzso and by the light brown zzso region and a cream colored zzso surface with scattered brown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by its medium size zzso zzso zzso in zzso by the absence of contact between the zzso bones and between the zzso and zzso by a very reduced zzso projection, by having zzso bones very depressed and broad zzso by the smooth surface of the zzso and zzso by shallow, zzso zzso pits on the zzso and by the females presenting the zzso region dark zzso The two new species were previously confused with zzso zzso for which we provide a new zzso A molecular analysis based on zzso and nuclear genes recovers a zzso zzso with high support, and the two new species in a zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data also reinforce the idea that the species groups presently admitted to the zzso are not zzso
