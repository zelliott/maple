Fetal zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso is a mixture of two molecular species zzso and zzso that differ only at position 136 reflecting the products of two zzso zzso zzso At the time of birth, zzso accounts for approximately zzso of the total zzso The zzso zzso ratio in the zzso of normal newborn is zzso whereas in the trace amounts of zzso that is found in the adult it reverses to zzso because of a zzso to zzso gene zzso zzso of these ratios are indicative of a molecular zzso at the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso due to zzso and zzso chain structural zzso and quantitative zzso affecting the synthesis of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and even zzso of the zzso zzso which may be detected in newborn blood zzso have been zzso Moreover, several pathological and zzso conditions affecting the zzso gene zzso such as zzso zzso cell disease, zzso and zzso persistence of zzso zzso are characterized by the continued synthesis of zzso chains in the adult zzso Studies of these natural zzso associated with increased synthesis of zzso in adult life have provided considerable insight into the understanding of the control of zzso gene expression and zzso zzso
