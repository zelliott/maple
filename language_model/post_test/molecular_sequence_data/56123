zzso active and inactive zzso zzso G exerted zzso action in zzso against zzso zzso whereas only zzso active zzso G displayed zzso action against zzso zzso In order to further test the requirement for zzso activity for the zzso action of zzso G, synthetic peptides spanning the full-length mature protein were prepared and examined for zzso zzso Surprisingly, three structurally distinct peptides that zzso to zzso 61 to 80, 117 to zzso and 198 to 223 within the full-length protein were found to exert potent zzso action zzso zzso logs of killing at 500 zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and four zzso clinical zzso Only the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso 117 to 136 zzso within zzso G exerted zzso action against the zzso pathogen zzso zzso The zzso action of zzso was rapid and could be inhibited either by increasing zzso of zzso or by zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and these conditions appeared to reduce binding of the zzso to whole zzso zzso of zzso zzso lacking either a zzso zzso domain or a positively charged zzso domain were found to have significantly less zzso action than zzso The zzso capacity of the zzso form of zzso zzso was found to be identical to that of the zzso suggesting that the mechanism of killing does not require the recognition of a target site possessing a zzso zzso
