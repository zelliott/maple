zzso changes of rat skeletal muscle were investigated by two-dimensional difference zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso The results indicated that proteins involved in the zzso cycle, zzso production, and electron transport are zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso and zzso production were zzso zzso of the zzso markers zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso was also observed, suggesting that in zzso adaptation to zzso requires an active zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso which has been implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis in zzso appears zzso suggesting that its activity, in this system, is not controlled by oxygen partial zzso
