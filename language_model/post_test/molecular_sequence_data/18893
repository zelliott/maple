zzso between soybean zzso and bovine zzso has been previously zzso In this study we aimed to map zzso of the major soybean zzso zzso m 5 that are zzso by zzso specific zzso and to identify a zzso responsible for the zzso 

zzso milk protein zzso zzso were used in different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to evaluate the in zzso recognition of soybean proteins zzso zzso zzso m 5 zzso a truncated zzso containing the zzso domain zzso and peptides of zzso were obtained and zzso mapping was performed with an overlapping zzso zzso zzso tools were used for zzso prediction by sequence zzso and for zzso the zzso soy proteins and zzso The binding of SP to a zzso zzso was studied by surface zzso resonance zzso Finally, the in zzso zzso of SP was assessed in a mouse model of milk zzso 

Both zzso and zzso reacted with the different zzso zzso zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso in several zzso particularly in the zzso named zzso Besides, we found similar values of association and zzso zzso between the zzso specific zzso and the different milk and soy zzso The food zzso mouse model showed that SP and PA contain the zzso B and T zzso which triggered hypersensitivity reactions and a zzso response on zzso zzso 

zzso m 5 is a zzso soy zzso and the zzso portion of the zzso contains zzso and zzso zzso zzso confined to zzso a region with enough zzso to be bound by zzso These findings contribute to explain the intolerance to SP observed in zzso zzso patients, primarily not zzso to SP, as well as it sets the basis to propose a zzso zzso for milk zzso using this soy zzso
