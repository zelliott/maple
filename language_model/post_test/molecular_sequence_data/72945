zzso an actively transcribed genetic locus linked to the common zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The expression of zzso is neither dependent on the regulatory proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso nor on either copy of zzso 54, zzso and zzso The zzso start site of zzso was determined and found to overlap the zzso transcribed zzso gene by 224 zzso An appropriately located zzso sequence identical to the consensus proposed for zzso and a zzso zzso region were identified upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso showed no significant zzso to known sequences in gene databases, and its zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of five zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso seems to be zzso among zzso since an zzso probe zzso to total DNA extracted from other zzso zzso
