The involvement of human zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso has been investigated using zzso expression and liver zzso kinetic and inhibitor zzso zzso zzso by human liver zzso and zzso human zzso exhibited zzso zzso the respective apparent zzso values were 30 zzso 7 and 21 zzso Mutual competitive zzso was observed for zzso and zzso zzso (an alternative human zzso zzso in liver zzso with close similarities between the calculated apparent zzso and Ki values for each individual zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities in zzso from 18 liver donors varied to a similar extent zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity correlated significantly zzso zzso or zzso zzso P zzso zzso with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso formation and decreased zzso zzso by zzso zzso and human liver zzso in zzso zzso for other human zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused zzso zzso zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso These data confirm that, as in animal species, zzso zzso is zzso largely by zzso in human liver and zzso may therefore be used as an in zzso zzso probe for the human zzso
