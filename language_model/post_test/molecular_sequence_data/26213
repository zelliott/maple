zzso zzso is an zzso thought to play an important zzso role in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We have designed an zzso dot zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso using as probe a synthetic zzso complementary to its zzso zzso We have also used zzso zzso complementary to zzso sequences within bacterial zzso zzso zzso to amplify a zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso via the zzso chain reaction zzso After determining the DNA sequence of this amplified zzso zzso fragment, zzso were designed for specific zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso from clinical zzso zzso were zzso amplified with universal zzso zzso zzso to detect the presence of bacteria and with zzso zzso zzso to uniquely detect zzso zzso Finally, by comparing the zzso zzso zzso zzso to commonly used diagnostic tests, we demonstrate that the molecular technique of zzso amplification shows promising applications for the clinical detection of zzso zzso
