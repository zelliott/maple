Previous characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso III zzso indicated the presence of a second zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hoffmann, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso gene was found to be split into the two potential open reading frames zzso and zzso by a sequencing error of the zzso sequencing zzso The zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso under zzso and zzso growth zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulated zzso III under zzso growth zzso A zzso zzso double zzso exhibited normal zzso and zzso growth, indicating the presence of a third alternative zzso zzso system for zzso III zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IX zzso with zzso III zzso side activity, did not significantly contribute to this newly identified zzso Growth behavior of zzso zzso revealed the presence of an zzso zzso IX zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso starting 31 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso was zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso and zzso demonstrated a fivefold zzso induction of both genes under nitrate zzso growth zzso No zzso induction was observed for zzso growing zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso regulatory systems zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were indispensable for the observed zzso zzso A zzso regulation cascade proceeding from an unknown sensor via zzso through zzso and zzso to zzso is suggested for the observed zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso respiratory energy zzso Finally, only zzso was found to be fivefold induced by the presence of zzso indicating further zzso of zzso zzso with the formation of the zzso zzso zzso
