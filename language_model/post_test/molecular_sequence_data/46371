The zzso membrane in purple bacteria contains several zzso complexes that assure light capture and establishment of the zzso zzso The zzso tasks of the zzso membrane require the strong interaction between these various zzso In the present work, we acquired the first images of the native outer membrane architecture and the zzso organization of the zzso apparatus in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Mixed with zzso zzso complex 2) rings, the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso core complexes appear as zzso zzso with random zzso in the zzso zzso Within the zzso fence surrounding the zzso a remarkable gap that is probably occupied (or partially zzso by zzso is zzso zzso alignment revealed that one specific region in zzso may be essential for zzso core zzso In this region of ten zzso acids in length all zzso species had five zzso zzso zzso with the exception of zzso zzso Our findings provide direct evidence that the presence of zzso in zzso zzso does not directly govern the zzso of zzso core complexes in the native zzso It is zzso zzso that the high membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features equally small zzso zzso alike zzso zzso is not due to membrane zzso induced by zzso zzso cores, as it has been proposed in zzso zzso
