A fundamental question in cell biology is how membrane proteins are sorted in the zzso zzso The sorting of zzso zzso receptors between recycling zzso and zzso is responsible for opposite effects on signal zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso Here we describe a mechanism that controls this sorting operation, which is zzso by a family of zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso The zzso zzso (for zzso zzso binds to the zzso tail of the zzso zzso through a zzso domain and to the cortical zzso zzso through an zzso zzso zzso the interaction of zzso with either domain or zzso of the zzso zzso itself causes zzso of zzso zzso receptors but does not affect the recycling of zzso zzso A zzso zzso at position 411 in the tail of the zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso by zzso (for zzso zzso and is required for interaction with zzso and for proper recycling of the zzso Our results identify a new role for zzso protein interactions and for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and suggest a mechanism by which zzso zzso could regulate membrane trafficking of zzso receptors after zzso
