The sequence structure of the zzso internal transcribed zzso 2 zzso was determined for six species of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso fish in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas divergent zzso zzso copies were detected in Chinese, Japanese, and Slovak zzso of zzso zzso and in zzso zzso both zzso in common zzso and in zzso zzso recently described from Chinese zzso zzso in zzso Despite distinct zzso differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso both species display very high level of molecular zzso Variation in number of short repetitive motifs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in assortment of zzso sequences in four zzso zzso in zzso zzso from China, three in Chinese and Japanese zzso of zzso zzso and five zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso In zzso zzso the structure and arrangement of zzso was different from those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso in the number of two zzso regions zzso zzso divided zzso clones into two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and second zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso identity of zzso zzso with all but one zzso zzso zzso species ranged between zzso and zzso which zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast, sequence identity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso failed into the range of zzso variation determined for zzso zzso zzso This close genetic similarity indicates that recently described zzso zzso may have undergone zzso divergence as a result of ongoing zzso zzso by host zzso
