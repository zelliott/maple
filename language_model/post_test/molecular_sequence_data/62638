If the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso is followed by a short open reading frame zzso a significant fraction of zzso resume scanning after termination of zzso translation, and zzso at a downstream zzso To examine the underlying zzso we examined zzso in zzso using a series of zzso that differed only in the zzso region zzso zzso zzso was found to occur only if the zzso complex, or at a minimum the central one-third zzso of zzso participated in the primary initiation event at the zzso initiation zzso It did not occur, however, when zzso translation was driven by the classical zzso fever virus or cricket paralysis virus internal zzso entry sites zzso which do not use zzso zzso zzso or zzso A critical test was provided by an zzso with an zzso zzso which is translated by scanning but does not absolutely need zzso and zzso There was efficient zzso in a standard zzso zzso when initiation would be largely driven by zzso but no zzso in an zzso zzso These results suggest that resumption of scanning may depend on the interaction between zzso (or the zzso central zzso and the zzso being maintained while the zzso translates the zzso
