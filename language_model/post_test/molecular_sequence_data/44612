zzso levels were determined in the eggs of two sea zzso species, the Mediterranean zzso zzso and the Antarctic zzso zzso While appreciable levels of zzso were found in zzso zzso eggs, a negligible amount was detected in zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso were obtained by means of reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Two distinct zzso species were cloned and zzso The translated zzso acid sequences of these two forms consisted of 67 zzso and differed in two zzso acid zzso Despite the lack of zzso in zzso zzso eggs, a zzso zzso was obtained by zzso amplification and a single zzso acid sequence coding for a 63 zzso zzso was zzso A comparative analysis of the primary structure of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with those of the other sea zzso zzso has been zzso Sea zzso zzso appear to be less similar to each other than zzso of closely related zzso
