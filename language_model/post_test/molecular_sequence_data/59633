zzso form a novel class of plant zzso proteins which are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of many economically important zzso These proteins induce leaf necrosis in infected plants and elicit an incompatible zzso reaction, leading to the development of a systemic acquired resistance against a range of zzso and bacterial plant zzso No crystal structures of this class of protein are zzso The crystal structure determination of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was undertaken to identify structural features important for the zzso activity of zzso 

The structure of zzso was determined using the zzso anomalous zzso technique and refined to zzso A zzso The overall structure has a novel fold consisting of six alpha zzso and a zzso zzso whose sequence is highly zzso within the family, composed of an zzso zzso beta sheet and an omega zzso This motif is assumed to be a major recognition site for a putative zzso and/or zzso Two other distinct binding sites seem to be correlated to the level of zzso activity of zzso 

The determination of the crystal structure of a member of the zzso family may make it possible to separate the activity that causes leaf necrosis from that inducing systemic acquired resistance to zzso making it feasible to engineer a zzso zzso that only elicits plant zzso Such studies should aid the development of zzso agricultural zzso zzso
