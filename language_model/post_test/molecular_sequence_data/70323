zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso dominant inherited condition caused by zzso in a candidate tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrier testing for zzso can be accomplished by DNA linkage or zzso detection zzso In many zzso families all affected individuals are zzso zzso tissue zzso if available from such patients, are a useful source of DNA for molecular zzso We investigated the carrier risk of a zzso 5-year-old girl with a family history of zzso An archival zzso of normal zzso tissue was only available from the zzso affected deceased zzso We screened DNA extracted from this zzso with zzso repeat zzso zzso marker zzso linked to the zzso zzso coli gene and established that the zzso is at more than zzso risk of developing zzso The zzso increased risk status was subsequently confirmed by identification of a zzso zzso zzso coli gene zzso consisting of a 5 base pair deletion at zzso zzso This strategy of using DNA from archival specimens of affected, unavailable zzso patients will increase the number of zzso individuals that can be diagnosed zzso
