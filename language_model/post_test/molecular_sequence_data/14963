The zzso signaling zzso plays essential roles in cell proliferation and zzso and zzso zzso protein levels lead to many types of human zzso On zzso by zzso the zzso zzso LDL zzso related protein 6 zzso is zzso at multiple zzso zzso zzso motifs by zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso resulting in recruitment of the scaffolding protein zzso to zzso As a result, zzso zzso by zzso is inhibited and zzso protein is zzso However, how zzso zzso and the ensuing zzso interaction lead to the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso is not fully zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso using zzso zzso and found that the zzso zzso peptides directly inhibit zzso zzso by zzso in a sequence and zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso zzso motifs is direct and specific for zzso zzso of zzso at zzso but not for zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and is independent of zzso zzso We also show that a zzso zzso zzso is able to activate zzso signaling and to induce axis zzso in zzso zzso presumably by zzso of zzso in zzso Based on these zzso we propose a working model that zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso places zzso in the vicinity of multiple zzso zzso zzso which directly inhibit zzso zzso of zzso This model provides a possible mechanism to account, in part, for zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso
