The analysis of spontaneous zzso zzso has led to the identification and characterization of a new, zzso active, zzso sequence of the zzso family in the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The element, which has been designated zzso is zzso zzso long with 10 zzso perfect zzso repeat ends and generates direct repeats of a zzso of target sequence upon zzso to the zzso S zzso zzso encodes two zzso partially zzso major zzso which are zzso in a manner typical of the zzso zzso Despite a low overall DNA sequence zzso the putative zzso region of zzso is highly similar to the corresponding region of zzso which is a related element previously shown to be active in zzso zzso zzso
