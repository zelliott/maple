zzso receptors mediate zzso dependent inflammatory response and zzso as well as certain zzso zzso zzso receptors interact with zzso zzso by binding the zzso portion of the zzso in zzso fashion creating a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso receptors including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso interact with zzso The lower hinge region of the zzso contributes most of the binding to the low affinity zzso zzso zzso attached to the zzso zzso site on zzso portion of an zzso are critical to the recognition of zzso by the low affinity zzso zzso They are likely to function as a substitution for the zzso core to preserve an optimal lower hinge zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso probably are determined by the length of the lower hinge regions of zzso but not their zzso acid composition as revealed by the binding study of the lower hinge zzso These studies also paved a new way for designing of novel therapeutic compounds in fighting zzso zzso
