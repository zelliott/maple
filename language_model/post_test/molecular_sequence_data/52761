zzso transformations of zzso zzso such as DNA repair zzso transformations are commonly interpreted primarily by zzso zzso chemistry that ignores their extensive zzso Yet human zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso that zzso DNA zzso repair, efficiently zzso the damaged base zzso resulting from zzso zzso even when zzso functional groups are deleted by zzso The zzso resolution zzso analogue and zzso resolution zzso product zzso structures of zzso bound to zzso DNA suggest zzso zzso energy from the zzso interface is funneled into zzso power at the active zzso The zzso stabilized closing of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso that are relieved by zzso bond zzso in the product zzso This zzso defined zzso zzso implies the zzso alters the orientation of three zzso electron zzso to favor electron zzso for zzso bond zzso By revealing the zzso of this zzso effect to a zzso of the zzso bond electrons into the zzso aromatic system, this structurally implicated mechanism resolves apparent zzso concerning the zzso of electrons among zzso zzso and the retention of zzso efficiency despite zzso removal of zzso functional zzso These zzso structures and their implied zzso zzso chemistry suggest biology favors a chemistry for zzso repair initiation that zzso zzso coordination by product binding to avoid the release of zzso and zzso zzso Similar zzso chemistry may apply to other biological reaction pathways requiring the coordination of complex zzso chemical zzso
