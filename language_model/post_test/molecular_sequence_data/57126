The production of zzso peptides is accomplished through the sequential action of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that are contained within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso and zzso are known to generate both soluble and integral membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso In order to investigate the functional consequences of these differences we zzso zzso a soluble zzso zzso form of the zzso from the spent medium of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso sequence analysis of products of limited zzso and zzso zzso we identified zzso regions at the zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso PAL zzso and at the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso removal of the zzso region from the zzso zzso protein shifted the pH optimum of zzso to a more alkaline zzso increased the turnover number zzso of zzso and decreased its zzso for zzso the zzso properties of PAL were not zzso Since zzso zzso can be a zzso step in the zzso of zzso similar increases in zzso activity in zzso may play an important role in regulating the extent of zzso zzso
