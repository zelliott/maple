A zzso form of zzso zzso was isolated from the rat zzso zzso zzso The cloned zzso is zzso zzso in length and it contains an entire zzso zzso zzso zzso with 245 zzso acids that is characteristic to zzso zzso zzso By comparing with reported sequences of zzso zzso we found three zzso zzso within the coding sequence in our zzso zzso transition at zzso zzso 325 and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both are zzso zzso leading zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso at zzso 88 and zzso zzso Our results show that at least three different genetic zzso of zzso zzso are present in rat species which results in protein zzso Such zzso in the zzso acid sequence is an important indication of the diverse functions of this protein and may also contribute to the recent contradictory observations regarding the role of the zzso zzso zzso
