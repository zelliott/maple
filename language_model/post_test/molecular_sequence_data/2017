zzso zzso zzso were calculated by two independent methods, zzso and distance zzso analysis, from an alignment of the derived zzso acid sequences of the A and C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with 12 corresponding sequences including a further set of zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso pol I, pol II, and pol III, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso They show the zzso as a coherent group in close neighborhood of and sharing a zzso with zzso pol II and zzso pol zzso zzso The most probable trees show pol zzso branching off from the tree separately at a zzso with the zzso zzso zzso The implications of these results, especially for understanding the possibly zzso origin of the zzso nuclear zzso are zzso
