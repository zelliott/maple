zzso zzso muscular zzso zzso the second most common form of childhood muscular zzso in Japan, is an zzso zzso severe muscular zzso associated with an anomaly of the zzso We had mapped the zzso gene to an approximately zzso zzso between zzso and zzso on zzso and had also found evidence for linkage zzso between zzso and zzso in this candidate zzso Through further analysis, we have defined another marker, zzso which showed stronger linkage zzso than zzso A zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso which includes this zzso zzso on zzso has been constructed by a combination of zzso site, zzso and restriction zzso Also, zzso clones zzso from the zzso were assembled into three zzso one of which contains zzso which showed the strongest linkage zzso with zzso These zzso also allowed us to order the markers as zzso zzso 800 zzso zzso to zzso 700 zzso 500 zzso 30 zzso zzso to zzso 120 zzso Thus, we have constructed the first high-resolution physical map of the zzso candidate zzso The zzso and zzso zzso established here will be a crucial resource for identification of the zzso gene and other genes in this zzso
