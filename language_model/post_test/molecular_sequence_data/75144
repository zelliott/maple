We constructed genes zzso the DNA binding region of the bacterial zzso zzso fused to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso fusion proteins activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso by these proteins was as strong as zzso zzso by proteins native to zzso zzso fusion proteins only activated zzso of genes when they were bound to zzso binding sites inserted upstream of those zzso zzso was activated less strongly by similar proteins in which the DNA binding region of zzso was fused to zzso and zzso zzso was not activated by native zzso or by proteins containing the DNA binding domain of zzso fused to zzso 434 zzso or zzso zzso alpha 2 zzso These results demonstrate that zzso proteins activate zzso gene expression when they are bound to promoter DNA, and thus suggest that zzso proteins exert some of their effects because they stimulate zzso of cellular zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso proteins in zzso provides a zzso that may facilitate genetic analysis of the function of these proteins in higher zzso
