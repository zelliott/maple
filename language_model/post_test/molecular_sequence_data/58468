In zzso zzso the zzso of the cell cycle is regulated by two zzso functionally overlapping complexes composed of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are structurally very zzso and are required for the start of the zzso and zzso cycle, zzso We have addressed the question which parts of the proteins are essential for function and determine the functional zzso Several discrete zzso in the zzso zzso region are essential for the zzso and zzso start function and determine the functional specificity independently of the structurally zzso motifs at the zzso end and in the zzso One of these zzso in zzso restricts zzso to interact only with zzso zzso without this domain behaves like a functional zzso having the properties of zzso and zzso Likewise, internally truncated forms of zzso lacking the centrally located zzso repeats and adjacent sequences can partially suppress the zzso zzso in zzso zzso These truncated zzso molecules behave like functional zzso with the properties of zzso and zzso
