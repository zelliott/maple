Short tandem repeats zzso are the primary genetic markers used for the analysis of biological samples in forensic and human identity zzso The discrimination power of a combination of zzso is sufficient in many human identity testing comparisons unless the evidence is substantially compromised and/or there are insufficient relatives or a potential zzso may have arisen in kinship zzso An automated zzso zzso system that is based on zzso zzso mass zzso zzso has been developed that can increase the discrimination power of some of the zzso core zzso zzso and thus provide more information in typical and challenged samples and zzso Data from the zzso zzso system is fully backwards compatible with existing zzso typing results generated by zzso zzso In contrast, however, the zzso zzso system also reveals zzso zzso residing within the zzso zzso The presence of these zzso expands the number of zzso at a zzso zzso studies were performed on the 13 core zzso zzso zzso from African Americans, Caucasians and Hispanics capturing both the length of the zzso as well as zzso variations contained within repeat motifs or zzso zzso Such additional zzso were identified in 11 of the 13 zzso examined zzso several nominal length zzso were zzso A substantial increase in zzso was observed, with close to or greater than zzso of samples analyzed being zzso with zzso zzso in at least one of five of the core zzso zzso This additional zzso increases discrimination power significantly, zzso the seven most zzso zzso zzso have a discrimination power equivalent to the 10 most discriminating of the zzso core zzso An analysis of zzso among the three population groups revealed a higher zzso than would be observed compared with using zzso designated by nominal zzso zzso repeats zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso produced zzso estimates of zzso and zzso respectively, when the expanded zzso complement zzso nominal zzso and zzso was considered compared to zzso and zzso respectively when only nominal repeat number was zzso These differences may indicate underlying population specific zzso zzso exist within these zzso A system of nomenclature has been developed that zzso the zzso searching and analyses of these combined data zzso
