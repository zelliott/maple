zzso protein zzso also known as zzso is an zzso inactive member of the zzso protein zzso zzso family and is located in zzso zzso zzso In patients with type 1 diabetes, zzso to zzso appear years before the development of clinical zzso The zzso structure and function of zzso however, is not zzso In the present study, we determined the zzso structure of zzso and found that both human and mouse zzso consist of 23 zzso and span approximately 1,000 and 800 zzso zzso With this information, we prepared a targeting construct and zzso the mouse zzso gene as demonstrated by lack of zzso zzso and protein zzso The zzso mice, in contrast to zzso controls, showed mild zzso intolerance and impaired zzso insulin zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso mice, the most widely studied animal model for human type 1 diabetes, failed to prevent the development of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is involved in insulin zzso but despite its importance as a major zzso in human type 1 diabetes, it is not required for the development of diabetes in zzso zzso
