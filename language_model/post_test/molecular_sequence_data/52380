Four zzso in the zzso domain of human zzso growth factor zzso zzso 40, zzso 43, zzso 45, and zzso 46 were targeted for zzso zzso to evaluate their potential role in zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso One or more zzso were generated at each of these sites and the altered zzso zzso gene products were zzso and evaluated by zzso competition binding zzso zzso replacement of zzso 40 with zzso resulted in a decrease in zzso binding affinity to zzso relative to zzso zzso On the other hand, removal of the zzso charge by substitution of zzso 40 with zzso or zzso resulted in only a slightly greater decrease in zzso binding to zzso relative zzso zzso The introduction of a positive charge upon substitution of zzso 43 with zzso had no effect on zzso zzso The substitution of zzso 45 with zzso also showed no effect on zzso zzso unlike the absolute requirement observed for the zzso zzso at position 41 zzso zzso zzso zzso Hauser zzso Cook zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso elimination of the positive charge of zzso 45 by reaction with zzso zzso showed that the zzso property of the zzso at this site, as well as that at zzso 28 and zzso 48, was not required for zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
