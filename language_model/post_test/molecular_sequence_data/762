To identify the genetic defects associated with zzso dominant zzso nuclear cataract in a Chinese zzso 

Clinical data were collected, and the zzso of the affected members in this family were recorded by zzso zzso zzso DNA was isolated from peripheral zzso zzso were screened in zzso candidate genes through zzso chain reaction zzso analyses and zzso zzso models of the zzso and zzso zzso were generated and analyzed by zzso 

zzso screening identified only one zzso zzso transition at zzso 32 in the first zzso of zzso zzso resulting in an zzso acid change from zzso to zzso at zzso 11 zzso This zzso zzso in all available affected family members but was not observed in any of the unaffected persons of the zzso The putative zzso disrupted a restriction site for the zzso zzso in the affected family zzso The zzso however, was not found in any of the randomly selected zzso normal individuals or in 40 unrelated senile cataract zzso zzso prediction suggested that this zzso affected the zzso properties as well as the structure of zzso 

These results supported the idea that the novel zzso zzso was responsible for the zzso dominant nuclear zzso cataract in this zzso
