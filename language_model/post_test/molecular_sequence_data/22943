The sustained zzso response to nuclear envelope zzso zzso indicates a group of primary zzso zzso zzso patients at high risk for the progression to zzso zzso zzso To address this issue, we zzso studied the expression of zzso zzso in needle liver biopsy specimens from zzso patients using a zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso The specimens from zzso zzso zzso chronic viral zzso B zzso and C zzso patients served as disease zzso The expression of zzso zzso was apparently increased on the nuclear envelope of zzso zzso cells zzso of small zzso ducts in almost all specimens from zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso zzso was negative in zzso of small zzso ducts in normal liver, while relatively weak zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the degree of zzso expression in zzso of small zzso ducts was positively correlated to that of portal zzso interface zzso and zzso inflammation in zzso These results indicate that the increased expression of zzso in small zzso zzso which is probably associated with damage to zzso by zzso is possibly involved in zzso response to zzso leading to the progression to zzso zzso failure in zzso
