zzso 

zzso zzso is a key biological process enabling plant populations to maintain genetic zzso zzso estimates of zzso zzso using zzso assignment or correlated zzso estimates require highly variable genetic zzso of which zzso are the markers of zzso zzso 

Eight zzso zzso have been developed for zzso zzso combining classical enrichment methods with zzso zzso These markers have been used in zzso analysis as well as in zzso analyses and proven to be highly zzso zzso to 63 zzso in the largest population zzso An excess of zzso in six zzso indicate the presence of zzso zzso zzso 

These markers are the first zzso isolated and tested on zzso zzso and provide a useful tool for population genetic studies in this common zzso zzso
