zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells and responsible for catalyzing zzso zzso between proteins or zzso A series of recent crystal structures have revealed the overall architecture of zzso zzso and provided a deep look at their active site, calcium and zzso zzso and the manner by which zzso zzso interact with this zzso These structures, backed with extensive zzso studies, are providing new insights as to how access to the zzso active site may be gated through the coordinated changes in cellular calcium and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 can zzso zzso and is inhibited by zzso despite lacking structural zzso with other zzso binding zzso A structure based sequence zzso among the zzso zzso family shows that these essential structural features are shared among other members of the zzso zzso
