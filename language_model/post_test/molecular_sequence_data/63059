The natural diversity of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso toxin zzso zzso carried by zzso zzso coli zzso strains isolated from humans was zzso For many years, zzso was supposed to be represented by a rather zzso zzso and one zzso produced by the reference zzso strain, was zzso studied either as a zzso factor or as a vaccine zzso zzso encompassing the two zzso genes zzso and zzso of 51 zzso zzso zzso either zzso zzso zzso only or zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso (24 zzso or zzso (27 zzso subjects, were subjected to restriction zzso length zzso zzso analysis and DNA zzso Seven zzso zzso types of the zzso strain were detected with six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restriction zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso analysis revealed 50 base changes in the zzso zzso including 21 zzso sites at zzso and 9 at zzso Based on the deduced zzso acid zzso 16 zzso types were identified, including zzso expressed by the zzso strain and 23 other strains belonging to seven different zzso and zzso expressed by 11 strains of six different zzso In zzso experiments carried out with zzso toxins indicated that no significant differences in zzso affinity could be detected among zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso but not other toxin types, showed reduced toxic activities measured either in zzso with cultured cells zzso zzso or in zzso in rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that the natural diversity of zzso produced by zzso zzso strains isolated from human hosts is considerably larger than previously assumed and may impact the zzso of the strains and the epidemiology of the zzso
