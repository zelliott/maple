zzso zzso by zzso is a central feature of zzso calcium zzso Recently, eight zzso zzso acid zzso in zzso segments zzso zzso and zzso of the calcium channel zzso zzso were identified to substantially contribute to zzso zzso To determine whether these eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are sufficient to form a high affinity zzso binding site in a zzso calcium channel, we transferred them to the 1, zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso inward currents zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was investigated with the zzso zzso clamp zzso The resulting zzso zzso displayed low sensitivity for zzso Analysis of the zzso binding region of an ancestral zzso zzso zzso previously cloned from zzso zzso body wall muscle led to the identification of zzso zzso zzso as an additional critical constituent of the zzso zzso binding zzso The introduction of this zzso into zzso restored full sensitivity for zzso It also transferred functional properties considered hallmarks of 1, zzso zzso and zzso effects zzso zzso zzso dependence of drug zzso and zzso shift in the zzso of zzso Our zzso zzso provide an excellent model for future studies of the zzso relationship of 1, zzso to obtain critical structural information for the development of drugs for zzso zzso calcium zzso
