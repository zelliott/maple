zzso P zzso P) zzso with external guide sequence zzso represents a zzso zzso gene interference approach to zzso gene zzso Unlike other strategies, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso technology is unique because a zzso zzso zzso can bind to any complementary zzso sequence and recruit zzso zzso P for specific degradation of the target zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso strategy is effective in blocking gene expression and growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso agent of the leading zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso We constructed zzso zzso molecules that target the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and we administered them directly to human zzso zzso cells infected with zzso A reduction of zzso in zzso expression and a reduction of approximately zzso in viral growth were observed in cells treated with a functional zzso In contrast, a reduction of zzso in the zzso expression and viral growth was found in cells that were either not treated with an zzso or that were treated with a disabled zzso containing zzso that zzso recognition by zzso zzso Our study provides direct evidence that zzso are highly effective in zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso administration of chemically modified zzso in inducing zzso zzso zzso represents an approach for zzso specific gene expression and for treating human diseases, including zzso zzso
