The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso agent of bacterial spot disease on pepper and tomato zzso The main zzso zzso reaction and zzso gene cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso spans a zzso zzso region, zzso six zzso groups designated zzso to zzso Analysis of the zzso locus revealed a single open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is predominantly zzso and contains two zzso zzso in the C zzso An interesting feature is the presence of two imperfect direct repeats in the zzso zzso zzso studies showed that one repeat is sufficient for zzso zzso tagging of zzso allowed detection of the protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso is both in the soluble fraction and in the inner zzso Interestingly, zzso is zzso identical zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso protein that is part of the host specificity zzso Since several zzso proteins are believed to be components of the types of III zzso protein zzso apparatus, allowing export of proteins essential for the interaction with the plant, the possible role of zzso and zzso in zzso is zzso
