Intermediate states play well-established roles in the folding and zzso reactions of individual zzso and protein zzso In contrast, the roles of transient structural zzso in zzso zzso zzso assembly processes and their potential for zzso are largely zzso The zzso protein is zzso but forms a compact core domain and two extended zzso zzso upon binding the signal recognition particle zzso zzso The zzso protein subsequently binds to the fully assembled zzso complex to form an intimate zzso interface with both zzso and the zzso and without significantly altering the structure of zzso We show, however, that the presence of zzso during zzso assembly dramatically alters the folding energy landscape to create a non-native folding zzso that leads to an zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex arises from the surprising ability of zzso to bind rapidly to an zzso assembly intermediate and to interfere with subsequent folding of one of the zzso binding zzso at the three-way zzso zzso An incorrect zzso order of assembly thus readily yields a non-native zzso zzso zzso We propose there may exist a general requirement to regulate the order of interaction in zzso zzso assembly reactions by spatial or zzso zzso of individual constituents in the zzso
