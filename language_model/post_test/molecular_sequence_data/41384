zzso factor A zzso functions as a DNA packaging factor in zzso zzso zzso also binds zzso to sites immediately upstream of zzso zzso but there are conflicting data regarding its role as a core component of the zzso zzso zzso We here demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso in zzso extracts as well as in a zzso in zzso zzso zzso The absolute requirement of zzso can be relaxed by conditions that allow DNA breathing, zzso low salt zzso or zzso zzso DNA zzso The situation is thus very similar to that described in nuclear zzso zzso zzso transcription, in which the free energy of zzso can circumvent the need for a subset of zzso zzso factors at specific zzso In agreement with these zzso we demonstrate that zzso has the capacity to induce negative zzso in DNA, and, using the recently developed zzso analog zzso zzso we find that zzso zzso significantly the DNA zzso Our findings differ from recent observations reporting that zzso is not a core component of the zzso zzso zzso Instead, our findings support a model in which zzso is absolutely required to recruit the zzso machinery during initiation of zzso
