In relation to the primary sequence and three-dimensional structure of rabbit muscle zzso zzso we have carried out a comparative sequence analysis of zzso from human, zzso zzso zzso potato and zzso zzso Based on sequence zzso a large region of the protein is shared by these zzso extending from zzso to the last zzso zzso zzso are equally distributed between the N and zzso zzso and occur primarily in buried zzso zzso analysis indicates that the two zzso within either zzso coli, potato or zzso are more closely related to each other than they are to other zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso muscle and brain zzso are more closely related to each other than to the liver zzso and the muscle zzso is evolving at the zzso zzso All zzso exhibit high conservation of active site and zzso zzso binding zzso Most zzso also exhibit high conservation of sugar binding zzso in the zzso storage zzso zzso and zzso binding site zzso are poorly zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso binding zzso are highly zzso in four of the seven zzso zzso Analysis of interacting pairs of zzso contact zzso indicates that they can be grouped into three relatively independent zzso One network contains zzso and zzso binding zzso and is poorly zzso in zzso zzso A second network contains zzso binding zzso and is highly zzso in zzso containing a zzso zzso binding zzso A third, zzso network contains zzso within the tower zzso and gate zzso A model for the evolution of zzso in zzso is proposed, suggesting that zzso zzso was an early control zzso The later creation of primarily distinct zzso binding sites for zzso control may have allowed the establishment of a separate zzso contact network for zzso zzso changes leading to zzso rather than zzso of zzso zzso
