The zzso is a very diverse group of zzso with zzso 14 extant families and more than 200 zzso zzso and often zzso marine, zzso and freshwater zzso While the composition of zzso is now better understood due to recent anatomical and zzso studies, the zzso relationships among families remain zzso zzso studies have provided conflicting views of relationships among zzso We generated a zzso of zzso based on zzso large zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene sequences zzso aligned data set zzso zzso zzso evidence and the presence of a unique pair of zzso genes zzso zzso + zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso gene support conclusions based on zzso data that zzso and zzso are not zzso certain anatomical similarities being due to zzso zzso The molecular zzso shows support for the zzso of the marine families zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as currently zzso The zzso data reveal that freshwater zzso evolved on three separate zzso however, all three recognized freshwater families zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso sequences provide valuable data for testing the zzso of zzso zzso families and relationships within families, but fail to provide strong evidence for resolving relationships among zzso It appears that the deepest zzso limits for resolving zzso relationships is less than about zzso zzso based on estimates of divergence derived from the fossil zzso
