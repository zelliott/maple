The gene zzso zzso a zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a zzso library in zzso in a zzso zzso coli strain and subsequently zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso active in zzso coli and zzso a broad range of zzso but no zzso zzso or larger zzso Northern zzso and primer extension analyses indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso unit starting 24 bases upstream of the zzso zzso start zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was shown to be similar to the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso identity in the deduced zzso acid zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso was constructed by zzso zzso Growth of the zzso strain in milk was significantly slower than that of the wild type, but the strains ultimately reached the same final cell zzso
