The gene zzso from zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which displays significant sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso inner zzso zzso zzso Steady state levels of the respective zzso are low during growth on zzso or zzso zzso on zzso and significantly induced when ethanol or zzso are the only carbon zzso The zzso zzso region zzso the identical carbon source dependence also on the expression of zzso when cloned zzso to the zzso coli zzso zzso An zzso directed against a zzso fusion protein recognizes a protein of zzso molecular mass in the zzso fraction from zzso In zzso translated zzso which lacks a zzso zzso binds to zzso in a zzso location in a standard in zzso import zzso zzso of the single copy gene in a zzso zzso strain yields no obvious zzso with any carbon zzso zzso zzso activities of intact zzso from a zzso deletion zzso are slightly lower than wild type, but are approximately alike in zzso zzso from zzso and control zzso Thus, the novel gene is zzso and likely to code for a minor zzso outer zzso zzso
