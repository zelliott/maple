The zzso genes zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is centrally responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso necessary to form functional zzso and zzso zzso zzso To help zzso the origins of the zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso gene from the zzso shark zzso zzso and characterized the entire zzso gene zzso The shark zzso protein consists of 520 zzso zzso is approximately 50% identical with zzso proteins from other zzso and contains the same three zzso identified in zzso zzso zzso critical for zzso function are zzso in the shark zzso In common with other zzso species, the shark zzso coding region lacks zzso and is closely linked in opposite orientation to the zzso zzso The zzso region is zzso zzso which is considerably larger than of zzso zzso zzso and is comparable to that of zzso This length is partially explained by the presence of several zzso and LINE zzso The ancestors of the zzso were apparently the first zzso in zzso to have zzso zzso and our results confirm that the zzso genes have been highly zzso during evolution both in terms of sequence and gene zzso
