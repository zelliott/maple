Previous studies of the zzso alpha chain gene have located promoter elements zzso to the start of the various V alpha zzso The only fully characterized zzso for the entire alpha chain gene zzso J and C zzso has been located approximately 3 zzso from the 3' end of C zzso We now report the existence of additional regulatory elements located in the zzso of several zzso V alpha genes zzso alpha 1, V alpha 3 and V alpha zzso In the case of V alpha 1, this element appears to be a promoter with zzso activity that is not T cell zzso Interestingly, upstream of the promoter in the zzso zzso an open reading frame has been found that codes for a small molecular weight protein zzso 60 zzso zzso that contains a zzso region and a zzso motif that has zzso to zzso beta (the zzso gene zzso A rabbit zzso made against this sequence has confirmed its existence by Western zzso and zzso Thus this V alpha 1 zzso promoter has the potential not only to induce the formation of a truncated V alpha 1 gene product, but also regulates the expression of a small molecular weight protein that may be involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of this promoter is regulated by changes in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the promoter is zzso in the sense direction and its activity is enhanced in the zzso zzso This result suggests that this promoter can act zzso to produce two very different gene zzso The zzso V alpha 1 promoter appears to be the first in the zzso zzso to induce potentially functional proteins in both zzso
