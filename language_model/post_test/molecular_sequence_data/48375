The zzso response factor zzso family are members of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso they are known to play an important role in plant adaptation to zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes have been studied in zzso rice, zzso and zzso however, there are few reports of zzso genes in zzso We identified 105 zzso zzso zzso zzso which were zzso into 12 groups zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso based on their sequence zzso and this new method of zzso for zzso genes was then further zzso A comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso genes was performed using a zzso zzso database, to analyze the zzso of zzso zzso identify other zzso motifs apart from the zzso domain, map zzso genes to the 10 zzso zzso and determine the zzso expression patterns of zzso zzso Gene zzso indicates that zzso genes were generated by tandem zzso zzso of zzso genes with zzso zzso zzso suggests lateral gene transfer between zzso zzso These results can contribute to our zzso of the evolution of the zzso gene zzso
