Purple acid zzso from sweet potatoes zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso and characterized using zzso zzso zzso laser zzso mass zzso analysis revealed a molecular mass of approximately 112 zzso The metal content was determined by X-ray zzso using zzso zzso In contrast to previous studies it is shown that zzso contains a zzso center in the active site as previously determined for the purple acid zzso from red kidney bean zzso Moreover, an alignment of the zzso acid sequences suggests that the zzso involved in zzso are identical in both plant zzso zzso functions as one of the zzso for the zzso zzso Low temperature zzso zzso of zzso show a signal near g zzso zzso characteristic for zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso charge transfer transition and the zzso signal are both very sensitive to changes in zzso The pH dependency strongly suggests the presence of an zzso group with a zzso of zzso arising from an zzso zzso coordinated to zzso zzso and zzso studies of zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso or zzso suggest that both zzso bind to zzso in the zzso center replacing the coordinated water or hydroxide zzso necessary for zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso corresponding to zzso and zzso in zzso probably interact in zzso
