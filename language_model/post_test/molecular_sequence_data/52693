zzso such as zzso found in fruit flies and zzso and zzso its zzso zzso zzso carry a zzso zzso and a zzso shadow domain zzso These proteins are required to form functional zzso silent zzso zzso and their zzso leads to zzso segregation zzso zzso have only been found in tandem in proteins containing the related zzso Most zzso proteins have been found to associate through the zzso and many of these zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso A crystal structure of the zzso zzso is presented zzso This reveals a novel zzso structure that is distinct from the previously reported zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso structure of the CD from the mouse modifier 1 protein zzso also known as zzso or zzso A prominent pit with a zzso base is generated at the zzso zzso and is commensurate with binding an extended zzso zzso zzso alignments based on this structure highlight differences between CDs and zzso that are superimposed on a common structural zzso The analyses also revealed a previously zzso zzso zzso sash around the surface of the CD zzso 

zzso through the zzso of zzso proteins results in the simultaneous formation of a putative zzso interaction pit, providing a potential means of targeting zzso proteins to particular zzso zzso
