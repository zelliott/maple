zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are activated by zzso in the zzso of zzso A conservation of zzso zzso sites in the zzso proteins zzso the expression of active toxins in transgenic plants to obtain protection from various zzso However, the engineering of zzso toxins has, thus far, failed to yield zzso resistance to zzso of zzso species representing common insect zzso zzso To improve the production of zzso zzso zzso we established a zzso consensus sequence by comparative analysis of three zzso genes and tested the stability and zzso sensitivity of truncated zzso toxins in zzso coli and in zzso In contrast to previous data, the boundaries of zzso zzso core toxin were mapped to zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the truncated zzso proteins showed that zzso zzso zzso may further shorten the zzso of zzso toxin to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and a zzso causing zzso acid replacement zzso abolished the zzso activity of zzso toxin to zzso zzso larvae, as well as its resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because no zzso toxin carrying a zzso processed zzso could be zzso expressed in bacteria, our data indicate that, in contrast to other zzso zzso an zzso zzso located between zzso acid positions 1 and zzso is required for stable production of zzso zzso zzso
