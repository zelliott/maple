By using zzso DNA technology the zzso and zzso domain of the human zzso zzso alpha chain zzso zzso zzso and of a zzso protein lacking zzso 18, 25, 44, 88, 92, zzso zzso zzso zzso and 209 zzso zzso zzso zzso by a chemically and zzso zzso zzso were zzso This leads to zzso expression of soluble zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso after zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso up to zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso alpha zzso cells in 24 h into the culture zzso zzso cell lines, expressing a large number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha of zzso zzso on their surface, shed a truncated form of the zzso protein of about 40 zzso into the culture zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso shedding of zzso zzso protein is strongly zzso This phenomenon might be the result of higher protein stability of the zzso zzso which may also explain the about 10 times higher surface expression of zzso zzso alpha in zzso zzso There are no significant differences in the zzso and zzso modification of zzso or zzso zzso proteins either in zzso zzso or zzso cells as zzso by zzso labeling zzso
