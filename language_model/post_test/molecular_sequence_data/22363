Most viral zzso zzso membrane fusion adopt a zzso native zzso and undergo major zzso changes during zzso We previously described a panel of compounds that specifically prevent fusion induced by zzso virus zzso most likely by interfering with zzso zzso of the zzso fusion zzso zzso To further zzso the basis of zzso and better understand the mechanism of zzso zzso fusion, we generated and characterized resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drug resistance were confirmed in transient zzso and in the context of zzso zzso and were in all cases located in the fusion zzso Several zzso emerged independently at F position zzso which is located in the zzso zzso repeat zzso zzso In zzso competition zzso all zzso zzso at zzso zzso revealed reduced affinity for binding to the zzso core complex compared to unmodified zzso Combining zzso at zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso F head region, which we had previously identified as zzso drug resistance, causes zzso retention of the zzso zzso The transport competence and activity of the zzso can be zzso however, by incubation at reduced temperature or in the presence of the zzso compounds, indicating that the F escape zzso have a reduced zzso stability and that the zzso stabilize a zzso zzso of the F zzso The data support the conclusion that zzso located in the head domain of the F zzso and the zzso region contribute jointly to controlling F zzso zzso
