Recently a novel gene containing a zzso zzso repeat that is expanded on HD zzso has been zzso This gene was shown to detect a single transcript of zzso zzso by zzso zzso We have however, previously identified three zzso which are part of the same gene that have been shown to detect two distinct transcripts of 10 zzso and one that is significantly zzso These different zzso species could be due to use of alternate zzso start sites, alternate zzso or selection of different zzso zzso We have identified zzso clones spanning the HD gene including two zzso and zzso that share identical protein coding sequences but differ in size and sequence of their 3' untranslated zzso zzso has zzso base pairs of additional sequence zzso to the previously published 3' end zzso zzso zzso has revealed that the larger zzso zzso zzso is the zzso transcript in human zzso zzso fragments unique to zzso detected only the larger zzso zzso analysis identified two different putative zzso sequences at position zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that the two observed zzso species originate from a single gene and that differential zzso leads to transcripts of different zzso The relative increased abundance of the larger transcript in human brain may provide some insights into the mechanism by which a widely expressed gene may exert tissue specific zzso
