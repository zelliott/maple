zzso right zzso zzso zzso is an inherited genetic zzso disease characterized by zzso replacement of the zzso and a predisposition to cardiac zzso and sudden zzso We evaluated the zzso gene zzso zzso as a candidate zzso gene because of its proximity to an zzso locus at position zzso and the connection of the zzso protein to the transitional junction at zzso zzso 

All 312 zzso zzso known to be expressed in human cardiac zzso and the complete 3' untranslated region were zzso in 38 zzso zzso Eight unique zzso zzso were detected in 7 families, including a prominent zzso zzso that showed complete segregation with the zzso zzso in 1 large zzso The zzso zzso maps within a highly zzso zzso fold zzso zzso located in the spring region of zzso Native gel zzso nuclear magnetic zzso intrinsic fluorescence, and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso exchange reduces the structural stability and increases the propensity for degradation of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso carriers was characterized by a history of sudden death (5 of 7 zzso progressive zzso dysfunction causing death or heart transplantation (8 of 14 zzso frequent zzso disease (11 of zzso and incomplete zzso zzso 

Our data provide evidence that zzso zzso can cause zzso a finding that further expands the origin of the disease beyond zzso zzso zzso impairment of the zzso spring is a likely cause of zzso and constitutes a novel mechanism underlying zzso zzso and sudden cardiac zzso
