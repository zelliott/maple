The fourth component of the complement system, zzso is zzso by two highly zzso zzso genes expressing the two zzso zzso and zzso A gene size zzso zzso zzso or 16 zzso has been described which depends on the presence or absence of a zzso zzso in zzso 9 of the C4 zzso By sequencing a zzso zzso clone from a human zzso library containing the long zzso 9 as well as zzso DNA containing the short zzso the DNA sequences of both zzso were zzso The long and short zzso have lengths of zzso zzso and 415 zzso zzso The sequence of the short zzso is almost identical zzso to the corresponding parts of the long zzso At position 282 of the short zzso a zzso zzso is present in the long zzso which has all characteristics of a full-length zzso zzso The zzso DNA is flanked by two zzso target site zzso The orientation of the zzso sequence is opposite to that of the C4 coding zzso Long terminal repeats zzso of zzso zzso were found at both ends of the zzso A zzso box and an zzso zzso core as well as a zzso signal are present in the zzso A zzso primer binding site for zzso zzso was zzso The strongest sequence zzso were found in comparison to human zzso zzso zzso between zzso for zzso pol and zzso zzso However, a search for open reading frames in these regions indicated the presence of multiple stop zzso in all three reading zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
