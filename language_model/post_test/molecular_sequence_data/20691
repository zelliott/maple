zzso and zzso are structurally related natural zzso of zzso zzso with promising zzso zzso The total synthesis of these zzso agents has enabled the production of structural zzso which are useful to explore the biological significance of features contained in the parent zzso Here, the zzso activity of zzso zzso and 10 key structural zzso were tested in side-by-side zzso zzso to further characterize their zzso activity against zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 5 zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso 1) and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in which key zzso predicted for inhibitor contact with zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were introduced into zzso and zzso using zzso zzso The data confirm the importance of the zzso and zzso for general zzso and further demonstrate the importance of a predicted zzso interaction with a unique zzso zzso in the zzso loop of zzso The data also indicate that additional features beyond the zzso zzso contribute to zzso potency and zzso zzso a zzso of zzso lacking the entire zzso zzso demonstrated marked potency and selectivity for zzso while having substantially reduced and similar activity against zzso and zzso zzso that have greatly increased sensitivity to both zzso and zzso This suggests that other features zzso the zzso also contribute to zzso zzso When considered together with previous data, these studies suggest that, despite the high structural conservation of the zzso site in zzso zzso and zzso the development of highly selective zzso zzso should be zzso
