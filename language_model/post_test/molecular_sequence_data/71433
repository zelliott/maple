To determine the origin and clinical relevance of selected strains of zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome zzso virus zzso 

38 pigs without zzso for zzso 

A seemingly uncommon restriction zzso zzso site in a commercially available vaccine strain of attenuated zzso was tested for its stability and prevalence under defined zzso zzso field strains of zzso with or without the zzso marker, were subsequently tested in pigs for zzso and for their ability to replicate competitively in pigs simultaneously given the zzso 

Under experimental conditions, the zzso marker was stable during long-term infection of zzso It was not detected in any of the 25 field strains of zzso that were isolated before use of the vaccine or 21 of 25 field strains that were isolated after use of the vaccine but that, on the basis of previous testing, were believed unrelated to the vaccine zzso zzso it was detected in 24 of 25 field strains that were isolated after use of the vaccine and that, on the basis of previous testing, were believed to be zzso descendants of the vaccine zzso zzso zzso strains caused more pronounced zzso changes than did the vaccine strain alone, and they predominated during replication in pigs also given the vaccine zzso 

In some zzso zzso the vaccine strain may have persisted and zzso to a less attenuated zzso 

The potential for persistence and zzso of specific strains of virus should be an important consideration when designing vaccination programs involving attenuated zzso
