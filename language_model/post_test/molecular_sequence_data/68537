An zzso that zzso the conversion of big zzso to zzso designated as zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso from the membrane fraction of zzso zzso zzso and was zzso by sequential zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peanut zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the membrane fraction zzso was zzso The zzso zzso had a very narrow neutral pH optimum and was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and low zzso of some zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso of zzso was most effective for the restoration of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed the highest affinity for big zzso among big zzso zzso and the zzso for big zzso and the corresponding zzso for zzso formation were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence from zzso to zzso and zzso was essential for recognition by this zzso while the presence of the zzso loop structure reduced the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed an zzso point of zzso The molecular mass was estimated to be 131 zzso by zzso density zzso zzso and a value of 120 zzso was obtained by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso indicating that zzso zzso is a zzso zzso
