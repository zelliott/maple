To guide the design of potential plant zzso zzso synthetic zzso of naturally occurring zzso gene products were zzso Five zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso acid zzso and one zzso acid zzso zzso zzso sequences were zzso zzso and tested with in zzso zzso Positive charges on the zzso side of the zzso were shown to be essential for zzso activity, yet the number of positive charges could be varied with little or no change in zzso The size could be reduced to 18 zzso zzso but at 17 zzso acids a significant reduction in activity was zzso zzso 5, 6, and 12 peptides were zzso to the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but did not inhibit the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but inhibited the growth of the bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The minimal zzso zzso of the active zzso peptides were similar to those of the naturally occurring control zzso zzso II and zzso zzso The significant differential in sensitivity between the microbes and plant cells indicated that the active zzso peptides are potentially useful models for designing plant zzso zzso
