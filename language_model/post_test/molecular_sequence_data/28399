The fourth gene from the human zzso gene family of zzso zzso zzso has been isolated and partially characterized by DNA zzso The zzso which we name zzso codes for human zzso C, and has the same organization as the zzso gene for zzso zzso and the zzso gene for zzso zzso Southern analysis of zzso I zzso zzso from 32 independent zzso cell hybrid clones zzso to a probe from zzso demonstrated that all members of the zzso gene family segregate with human zzso zzso These results indicate that the genes for zzso zzso and zzso C are members of a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso
