The zzso zzso protein 2 zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso of many drugs and drug zzso and has been reported to account for dramatic zzso differences in the aspects of zzso In the present study, an absolute zzso method was developed to zzso measure zzso using zzso for detection of a selective zzso zzso A unique zzso zzso zzso was identified by conducting zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso samples of zzso following zzso with zzso The lower limit of zzso was established to be zzso with the zzso of the standard curve spanned to zzso Both the accuracy zzso zzso and the precision zzso of zzso of the method were below zzso Using this method, we successfully determined the absolute amount of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso cells as well as the zzso levels of canine zzso protein in zzso zzso Our findings also demonstrate that the sensitivity of this method exceeds the sensitivity of zzso zzso which was not able to detect the zzso levels of canine zzso in zzso zzso The method could be directly zzso to many current research needs related to zzso zzso
