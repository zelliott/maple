We conducted laboratory experiments to verify molecular techniques of avian malaria zzso detection distinguishing between an infected zzso zzso on zzso wall) and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in parallel with zzso identification from individual zzso mosquitoes prior to application to field survey for avian zzso Domestic zzso infected with zzso zzso was exposed to a zzso and zzso zzso species, Aedes aegypti and zzso zzso zzso respectively, to compare the time course of zzso chain reaction zzso detection for zzso between competent and zzso zzso DNA of the domestic zzso was zzso for at least 3 days after blood zzso The zzso detection of zzso zzso from the abdomen and zzso of zzso aegypti corresponded to the microscopic observation of zzso and zzso zzso this zzso method was considered useful as one of the criteria to assess zzso stages of zzso zzso in zzso species collected in the zzso We applied the same zzso method to 21 zzso zzso zzso mosquitoes collected in zzso Park in urban Tokyo, zzso Of 15 blood meals of zzso zzso successfully identified, zzso were zzso zzso were zzso zzso DNA was amplified from the abdomen of three zzso zzso specimens having an avian blood meal from the Great zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Jungle Crow zzso zzso This is the first field study on zzso habits of zzso zzso in relation to the potential role as a zzso for avian malaria zzso transmitted in the Japanese wild bird zzso
