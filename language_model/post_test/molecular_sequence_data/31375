zzso sequence analysis of the complimentary zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analysis have shown that zzso is equivalent to zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso in the zzso as well as zzso plasma zzso zzso in the zzso In view of its widespread presence in various species, a specific zzso was established to zzso the tissue distribution of this zzso zzso zzso is present in almost all organ zzso zzso including zzso zzso serum, liver, zzso seminal zzso and zzso zzso zzso generated using zzso prepared from these zzso were parallel to those obtained using zzso rat zzso and crude zzso zzso culture zzso zzso zzso was also zzso in these organ extracts by zzso Studies on the tissue distribution of zzso zzso using zzso revealed that the concentration of zzso in the zzso of adult rats was 6- and zzso higher than that in the serum and zzso respectively and is 50- to zzso higher in the liver, zzso zzso brain, zzso zzso seminal zzso and zzso A study of the distribution of zzso in various compartments of the zzso indicated its concentration in the zzso zzso was almost zzso higher than that in the corpus and zzso zzso After zzso the zzso of zzso in the zzso prostate and seminal zzso increased as much as zzso and zzso and peaked at day 4 after surgery, zzso daily injection of zzso zzso beginning at day 3 after zzso reduced the zzso of zzso and restored them to a normal zzso A different pattern was noted in the zzso after zzso the concentration of zzso in the zzso zzso decreased with time; however, daily injection of zzso beginning at day 3 increased the zzso zzso zzso concentration and restored it to a normal zzso The concentration of zzso was not altered in the corpus or zzso zzso after zzso and/or zzso zzso Also, the serum and liver zzso levels did not change with time after zzso These observations suggest that zzso will be a valuable marker to monitor the diverse effects of zzso withdrawal in the male zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may be a zzso protein in view of its broad tissue distribution and association with numerous zzso and pathological zzso
