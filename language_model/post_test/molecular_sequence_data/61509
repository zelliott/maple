A rapid and zzso method for the synthesis of zzso of zzso A is zzso The method links the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso in zzso to generate a variety of zzso zzso from chemically zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso were zzso as zzso zzso providing an abundant source of pure active zzso for the zzso The synthesis of five novel zzso derivatives is reported and the method is shown to be robust and tolerant of a number of different zzso acid structures, which indicates that the procedure should be widely zzso
