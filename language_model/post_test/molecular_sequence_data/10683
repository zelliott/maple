A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression system zzso in zzso coli has been constructed that can be used to study the involvement of factors that affect zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso sequence is placed in the coding region of zzso zzso which is expressed from a zzso translation zzso zzso The size and the zzso sequences of the 3' zzso fragments were determined and the efficiencies of different zzso zzso were measured by quantitative primer zzso It is shown that one of the zzso zzso zzso can be used as an indicator for zzso that read through or terminate at a stop zzso upstream of the zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso of the stop zzso in an zzso zzso gives a full length zzso zzso zzso at the stop zzso upstream of the zzso sequence gives a shortened termination zzso However, the zzso zzso that should arise as a result of the zzso does not give rise to any zzso corresponding truncated zzso Besides studies on translating zzso the zzso system can be used to isolate zzso strains that are changed in zzso activity either from internal base zzso or changed interacting host zzso
