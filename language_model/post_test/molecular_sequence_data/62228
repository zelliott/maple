The zzso coli zzso protein recognizes the 11 zzso zzso sites in the zzso region of the zzso and prevents replication zzso within one cell zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain with zzso DNA revealed the zzso recognition zzso however, the mechanism of discrimination between the zzso and fully zzso states has remained zzso In the present study, we performed zzso analyses of zzso zzso sequences with the minimal zzso domain of zzso zzso and found that zzso specifically binds to zzso DNA containing a sequence with a mismatched zzso base pair zzso as efficiently as the normal zzso zzso zzso We determined the crystal structures of zzso zzso with the mismatched and normal zzso zzso at zzso and zzso A resolutions, respectively, and found that the mismatched zzso base pair and the normal zzso base pair are recognized by zzso in a similar zzso Furthermore, in both crystal structures, an electron density is present near the zzso zzso which is only zzso in the fully zzso zzso This electron density, which may be due to a water zzso or a metal zzso can exist in the zzso state, but not in the fully zzso state, because of zzso clash with the additional zzso zzso
