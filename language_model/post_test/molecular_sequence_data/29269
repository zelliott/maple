zzso class switch zzso zzso occurs by an zzso zzso process between switch zzso regions in B zzso To facilitate the study of zzso we derived a new B cell line, zzso which is uniquely capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso at its zzso zzso The zzso cell line was used in combination with zzso zzso S zzso in transient zzso zzso to test for the presence of zzso switching zzso The zzso cell line supports zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso on S zzso In contrast, normal zzso B cells activated with zzso and zzso are capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that this S zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a marker to identify existing B cell lines as possible candidates for supporting zzso The zzso and zzso cell lines were identified as AID positive and, following zzso with zzso and other zzso were found to zzso support zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso These studies provide evidence for two new switching activities for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are distinct from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha switching activities previously zzso AID is expressed in all the B cell lines capable of zzso but cannot account for the zzso specificity defined by the S zzso zzso These results are consistent with a model in which zzso switching factors are either zzso zzso or DNA binding proteins with sequence specificity for S zzso
