zzso zzso is a zzso zzso pathogen that causes black spot disease on zzso plants including economically important zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify zzso genes expressed during infection of zzso In order to identify candidate genes involved in zzso we employed suppression zzso zzso zzso between zzso isolated from zzso zzso spores incubated in water and on the leaf surface of the zzso zzso zzso Two populations of zzso were created from total zzso extracted after zzso when approximately zzso of the spores had zzso either on the leaf surface or in zzso Following zzso expression of clones was examined using zzso zzso and virtual Northern zzso 47 zzso clones zzso expressed between zzso infected zzso leaves and spore zzso in water were selected for zzso zzso percent zzso of the zzso had significant zzso to zzso sequences from databases zzso including available zzso zzso while zzso (11) had no zzso to sequences in the zzso All 36 genes had significant matches with genes of zzso origin, while 11 genes did not have significant hits in the databases zzso Five sequences were expressed on the plant leaf surface but not during spore zzso in water according to virtual Northern zzso These five zzso were predicted to zzso a cyanide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso and one zzso zzso was used to examine the expression of these five genes during infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso growth in zzso rich media, and infection of zzso zzso Four of these genes are expressed in the zzso rich zzso while the unknown gene zzso was only expressed during plant zzso The results of this study provide the first insight into genes expressed during zzso zzso infection of zzso species that may be involved in zzso zzso
