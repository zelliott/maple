A novel class of zzso zzso channels, the zzso family, has been found on several types of zzso These channels, acting in concert with the zzso zzso zzso regulate the pH of the zzso interior, which is critical for zzso zzso Here we describe the molecular cloning of zzso a zzso zzso from both human and zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso is expressed abundantly in brain and zzso whereas the other members of this family zzso zzso and zzso are expressed only at low levels in these zzso zzso analysis of zzso in rat brain, using an zzso zzso revealed a high level of expression in the zzso zzso zzso formation, the amygdala, the zzso and the zzso zzso microscopic analysis of zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated a striking association between zzso and large zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, very low zzso labeling was found in zzso or associated with small synaptic zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso is zzso with heavy membrane zzso containing zzso rather than the zzso containing zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may be involved in the maintenance of low internal pH in zzso and in the maturation of zzso and the zzso of functional zzso
