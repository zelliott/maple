We describe the methodology and application of the zzso chain reaction to detect zzso zzso as a marker for zzso zzso The technique is highly sensitive enabling the routine detection of 1 zzso cell in zzso or zzso normal cells and is therefore the most sensitive method available for detecting minimal residual zzso Analysis of zzso or blood from 80 patients after bone zzso transplantation for zzso shows that residual leukemia is often zzso for several months but that most subsequently become zzso zzso Patients who relapsed were all zzso positive before the detection of Philadelphia positive zzso in bone zzso zzso
