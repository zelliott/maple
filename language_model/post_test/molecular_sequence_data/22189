To understand the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we isolated this gene from a whole body zzso library and found two heat shock factor elements at the zzso The transformed bacteria containing zzso zzso showed zzso against heat shock (54 degrees zzso with different ranges of zzso The zzso zzso gene is comprised of 174 zzso acid zzso and shows similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mexican zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dogfish zzso zzso zzso but shows more similarity in the zzso region that contains an zzso zzso zzso motifs such as an zzso site zzso zzso and a zzso zzso II zzso site were found in zzso zzso The zzso structure of the zzso zzso gene did not contain zzso To characterize the zzso characteristics of the zzso zzso zzso we expressed zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso the soluble protein via zzso zzso zzso To analyze the gene expression of zzso zzso against environmental stresses zzso water temperature and zzso we performed a zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso On exposure to different zzso significant change in the expression of zzso zzso was not zzso However, upon heat shock (30 degrees zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly increased, but in the case of cold shock (4 or 10 degrees zzso expression was likely zzso These findings provide a better understanding of cellular protection mechanisms against environmental stress such as heat zzso
