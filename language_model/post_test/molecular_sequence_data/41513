zzso is a member of zzso zzso family 32 zzso degrading zzso of the zzso type with an zzso mode and is an important class of industrial zzso In the present study, we report the first crystal structure of an zzso zzso from zzso zzso at zzso zzso It was solved by molecular replacement with the structure of zzso as search zzso The zzso structure presents a zzso arrangement common to other zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain with four zzso and a zzso zzso domain organized in two zzso with five zzso The structural analysis and comparison with other zzso zzso reveal the presence of an extra pocket in the zzso zzso site, formed by two zzso and the zzso motif zzso This cavity would explain the zzso of the zzso the critical role of zzso and particularly the zzso at the third unit of the zzso zzso Crystal structure at zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso experimental zzso data and molecular zzso studies support these zzso
