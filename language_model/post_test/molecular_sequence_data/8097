An open reading frame zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso proteins is adjacent to the zzso gene on the left arm of zzso II in zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso is basic zzso zzso contains 232 zzso acids zzso zzso and has zzso zzso acid sequence identity to zzso coli zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso to the zzso zzso showed specific zzso with a 22,000 Mr zzso zzso that zzso with the large zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso density zzso The levels of the zzso zzso and protein varied in response to carbon zzso In zzso zzso cells lacking zzso zzso the zzso zzso accumulated at normal levels, but the protein was barely zzso indicating zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Gene disruption experiments demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso protein in zzso
