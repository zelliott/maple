zzso rabbit zzso zzso against peptides corresponding to the highly zzso protein zzso zzso 2A and X zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to investigate the cellular and zzso distribution of zzso and zzso as well as their zzso zzso zzso of rat tissue extracts revealed a widespread distribution of these zzso but particularly high levels of zzso and zzso in brain and zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso analyses of rat brain sections demonstrated that zzso is predominantly localized to the nucleus, whereas zzso is largely zzso Treatment of nuclear extracts with zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso to a zzso zzso directed against the zzso no change in zzso zzso was observed using an zzso against an internal zzso zzso treatment of brain and liver zzso and nuclear extracts did not change the molecular mass or the zzso point of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso from zzso cell extracts incubated with the zzso donor zzso Thus the increase in zzso probably results from removal of a zzso group from zzso as has been shown previously for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso is a predominantly nuclear zzso and is zzso at its zzso
