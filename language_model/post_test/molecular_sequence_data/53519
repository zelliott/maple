Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso of zzso zzso of zzso chilled zzso zzso packs of meat zzso with these strains developed gas bubbles and pack zzso within 14 d storage at 2 degrees zzso The two main gases responsible for pack zzso were carbon dioxide and zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid and zzso zzso were the major volatile compounds produced by the strains in the artificially zzso zzso The unknown strains were zzso zzso rods producing elliptical zzso spores during the zzso growth zzso At pH zzso they grew from zzso to 26 degrees C, and their optimum growth temperature was zzso degrees zzso At 20 degrees C, the pH range for growth was zzso and the optimum pH for growth was zzso In zzso extract zzso the organisms grew little or not at all in the absence of zzso zzso Both strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso products formed in zzso zzso extract zzso starch broth were ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso carbon dioxide and zzso The zzso contents of the DNA of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the strains belong to cluster I of the zzso zzso zzso Collins et zzso zzso The new strains differed from the zzso related zzso in cellular fatty acid zzso soluble protein profiles and zzso zzso On the basis of zzso analysis and zzso and zzso zzso the strains were assigned to a new species for which the name zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is designated as the type zzso
