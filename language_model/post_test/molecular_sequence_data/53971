zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which has emerged as an important cause of epidemic and endemic zzso zzso as well as food-borne outbreaks have occurred, including a large number of zzso cases associated with zzso imported from zzso zzso markers exist for tracing the epidemiology of many of the bacterial pathogens associated with zzso or food-borne zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso However, there are currently no molecular markers available for zzso zzso The intervening transcribed zzso zzso regions between the small- and zzso zzso genes demonstrate much greater sequence zzso than the zzso zzso sequence itself and have been useful for the molecular typing of other zzso Thus, zzso zzso might allow the identification of different zzso of zzso zzso In order to determine the degree of zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso the zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso from a variety of sources, including zzso cases, cases from Guatemala, and pooled and individual zzso from Peru, were zzso The zzso sequences of all five zzso zzso were zzso consistent with their origin from a single zzso In contrast, one of the two Guatemala zzso and two Peruvian zzso contained multiple zzso zzso These multiple sequences could represent multiple clones from a single clinical source or, more zzso zzso of the zzso region within the zzso of a single zzso
