In this study, a mouse zzso region is identified that zzso DNA zzso and yields circular DNA in brain during zzso External zzso inverse zzso chain reaction on circular DNA extracted from late embryonic brain tissue repeatedly detected DNA of this region containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed this region underwent zzso accompanied with deletion of intervening zzso including the zzso zzso This region was mapped by zzso in zzso zzso to C1 on mouse zzso 16, where no gene and no zzso DNA zzso had been zzso DNA sequence in the region has zzso zzso to an zzso region on human zzso zzso These observations demonstrated zzso DNA zzso yielding zzso deletions in brain during zzso
