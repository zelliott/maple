In this study, we evaluated distinct zzso zzso to determine class II restriction of the production of zzso zzso in zzso transplant zzso 

Data from 217 zzso transplant patients who received an zzso zzso graft were analyzed with regard to zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA typing of class II zzso zzso was performed by zzso chain zzso zzso Patients who had one of the following eight zzso zzso were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso samples were screened zzso with the standard zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso were used as a target for the detection of zzso zzso zzso The following zzso zzso acid positions zzso zzso that are responsible for the induction of an zzso response were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The definition of the zzso zzso of zzso response was based on a zzso II restriction zzso designed for this zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso zzso peptides was based on an zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso had a trend toward a positive correlation with the production of zzso class zzso zzso against the zzso shared zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso had higher trend toward a positive correlation with the production of zzso against the zzso private zzso zzso In 42 patients with the zzso zzso 11 zzso patients produced zzso zzso against the zzso group of zzso Moreover, in these patients, spreading of the zzso against zzso zzso zzso was zzso Many of these other zzso zzso did not belong to zzso group but had newly defined shared zzso with this zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso based on an zzso database, revealed differences in the zzso strength zzso to the zzso zzso zzso I and zzso for a specific zzso zzso in the 42 patients zzso and zzso 

The data presented in this paper suggest that the zzso class II zzso and the type of the bound zzso may influence the zzso and cellular zzso The zzso of these zzso could be predicted with an zzso database zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the future, production of synthetic zzso zzso on the basis of these predictions, could be used for induction of zzso zzso and/or zzso In the short term, zzso on the basis of our approach, could be tested for influence on graft survival and zzso in current high-quality data zzso
