The Met zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso play important roles in normal development and in tumor growth and zzso zzso signaling requires zzso from an inactive zzso precursor into an active zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso alone binds Met, and report its crystal structure in complex with the zzso and zzso domain of the Met zzso The Met zzso domain folds into a zzso zzso where the bottom face of zzso 2 and 3 binds to the zzso zzso zzso site zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the area that constitutes the active site region in related zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso beta binding to zzso Key binding zzso in this interface undergo zzso zzso upon maturation and explain the necessity of zzso zzso for proper zzso zzso A zzso zzso interface between two zzso zzso brings two zzso zzso complexes together, suggesting a possible mechanism of Met zzso zzso and zzso by zzso
