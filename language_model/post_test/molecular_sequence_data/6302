To develop the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model system for the study of protein zzso we have characterized a zzso acid zzso zzso from this zzso zzso can be induced zzso by zzso for zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso from a zzso extract by zzso zzso We selected zzso that lacked zzso zzso activity and the gene zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso library of zzso DNA by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso with zzso to zzso acid zzso from other zzso zzso The sequence contains a zzso zzso signal sequence and six potential zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was used to show that zzso transits the zzso zzso zzso in less than 5 zzso
