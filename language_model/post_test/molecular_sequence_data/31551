In the zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein was previously reported to participate in the zzso feedback loop controlling the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso binds directly and tightly to the zzso core of zzso zzso zzso This binding occurs through a motif that is present exclusively in zzso proteins from zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that the ability of zzso to interact with zzso is not required for its general function and for its role in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, this interaction appears to be exclusively required for the zzso mechanism controlling the zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest a plausible model for the evolutionary appearance of a zzso binding motif in zzso
