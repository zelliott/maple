In order to have a proper zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso may require a zzso zzso that provides a signal for assembly and organization of zzso zzso and proteins within the compartment of zzso This study reports the presence of a zzso zzso zzso which can be engaged in such zzso function, located on the zzso membrane of human zzso A human melanoma zzso expression library in zzso zzso II was screened with a rabbit zzso zzso raised against human zzso isolated from cultured human melanoma cells, SK zzso zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso 90 zzso was identified through this zzso A partial sequencing of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of this clone zzso zzso and predicted zzso acids showed more than zzso zzso with dog zzso a previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A fusion protein of this zzso with zzso expressed in zzso coli revealed both the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Upon zzso the zzso zzso zzso revealed the positive zzso with both normal and zzso human zzso showing a much higher expression of zzso zzso than zzso human zzso The laser scanning zzso zzso using an zzso against a human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso confirmed the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso and zzso
