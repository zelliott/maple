Clearly, the human zzso includes a group of genes closely related to but distinct from the zzso class I genes zzso the zzso zzso and -C major transplantation zzso These zzso class I zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso are on the short arm of zzso 6 and part of the zzso class I gene zzso Although the human zzso zzso and zzso genes have features in common with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso little zzso zzso their relationship to the zzso zzso and zzso genes remains zzso It has been suggested that the zzso zzso class I molecules function as zzso for zzso T zzso The speculation is supported by the recent reports of a zzso zzso restricted zzso T cell zzso and recognition of a zzso zzso by gamma delta T cell zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins suggest that each protein is likely to fold zzso into a structure very similar to zzso and has a capability of presenting a bound zzso at the cell zzso In light of the possible role of bound zzso in the expression of a class I zzso at the cell surface, it is interesting to note that the zzso and zzso zzso even in association with beta zzso could not be detected at the cell surface of a zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso was found at the surface of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are less similar in sequence to zzso than is zzso One explanation would be that the zzso and zzso molecules have a zzso such that they are no longer able to bind zzso If the zzso zzso does function to present zzso to T zzso there are features unique to zzso that should impact on its ability to perform this zzso Both the analysis of zzso zzso and protein in zzso indicate that zzso unlike zzso zzso zzso is relatively zzso Since zzso zzso is thought to increase the number of different peptides that these molecules can zzso zzso is likely to be able to bind a relatively limited variety of zzso zzso also differs from zzso zzso and -C in that it seems to only be expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
