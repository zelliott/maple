The sequence of a zzso region of the human zzso zzso gene encompassing the deletion prone zzso 7 (110 zzso and the much shorter zzso 8 zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso sequences account for approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences occur in zzso 7 with significantly higher frequency than would be expected statistically while zzso sequences are zzso zzso 7 also contains numerous zzso zzso repeats, a diverse range of medium zzso repeats of unknown origin, and a sequence derived from a zzso zzso By contrast, the shorter zzso 8 contains no zzso zzso zzso Dating of the zzso and zzso sequences suggests that zzso 7 has approximately doubled in size within the past 130 million years, and comparison with the corresponding zzso from the zzso zzso zzso suggests that the zzso has expanded some zzso over a period of 400 million zzso The possible contribution of the zzso elements to the instability of zzso 7 is zzso
