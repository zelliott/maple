zzso the structure, zzso and stability of collagen is complex because of its length and variations in the zzso acid zzso sequence zzso It is well known that the basic constituent of the collagen zzso is the zzso repeating sequence of the form zzso On the basis of previous models and with the frequency of occurrence of the zzso the zzso (where zzso is the number of zzso sequence replicate has been chosen as the model for the most stable form of the zzso zzso With a view to understand the role of sequence length (or the number of zzso on the stability of zzso molecular dynamics simulations have been carried out by varying the number of zzso units on the model zzso zzso The results reveal that five triplets are required to form the stable triple zzso Further analysis shows that the zzso structural rigidity of the zzso acid zzso hydrogen zzso and water structure around the three chains of the triple zzso play the dominant roles on its structure, zzso and zzso
