The solution structure of the zzso protein zzso from the human zzso leukemia virus type one zzso a zzso that causes zzso leukemia and zzso zzso in humans, has been determined by zzso zzso The protein consists of independent N and zzso zzso connected by a flexible zzso The zzso are structurally similar to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, of the human zzso virus type one zzso and zzso infectious anemia virus zzso zzso zzso although several important differences zzso In particular, zzso zzso near the major zzso region are partially buried in zzso CA, which is zzso in solution, whereas analogous zzso in zzso and zzso CA project from the zzso domain and promote zzso These differences in the structure and zzso state of the proteins appear to be related to, and possibly controlled by, the zzso state of zzso zzso zzso which are reduced in zzso CA but form a zzso bond in the zzso and zzso CA crystal zzso The results are consistent with an zzso zzso assembly zzso in which CA zzso or maturation is triggered by zzso zzso zzso formation as the budding virus enters the zzso environment of the zzso
