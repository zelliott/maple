Among the genes that have recently been zzso to be essential for plant zzso development a large number encodes zzso proteins suggesting that zzso is linked to zzso localized zzso However, nuclear zzso zzso proteins are zzso as precursors in the zzso and subsequently have to be transported across the zzso envelopes by a complex import zzso We supposed that deletion of components of this machinery should allow a more general assessment of the role of zzso in zzso since it will not only affect single proteins but instead inhibit the zzso of most zzso zzso Here we have characterized three zzso zzso zzso lacking core components of the zzso complex, the protein zzso in the outer zzso envelope zzso which indeed show zzso lethal zzso zzso zzso development in the zzso zzso lacking the pore forming component of the zzso was arrested extremely early at the zzso zzso In contrast, despite the complete or almost complete lack of the import receptors zzso and zzso zzso development in the a zzso and zzso zzso proceeded slowly and was arrested later at the transition to the zzso and the heart stage, zzso These data demonstrate a strict dependence of cell division and zzso development on functional zzso as well as specific functions of zzso at different stages of zzso In addition, our analysis suggest that not all components of the zzso are equally essential for zzso protein import in zzso
