zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso specified the resistance to both organic and zzso zzso DNA sequence of this zzso resistant zzso zzso was zzso The zzso sequence includes six open reading frames zzso five of which were identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in order by analysis of deletion zzso and by comparison with the DNA and zzso acid zzso sequences of previously zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a less identity than the other zzso genes with those from other zzso resistance zzso The remaining zzso named zzso located between zzso and zzso had no significant zzso with the published zzso genes and seemed to be a new gene which may involve in zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso analyses of the zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso as well as the zzso were under the control of zzso which could activate not only by zzso zzso but also by zzso
