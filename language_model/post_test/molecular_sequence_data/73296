zzso variation at the zzso variable number of tandem repeat zzso zzso which includes both zzso and zzso zzso was examined in a wide sample of zzso A total of 22 zzso were zzso The distribution of zzso size variation implicated mechanisms involving both zzso and zzso zzso This was confirmed by direct sequences of two zzso zzso between the two zzso involved repeat number variation of zzso motifs and a complex event involving the zzso zzso but point zzso were not zzso
