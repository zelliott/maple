As a major agent of rapid zzso zzso zzso has played an important role in plant zzso When zzso involves species that exhibit zzso zzso this zzso barrier to zzso must be overcome or lost to allow zzso How zzso a normally dominant zzso is lost in nascent hybrids is not known, zzso Here we demonstrate that hybrid zzso can result from zzso changes in expression of the zzso genes that determine specificity in the zzso zzso We analyzed loss of zzso in synthetic hybrids produced by crossing zzso and zzso species in each of two zzso zzso We show that zzso is lost in the zzso of zzso zzso hybrids and their zzso derivatives and in the zzso of zzso zzso hybrids and their zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso gene transcripts as detected in zzso hybrids and suppression of the zzso zzso protein gene as observed in zzso hybrids are two zzso mechanisms by which zzso might break down upon zzso zzso to generate zzso hybrids in zzso
