For comprehensive analysis of genes expressed in a model zzso zzso zzso a total of zzso zzso end expressed sequence tags zzso were accumulated from zzso and zzso zzso libraries constructed from young (2 weeks old) zzso The zzso sequences were clustered into zzso zzso zzso zzso search against public zzso protein database indicated that zzso groups showed similarity to genes of known function, zzso groups to hypothetical zzso and zzso were novel zzso zzso of 5 zzso genes which have been reported in other zzso species were contained in the collected zzso suggesting that the zzso source generated in this study will become a useful tool for identification of genes related to zzso biological zzso The sequence data of individual zzso are available at the web zzso zzso
