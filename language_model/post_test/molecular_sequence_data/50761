To gain some insight into the role played by certain protein zzso in the import of zzso zzso zzso in isolated zzso three protein zzso were constructed by using the zzso zzso which contains the zzso sequence zzso for the mature form of this zzso Two zzso proteins in which zzso was zzso with either zzso or zzso and another protein lacking the nine zzso zzso acids were all zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was made among the newly zzso zzso proteins and the newly zzso wild type zzso zzso with respect to their capability to enter zzso All the zzso proteins proved to be able to enter zzso even though with a lower efficiency than the wild type zzso Interestingly the zzso zzso zzso proved to inhibit import of both wild type zzso and zzso zzso whereas import of zzso zzso was found to be insensitive to zzso thus showing that zzso is the unique zzso group involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso is shown to involve certain protein zzso present in the mature zzso two of them being the zzso and the zzso zzso
