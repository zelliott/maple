zzso interactions can be guided by contacts between surface zzso within zzso We therefore investigated the hypothesis that novel zzso interactions could be created using a strategy of zzso zzso in which the zzso acid sequence of a biologically active, flexible loop on one protein is used to replace a surface loop present on an unrelated zzso To test this hypothesis we replaced a surface loop within an zzso growth factor module with the zzso region of a zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso from zzso an zzso selected to bind the beta zzso with zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso Hu, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was grafted into the zzso growth zzso module of human zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso of zzso bound to the zzso zzso alpha zzso beta 3 with zzso zzso retained full zzso activity, and was zzso normally by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the novel zzso of zzso to zzso alpha zzso beta 3 was dependent on the presence of zzso zzso and was inhibited by an zzso zzso demonstrating that, like the donor zzso the novel zzso binds specifically to the zzso site of the zzso These findings suggest that surface zzso within protein zzso can, at least in some cases, be interchangeable and that zzso display can be combined with loop zzso to direct zzso at high zzso to selected zzso In principle, these targets could include not only other proteins but also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or even zzso markers of specific cell types, zzso or zzso
