We recently reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a large family of dogs that is not caused by zzso in the zzso locus zzso et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report a zzso linkage analysis using zzso zzso markers to map canine zzso to the zzso end of zzso zzso The zzso of zero zzso was refined by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to zzso and the included genes were zzso We found a zzso zzso deletion in zzso 14 of zzso 2 zzso predicting loss of a zzso zzso at position zzso in the protein of affected zzso zzso demonstrated near normal expression of the zzso zzso but zzso expression was zzso to very low on western blots of affected dog zzso zzso zzso and cultured zzso and by zzso on zzso zzso zzso is a multifunctional, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso most commonly associated with human zzso disease type zzso The canine disorder extends the range of zzso zzso and suggests zzso as a candidate gene for rare cases of human zzso
