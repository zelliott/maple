zzso complexes form the main machinery driving protein sorting from zzso to zzso Currently, the picture regarding assembly of zzso on zzso is zzso The structure of the zzso zzso zzso core presented here shows a zzso arrangement of three zzso zzso each corresponding to a different zzso zzso is the central hairpin sandwiched between the other zzso explaining the critical role of its zzso zzso in the stability of zzso We show that zzso zzso links directly to zzso through a tight interaction of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso domain of zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso domain missing this zzso reveals it is a split zzso domain, with a zzso zzso binding pocket that binds zzso The simultaneous and reinforcing interactions of zzso zzso domain with zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso cargo progression from early to late zzso
