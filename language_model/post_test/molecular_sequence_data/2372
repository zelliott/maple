zzso within the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso stimulate synthesis of the major zzso zzso precursor in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Warner, Cell zzso zzso zzso sequences that mediate this zzso activity are located approximately zzso zzso upstream from sequences that zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso By utilizing a zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso a zzso region of zzso zzso was identified by deletion mapping that is required for efficient stimulation of zzso zzso synthesis in zzso A zzso zzso previously shown to support zzso zzso zzso selective initiation of zzso in zzso was located 15 base pairs upstream from the 3' boundary of the zzso zzso A zzso pair region of zzso DNA that mediates zzso zzso activity in zzso was identified immediately downstream from the zzso boundary of the zzso zzso zzso zzso extending downstream from the zzso boundary of the zzso zzso region simultaneously interfere with zzso activity and stimulation of zzso zzso synthesis from the zzso The zzso region supported termination of transcripts initiated by zzso zzso I in zzso The organization of sequences that support zzso and promoter activities within the zzso zzso region is similar to the organization of zzso gene promoters in higher zzso zzso mechanisms for zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso synthesis in zzso are zzso
