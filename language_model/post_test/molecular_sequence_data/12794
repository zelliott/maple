zzso differential zzso was performed to examine rapid changes in gene expression caused by a zzso zzso in zzso zzso of cucumber zzso zzso zzso We isolated 86 zzso clones for zzso whose levels decreased within 2 h of the start of treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences showed that some of the zzso were zzso to those for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso This is the first report that the levels of the zzso for those proteins are regulated by a zzso in zzso Together with previous results zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the present study suggests that the zzso act to lower the levels of zzso transcribed from various genes in zzso zzso
