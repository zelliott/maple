The rat zzso collagen promoter contains a unique zzso sequence between zzso and zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The zzso sequence from zzso to zzso zzso is on the coding strand and the adjacent zzso sequence from zzso to zzso zzso is on the zzso zzso Earlier we demonstrated triplex formation with a zzso 30 zzso parallel zzso zzso zzso corresponding to C1 and zzso of zzso activity of the rat zzso collagen zzso In the present work we have tested zzso abilities of shorter (18 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in parallel and zzso orientation to the C1 zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso zzso formed zzso with the highest binding zzso while zzso zzso zzso did not show appreciable zzso zzso modification of zzso zzso did not significantly reduce binding zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso are quite stable when zzso with ethanol and zzso in zzso Further analysis was carried out using two zzso zzso zzso zzso 158 zzso and zzso zzso designed to bind to the promoter region from zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso respectively, which were found to form zzso even under zzso zzso zzso I zzso experiments showed the ability of these zzso to protect target sequences in the promoter zzso both zzso sequences zzso and zzso were protected in the case of 158 zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso with a reporter zzso containing the collagen promoter sequence showed significant zzso of zzso when compared with a control zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso was greater than that of 158 zzso These results indicate that this triplex strategy could be used in the zzso of collagen synthesis in cultured cells and offer the potential to control zzso in zzso
