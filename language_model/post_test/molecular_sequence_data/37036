We have previously reported a zzso finger protein zzso zzso which is expressed temporarily in two- to eight-cell mouse zzso The zzso gene is zzso in the coding region but carries a solitary zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In this study, we have analyzed the zzso promoter activity in early zzso and in zzso zzso We determined that the major zzso promoter, designated zzso and located upstream of zzso 1, is zzso in both early zzso and in zzso zzso A zzso box and a zzso zzso element are discernible in the zzso zzso We uncovered an alternative promoter, designated zzso in the zzso zzso amplification of zzso ends and real-time zzso experiments indicated that the zzso promoter is weak and is probably fortuitous in early zzso In zzso cells, however, zzso experiments showed that zzso is as active as zzso as a zzso Furthermore, zzso appears to be composed of two different zzso used zzso for zzso initiation in zzso and in zzso zzso Our observations may bear relevance in explaining zzso deficiencies associated with zzso cell cloning zzso
