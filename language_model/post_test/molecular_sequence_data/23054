Here, we identify and clone the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the first reported gene to be expressed specifically during the zzso zzso zzso zzso To isolate zzso we designed zzso zzso based on the zzso protein zzso acid zzso A zzso DNA zzso was amplified by zzso from zzso zzso zzso DNA, whose sequence showed zzso identity to zzso gene over zzso zzso zzso gene sequence was obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of amplified DNA fragments showed a single uninterrupted zzso zzso that zzso a zzso protein with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso with zzso similarity to the zzso zzso A zzso putative signal zzso was found at the zzso followed by a strongly zzso zzso An zzso acid motif for a zzso zzso anchor was identified at the zzso The zzso protein lacking the putative signal zzso at the zzso was expressed in zzso coli and was recognized in western zzso by zzso from zzso infected zzso A mouse zzso zzso serum was produced for zzso studies, and revealed zzso zzso zzso expression in in zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso analysis with samples from in zzso zzso zzso showed increasing levels of zzso transcript over time, suggesting a zzso zzso of this zzso
