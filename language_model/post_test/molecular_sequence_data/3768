The floral zzso zzso in zzso zzso is composed of several interacting regulatory zzso including the zzso architecture gene zzso zzso zzso the floral zzso identity genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the floral organ identity genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso population genetic analyses of these different genes indicate that the coding regions of zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso share similar levels and patterns of zzso zzso In contrast, the coding regions of zzso and zzso display a significant reduction in zzso variation, suggesting that these sequences have been subjected to a recent zzso zzso Moreover, the promoter of zzso unlike its coding region, displays high levels of diversity organized into two distinct zzso that appear to be maintained by zzso These results suggest that patterns of molecular evolution differ among regulatory genes in this zzso pathway, with the earlier acting genes exhibiting evidence of zzso zzso
