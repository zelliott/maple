zzso zzso in E coli is a rare event zzso by three known zzso zzso each having a specific zzso protein zzso zzso zzso lots of zzso zzso a fusion protein constructed from zzso zzso zzso were expressed and zzso from a single zzso transformed zzso coli cell zzso A zzso form of zzso with mass increased by zzso Da was detected in all zzso lots by zzso zzso acceleration zzso mass zzso zzso zzso mapping zzso localized the increased mass to an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and defined it as zzso Da using a zzso exact mass feature and a zzso zzso mass zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso collision induced zzso zzso further localized the modification to the zzso terminal zzso zzso and identified the modification as zzso The average content of zzso zzso in five lots was zzso indicating that a stable zzso activity for zzso was established in the zzso coli expression zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with those of other known zzso zzso proteins expressed in zzso coli reveals a zzso motif analogous to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and distinct from zzso zzso coli zzso zzso
