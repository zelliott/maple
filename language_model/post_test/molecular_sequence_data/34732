The zzso gene family codes for proteins which unwind secondary structures of zzso during zzso zzso The tobacco zzso promoter is one of a few of zzso promoters found in zzso Research was conducted to identify the zzso promoter elements and to evaluate the potential application of the promoter for regulating zzso expression in a range of crop zzso A large zzso zzso zzso in the leader sequence was found to be zzso for zzso promoter activity and did not contribute to the overall performance of the zzso zzso analysis showed that the upstream region between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the zzso start site was essential for the high level of expression and the zzso zzso The data indicated that the elements in this region may coordinate and compensate each other for the high levels of promoter zzso The downstream leader sequence also contained a strong quantitative zzso element that was essential for the full activity of the zzso zzso The zzso promoter was found to be active in a wide range of plant species and zzso indicating that it will be useful for the zzso expression of zzso in zzso
