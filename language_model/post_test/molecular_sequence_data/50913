The zzso zzso is a major structural protein of the zzso zzso capsule in zzso zzso a structure that functions in shaping zzso into the zzso sheath surrounding the zzso A zzso clone zzso et zzso zzso was isolated previously zzso a protein whose predicted size and zzso acid content of zzso zzso zzso and zzso closely resembled a zzso in the bull zzso zzso The sequences of additional zzso and zzso DNA reported here reveal that the mouse zzso capsule zzso reading frame begins 54 zzso further upstream than previously zzso zzso these 54 zzso contain three zzso zzso zzso which normally signify stop but zzso zzso in bacterial and zzso zzso The coding region of the zzso capsule zzso gene is interrupted by a single zzso zzso mapping and primer extension demonstrate that the vast majority of zzso zzso are spliced using consensus zzso and 3' slice junctions in zzso zzso However, two zzso have been identified that apparently represent rare zzso zzso produced by use of cryptic zzso zzso
