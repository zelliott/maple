zzso zzso Asian ethnicity and zzso zzso are the major clinical zzso of zzso response in zzso cell lung cancer, as shown in previous zzso Recently, response to zzso has been associated with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso Higher rates of zzso were seen in zzso patients with zzso the Asian population and zzso which may explain the clinical response zzso The presence of diffuse zzso pulmonary zzso on chest imaging as a novel clinical predictor of its response is proposed zzso Two cases of lung zzso in men presenting with diffuse zzso pulmonary zzso were zzso Both patients showed a major response to zzso The dramatic reduction of zzso pulmonary zzso throughout both lungs on zzso zzso scans was achieved after treatment for a couple of months with 250 zzso of oral zzso In the molecular analysis, one patient had a zzso zzso zzso and the other had a zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, patients with lung zzso even men, who presented with bilateral diffuse zzso zzso spread to the lungs tended to have an activated zzso zzso zzso they are most likely to receive benefits from molecular target drugs such as zzso and possibly zzso
