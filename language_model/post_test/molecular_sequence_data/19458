zzso assembly of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso a slowly zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso genes cause benign familial zzso convulsions zzso a rare zzso zzso of the zzso In the present study, we describe the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso family, leading to an zzso to zzso substitution at zzso acid position 196 located at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso The consequences on zzso zzso function prompted by the zzso zzso as well as by the zzso zzso previously described in another zzso family, were investigated by zzso and single-channel current zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso When compared with zzso channels, zzso zzso zzso or zzso channels showed a 20 zzso rightward shift in their zzso zzso zzso with no zzso change in zzso open probability or single-channel zzso Furthermore, current zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels displayed an unusual dependence on the conditioning zzso zzso being markedly slower when preceded by zzso to more zzso zzso zzso channels formed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed gating changes similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these results reveal a novel role for zzso zzso in the zzso end of zzso in controlling gating of zzso and suggest that gating changes caused by zzso at these zzso may decrease zzso function, thus causing zzso zzso ultimately leading to zzso zzso
