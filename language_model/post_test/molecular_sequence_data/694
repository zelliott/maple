zzso zzso zzso zzso acute regulatory protein zzso have been isolated from different fish species, yet the relevance of zzso during zzso cycle and more zzso in final zzso maturation has not been assessed so zzso A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited 55 to zzso identity at zzso level with other zzso zzso zzso analysis of tissue distribution pattern demonstrated the presence of zzso zzso in various zzso including zzso zzso liver, brain and zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed high expression of zzso zzso in the zzso phase of zzso while it was low in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso maximum expression was noticed during the zzso zzso During human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso by 2 h and then declined gradually to reach zzso levels by 12 h as that of zzso zzso Taken together, high level of expression during zzso zzso maturation zzso in zzso suggests a role for zzso in addition to the zzso zzso genes in final zzso zzso
