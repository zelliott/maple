It is not agreed that correlated positions of zzso protein side chains zzso zzso can be deduced from zzso zzso The pure zzso zzso zzso zzso crystal structure confirms correlations deduced for the natural, mixed sequence form of zzso zzso Physical separation of the mixed form into pure zzso form and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso form crystal structure determination zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso support the proposed zzso zzso zzso Roe, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso density of mixed form zzso zzso shows four possible pairs of side chain zzso for zzso zzso 22 and nearby zzso zzso zzso 4, two zzso for each of two side zzso One combination can be eliminated because of short van der zzso zzso However, only two zzso have been zzso to exist in mixed form zzso zzso and zzso In zzso of the zzso form, zzso and zzso are found to be in direct van der zzso contact zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form structure with the mixed form electron density confirms that the fourth combination of side chains does not occur and that side chain correlations are zzso by water zzso
