Little is known about bacteria associated with zzso the large group of mostly zzso insects zzso the zzso and zzso We zzso the zzso zzso bacteria of a zzso zzso the gypsy zzso zzso zzso zzso whose gut is highly zzso by using traditional zzso and zzso zzso We also examined the effects of diet on microbial zzso Analysis of individual zzso larvae revealed a high degree of similarity of microbial composition among insects fed on the same zzso DNA sequence analysis indicated that most of the zzso zzso zzso genes belong to the zzso and low zzso zzso divisions and that the cultured members represented more than half of the zzso zzso Less frequently detected zzso included members of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequences from 7 of the 15 cultured organisms and 8 of the 9 sequences identified by zzso amplification zzso from previously reported bacterial zzso The microbial composition of zzso differed substantially among larvae feeding on a zzso artificial diet, zzso zzso white oak, or zzso zzso zzso analysis of cultured zzso indicated that an zzso species and zzso analysis indicated that an zzso zzso were both present in all larvae, regardless of the feeding zzso the sequences of these two zzso varied less than zzso among individual zzso These results provide the first comprehensive description of the microbial diversity of a zzso zzso and demonstrate that the plant species in the diet influences the composition of the gut bacterial zzso
