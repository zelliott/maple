zzso is one of the major plant zzso zzso of many commercially important medicinal zzso One of the major concerns in medicinal plant industry is zzso resulting from zzso of herbal zzso This study reports the construction and validation of a zzso capable of zzso zzso important species from the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso DNA of 104 zzso zzso and zzso species was zzso from pooled zzso DNA of 67 zzso zzso zzso 283 zzso DNA fragments were used to construct an zzso zzso The validation of zzso array revealed a high zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five zzso species zzso zzso representing 20 families and 9 orders within the zzso were zzso onto the array to reveal its level of species zzso All these species could be successfully differentiated using their zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso were identified for commercially important species like tea, coffee, zzso zzso zzso Japanese zzso zzso wild celery, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso A large number of zzso were novel zzso zzso whilst some of them were from zzso region including genes like zzso zzso and zzso that have extensively been used for zzso and zzso analysis of zzso 

zzso Diversity zzso technique is highly efficient in zzso species with little or no zzso zzso The zzso array could fingerprint all 25 species assessed including three species that were not used in constructing the zzso This study zzso the use of zzso genes for zzso zzso plant zzso In addition, this method allowed detection of several new zzso that can be explored to solve existing discrepancies in zzso and zzso of zzso
