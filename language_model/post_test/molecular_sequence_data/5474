About 40 zzso zzso downstream of the rat growth hormone zzso a gene was found to be expressed in the liver and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso DNA zzso as a probe, the corresponding zzso clone containing a zzso zzso insert was isolated from the rat liver zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence having zzso zzso was identical with that of the mouse zzso factor, zzso and human zzso zzso zzso The gene was thus identified as the rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso end of the gene was determined by the zzso analysis and the zzso was noted to comprise zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso in length and possessing 12 zzso started at zzso and ended at zzso zzso downstream from the zzso start site of the zzso zzso From zzso 2 to 11, the size of each zzso zzso was identical with the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso pig zzso zzso zzso zzso was similarly expressed in seven different zzso and one cell zzso
