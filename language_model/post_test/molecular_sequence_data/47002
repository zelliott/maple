zzso zzso zzso cells of the budding zzso zzso zzso acquire an organizer activity to induce a secondary body axis when implanted into developing zzso We identified several different zzso that were zzso in the zzso cells after zzso acid zzso We isolated a zzso clone corresponding to one of these zzso The zzso region of the predicted protein product is zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso that belong to the zzso zzso The zzso region contains several types of zzso interaction zzso We therefore named this protein zzso zzso zzso modular zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cells during budding and its zzso by zzso acid were demonstrated by reverse zzso and in zzso zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein showed a zzso activity with zzso zzso specificity and zzso proliferation of the cell line established in this zzso
