zzso containing the entire coding sequence of the respiratory zzso zzso virus fusion zzso protein gene zzso zzso zzso and two large zzso restriction fragments, zzso zzso acids 18 to 212 and 214 to zzso were expressed in zzso coli as zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso expression zzso zzso A further zzso fragment, overlapping the zzso restriction site and zzso zzso acids 190 to zzso was derived by zzso and expressed in a similar zzso zzso rabbit serum raised against zzso virus bound to all four zzso proteins but most strongly to those containing zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso capable of zzso the virus and zzso the viral fusion function, bound to all zzso except that derived from the zzso zzso fragment, suggesting that their binding sites were located between zzso acids 214 and zzso Further analysis of binding to expressed fragments from restriction zzso zzso and zzso amplification demonstrated that both zzso bound to zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso overlapping synthetic peptides containing the sequence 265 to 272 zzso but zzso zzso failed to bind to any zzso zzso derived from the F protein zzso zzso of mice with zzso proteins containing the whole F protein coding sequence or zzso acids zzso to zzso which includes the binding site of the two zzso identified here, failed to induce zzso that recognized the native zzso virus F protein or could neutralize the zzso This suggests that either the zzso partner zzso the immune response to the protein or that elements missing from the protein expressed in zzso coli, perhaps zzso or added zzso contribute to the zzso zzso zzso
