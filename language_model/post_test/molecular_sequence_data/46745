We analyzed the effect of substituting zzso for each of the 19 zzso zzso within the zzso zzso domain of the human zzso zzso on cell surface expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similar to wild type zzso the other 14 zzso to zzso zzso were retained zzso Four of these, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to zzso A zzso double zzso failed to zzso but was unique in that the zzso form expressed at the cell zzso zzso of a zzso for zzso 132 within the zzso zzso restored zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in various combinations caused a left shift in zzso response compared with wild type zzso These results identify zzso 129 and 131 as critical in formation of zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso zzso In a zzso zzso model of the zzso zzso domain, zzso and zzso are located within a region protruding from one lobe of the zzso We suggest that this region represents a zzso interface for the zzso and that zzso of zzso within the interface causes important changes in zzso response of the zzso
