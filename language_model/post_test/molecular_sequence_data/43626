We have discovered two types of zzso zzso gene zzso that impair zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and cause complete zzso zzso zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso for each zzso had negligible specific zzso zzso and did not react to an zzso against an zzso zzso of the zzso Both zzso were detected by direct sequencing of zzso zzso with zzso zzso One zzso is an zzso to zzso zzso at position zzso of the zzso 6 zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso of a portion of the zzso zzso domain yielded a small amount of a zzso zzso zzso instead of a zzso zzso zzso zzso established that zzso 5 was followed, out of frame, by zzso 7: zzso 6 was zzso The other zzso is a zzso zzso at the zzso position of the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and sequencing revealed a small amount of zzso zzso with normal zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso showed zzso zzso levels were well below zzso of zzso zzso most of the zzso zzso zzso resulting from each zzso is probably zzso The misbehavior caused by these two zzso indicates that in the zzso the zzso site zzso zzso is zzso indeed, 57% of zzso zzso have zzso in the zzso position, while only zzso have zzso
