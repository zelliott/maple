zzso is a zzso expressed zzso factor that specifies the fate of certain zzso early in the development of zzso zzso This zzso factor contains a basic region, but it binds to DNA as a zzso Because other zzso factors containing basic regions bind as zzso this finding implied that zzso represents a new DNA recognition zzso It has been proposed that the basic region zzso of zzso is stabilized for binding by zzso contacts to other parts of the zzso We have tested this proposal by carrying out circular zzso zzso and zzso experiments on the zzso domain and five truncated zzso Our results have shown that the basic region of zzso is zzso in solution and does not contact other parts of the zzso like other basic region zzso it folds into a zzso only upon binding specifically to zzso However, there is a zzso folded zzso module in the zzso domain, and one of the zzso in this module zzso immediately before the start of the basic zzso This zzso zzso contains a surface rich in basic zzso zzso and we propose that this zzso contacts the DNA zzso to the basic region proper, providing an extra long zzso recognition surface which helps to stabilize zzso zzso zzso between the zzso domain and several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raises the possibility that the affinity and perhaps the specificity of DNA binding by zzso proteins can be modulated by incorporating a zzso folded zzso segment that contacts the DNA just below the basic region zzso
