The zzso gene product zzso is required for entry into zzso and zzso in zzso zzso It has been predicted to be composed of two zzso an zzso domain with zzso to protein zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was identified in extracts of zzso cells carrying zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso analysis using an zzso zzso zzso complexes were found to zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso plasmids expressing truncated zzso proteins that lack part of or the entire zzso domain enabled cells to undergo zzso even under a certain repressive nutritional zzso These cells contained increased levels of protein zzso activity compared with control zzso These results suggest that the zzso domain has a protein zzso activity and that the zzso tail is not essential for either the zzso activity or zzso but serves in a negative zzso An zzso fusion was shown by zzso zzso to be localized predominantly to the nucleus, suggesting a nuclear function of zzso
