zzso of survival during the zzso zzso periods have been studied for more than a zzso Until now, molecular studies that confirmed animal survival on Alpine zzso that is, ice-free zzso surrounded by zzso were restricted to peripheral zzso Here, we search for molecular signatures of zzso survival of the narrow endemic and zzso zzso Alpine jumping zzso zzso zzso combining zzso and zzso data from its three known zzso The zzso data indicate survival on both peripheral and central zzso the latter suggesting that zzso in the zzso of the Alpine main zzso were more widespread than previously zzso zzso between zzso and zzso patterns suggest a complex evolutionary history of the species and may be explained via parallel fixation of zzso of different origins during the last glacial zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso may have been essential for central zzso survival, but may pose a serious threat for zzso zzso in consideration of the present zzso zzso
