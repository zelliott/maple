The zzso resistance of zzso zzso is due to zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso the zzso of the essential zzso zzso zzso A rapid and very simple method has been developed to detect zzso resistance in small numbers of zzso zzso present in zzso It involves zzso chain reaction amplification of a defined region of the zzso gene followed by zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso The reliability of the method has been tested on a sample of known drug-resistant and susceptible zzso of zzso zzso
