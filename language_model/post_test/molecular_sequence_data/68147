The zzso acid sequences of two zzso zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso were solved by a combination of direct protein sequencing and zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso from zzso coli, correct ordering of three internal peptides was achieved by sequencing a zzso of DNA generated by zzso In the case of zzso zzso from pig liver, chemical studies on the reaction of the zzso with a suicide inhibitor allowed a detailed description of the mechanism of zzso and collection of partial sequence information on the zzso The sequence of the protein was completely reconstructed after analysis of further zzso fragments derived by zzso and chemical zzso with the help of the information from the zzso sequence of pig brain zzso zzso performed by another group zzso Park and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
