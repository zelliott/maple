zzso tuberculosis is the zzso agent of zzso which is becoming an increasingly global public health problem due to the rise of drug-resistant zzso While residing in the human host, zzso tuberculosis needs to acquire iron for its zzso zzso tuberculosis has two iron zzso mechanisms, one that zzso zzso iron and another that taps into the vast host zzso zzso To date, proteins known to be involved in zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso Whereas zzso zzso zzso across the bacterial zzso or zzso zzso from host zzso zzso zzso and zzso are thought to transport zzso across the zzso In this work, we characterize the zzso properties of the predicted zzso soluble E1 zzso of both zzso and zzso utilizing zzso electron zzso zzso and magnetic circular zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that zzso transfers zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso at a rate faster than passive zzso zzso from zzso This work zzso a key step in the zzso zzso of zzso and it may be useful in the development of zzso drugs targeting this zzso
