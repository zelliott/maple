The spontaneous occurrence of protein zzso of zzso varies among animal zzso As zzso zzso of zzso has never been detected in the blue zzso we obtained acute phase zzso to search for zzso zzso The zzso zzso fraction was characterized by mass and sequence analyses to disclose any unique zzso in the zzso acid zzso The data revealed an zzso protein with zzso in several positions, and showed the typical zzso between positions 69 and zzso By comparing the zzso acid sequence with that from other zzso no unique sequence could be zzso However, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found attached to the zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso revealed a partially blocked and ragged zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence of zzso with that from the dog showed that the zzso zzso started about position 190, had an intact zzso and showed an identical sequence in all positions, except zzso Based on the data, we suggest an interaction of the zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso protein that zzso the AA zzso in the blue zzso
