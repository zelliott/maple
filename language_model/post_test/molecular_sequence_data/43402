We have recently shown that two proteins related to two of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are part of an zzso complex not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Bright, zzso West, zzso Newman, zzso zzso and zzso Robinson, zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso In the present study we have searched the zzso database and have identified, zzso and zzso a zzso expressed zzso of zzso zzso as well as zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso delta and zzso which are also zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso delta and zzso show that they are the other two zzso of the zzso zzso We are calling this complex zzso a name that has also been used for the zzso zzso zzso but we feel that it is a more appropriate designation for an zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso reveals that the zzso complex is associated with the zzso region of the cell as well as with more peripheral zzso These peripheral structures show only limited zzso with zzso markers and may zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The delta zzso is closely related to the protein product of the zzso zzso zzso which when zzso results in reduced pigmentation of the eyes and other zzso Because zzso zzso are believed to be similar to zzso this suggests either that the zzso complex may be directly involved in trafficking to zzso or alternatively that it may be involved in another pathway, but that zzso in that zzso may indirectly lead to defects in zzso zzso
