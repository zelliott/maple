Identification of zzso sites is essential for the expression of most zzso zzso allowing accurate zzso of zzso The zzso sites are recognized by the zzso machinery based on sequences within the zzso Here, we show that the zzso sequences at the zzso junctions play a zzso previously zzso role in the selection of 3' zzso sites during the second step of zzso The influence of the zzso sequences was enhanced by the zzso zzso zzso and the strength of an zzso sequence in zzso zzso predicted its effect in zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso of zzso in zzso demonstrated that 3' zzso sites were chosen competitively during the second step, likely at the same time as zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso site selection for two genes studied was altered by point zzso in their zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso and alternative zzso Finally, we note that the zzso of the genetic code allows competing 3' zzso sites to be eliminated from coding regions, and we suggest that the evolution of the zzso signals and the genetic code are zzso
