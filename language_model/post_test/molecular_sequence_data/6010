The zzso protein of zzso coli is an zzso that specifically zzso and zzso Holliday junctions during genetic zzso The structure of the zzso junctions complex has been investigated by zzso I zzso and by gel zzso zzso We find that zzso binds to the Holliday junction to form a complex that exhibits zzso zzso and in which the three-dimensional structure of the Holliday junction is altered to an unfolded zzso This structure is observed in the absence or presence of zzso metal zzso and differs from either the unfolded square or the folded stacked zzso that have been observed with zzso Holliday zzso zzso was used to probe the junction DNA upon binding by zzso and indicates that zzso at the crossover is disrupted within the zzso zzso
