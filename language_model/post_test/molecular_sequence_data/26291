The plasma membrane forms of zzso zzso contain a highly zzso zzso domain, which is also zzso in the soluble form of the zzso and in zzso zzso zzso A protein zzso domain lies to the zzso side of the zzso domain and appears to be required for signaling via zzso it might also zzso itself, through zzso zzso This domain is present in the growth factor zzso but appears not to be a component of other zzso zzso or zzso zzso A single zzso domain then separates the zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso from the putative zzso zzso At least two plasma membrane forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have now been identified, and their zzso zzso appear to be distinctly zzso The zzso distribution of this family of receptors is now of potential importance, since specific zzso might zzso regulate zzso processes via the secondary messenger, zzso dependent on cellular distribution of the zzso
