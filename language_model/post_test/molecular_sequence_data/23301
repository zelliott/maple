zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is a complex and tightly regulated zzso that involves the induction of a large number of zzso We have identified zzso in a zzso library enriched for zzso zzso zzso searches show that the first one-third of zzso has strong sequence similarity to bacterial zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a potential zzso zzso zzso This is further supported by the fact that zzso cells are zzso and that a zzso fusion zzso to the zzso We have confirmed by Northern zzso analysis that both zzso and zzso are strongly induced during the middle stages of zzso and that this induction is dependent on the presence of a middle zzso element zzso in the promoters of these zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso and zzso but not other zzso zzso zzso accumulate during the middle stages of zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso may have additional zzso zzso
