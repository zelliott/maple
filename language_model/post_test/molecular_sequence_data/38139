zzso (also called zzso is one of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso that are necessary for zzso zzso zzso is known to target zzso nuclear proteins that also interacts with zzso zzso and zzso In order to identify additional zzso targets, an zzso human zzso zzso library was screened in the zzso zzso system with zzso truncated zzso that cannot interact with zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso a cellular partner of zzso B virus zzso was zzso This protein is also known as the zzso zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso complex zzso The specific binding to zzso was confirmed by showing that the zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells that were infected with zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso eliminated the zzso Fusion with green fluorescent protein showed that zzso is zzso zzso but zzso to the nucleus upon expression of zzso
