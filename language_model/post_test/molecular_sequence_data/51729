We recently zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a human zzso Three zzso sequences were zzso one from the zzso zzso and two from internal peptides which were generated by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso These sequences were aligned to the corresponding sequences of 19 zzso zzso from various zzso zzso zzso were then designed according to the sequence and the position of each zzso The zzso were used to amplify a complete zzso using the zzso chain reaction with either adult zzso total zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso library as the zzso The protein zzso by the zzso has 153 zzso acids with a calculated molecular weight of zzso It also has zzso zzso to 19 zzso zzso from various zzso All of the zzso binding sites and zzso activity sites are zzso Computer analysis predicts that the zzso has a zzso value of zzso which is very close to the experimental results of zzso analysis zzso and zzso The entire coding sequence from the zzso was cloned into a bacterial alkaline zzso zzso expression zzso and a large amount of soluble product was expressed and zzso to zzso We compared the zzso expressed zzso with the native zzso derived from zzso and found that they are identical by the following criteria: zzso They focus at the same positions on zzso zzso zzso they form zzso in solution as measured by gel zzso zzso they have the same zzso zzso zzso zzso they both are zzso active with comparable specific zzso The specific activity of the zzso derived zzso was increased somewhat zzso zzso by incubation with copper and zinc zzso
