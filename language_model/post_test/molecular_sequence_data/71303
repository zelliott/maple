The peptides corresponding to the four repeats found in the zzso binding region of zzso protein were zzso and their ability for zzso in presence of zzso or zzso zzso was zzso Mainly, only the zzso containing the third zzso repeat is able to form zzso in a high zzso Additionally, the zzso containing the second repeat zzso with a very low zzso However, when this zzso contains the zzso zzso described in a zzso zzso zzso it is able to form zzso at a higher zzso Finally, it is suggested to have a role for the first and fourth zzso zzso It could be to decrease the ability of the third zzso repeat for zzso in the presence of zzso
