A portion of the Aedes aegypti zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 gene zzso was amplified using zzso with a 42 degrees C zzso zzso zzso fragments from individual mosquitoes were similar to zzso but contained multiple segregating zzso We suspected that nuclear copies of zzso origin zzso exist in the zzso aegypti zzso A zzso search in zzso with the entire zzso aegypti zzso zzso identified 233 zzso zzso 110 178 zzso in 145 zzso At a density of zzso zzso this represents the second highest density of zzso in an insect zzso and the highest in zzso zzso of zzso sequences suggested that zzso aegypti zzso arise through zzso leakage from damaged zzso followed by breakage and zzso zzso rather than through duplicative processes such as zzso or molecular zzso
