We undertook zzso substitution zzso and zzso zzso at selected zzso positions to map sites of zzso binding and changes in zzso exposure of the zzso protein from zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly sensitive to its local environment, and when bound to zzso exhibits changes in both intensity and zzso wavelength that are reflected in the degree of zzso exclusion and the effective zzso constant of the environment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated based on the zzso protein crystal structure and predicted zzso binding sites, and zzso parameters were zzso on the zzso zzso This approach allows one to analyze the environment around the zzso zzso side chain and the changes induced by bound zzso Introduction of an zzso zzso at position 178 yields a large blue shift with zzso association, whereas the zzso and zzso zzso induce red shifts reflecting zzso exposure at this zzso Such zzso changes in zzso parameters suggest that certain zzso can induce distinct zzso states of the binding zzso and that mutually exclusive binding results from disparate portals of entry to and zzso of the bound zzso and smaller zzso zzso at the binding zzso zzso at other zzso positions around the predicted binding pocket also reveals distinctive spectral changes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
