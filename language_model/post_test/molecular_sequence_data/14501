zzso zzso is an essential zzso of the major zzso complex zzso class I zzso that helps to stabilize the structure of zzso I zzso zzso It is also one of the typical zzso zzso zzso molecules in the zzso immune system zzso zzso belong to the zzso fish, which are the oldest zzso zzso ancestors with an zzso to exist in the zzso Thus, the study of zzso fish zzso would help in understanding the evolution of zzso zzso In order to demonstrate this, zzso from a zzso fish, nurse shark zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso data were collected to a resolution of zzso zzso The crystal belonged to space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure contained two molecules in the zzso zzso The results will provide structural information for study of the evolution of zzso and zzso in the zzso
