The genetic changes underlying the dramatic differences in form and function between humans and other primates are largely unknown, although it is clear that gene regulatory changes play an important zzso To identify regulatory sequences with potentially zzso functions, we and others used comparative zzso to find zzso regions zzso across zzso that have acquired many sequence changes in humans since divergence from zzso These regions are good candidates for performing zzso regulatory zzso Here, we zzso the DNA zzso evolutionary history, zzso zzso zzso state and zzso factor zzso binding sites of a combined set of zzso zzso human accelerated regions zzso and predicted that at least zzso of them function as zzso zzso We zzso the predicted zzso enhancers using analysis of zzso binding site gain and loss, along with the functional zzso and expression patterns of nearby zzso We then tested both the human and zzso sequence for 29 zzso in transgenic mice, and found 24 novel zzso enhancers active in both species, 17 of which had very consistent patterns of activity in specific embryonic zzso Of these zzso zzso five drove expression patterns suggestive of different activity for the human and zzso sequence at embryonic day zzso The changes to human zzso DNA in these zzso enhancers may modify the complex patterns of gene expression necessary for proper development in a zzso manner and are thus promising candidates for understanding the genetic basis of zzso zzso
