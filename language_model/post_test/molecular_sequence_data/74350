During zzso infection, the zzso protein plays a key role by zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso of zzso T zzso leading to a massive loss of immune zzso This zzso is notably zzso by the interaction of zzso with zzso which are dynamic components essential for cell structure and zzso zzso binds two zzso zzso through its zzso zzso region in zzso but the role of zinc in the structure and properties of zzso is still zzso 

To investigate the role of zzso we first characterized zzso zzso and zzso by zzso correlation zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both of the zzso forms are zzso and poorly folded but differ by local zzso changes in the vicinity of the zzso zzso The interaction of the two zzso forms with zzso zzso and zzso was monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso At 20 degrees C, both of the zzso forms bind zzso zzso but only the zzso was found to form discrete zzso At 37 degrees C, both forms promoted the nucleation and increased the zzso rates of zzso zzso However, only the zzso increased the amount of zzso decreased the zzso critical zzso and stabilized the zzso In contrast, zzso induced a large amount of zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso zzso to the active form, responsible for the zzso zzso
