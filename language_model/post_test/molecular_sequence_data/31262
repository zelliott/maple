zzso zzso is a small zzso zzso from zzso zzso that belongs to zzso group 3 and expresses two distinct types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed by the primary replication control zzso zzso which specifies two small zzso zzso I and zzso II, that jointly inhibit the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed by the leading strand replication origin and is due to competition for zzso The zzso region from each of 11 different zzso copy number zzso was cloned onto the zzso zzso zzso and tested for its ability to inhibit the replication of zzso and its copy number zzso The zzso replication origin was also cloned and tested for its ability to inhibit the replication of the same zzso In general zzso zzso that alter the production or sequence of zzso I and zzso II greatly reduced or completely eliminated zzso zzso Unlike the zzso all of the copy zzso were resistant to zzso zzso The separately cloned zzso zzso and zzso regions each reduced the copy number of zzso in proportion to their gene zzso but neither blocked replication zzso It is proposed that the cloned Inc zzso cause zzso by interfering with the zzso copy correction zzso this interference zzso the zzso even under conditions where its average copy number is not greatly zzso
