Human factor zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso requires zzso for zzso and zzso the gamma chains of zzso more efficiently than the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso is zzso and forms predominantly zzso and zzso chain zzso Previous work from this laboratory demonstrated that zzso acid zzso within zzso 7 of zzso were important for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine to what extent the primary zzso acid sequence within zzso 7 defines zzso zzso zzso 7 of zzso was replaced with the corresponding zzso of zzso using gene zzso by overlap zzso Other work from this laboratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Santiago, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using synthetic peptides identified two other zzso that might play a role in zzso recognition zzso in zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso were also created in which these two zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3, 5, and 7 were expressed in zzso coli, zzso and the nature of the zzso zzso pattern of these five proteins was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso formed the zzso zzso whereas zzso formed zzso zzso zzso 7 formed zzso complexes that resembled the zzso pattern of zzso This finding demonstrates that the primary zzso acid sequence of zzso 7 of zzso zzso some of the specificity for the zzso and zzso zzso pattern characteristic of zzso zzso 5 exhibited reduced zzso activity zzso of zzso zzso but still retained preference for formation of the zzso zzso whereas zzso 3 was not zzso In conclusion, exchanging the primary zzso acid sequence of the active site zzso of human zzso with that of human zzso zzso the zzso such that the zzso zzso pattern more closely resembles that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso zzso
