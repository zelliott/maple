The human small cell lung cancer zzso cell line selected for resistance to zzso zzso has been reported previously to zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso cells demonstrated a distinct zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso the target of zzso zzso showed a decrease in Mr 170,000 zzso zzso in nuclear extracts in zzso but equal amounts of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso II zzso activities in zzso and zzso zzso extracts were equal, as were their zzso by zzso zzso of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso deletion encompassing zzso zzso coding for zzso overlapping two potential zzso nuclear zzso zzso The deletion occurred at the initial nine zzso of an zzso suggesting alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso DNA revealed a zzso point zzso in the 3' zzso zzso site consensus zzso resulting in the use of an alternate zzso zzso zzso with previous reports on three drug-resistant cell lines with large zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso and zzso zzso point to a pivotal role for the basic cluster zzso in the nuclear import of this zzso
