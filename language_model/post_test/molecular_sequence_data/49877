We have developed a novel type of DNA zzso zzso agent by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso connected using seven different zzso The zzso zzso compound, zzso efficiently produces DNA zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso only in the presence of a partner zzso zzso For efficient zzso by zzso with zzso one zzso base pair between two recognition sites was required to accommodate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso base pair and zzso of an additional zzso base pair and substitution with a zzso base pair significantly reduced the degree of zzso The sequence specificity of the zzso zzso by zzso was also examined in the presence of various zzso The presence of zzso slightly reduced the formation of a zzso product compared to zzso The mismatch partners, zzso and zzso did not produce an zzso zzso product with zzso whereas zzso and zzso induced efficient zzso at their matching site with zzso The zzso zzso abilities of zzso were further examined using zzso zzso gel zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso The sequencing gel analysis of the zzso DNA zzso with zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso several sites on the top and bottom zzso including one zzso zzso match site, zzso To obtain direct evidence of zzso zzso on longer DNA fragments, a simple method using zzso complementary strands was developed, which produced a band corresponding to the zzso zzso site on both top and bottom zzso zzso analysis indicated that the contribution of the zzso zzso in the observed zzso bands was approximately zzso This compound efficiently zzso both strands at the target zzso The present system consisted of a zzso complex of the zzso agent and its partner zzso and caused an zzso zzso in a zzso fashion according to the zzso recognition rule of zzso zzso
