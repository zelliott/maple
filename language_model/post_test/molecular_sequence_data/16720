Both DNA zzso and zzso zzso modifications contribute to gene zzso but the zzso relationship between these zzso marks is zzso zzso in two zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and the zzso zzso DNA zzso cause a reduction of zzso DNA zzso suggesting that zzso zzso controls zzso DNA zzso Here we show that the zzso of zzso can directly interact with the zzso tail of zzso zzso but only when it is simultaneously zzso at both the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso analysis and zzso experiments, we found that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso present at zzso was not affected by zzso in zzso or in several zzso zzso related genes including the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that a novel zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest a model in which zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by an unknown zzso provide a zzso zzso code for the recruitment of zzso to silent zzso
