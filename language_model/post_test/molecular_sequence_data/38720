A bacterial artificial zzso zzso library has been established from zzso DNA isolated from the zzso zzso of human, zzso zzso This library consists of more than zzso zzso clones carrying zzso in the zzso zzso The mean insert size was 100 zzso representing an approximate zzso zzso zzso Library screening with eight zzso or zzso gene zzso yielded between 1 and 9 positive zzso and none of those tested was absent from the zzso End sequences were obtained for 93 randomly selected zzso and 37 showed sequence identity to zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso or repetitive zzso A preliminary analysis by zzso in zzso zzso localized 8 clones on zzso zzso 1 (2 zzso 2, 3, 5, zzso and W (3 zzso This library provides a new resource for the physical mapping and sequencing of the zzso of this important human zzso
