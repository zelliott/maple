We describe a general and efficient zzso strategy for zzso zzso zzso In the first step, a zzso zzso zzso zzso In the second step, T4 zzso zzso closes the loop that completes the zzso The zzso reaction can form either a natural or zzso zzso zzso depending on which of the two zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the lone zzso We demonstrate two approaches to control formation of either zzso zzso In conjunction with other routes for zzso zzso zzso the zzso strategy described here will facilitate zzso studies that require zzso zzso of varying zzso zzso
