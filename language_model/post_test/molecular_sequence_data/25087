To determine and characterize zzso zzso of drug-resistant zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso products of zzso of drug-resistant and susceptible zzso and zzso were zzso cloned and analyzed by zzso 377 zzso sequencing zzso 

11 out of 17 drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso were detected having zzso zzso 10 out of the 11 strains with variations had at least one zzso zzso The variations consisted of point zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms were different from strain to zzso 8 of 13 zzso strains had both zzso and zzso zzso 18 variation positions and mechanisms different from previous report have been zzso 

These results suggested that binding sites decrease caused by zzso point zzso be associated with zzso zzso resistance to zzso and zzso
