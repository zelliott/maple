The mechanism by which the products of the zzso zzso the corresponding zzso zzso and the related zzso gene of zzso zzso exert their effects is not zzso Here we show that the zzso chicken zzso and zzso proteins activated gene expression when fused to zzso sequences and bound to DNA upstream of target genes in zzso zzso We have defined two distinct zzso regions in the zzso zzso Region I, located in the zzso half of zzso and zzso zzso contains no stretches of zzso zzso or zzso zzso acids and therefore may be a novel zzso zzso zzso in the zzso protein that diminished or abolished zzso transformation of avian zzso cells zzso affected zzso zzso by region zzso Region II, located in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is highly zzso Region II is not present in the zzso protein or in a transforming zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso of zzso proteins requires zzso region I and suggest that the biological function of zzso and zzso proteins depends on zzso zzso by this zzso
