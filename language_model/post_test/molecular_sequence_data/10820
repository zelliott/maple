In previous studies, the zzso R zzso of the zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso protein was shown to be a potent inhibitor of viral fusion zzso In the present study, we investigated the molecular zzso in the zzso zzso protein zzso tail which are important for the fusion zzso activity of the R zzso We constructed a series of zzso zzso zzso genes which express zzso proteins with serial zzso internal zzso or zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso To analyze their cell fusion activity, we employed a quantitative fusion zzso We found that zzso of up to 7 zzso acids from the C zzso of the zzso tail had no zzso effect on the lack of fusion activity of the full-length zzso zzso however, further zzso resulted in a progressive increase in cell fusion zzso Studies of zzso proteins with zzso acid zzso in the zzso tail showed that zzso plays an important role in fusion zzso by the R zzso while most of the other zzso acids in the R zzso were not essential for fusion zzso Studies of zzso proteins with internal deletions upstream of the zzso site in the zzso tail showed that this region is also involved in fusion zzso by the R zzso although only to a limited zzso The results are consistent with a model in which the zzso R zzso exhibits its fusion zzso activity through interaction with a cellular zzso
