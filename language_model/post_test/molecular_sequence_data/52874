The zzso zzso zzso gene encodes one of the few essential zzso proteins that are required for the import of zzso precursor proteins from the zzso and their subsequent sorting into the different zzso zzso We have isolated and characterized a putative zzso of zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a protein of 90 zzso acids with zzso identity to zzso zzso zzso It was capable of suppressing the temperature sensitivity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is both a functional and structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso gene product contains all the four zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso motifs typical of the Tim family proteins in the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso serum, Western blots detected a protein of about 10 zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso import and sorting systems might be also strongly zzso in other zzso The coding sequence of the zzso zzso zzso has been deposited in the zzso zzso zzso Database under zzso zzso zzso
