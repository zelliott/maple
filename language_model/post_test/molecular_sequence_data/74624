The zzso zzso A zzso gene zzso cloned previously from zzso zzso zzso zzso contains three putative regulatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso Their deduced gene products show high similarity to members of the zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso family zzso or to zzso regulators zzso and zzso Here we provide experimental data supporting zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso and zzso production could be restored to the zzso zzso by expressing zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that up to 26 of the 28 genes within the zzso gene zzso with the exception of zzso and zzso were under the positive control of zzso directly or zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso improved the zzso zzso zzso (to about zzso zzso relative to that of zzso zzso zzso Cloning of the complete zzso cluster into an zzso zzso and subsequent expression in zzso hosts revealed that considerable amounts of zzso could be produced in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso host could be engineered to produce zzso via zzso expression of zzso zzso production in zzso zzso could be enhanced further by zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso with zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate the viability of engineering zzso zzso and improving zzso zzso in both the native producer zzso zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The approach taken zzso on zzso a key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
