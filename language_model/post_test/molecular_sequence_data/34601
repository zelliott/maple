zzso proteins zzso are specific proteins of the growth zzso zzso family in bovine zzso This study reports the identification and sequencing of a full-length zzso for two new members of bovine zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso and quantitative expression in bovine zzso 

New zzso and zzso were identified from bovine zzso zzso and quantitative gene expression in the zzso were respectively investigated by in zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso proteins of these genes were produced by a zzso zzso cell expression zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were respectively cloned with zzso and 910 zzso zzso corresponding to proteins of 236 and zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso acid sequence shared about 40 to zzso zzso with other zzso and zzso had about 50 to zzso zzso of zzso The two new zzso were detected only in the zzso by zzso zzso was primarily expressed in the zzso and zzso zzso throughout zzso An in zzso zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso membrane on Day 27 of zzso however, no zzso zzso was observed in the zzso membrane in the same stage of pregnancy by quantitative real-time zzso zzso Both new zzso genes were possible to translate a mature protein in a zzso cell expression system with approximately 28 zzso in zzso and 38 zzso in zzso 

We identified the new members of bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and quantitative expression were confirmed in bovine zzso by in zzso zzso or real-time zzso Their different zzso and spatial expressions suggest a different role for these genes in bovine zzso during zzso
