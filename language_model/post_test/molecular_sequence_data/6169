zzso zzso factor zzso is an zzso coli protein associated with zzso zzso zzso which are formed at stationary growth phase or in slowly growing zzso zzso either zzso from zzso zzso or zzso by a chemical method was examined for its zzso By adding either natural or synthetic zzso to zzso zzso prepared from both zzso growing and stationary phase cells, zzso zzso zzso were generated in a zzso zzso zzso synthesis in zzso was inhibited zzso with the formation of zzso zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was inhibited in zzso Taken together we propose that zzso is a stationary zzso inhibitor of zzso functions and zzso zzso are stored forms of zzso
