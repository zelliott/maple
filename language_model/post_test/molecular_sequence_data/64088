The gene for zzso zzso of zzso tuberculosis was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso tuberculosis zzso strain zzso zzso The protein was expressed in inclusion bodies in high yield in zzso coli under the control of the zzso zzso Active zzso was obtained by zzso from zzso zzso and after a single zzso step the sample was zzso zzso homogeneous with a specific activity of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis confirmed the expected mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso indicated that it was a zzso zzso kinetic parameters were determined and the effect of pH and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso
