zzso S zzso zzso by zzso in zzso coli is a stationary phase specific zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso among the zzso coli zzso strains is an amber zzso that prematurely zzso zzso These zzso zzso would be expected to show no zzso zzso However, zzso free zzso zzso retain an intermediate zzso activity, a zzso S controlled zzso By analyzing the sequence of the zzso gene we zzso that a 277 zzso acids long zzso zzso of about 30 zzso can be translated from an internal secondary translation initiation region zzso zzso that is located downstream of the amber zzso By cloning this zzso zzso following the zzso function, and zzso sequence of this zzso zzso we report the presence of a functional internal STIR in zzso coli zzso from where a truncated but nevertheless functional form of zzso can be zzso
