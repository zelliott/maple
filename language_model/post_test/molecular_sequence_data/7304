zzso zzso zzso have been subdivided into zzso enteric zzso zzso and zzso infectious zzso viruses zzso on the basis of zzso zzso zzso a distinction has been made between type I and II zzso the latter of which more closely resemble canine coronavirus zzso To gain more insight into the genetic relationships between different zzso zzso we determined the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso unit of nine zzso The following observations were made: zzso The sequences are zzso zzso In this part of the zzso type I and II zzso are more closely related to each other than to zzso To explain the genetic and zzso differences between the spike genes of type I and II zzso we zzso that type II zzso have arisen by an zzso zzso event between a type I zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso are more similar to virulent zzso strains than to each zzso Our findings thus support the notion that zzso and zzso are not different species but merely zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an intact zzso indicating that zzso deletions are not a universal distinguishing property of zzso zzso zzso deletions readily occur in zzso zzso with loss of zzso By reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, we show that in naturally occurring zzso zzso is zzso Thus, zzso seems to provide a distinct selective advantage during natural zzso
