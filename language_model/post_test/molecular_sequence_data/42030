We used standard zzso analyses of zzso cells to identify a zzso of cells in primary zzso zzso with zzso of zzso 7 and zzso These cells are a minor zzso in the primary tumor but become the dominant population after treatment in zzso of the cells with the zzso agent zzso zzso The selection for a cell with this specific zzso zzso suggests that these zzso contain genes important to the growth of zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso analyses demonstrate an increased copy number of the genes zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso which have been mapped to zzso 7 and 22, zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso chain reaction zzso analysis demonstrates increased expression of these zzso In addition, these cells zzso a zzso factor that stimulates zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This factor is sensitive to zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and/or zzso mechanisms occur in human zzso zzso and that zzso of zzso may play a role in the growth of zzso cells in these zzso
