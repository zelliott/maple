zzso zzso zzso acquire iron by zzso zzso of host zzso However, the zzso by which iron is then transferred from the zzso to the zzso are zzso Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of a protein zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso In zzso we show that this protein is localized to the single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could only be generated in the presence of an expressed zzso zzso suggesting that the protein is zzso zzso zzso resulted in a growth zzso in zzso and led to a zzso increase in zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso remained viable when the zzso copy was zzso but were hypersensitive to zzso and displayed a growth zzso similar to that observed following zzso The conditional zzso also retained zzso in zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso These data provide strong evidence that zzso has a role in import of iron into the zzso of African zzso They also indicate that even when expression is greatly reduced, there is sufficient zzso or an alternative zzso to provide the zzso with an adequate supply of zzso zzso
