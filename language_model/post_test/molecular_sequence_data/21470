We present a high-quality zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a model species for zzso and zzso conflict zzso We compare this zzso with three previously zzso zzso of zzso from different zzso and focus our analyses on aspects of the zzso likely to be associated with known evolutionary zzso The first is the specialized zzso diet of zzso zzso where we find gene loss in the zzso zzso synthesis pathway, loss of zzso zzso and expansion of a group of zzso zzso One of these is a unique zzso contribution to the zzso fluid, which otherwise consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso that are unaffected by zzso zzso The second is multiple mating of queens and zzso competition, which may be associated with a greatly expanded zzso zzso gene zzso The third is sex determination, where we could identify only a single zzso of the zzso zzso As other zzso and the zzso have zzso of this zzso we zzso that this may partly explain the frequent production of zzso male larvae in zzso zzso The fourth is the evolution of zzso where we find a highly zzso zzso profile of zzso genes that may be related to zzso zzso These first analyses of the zzso zzso zzso indicate that considerable genetic changes are likely to have accompanied the transition from zzso to agricultural food production 50 million years ago, and the transition from single to multiple queen mating 10 million years zzso
