The zzso coding for mouse zzso zzso was zzso into the parental cells of a spontaneous zzso of zzso mice zzso and clones zzso small, zzso and large quantities of zzso were zzso In zzso both low and high producer clones do not display an enhanced ability to grow in zzso and zzso incompatible zzso Instead, the intensity of their rejection increases in function of the amount of zzso zzso After an initial growth period in zzso mice, high producer clones undergo complete rejection due to the combined action of zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso After this zzso mice are immune to a subsequent challenge with zzso This memory rests on a strong zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso Following the zzso mice also develop zzso zzso that guide the zzso in zzso memory zzso A direct comparison shows that although zzso clones engineered to release zzso activate zzso and no zzso zzso those engineered to release zzso activate a strong zzso response but not zzso The kind of zzso released by the tumors appears to determine the type of zzso However, zzso high producer cells do not zzso the immune memory, neither toward a zzso nor a zzso Both the zzso activity and the zzso responses induced by zzso high producer cells are the strongest so far observed in the zzso zzso
