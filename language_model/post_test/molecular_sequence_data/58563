zzso differentiation in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to involve a mechanism of zzso zzso that culminates with the formation of an aerial zzso We have identified a gene cluster designated zzso in which zzso and deletion zzso cause a block in aerial zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso defines a step in a cascade of zzso zzso colonies of a zzso strain zzso complement zzso zzso and are themselves zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is located at 5 o'clock on the genetic map and within zzso zzso zzso on the physical map, consists of five adjacent open reading zzso These genes specify zzso of the zzso of the zzso family of zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso Because zzso zzso zzso resistance to the toxic zzso zzso it is zzso that zzso is an zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso is responsible for the import of an zzso zzso zzso produced under the control of the zzso product of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in turn, causes the production of a second zzso signal zzso that depends on the products of zzso and zzso for its zzso
