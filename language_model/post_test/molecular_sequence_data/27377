An unresolved question in ecology concerns why the ecological effects of zzso vary in zzso Many introduced species fail to interact strongly with the recipient zzso whereas others profoundly disrupt the zzso they invade through zzso competition, and other zzso In the context of ecological impacts, research on biological zzso seldom considers zzso or zzso changes that occur following zzso Here, we show how plasticity in key life history traits zzso size and zzso together with zzso zzso the predatory impacts of an invasive social zzso zzso zzso on a largely endemic zzso zzso in zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso and behavioral approaches, we demonstrate zzso that zzso consume an astonishing diversity of zzso resources and zzso prey populations in invaded Hawaiian zzso and zzso that their impact as predators in this region increases when they shift from small annual colonies to large perennial zzso Such trait plasticity may influence invasion success and the degree of disruption that invaded zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso changes may help invaders to compensate for reductions in zzso potential resulting from founder events and small population zzso The dynamic nature of biological zzso zzso a more quantitative understanding of how zzso changes in zzso traits affect invasion zzso
