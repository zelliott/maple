zzso of Ho, the zzso mating switch zzso is restricted to a narrow time window of the cell zzso Ho is unstable and despite being a nuclear protein is exported to the zzso for zzso zzso We report here the molecular basis for the highly efficient nuclear import of Ho and the relation between its short zzso and passage through the zzso The Ho nuclear import machinery is functionally zzso being based on two zzso nuclear zzso signals, recognized by four zzso of the zzso import zzso Ho degradation is regulated by the DNA damage response and Ho retained in the zzso is zzso zzso that Ho acquires its crucial degradation signals in the zzso Ho arose by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the primary sequences of Ho and zzso zzso zzso shows that the Ho nuclear zzso signals are highly zzso in all Ho zzso but are absent from zzso zzso Thus adoption of a highly efficient import strategy occurred very early in the evolution of zzso This may have been a crucial factor in establishment of zzso in zzso and a key event in the rise of the zzso zzso zzso
