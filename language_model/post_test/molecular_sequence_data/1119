We have employed electron zzso zzso and molecular techniques to clarify the species of origin of the zzso zzso the remains of a large sea creature that zzso on the Chilean coast in July zzso zzso zzso revealed that the remains are largely composed of an zzso zzso network reminiscent of the collagen fiber network in whale zzso zzso acid analyses of an acid hydrolysate indicated that the fibers are composed of zzso zzso zzso and also contain zzso and zzso all diagnostic of zzso Using zzso designed to the zzso gene zzso an zzso product of the zzso chain reaction zzso was amplified from DNA that had been zzso from the zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso product was zzso identical to zzso of zzso whale zzso zzso These results unequivocally demonstrate that the Chilean zzso is the almost completely zzso remains of the zzso layer of a zzso zzso This identification is the same as those we have obtained before from other relics such as the so-called giant octopus of zzso Augustine zzso the zzso West Coast zzso two Bermuda zzso and the zzso zzso It is clear now that all of these zzso of popular and zzso interest are, in fact, the zzso remains of large zzso
