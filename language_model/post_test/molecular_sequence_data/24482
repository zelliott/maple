zzso expression systems have been extremely useful in zzso studies, allowing the expression of specific proteins in defined spatial and zzso zzso If these proteins are fused to an appropriate molecular tag, then they can be zzso or zzso without the need to raise specific zzso If the tag is inherently zzso then the proteins can even be zzso directly, in living zzso We have constructed a series of P zzso transformation zzso for the most widely used expression system in zzso zzso These zzso provide a series of useful tags for zzso zzso protein zzso and/or direct zzso together with a convenient multiple cloning site into which the zzso of interest can be zzso
