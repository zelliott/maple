zzso group box protein 1 zzso gene has a universal zzso function for zzso zzso innate immune responses and acts as a zzso zzso in the inflammatory zzso In an effort to identify the functional zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region zzso of the bovine zzso gene that affects the binding to its target zzso first, the expression of zzso zzso in different zzso and its candidate zzso was zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction results showed that the relative expression of zzso zzso in cows with the zzso zzso is significantly higher than those in cows with the zzso AA zzso The expression of zzso was significantly zzso by zzso zzso in the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with that in the healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso expression was directly targeted by zzso in human zzso kidney zzso T zzso zzso One novel zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso altering the binding of zzso and zzso was found to be associated with zzso count scores in zzso Taken together, the zzso zzso zzso was an advantageous zzso which can be used as a candidate functional marker for zzso resistance breeding zzso
