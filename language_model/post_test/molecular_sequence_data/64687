The protein zzso zzso is constituted by two zzso zzso and/or zzso and two regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso more than 300 proteins with important functions in the cell zzso This study has looked at the relation between zzso and zzso which is a regulator of the cell cycle and a known inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso human zzso but this zzso occurs only in the presence of the regulatory beta zzso The principal site of zzso is zzso Analysis using pull down and surface zzso resonance zzso techniques showed that zzso interacts with the beta zzso through two zzso present in the zzso and zzso ends, while CD zzso showed that zzso zzso by zzso affects its secondary zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso zzso by zzso probably involves a zzso event zzso by the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso may affect its biological zzso
