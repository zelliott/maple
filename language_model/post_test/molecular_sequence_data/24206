We identified 77 zzso clones zzso zzso proteins zzso from a zzso zzso zzso in a database zzso These zzso zzso ( zzso zzso were separated into seven groups based on DNA sequence zzso zzso analysis showed that these groups were divided into two novel zzso clearly distinguishable from higher plant zzso and zzso named zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso 1 lacked two zzso at the zzso positions observed in higher plant zzso or zzso zzso belonging to zzso zzso 2 contained two zzso as observed in higher plant zzso and zzso In zzso zzso 1, 12 zzso zzso in which one of two zzso is included, were deleted between boxes A and zzso Further, we determined the zzso structure of all of seven zzso zzso The sequences of zzso s of zzso zzso 1 contained one or two zzso whereas those of zzso zzso 2 contained no zzso Other zzso from zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso , and two moss zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso also fell into zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso 2, zzso No higher plant zzso and zzso were grouped into the zzso zzso 1 and 2 by our zzso Moreover, we revealed that zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso possess characteristic zzso which zzso are clearly distinguishable from higher plant zzso
