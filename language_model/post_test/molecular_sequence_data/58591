zzso zzso assist zzso zzso in promoting folding and assembly of other zzso Upon expression of zzso tuberculosis zzso in zzso coli we have zzso a zzso which, through zzso acid sequencing, was identified as the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso studies showed that its expression was specifically zzso upon cloning of different members of the zzso family, including zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso is but one of several proteins whose expression is modulated upon cloning of zzso zzso of zzso was also observed after exposure of normal cells, but not of zzso zzso to elevated temperatures zzso degrees zzso This allowed us to define zzso as a zzso protein zzso whose expression is dependent on the production of another zzso zzso Northern zzso experiments showed that enhanced expression of zzso was zzso to increased zzso of transcripts and that zzso zzso were devoid even of baseline levels of transcripts both at 37 degrees C and after temperature zzso These results show that zzso in addition to its established role in assisting protein folding may act as a zzso regulator and is likely to play an important role in modulating gene expression particularly in those conditions, like the stress response, in which its production is greatly zzso
