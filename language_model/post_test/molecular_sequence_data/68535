zzso DNA zzso E zzso zzso is a moderately zzso 3' to zzso zzso active on zzso DNA, that we have proposed to have a role in DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso Here we have examined its activity on a series of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso E was capable of efficiently zzso a primer strand zzso in an internal position, a zzso zzso In a zzso model system, calf DNA zzso zzso could successfully extend an upstream primer through a zzso zzso zzso to the end of the complementary template zzso in a reaction dependent on zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso E was blocked by zzso modification of the template zzso zzso displacement was completely prevented if the modified site was located just upstream of the zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso E was also reduced by zzso modification of the template zzso zzso competition experiments indicated that zzso DNA templates did not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that there is a short delay without zzso zzso before zzso of zzso E from zzso template zzso Interestingly, zzso E could zzso a primer if the zzso modification was on the template within the zzso zzso zzso explanations for this are zzso Taken together, these results are consistent with the proposal that zzso E zzso in DNA repair by zzso segments of damaged zzso
