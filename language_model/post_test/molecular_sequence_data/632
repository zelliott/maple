The function of the zzso E virus zzso open reading frame 3 zzso protein remains zzso To zzso the role of the zzso protein in the virus life cycle, an infectious zzso clone zzso that can replicate efficiently in zzso and zzso cells and release progeny into the culture medium was used to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso whose third zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso to zzso The zzso zzso in the culture medium of zzso zzso zzso cells was able to zzso and replicate within zzso and zzso cells as efficiently as the zzso zzso zzso However, less than zzso of the number of progeny was zzso in the culture medium of zzso zzso zzso cells compared with zzso zzso cells, and the zzso zzso level in the culture medium of zzso zzso zzso cells was below or near the limit of zzso An zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso protein is present on the surface of zzso zzso zzso but not on the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the culture zzso peaked at a zzso density of zzso g zzso in contrast with the zzso zzso in culture zzso which banded at zzso g zzso similar to zzso in cell zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is responsible for zzso zzso from infected cells and is present on the surface of released zzso zzso which may be associated with zzso
