To explore the genetic characteristics of viral zzso in zzso zzso infections among intravenous drug users zzso the zzso fragments of zzso zzso gene were amplified from plasma samples collected from 6 zzso infected persons using single zzso amplification and sequencing zzso zzso method, and 11 to 28 sequences were obtained from these samples, respectively, A zzso zzso tree was reconstructed to describe the genetic characteristics of viral zzso The zzso zzso zzso trees and diversity plots based on average zzso distance zzso were used to identify the zzso events between zzso The zzso sequences derived from single zzso formed a large zzso cluster in the zzso zzso tree and showed the complex zzso structures of viral zzso Of the 6 zzso infected patients, only one possessed the high genetic zzso whereas the other five individuals showed high zzso with two to four zzso inside the zzso cluster for each zzso In addition, the zzso events were identified among viral zzso from 3 zzso The results show zzso technique and zzso analyses are useful tool to investigate the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso variation and high genetic zzso
