To determine the genetic basis of dominant zzso diabetes zzso in two zzso 

zzso analysis by zzso sequencing of the promoter, the zzso untranslated region zzso and zzso of both zzso and zzso genes was carried out in two families with clinically diagnosed dominant diabetes zzso 

The novel zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso was present in several members of the two families in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso was also identified in three members of one of the families, and two of them carried both zzso in zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and the coexistence of zzso diabetes of the young zzso 2, zzso 3 and unusual zzso 2-3 zzso in the same zzso 

zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso a typical zzso 3 zzso and showed that the presence of a second zzso in the zzso gene apparently did not modify the clinical outcome, at least at the time of this zzso Our data show that zzso of zzso 2 and zzso 3 zzso should be considered, at least in some cases, for accurate genetic zzso
