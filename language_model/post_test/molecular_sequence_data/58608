The precise zzso of zzso caused by zzso junction obstruction is not yet known but there is convincing evidence for a genetic cause, with linkage analysis predicting a zzso zzso locus on zzso zzso In previous studies, a patient was described with a de zzso zzso zzso zzso and suffering from bilateral zzso zzso zzso zzso caused by a bilateral complete zzso junction zzso In an effort to zzso a possible correlation between this zzso and zzso zzso we have carried out an extensive molecular characterization of a zzso 19 zzso clone previously identified as spanning the zzso in this unique index zzso DNA sequencing across a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso indicates the presence of DNA sequences with a high degree of similarity to the zzso gene that encodes the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso structure of zzso consists of 10 zzso distributed over a DNA region of about 11 zzso The putative promoter region is zzso and lacks zzso and zzso boxes, suggesting that expression of the zzso gene may be controlled by a typical zzso gene zzso The zzso 19 zzso in the zzso patient appeared to have occurred in zzso 7 of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of a variety of human zzso revealed that the zzso gene is zzso zzso Furthermore, Northern zzso and zzso analysis of zzso isolated from lung zzso of the zzso patient failed to detect a fusion transcript involving zzso zzso suggesting gene disruption rather than the generation of a fusion gene as a possible underlying zzso
