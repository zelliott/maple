A zzso was zzso zzso to apparent zzso from culture zzso of zzso zzso by a series of column zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso as a zzso The molecular weight of the zzso was estimated to be 42,000 by zzso in the presence of zzso Studies on the zzso specificity with zzso zzso and natural peptides revealed that this zzso zzso zzso the zzso bond on the zzso side of either zzso or zzso zzso at the zzso position and zzso bulky zzso acids at zzso It was most active at pH zzso for the zzso of zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso or by zzso Based on the zzso toward zzso and zzso this zzso differs from zzso or zzso zzso hence it is a new type of zzso with specificity for zzso acids at zzso and zzso zzso
