zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso properties that was derived from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso We previously showed that increasing the net zzso of zzso zzso by substituting zzso for zzso and zzso zzso 3) increased the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso 3 forms an zzso structure consisting of an zzso random zzso region zzso zzso and an extended zzso region zzso zzso To investigate the zzso relationship of zzso 3, we zzso Pro for zzso zzso zzso and then examined the new zzso three-dimensional structure, zzso activity and mechanism of zzso zzso zzso had an zzso structure in the presence of zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso structure in zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso potential introduced by zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso exhibited about 4 times greater zzso activity than zzso zzso Fluorescence activated flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that incorporating a zzso into zzso 3 markedly reduced its membrane zzso so that it accumulated in the zzso without remaining in the cell zzso To investigate the zzso zzso we assessed its ability to release of zzso The result showed zzso zzso created a pore zzso zzso in diameter, which is similar to zzso zzso zzso scanning electron microscopic observation of zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso II exert similar effects on cell zzso whereas zzso 2 exerts a different, more damaging, zzso In addition, zzso zzso assumed a zzso structure in the presence of biological zzso and formed zzso in both bacterial and zzso zzso through which it entered the zzso and tightly bound to zzso These results indicate that the zzso region of zzso 3- Pro zzso is prerequisite for effective zzso activity and may facilitate easy penetration of the zzso zzso of the cell zzso
