zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli is growth zzso and zzso a specific stress zzso This is sensed and coordinated by a zzso factor zzso that in turn activates expression of the primary zzso of the stress response, a small regulatory zzso zzso This zzso zzso regulates the translation and stability of the zzso zzso which encodes the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso occurs through a zzso mechanism facilitated by the zzso zzso zzso Other host factors required for the regulation by zzso include the zzso zzso E and components of the zzso zzso particularly zzso a zzso zzso whose role in zzso degradation is currently not zzso There are many unanswered questions regarding the physiology of zzso stress, including the cellular signals and targets zzso However, it is clear that the small zzso zzso is required for adaptation to zzso The current model is that zzso promotes recovery by stopping the synthesis of zzso transport zzso which in turn limits the zzso of toxic zzso
