Two novel human zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and zzso zzso or zzso were discovered as part of a large scale zzso sequencing zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso and activated zzso libraries, zzso Both of the zzso were cloned into a zzso zzso and expressed in insect zzso The mature zzso zzso protein consists of 99 zzso acids and is most zzso to zzso inflammatory protein zzso showing 51% zzso It displays zzso activity on resting T zzso and zzso a minimal but significant activity on zzso and is negative on activated T zzso zzso is also a potent zzso of bone zzso low zzso potential zzso cells, a committed zzso that gives rise to zzso and zzso zzso The mature zzso zzso has 93 zzso acid zzso and shows 39 and zzso identity with zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso It displays zzso activity on resting T zzso a minimal activity on zzso and is negative on zzso and activated T zzso On zzso zzso produces a transient rise of zzso zzso and uses the zzso for zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso strongly suppressed the colony formation by the high zzso potential zzso cell zzso which represents a zzso zzso zzso
