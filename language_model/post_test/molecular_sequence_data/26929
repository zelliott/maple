zzso zzso replacement therapy for zzso storage diseases requires a zzso zzso with highly zzso zzso zzso human zzso A is a potentially therapeutic zzso for zzso zzso zzso has been produced by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a host, and the zzso zzso was tested for its replacement effect on cultured zzso derived from zzso zzso Although the therapeutic effect was observed, in order to obtain the higher therapeutic effect with a little dose as possible, increased zzso of zzso zzso A zzso is suggested to be zzso In the budding zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso which encodes a positive regulator of zzso zzso led to increased zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned zzso a zzso gene to zzso based on the zzso sequence of zzso zzso We zzso the cloned gene under the control of the alcohol zzso promoter in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso by zzso liquid zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso caused a zzso increase in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso prepared from strains zzso zzso was more effectively incorporated into cultured zzso and neural cells, and it more rapidly zzso the accumulated zzso as compared to the control zzso These results suggest that zzso A produced in a strain that zzso zzso will act as an effective zzso for use in replacement therapy of zzso
