zzso lacking previous exposure to zzso zzso typically have a high frequency of zzso T cells in peripheral blood, which zzso with zzso from other zzso We studied a large number of zzso human T cell clones from zzso and zzso donors to determine whether this response is zzso and might therefore be generated by a limited number of zzso zzso Most clones responded well to zzso zzso from three zzso distinct stocks of zzso zzso zzso derived from the same donor tended to show similar patterns of zzso to a panel of zzso zzso from various zzso suggesting that a limited number of zzso were recognized by zzso However, analysis of the usage of V segments of the beta chain of the zzso zzso revealed no evidence of zzso restriction in the T cell response, either within individual donors or across all zzso An apparent skewing towards zzso in one donor was shown by two methods to be due to in zzso expansion of a single zzso zzso zzso sorting of zzso zzso T cells from fresh zzso did not reveal any enrichment for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso regions revealed that the zzso clones were zzso zzso of zzso clones from this donor showed major differences in the zzso zzso zzso No differences in zzso repertoire between zzso and exposed donors were zzso These results exclude the existence of a zzso zzso and suggest that the T cell response to malaria zzso zzso in zzso donors is driven by a large number of zzso
