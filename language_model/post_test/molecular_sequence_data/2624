zzso are a group of zzso proteins that are zzso in the zzso of developing zzso zzso These proteins are zzso by a large number of genes located on several zzso based upon the number of zzso that have been isolated, zzso gene regulation is zzso Comparisons of gene zzso regions reveal zzso sequences that may be important for their zzso Studies of transformed plant zzso support the assertion that zzso elements with the zzso zzso regions of zzso genes are required for accurate zzso Although the genes are transcribed in transgenic tobacco and zzso plants, they are not properly zzso This appears to be due to zzso effects rather than protein or zzso zzso
