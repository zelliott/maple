The zzso zzso strain of the zzso zzso zzso grows well at 28 degrees C but not at 37 degrees zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso exhibited swelling at zzso zzso after a zzso from 28 degrees C to 37 degrees zzso The temperature sensitivity and zzso swelling zzso through zzso as expected for a single zzso factor, designated zzso zzso zzso Both defects could be suppressed by the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso suggesting that the zzso gene product is required for proper zzso zzso Chemical analysis of the cell walls, however, failed to detect any clear difference in the composition of the zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso A DNA zzso which zzso the zzso zzso was cloned and zzso The predicted protein in the zzso essential for zzso of zzso is a novel zzso
