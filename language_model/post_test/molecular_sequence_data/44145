A critical outcome of zzso disease is degradation of the zzso zzso ligament that connects teeth to bone in the dental zzso zzso diseases occur in response to bacterial colonization of the teeth, but their molecular zzso is still zzso One family of zzso known as the zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the degradation of the zzso zzso zzso which are also suspected to play a role in many other zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso cells surrounding the teeth and are found in relative abundance in zzso and zzso near zzso diseased zzso Since most zzso are zzso as inactive zzso which may be activated by limited zzso it has been suggested that zzso expressed by the infecting zzso pathogens might activate zzso host zzso to initiate or accelerate degradation of the zzso zzso zzso The aim of this work was to examine interactions between zzso host zzso and bacterial zzso In this article, we demonstrate that a zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso zzso and zzso and can catalyze the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso of these zzso is demonstrated to result from initial zzso within their zzso Also, for zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso following a zzso zzso at a previously zzso site which, for both zzso is one zzso zzso to the known zzso zzso zzso These data describe a mode of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso that involves zzso of zzso zzso
