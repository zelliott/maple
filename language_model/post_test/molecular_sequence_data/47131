The protein zzso zzso zzso zzso can initiate the repair of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The human gene zzso zzso this zzso has at least four zzso sites, one of which results in two major zzso with either an zzso zzso or a Val zzso at zzso acid position zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso are similar in Caucasian zzso but a predominance of the zzso zzso exists in Asian and African zzso zzso of the zzso activities of the zzso and zzso zzso in red blood cell zzso show that the higher specific activity and zzso of the zzso zzso is balanced by the potentially zzso higher zzso affinity of the zzso zzso In a preliminary attempt to find an association between zzso frequency at the zzso locus and healthy aging, we compared the distribution of zzso in a healthy older population of zzso Jewish individuals with that in a younger ethnically matched control zzso We found that zzso of the healthy older population had the zzso zzso greater than the 50% expected by zzso zzso suggesting a possible selection for having both zzso of the repair zzso in successful zzso Three additional zzso in zzso regions of the zzso gene were found to be zzso and demonstrated zzso association in a specific zzso with the zzso 119 zzso Finally, we also detected a zzso zzso in the zzso branch site of zzso 2 that did not appear to affect zzso This study will help define the normal zzso range of activity for this repair zzso and give us a better understanding of its role in the processes of aging and zzso
