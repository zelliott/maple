The development of T helper zzso and regulatory T zzso cells is zzso regulated by zzso zzso growth factor zzso alone zzso zzso zzso cells, but together with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is a key zzso that affects differentiation of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso predominantly produced by zzso cells, zzso with zzso to differentiate zzso zzso T cells into zzso cells, while zzso zzso by zzso cells is regulated by zzso Interestingly, zzso enhances the zzso functions of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso and absence of zzso signaling zzso the zzso activity of zzso in zzso leading to an increase in zzso cells and worsening of experimental zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso effects on zzso and zzso is through zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Our findings highlight a role of zzso as a regulator of zzso versus protective mechanisms of immune zzso
