We have recently shown that the locus of zzso zzso zzso of the bovine zzso zzso coli zzso zzso resides within a large zzso island zzso integrated in the vicinity of the zzso zzso gene zzso Here we describe an zzso but zzso zzso island in zzso in the vicinity of another zzso zzso zzso zzso the sequence of which is identical to zzso These two zzso islands revealed identity of the left, but a relative zzso of their right end zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso distribution in zzso coli, we zzso similar junctions in the zzso zzso of additional zzso and zzso strains the LEE location of which had not been determined zzso By zzso of zzso restriction fragments with zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the LEE was found linked to either one of these two zzso The results agreed well with recently published zzso data and indicate that in the clones of zzso zzso coli zzso Dec 11 and Dec 12, forming the zzso cluster zzso 2, and in the strains of the most typical zzso of the Dec 8, belonging to the zzso cluster zzso 2, the LEE was linked with zzso and not with the zzso locus as previously zzso zzso comparison with other zzso and zzso zzso islands from different zzso coli zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso as well as from zzso indicated the same structural features at the zzso These zzso structures suggested a common DNA zzso serving as common vehicle for horizontal gene transfer of various zzso In addition, the elements suggest an origin from a common zzso zzso and integration into the zzso through zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso islands played an important role in the evolution of several zzso in zzso coli and related zzso
