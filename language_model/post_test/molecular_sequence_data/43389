zzso zzso constitute one of the fastest evolving protein families in zzso The addition of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso in comparison with bovine pancreatic zzso zzso zzso could have zzso significance in zzso We have cloned and expressed human pancreatic zzso in zzso coli to probe the influence of the zzso extension and neighboring zzso zzso on the zzso properties of the zzso zzso of the zzso extension from zzso yielded an zzso zzso with enhanced ability to cleave zzso zzso also exhibited a steep increase in zzso stability mimicking that known for zzso zzso zzso zzso had significantly low zzso stability compared to zzso zzso The study identifies the zzso boundary in the human pancreatic zzso required for efficient zzso
