This study reports the complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso an zzso isolated from a zzso Although closely related to human zzso zzso virus type 2 zzso the level of sequence diversity confirms that zzso is sufficiently distinct to be considered a member of a different virus species rather than a zzso strain of zzso zzso comparison with other zzso at several levels supports the hypothesis that zzso and zzso zzso with their respective human and zzso hosts and raises questions regarding the evolutionary origins of zzso
