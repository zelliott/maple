The process of zzso zzso the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones) is fundamental to zzso processes such as zzso development and repair, as well as to pathological conditions such as tumor zzso zzso arthritis and zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain, a specific marker of zzso consists of 91 zzso acid zzso that are inserted by alternative zzso into the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso structure of the zzso domain is reported and reveals important differences from other zzso type III zzso A comparison of the zzso domain with the crystal structure of a zzso zzso zzso shows the novel features of zzso to be located in loop regions that are buried at zzso zzso and which therefore largely determine the global shape of the zzso zzso The zzso charged zzso acids in this highly zzso protein are zzso distributed over the molecular surface, with the sole exception of a zzso zzso patch that represents a potential specific recognition zzso zzso mapping with 82 zzso that span the zzso sequence revealed that three zzso zzso zzso which selectively target newly forming blood vessels in zzso mice, bind to adjacent regions on the zzso zzso 

The zzso structure enables the identification of a large surface area of the zzso domain that appears to be accessible in zzso opening up new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso Furthermore, the mapping of specific zzso zzso to the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain, and their use in zzso zzso experiments, provides a basis for further investigation of the role of the zzso domain in the formation of new blood zzso
