The zzso is a zzso complex that zzso the zzso and deletion of zzso that occurs during zzso editing in zzso We report the identification of nine novel zzso proteins in zzso zzso They were identified by mass zzso analysis of functional zzso that were zzso by serial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific to the zzso zzso zzso or tandem affinity zzso based on a zzso zzso editing zzso The newly identified proteins have zzso and/or zzso binding motifs suggesting zzso function for at least some of zzso Five of the proteins are zzso as are two others, and one is related to four previously identified zzso zzso The implications of these findings are zzso
