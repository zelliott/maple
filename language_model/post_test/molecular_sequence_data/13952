zzso zzso necrosis virus zzso causes a highly zzso economically important disease of salmon and zzso The virus is zzso throughout western North America, and has been spread to Asia and zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes of 12 diverse zzso zzso were determined in order to examine the molecular zzso of zzso the primary structure and conservation of zzso and the evolution of the zzso The G and zzso genes and their zzso proteins were highly zzso with a maximum zzso zzso divergence of zzso and zzso and zzso acid divergence of zzso and zzso zzso Conservation of zzso protein sequence zzso zzso acids in zzso confirms that the protein is functional and plays an important role in virus zzso The zzso relationship of viruses was found to correlate with the geographic origin of virus zzso rather than with host species or time of zzso These data are consistent with stable maintenance of virus in zzso zzso Two main zzso genetic lineages were zzso one in the Columbia River zzso zzso Washington and zzso the other in the Sacramento River zzso zzso The first major zzso outbreak in zzso salmon in 1973 in the Columbia River was genetically linked to zzso of zzso fish eggs from the Sacramento River where outbreaks in zzso salmon are zzso However, the introduced virus apparently did not persist, subsequent virus outbreaks in Columbia River zzso salmon being associated with Columbia River genetic zzso In general, virus zzso zzso zzso profiles and zzso relationships correlated zzso
