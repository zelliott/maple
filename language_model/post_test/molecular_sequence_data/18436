The zzso zzso bacteria, zzso zzso is considered as the most important zzso in relation to copper and uranium zzso zzso Since zzso zzso is a strict zzso zzso its genetic manipulation is a very hard zzso Until now, all efforts have been zzso zzso we decided to approach the problem in steps, trying initially to manipulate some zzso zzso related zzso We chose zzso zzso that shares its habitat with zzso zzso and zzso zzso for its zzso nature that makes them easier to grow and suitable for zzso zzso The main objective of this work was directed towards the isolation and characterization of zzso promoters from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Four different promoters from zzso zzso and four from zzso zzso were isolated and zzso In order to test their functional capacity in bacterial systems different from zzso coli, they were zzso and transferred to other zzso One of these zzso plasmids was successfully transferred to zzso zzso and from it to zzso zzso The zzso promoter was able to zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso
