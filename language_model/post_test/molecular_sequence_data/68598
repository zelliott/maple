zzso zzso B and zzso zzso are zzso of common zzso zzso which respectively cause human zzso fever and zzso In order to define zzso and zzso relationships in this group, we examined representative strains for restriction zzso length zzso zzso in and around the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the five to zzso zzso sites of the zzso DNA zzso sequence zzso One of four zzso zzso profiles was zzso and was shared by the majority of zzso irrespective of their designation as zzso zzso B or zzso zzso On the other hand, thirteen unique zzso profiles were found and this technique was able to zzso for the first time, distinct zzso for zzso zzso B and zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso B profiles, zzso represented a zzso zzso Greater diversity was detected within zzso profiles of zzso zzso than within those of zzso zzso zzso zzso profiles described a zzso complex in which strains of both zzso could be zzso They constituted zzso molecular zzso which could be compared in a zzso database suitable for molecular zzso zzso
