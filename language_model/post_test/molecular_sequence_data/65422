zzso which is zzso in cancer cells and is zzso by zzso possesses a zzso zzso binding affinity and binds to the zzso promoters of tumor zzso genes in cancer cells with zzso and zzso suggesting suppression of these genes and maintenance of zzso status which leads to zzso Recently, it was reported that the human zzso of zzso is different from zzso but not from zzso Because zzso is the gene symbol of zzso the claim is a little zzso that is, zzso and zzso are zzso Because the previously published zzso structure of the zzso gene needed to be revised and the registered zzso sequence zzso contains two rare zzso or sequence zzso we think that confusion could zzso Here we show the revised zzso gene structure and zzso zzso in this zzso Our conclusion is that the human zzso of zzso is zzso whose gene symbol is zzso
