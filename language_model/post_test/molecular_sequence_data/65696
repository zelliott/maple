zzso zzso zzso is a global regulator that controls genes involved in nitrogen zzso By zzso screening 10 new zzso targets were identified, including zzso for ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso zzso zzso zzso and a number of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the zzso zzso a zzso binding site which comprises the sequence zzso has been zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso activates or zzso the expression of its target zzso Furthermore, zzso expression itself was shown to be zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso with ammonium and nitrate as the sole nitrogen source revealed that zzso is not only involved in ammonium zzso but also in ammonium zzso blast analysis demonstrated that zzso proteins are present in different zzso containing the zzso gene with the zzso zzso binding zzso By DNA binding studies, it was zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is able to interact with these zzso upstream zzso We therefore suggest that zzso regulation is not restricted to zzso but constitutes a zzso zzso in many zzso
