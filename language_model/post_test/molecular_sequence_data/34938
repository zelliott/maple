Many recent advances in biology and medicine have resulted from DNA sequence alignment zzso and zzso Traditional approaches for the matching of DNA sequences are based either on global alignment schemes or zzso schemes that seek to approximate global alignment zzso while providing higher zzso zzso This report describes an approach using the mathematical operation of zzso to compare zzso It can be implemented using the fast zzso transform for zzso zzso The zzso is summarized and sample applications are zzso These include gene sequence alignment in long stretches of zzso DNA, finding sequence similarity in zzso related organisms, demonstrating sequence similarity in the presence of massive zzso zzso random point zzso comparing sequences related by internal zzso zzso zzso within a zzso and investigating fusion zzso Application to zzso and protein sequence alignment is also zzso The method is efficient, sensitive, and zzso being able to find sequence similarities where other alignment zzso may perform zzso
