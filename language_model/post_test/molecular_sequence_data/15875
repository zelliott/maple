Genes whose expression is restricted to zzso and early development may have important functions in these zzso Northern analysis showed that zzso B4 zzso is expressed in zzso and zzso through to the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed that B4 protein is only zzso in zzso zzso it is localized to zzso and is associated with zzso zzso zzso revealed approximately constant levels of B4 protein per zzso for the first 2 days of zzso Thus, as the number of zzso increases during early development, the amount of B4 protein per nucleus is diluted zzso zzso of two B4 zzso clones revealed that the predicted B4 translation product is a zzso protein with zzso identity with zzso zzso distributed over the entire length of its zzso The B4 protein also has certain other zzso protein zzso zzso structure consisting of a mainly zzso central domain flanked by an zzso segment and a long zzso zzso tail containing a zzso repeated zzso acid zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso B4 zzso has a classic zzso zzso is zzso and lacks the zzso zzso 3' zzso consensus sequence involved in zzso zzso
