The extraordinary invasive capability is a major cause of treatment failure and tumor recurrence in zzso however, the molecular and cellular mechanisms governing zzso invasion remain poorly zzso Evidence in other cell systems has implicated the regulatory role of zzso in cell zzso and invasion, which promotes us to investigate the biological functions of zzso in zzso in this zzso 

We have found that zzso is dramatically zzso in clinical zzso of zzso and is zzso correlated with the tumor pathological grading in the current zzso The cells zzso by zzso expression zzso have demonstrated retarded cell zzso Using a zzso analysis approach, zzso zzso containing protein zzso 1 zzso a well-known cell zzso zzso has been identified as the target of zzso A zzso reporter zzso was used to confirm that zzso targeted directly the zzso of zzso gene and zzso the zzso expression in zzso human zzso cell zzso Furthermore, experiments have shown that the decreased cell mobility was due to the zzso zzso zzso and the reduced cell surface ruffle in zzso zzso zzso These results are similar to the cellular responses of zzso zzso cells to the treatment of zzso an inhibitor of ROCK zzso Moreover, a zzso active zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells reversed the effects of zzso Our results revealed a novel mechanism that zzso zzso zzso cells migration and invasion via zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may function as zzso and zzso influence in zzso and provides a potential approach for developing zzso therapeutic strategies for zzso zzso zzso
