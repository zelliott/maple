zzso zzso possesses an alternative zzso of zzso zzso which is different from the known bacterial and zzso zzso In a previous paper zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified and characterized zzso zzso which zzso the first reaction step in this pathway, and we cloned the corresponding zzso Here we focused on the fifth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was zzso tentatively as a zzso zzso zzso zzso with high activity for zzso The gene zzso this zzso was cloned and shown to be located on the zzso of zzso zzso separately from a gene cluster containing the zzso zzso zzso in contrast with zzso zzso in which both genes are located in the same gene zzso Higher zzso efficiency of zzso was found with zzso and zzso zzso among the tested zzso zzso In zzso zzso analysis with the zzso zzso a single active band was found at the same position as the zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso of the gene did not grow on zzso These results indicated that this zzso gene was the only gene of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In the zzso tree of the zzso family, zzso zzso from zzso zzso falls into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several putative zzso zzso from other bacteria belong to a different zzso zzso from zzso suggesting strongly that their zzso zzso for zzso are acquired independently during the evolutionary zzso This is the first evidence of unique zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
