zzso zzso zzso elements zzso are the major internal spontaneous zzso agents for the zzso of zzso zzso To address the general issue of whether zzso mediate zzso changes in zzso zzso we scanned two zzso per each of the six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the presence of zzso insertions by zzso walking and sequence zzso We also scanned thirteen zzso zzso zzso genes for TE insertions by in zzso mapping and literature zzso 

Twelve novel zzso including zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso (short zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso one full-length zzso zzso and one full-length zzso DNA zzso are identified from the zzso of the six zzso zzso zzso zzso The twelve zzso are inserted into the zzso region, zzso region, zzso or zzso of the six zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso seven out of the eight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso resistance are associated with a variety of zzso By contrast, all the five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso regulation are free of TE zzso 

These results indicate that zzso are selectively retained within or in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso
