Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells were observed to display transient inward zzso currents of average zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso which activated at zzso more than zzso zzso and peak inward currents were observed at zzso equal to or more than zzso zzso zzso zzso currents in these cells were eliminated after treatment with 500 or 50 zzso zzso zzso whereas 5 zzso zzso resulted in 64 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using DNA zzso designed to bind to the rat brain zzso zzso channel zzso we amplified specific zzso chain reaction zzso fragments from zzso zzso The cloning and sequencing of two of these fragments confirmed the presence of an zzso expressed zzso channel gene in these cells, which we have termed zzso zzso zzso of the DNA sequence of zzso 1 zzso fragments with other known zzso channel genes indicated a high degree of zzso with rat brain zzso channel zzso Northern blots using zzso generated from the zzso 1 zzso fragments revealed the presence of a specific zzso zzso in these zzso The molecular and zzso data suggest that the zzso 1 zzso channel gene from zzso cells is closely related to zzso zzso zzso
