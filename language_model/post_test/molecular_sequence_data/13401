We have generated a zzso transgenic zzso mouse model in which the zzso locus has been replaced with a rearranged zzso coding for the heavy chain of an zzso zzso In these mice, B cells expressing the zzso specificity are zzso zzso We observe a novel mechanism for B cell zzso zzso editing at the heavy chain zzso In most zzso B cells, the inserted zzso zzso gene has been replaced by the upstream zzso zzso or zzso or both genes through zzso with the zzso embedded at the 3' end of most zzso zzso Three types of zzso events have been zzso zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences revealed features of classical zzso zzso namely N sequence addition and zzso zzso A zzso zzso was found 12 zzso upstream of the embedded zzso This zzso may represent a novel zzso signal sequence used for zzso zzso The zzso model thus provides direct evidence for secondary zzso at zzso This process may play a role in tolerance by editing zzso receptors and may also serve to diversify the zzso zzso
