The reaction product of zzso acid and the zzso zzso (the major component of zzso zzso has been investigated by zzso zzso zzso By comparison with the zzso zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid complexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso it is found that the zzso zzso is zzso via a zzso complex of two zzso both forming zzso zzso ring cycles zzso this contrasts with previous zzso Based upon zzso constraints we propose that preferential zzso the zzso zzso occurs via the zzso of the zzso side zzso The zzso and zzso for zzso of zzso acid to zzso and zzso have been determined, from the temperature dependence of the appropriate equilibrium constants, and used in conjunction with zzso zzso calculations on model compounds, to understand prior conflicting proposals for zzso acid zzso zzso zzso derived pH dependent equilibrium zzso and zzso zzso calculations have been used to understand the reasons for the inefficiency of zzso acid to zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso per 3 zzso repeat units are required for a viscous gel suitable as a zzso zzso the most zzso sites on the component zzso zzso and zzso are precluded from reaction by the nature of the zzso zzso the comparable acidity zzso of the remaining zzso alcohol zzso and the water zzso results in a competition between zzso and zzso zzso a significant fraction of the zzso acid is ineffective in zzso zzso due to the modest equilibrium zzso In contrast to prior work, we present evidence for the reaction of alcohols with zzso acid, rather than the zzso zzso Based upon the results obtained for zzso acid, alternative zzso agents are zzso
