Baby zzso kidney cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso to zzso and zzso zzso To further characterize zzso cell zzso we generated a panel of zzso zzso zzso consisting of different zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis using these zzso revealed that zzso for zzso are expressed on both B and T cell lines and also normal B and T zzso In zzso cells, the expression of zzso zzso began on zzso zzso cells in bone zzso The zzso site of zzso for zzso was mapped to zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso containing zzso zzso 1 and 2 bound target cells and zzso sets of zzso similar to zzso containing zzso zzso 1 to 3 or all 7 zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso containing zzso zzso 2 to 3 or 3 to 7 did not bind either B or T zzso Furthermore, B cells apparently expressed higher levels of zzso zzso than that of T cells, suggesting a potential competition for zzso binding between zzso expressed on the same B cell and those expressed on another B cell or T zzso zzso experiments using the zzso identified zzso itself and the B zzso zzso of zzso zzso as two of the zzso zzso expressed on B zzso Thus, zzso may potentially regulate B cell zzso through interactions with itself or zzso
