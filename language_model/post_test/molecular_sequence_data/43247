zzso is an abundant, highly zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that two proteins of 116 zzso and 80 zzso zzso with zzso from mouse T zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein revealed high similarity to an incomplete human open reading frame that has been suggested to zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We determined the zzso sequence of the mouse zzso and observed that it encodes a protein product nearly identical to its human zzso and shares an active site consensus sequence with Family 31 zzso zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso followed by molecular zzso revealed high zzso to human and bovine zzso zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso developed to the mouse zzso allowed us to demonstrate that the interaction between zzso and zzso II can be zzso in zzso in an zzso zzso zzso The strong interaction between zzso II and zzso may provide a paradigm for investigating novel aspects of the biology of these zzso
