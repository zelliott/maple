The major zzso protein of zzso zzso the human zzso is a highly zzso zzso protein that has a pore forming activity that is thought to be essential for the attachment of the zzso to host zzso zzso By gene analysis, we have demonstrated that this protein belongs to a zzso family, and we have obtained zzso and zzso information for two of these zzso The zzso proteins are composed of tandem zzso of alternating 50- and zzso zzso within which the positioning of the zzso zzso is highly zzso This structure resembles that of four zzso core domain zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso protein family differs in being composed of multiple zzso of this type zzso in zzso 17 in zzso An analysis of the relationship between the zzso and a comparison of the fine arrangement of the zzso suggests that zzso has arisen relatively recently following zzso of the zzso zzso which itself arose by zzso of a zzso zzso
