The zzso zzso appears to zzso proteins that enhance the ability of zzso coli zzso to survive under zzso zzso Although the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso behavior remain to be zzso findings from structural zzso studies have shown that the structure of zzso the protein zzso by the zzso zzso is zzso to that of the zzso that mediates zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso We now report the first detailed examination of the zzso kinetic behavior and zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso Our studies confirm that zzso is a zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso appears to be more stringent than the corresponding zzso zzso in zzso in employing zzso and zzso as zzso We also report the effects of replacing zzso in the zzso active site with the zzso zzso that occupies an equivalent position in the zzso coli zzso The results of these experiments show that zzso zzso zzso binding to a site that mediates zzso zzso for zzso In addition, the replacement of zzso by zzso yields an zzso zzso for which zzso zzso zzso is modified to resemble that seen for zzso Our findings illustrate the utility of structural zzso in assigning zzso function and raise the question of whether zzso zzso takes place in zzso coli upon the zzso of the zzso zzso under zzso zzso
