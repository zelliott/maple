zzso finger protein zzso factors zzso zzso have been designed to control the expression of zzso genes in a variety of zzso However, thus far the use of engineered zzso zzso in zzso transgenic settings has been restricted to zzso Here we report that zzso zzso can regulate gene expression in transgenic zzso To demonstrate this, we targeted the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene with a zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso domain from zzso zzso virus, and zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso binding domain zzso Delta zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in zzso effects on zzso regulation, as deduced from changes in the zzso pattern and intensity of zzso and en gene zzso and from the zzso analysis of first zzso zzso These data demonstrate the utility of zzso zzso as tools for controlling gene expression in the context of a zzso zzso
