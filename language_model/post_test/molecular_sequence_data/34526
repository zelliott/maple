A method to reconstruct the energy landscape of small peptides is presented with reference to a two-dimensional zzso zzso The starting point is a statistical analysis of the zzso distances between generic zzso and directly connected pairs zzso As the mutual distance of zzso is typically much smaller than that of generic pairs, a metric criterion can be established to identify the great majority of zzso zzso and limits of this approach are thoroughly analyzed for three different zzso zzso A zzso structure of the energy landscape is found in all of the three cases, but the escape rates clearly reveal that the native zzso is more easily accessible (and is significantly more zzso for the sequence that is expected to behave as a real zzso
