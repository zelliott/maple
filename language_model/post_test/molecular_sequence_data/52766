The zzso zzso of zzso zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso are released into the zzso by regulated zzso zzso after which they enter the nucleus to activate genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zinc zzso that zzso zzso at a zzso zzso zzso In the current study, we use zzso methods to zzso the zzso within the zzso zzso segment that are required for zzso by zzso The studies reveal a requirement for an zzso sequence in the middle third of the zzso zzso We propose a model in which the zzso sequence serves as an zzso cap for a portion of the zzso zzso of zzso allowing the remainder of the zzso to unwind partially to expose the zzso bond for zzso by zzso
