The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso have identical zzso binding sites and zzso zzso However, differences in their first 100 zzso acids result in zzso different zzso zzso for zzso We constructed zzso to identify those zzso acid sequences that contribute to the high affinity zzso zzso and low affinity zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained permutations of six zzso regions zzso including the zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso and the hinge domain zzso zzso The exchange of zzso along with zzso switched the zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and vice versa, suggesting that the zzso with the highest zzso between the two zzso determine their affinity for zzso The high affinity zzso zzso zzso was also obtained by a specific substitution within the hinge zzso zzso with the sequence of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were activated at up to zzso lower zzso zzso than zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso of all zzso constructed, empirical weighting factors have been calculated that zzso describe the contribution of the individual zzso zzso zzso to the high affinity zzso zzso zzso
