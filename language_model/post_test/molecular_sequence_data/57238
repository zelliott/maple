The alpha zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been characterized initially by an increased zzso to zzso of the alpha zzso V domain junction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Until now, it has been found associated invariably with a low expression level of the corresponding alpha zzso Among 61 zzso investigated in French and North African individuals or zzso we observed 19 zzso with the alpha zzso zzso With no single exception, the latter displayed a point zzso in zzso 40 zzso zzso at position alpha zzso According to the triple zzso model of zzso structure, this change accounts for the zzso zzso zzso zzso the entire alpha V domain zzso disclosed, in addition, a partial skipping of zzso zzso At the gene level, a substitution zzso was evidenced at zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso appeared linked to the zzso 40 zzso in 17 zzso again with no single exception, among 53 examined zzso We hypothesized that the lack of zzso 46 would hamper the nucleation process and eventually account for the low expression zzso The present doubly zzso zzso was renamed zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso
