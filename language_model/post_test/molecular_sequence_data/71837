A novel locus in the human zzso syndrome zzso region encodes the imprinted zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the mouse zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso putative zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso that suggest function as a zzso By the use of zzso across an zzso zzso tandem repeat and zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is expressed only from the paternal zzso in brain, heart and zzso Similarly, zzso is expressed in differentiated cells derived from zzso embryonic stem cells and normal zzso but not those from zzso embryonic stem zzso We zzso that the zzso imprint may be set, at least in part, by the zzso activity of zzso in zzso and zzso male germ zzso zzso zzso is a novel imprinted gene that may play a role in the imprinted zzso of mouse models of zzso
