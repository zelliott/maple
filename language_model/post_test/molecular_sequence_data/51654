When human zzso cells are placed in zzso zzso and treated with a zzso the zzso membrane is zzso and the nuclear membrane is zzso However, the zzso remain intact and maintain both replication and zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso against zzso have been diffused into this system and used to measure the amount of zzso present in the zzso It has previously been shown that the amount of zzso present decreases due to relaxation by zzso I and increases as the level of zzso zzso Here we measure the formation of zzso in the zzso gene by zzso the zzso to DNA using laser radiation at zzso zzso for 10 zzso The zzso DNA is isolated by restriction zzso separation of zzso labeled zzso through the zzso zzso and subsequent zzso to remove the zzso zzso Three zzso restriction fragments of the zzso gene are shown to form zzso when the cell is zzso zzso The zzso forming segments are near the promoter regions of the zzso However, when zzso cells start to differentiate and zzso of the zzso gene is zzso the zzso content goes to zzso levels within zzso zzso
