The fourth zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the TM zzso has been zzso zzso of the synthetic product under zzso conditions gave a single major zzso The zzso bonding pattern of the zzso oxidized domain was zzso zzso zzso which is the same as that found in zzso zzso zzso was tested for TM zzso activity because deletion and substitution zzso experiments have shown that the fourth zzso domain of TM is essential for TM zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso activity in two zzso systems, both for zzso of zzso zzso formation, and for zzso activity in zzso zzso of protein zzso A preliminary structure of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso distance zzso zzso geometry calculations yielded a single zzso zzso The structure resembles the structure of zzso and other known zzso zzso but has some key zzso The central zzso zzso is zzso despite the differences in the number of zzso acids in the zzso The zzso loop formed by the zzso bond between zzso and zzso in zzso is five zzso acids longer than the analogous loop between zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This loop appears to have a different fold in zzso than in zzso zzso The loop forms the two outside strands of a broken, irregular zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso lie between the two strands forming the middle strand of the zzso Thus, although the zzso of zzso protein forms one of the outside strands of a zzso zzso sheet, the zzso of zzso forms the inside strand of an irregular zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were shown to be critical for zzso activity by zzso scanning zzso all lie in a patch near the zzso loop, and are zzso zzso The other critical zzso zzso and zzso are largely buried and appear to play essential structural rather than functional zzso
