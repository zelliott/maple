zzso targeted zzso has shown promise as an approach to treat zzso However, many known zzso zzso are not expressed as integral membrane proteins and cannot be zzso as targets for zzso zzso In order to expand the limited target range of zzso we have constructed a soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein designated zzso This fusion protein is comprised of a zzso zzso zzso specific for a zzso zzso of the human zzso tumor zzso zzso which is zzso in a broad range of human zzso The zzso fusion protein has been expressed at high levels in zzso cells, and zzso quantities have been zzso zzso zzso binding properties are maintained in the zzso zzso zzso portion of the fusion zzso and the zzso portion retains zzso similar to that of free zzso zzso Moreover, this fusion protein is capable of zzso target and zzso cells, remains intact in the blood and substantially increases the half life of the zzso portion of the zzso Finally, the zzso fusion protein can be used to stain tumor cells and is capable of reducing lung zzso in an experimental model of zzso Thus, zzso fusion proteins may provide a novel class of targeted zzso for zzso
