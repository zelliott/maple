A gene containing a zzso human repeat element, called THE 1, has been isolated and zzso The zzso termed zzso encodes a zzso resembling known zzso zzso The THE 1 element is present in the zzso region of its zzso The zzso clone corresponding to the zzso zzso product led to the identification of this zzso A processed zzso zzso related to the authentic gene has also been zzso In addition to zzso processing, this zzso differs from the gene in that it contains an zzso zzso repeat instead of a THE 1 element in the zzso zzso Thus, we compare a site containing a THE 1 element to an zzso related zzso target zzso The comparison suggests a zzso mechanism of THE 1 zzso This system is unusual in that the parent gene is associated with three distinct zzso events: the parent gene was converted to a processed zzso zzso an zzso repeat inserted into the zzso and a THE 1 element inserted into the parent zzso
