The zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso is preceded by a bona fide zzso sequence which allows the initiation of zzso by zzso zzso the same strand as the zzso zzso zzso When the promoter zzso is cloned in front of a zzso gene equipped with an initiation zzso but lacking a promoter, this element permits formation of zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso from zzso transformed with the fusion zzso we mapped by primer zzso a single initiation site 63 zzso downstream from the presumed zzso zzso zzso about 53 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso A similar signal at about the same position was observed when zzso from zzso zzso zzso was used as a template for primer zzso These results suggest that zzso from this zzso II zzso element occurs in zzso A regulatory function could not be assigned to this zzso Its initiation is not significantly influenced by zzso or carbon source, although two boxes of high zzso with upstream zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso dependent expression of the zzso c gene zzso zzso the promoter at the appropriate zzso
