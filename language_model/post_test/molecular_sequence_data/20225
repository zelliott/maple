The zzso and functional diversity of zzso zzso bacteria zzso present in an zzso zzso was investigated by zzso combined with fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso that can directly link zzso zzso zzso with in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso community in the zzso zzso sludge consisted of at least four zzso groups: zzso zzso short rod zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso long rod zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unidentified zzso The activities of these zzso groups were dependent on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the total active zzso under all the zzso zzso tested zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso was active only at lower zzso zzso and became a dominant active zzso at zzso zzso of zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the total active zzso above zzso zzso zzso whereas the active zzso population became low zzso zzso at zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was operated in a fill and draw mode, resulting in zzso changes in zzso concentration ranging from 0 to 10 zzso These zzso and functionally diverse, to some extent functionally zzso active zzso communities were zzso responding to the zzso changes in zzso zzso
