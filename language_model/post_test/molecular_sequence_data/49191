The potential for zzso of zzso in zzso marine sediments exists through zzso zzso by zzso organisms, utilizing nitrogen dioxide, zzso of zzso zzso reduction, and zzso zzso of ammonium by zzso (the zzso zzso Here we describe the presence of microbial communities with the potential to carry out these processes in a natural marine zzso system zzso zzso zzso Natural microbial communities of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso bacteria were characterized by analysis of zzso zzso genes amplified using zzso zzso by zzso and reverse zzso amplification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso products were analyzed by sequencing of clones and by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso of zzso specific for zzso and zzso zzso bacteria generated products at all sampling sites and zzso but no product was generated using zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns indicated complex communities of zzso zzso bacteria in zzso marine zzso zzso analysis of sequences from clones and those excised from zzso gels suggests dominance of zzso cluster zzso organisms and of strains belonging to a novel cluster represented in dominant bands in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Their presence indicates a group of organisms closely related to recognized zzso zzso bacteria that may be selected in zzso environments and may be capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso clone libraries and sequences excised from zzso gels also demonstrated a diverse microbial community and suggested the presence of new zzso but no sequence related to recognized zzso organisms was zzso
