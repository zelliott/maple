A method for separating into zzso sets of a complex mixture of fragments obtained by DNA zzso with zzso or zzso of restriction zzso producing zzso zzso of different sequences at the zzso ends has been zzso The method is based on the zzso of short zzso adapters with zzso zzso complementary to the zzso of a selected set of fragments followed by zzso with the primer which represents a strand of the zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso recognizing sequences zzso and zzso and producing three- and zzso zzso respectively, it has been shown that amplification of a set of fragments occurs only when the adapters are attached to DNA fragments with zzso Several applications of the zzso are zzso for obtaining individual bands in DNA zzso for reducing the kinetic complexity of DNA in the zzso difference analysis zzso zzso of complex zzso for zzso DNA fragments, and for constructing physical zzso zzso
