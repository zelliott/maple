We have isolated two genes from zzso zzso zzso proteins of 82 and 81 zzso that are highly zzso to the zzso zzso heat shock protein gene and have analyzed the structure and pattern of expression of these two genes during heat shock and zzso Southern zzso analysis and hybrid select translations indicate that the highly zzso zzso and zzso genes are members of a small zzso family composed of at least two and perhaps three or more gene family zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of these proteins based on the zzso sequence of the coding regions shows zzso zzso acid zzso to other zzso family genes from human, zzso zzso and zzso The promoter regions of both the zzso and zzso genes contain several heat shock elements zzso which are putative binding sites for heat shock zzso factor zzso commonly found in the promoters of other heat shock zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and used to examine the zzso expression patterns of the zzso and zzso genes during heat zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene is only mildly heat zzso in leaf zzso but is strongly expressed in the absence of heat shock during the zzso and zzso zzso stages of zzso development and in zzso as well as in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene shows strong heat zzso at zzso temperatures zzso degrees zzso and in heat shocked zzso and zzso but is only zzso expressed in the absence of heat zzso zzso reporter gene zzso made and analyzed by transient expression zzso in Black Mexican Sweet zzso zzso zzso also indicate that the zzso and zzso are regulated zzso The zzso promoter zzso strong zzso expression of the zzso reporter gene in heat-treated cells zzso to zzso over control zzso whereas the zzso promoter is only zzso heat zzso zzso to zzso over control zzso
