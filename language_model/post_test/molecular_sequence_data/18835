zzso channels detect changes in the membrane potential via their zzso zzso zzso that control the status of the zzso bundle crossing zzso zzso The movement of the zzso results in a transfer of the zzso gating charges across the cell membrane but only the last zzso of the total gating charge movement is associated with BC gate zzso which involves cooperative zzso in the zzso Substituting the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the Shaker channel by a zzso or zzso causes a considerable shift in the zzso of the cooperative zzso of BC gate zzso effectively zzso the late gating charge component from the other gating charge that originates from earlier zzso zzso Interestingly, both zzso also abolished zzso sensitivity to zzso which is a pharmacological tool to isolate the late gating charge zzso The zzso substitution zzso would promote a zzso zzso compared to zzso resulted in the largest separation of both gating charge zzso therefore, BC gate flexibility appears to be important for enabling the late cooperative step of channel zzso
