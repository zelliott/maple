Although zzso plasmids are important for horizontal gene transfer among bacteria, in particular zzso resistance spread, so far only three plasmids from the zzso zzso have been completely zzso In this study we doubled this zzso The three zzso plasmids zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from bacteria of two different sewage treatment plants and zzso by a combination of next-generation and zzso sequencing zzso A comparative analysis including the previously zzso zzso plasmids zzso zzso and zzso revealed a highly zzso zzso backbone (at least zzso DNA sequence zzso zzso 54 core zzso The accessory elements of the zzso zzso constitute a class 1 zzso interrupting the zzso gene and an zzso copy inserted into the zzso In addition, the zzso resistance genes zzso and the zzso element are located between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is loaded with a zzso mercury resistance zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso and contains zzso that are identical to those identified in zzso zzso and the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso element in a zzso zzso including a class 1 zzso between the zzso genes zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence identity to zzso from zzso inserted downstream of the zzso gene and a copy of zzso zzso to zzso on zzso inserted between the genes zzso and zzso On all three plasmids the accessory genes are almost always located between the backbone zzso confirming the importance of the backbone functions for zzso zzso The striking backbone conservation among the six completely zzso zzso plasmids is in contrast to the much higher diversity within the zzso zzso
