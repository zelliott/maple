The promoter region for zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso B virus was identified by the zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso cells and was found to function directly in virus production by way of the transient expression system of zzso The zzso sequence from zzso zzso to zzso (the zzso start zzso was indispensable for promoter function, while the zzso sequence (from zzso zzso to zzso containing a directly repeated sequence zzso connecting the same zzso sequence zzso (where zzso is a zzso at both sides was an essential element within this promoter zzso A specific cellular factor which zzso with the essential element was detected in the zzso cell zzso A similar binding factor was also observed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso This factor may thus be responsible for regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, or zzso
