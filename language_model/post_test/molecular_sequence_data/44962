Recent studies have described a widely expressed zzso complex, named zzso which is likely involved in protein sorting in zzso zzso The zzso complex is composed of four distinct zzso Here, we report the identification of one of the zzso of this complex, which we call zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso reveals that the protein is closely related to the zzso protein zzso zzso overall zzso and more zzso related to the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complexes zzso and zzso zzso zzso comparisons also suggest that zzso has a domain organization similar to zzso and to zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in all zzso and cells zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrate that zzso zzso to the approximately zzso zzso of the ubiquitous zzso complex, the other zzso being zzso zzso (now called zzso and zzso (A or zzso zzso is zzso on zzso zzso in zzso while the other zzso of the complex are not zzso zzso zzso is not present in significant amounts in zzso zzso The characteristics of zzso reported here lend support to the idea that zzso is a structural and functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso
