The zzso zzso system zzso is responsible for the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso The zzso of the oral zzso zzso zzso plays major roles in zzso zzso acid zzso and oral zzso zzso To further our understanding of the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso the binding of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso expression of the zzso in response to zzso was investigated by zzso I protection and gel mobility shift zzso An zzso binding sequence was found that was 27 zzso in length and had little sequence similarity to binding sites of other zzso metabolism zzso The presence of zzso at zzso relevant zzso enhanced the binding of zzso to its zzso Using cat zzso various deletion and substitution zzso within the putative zzso footprint were shown to cause dramatic reductions in expression from the zzso promoter in zzso confirming that the zzso sequence is required for optimal expression and induction of the zzso by zzso zzso of two putative zzso response elements zzso within the arc promoter region showed that both zzso contribute to zzso zzso A thorough understanding of the regulation of the zzso in zzso zzso and related organisms is needed to develop ways to exploit zzso zzso for the control of oral zzso Identification of the zzso and zzso binding sites lays the foundation for a more complete understanding of the complex interactions of multiple regulatory proteins with elements in the arc promoter zzso
