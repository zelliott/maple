We have isolated zzso clones covering the complete B chain of the complement zzso zzso from zzso this zzso zzso the classical complement zzso zzso sequence analysis shows that these clones contain 156 zzso of the zzso untranslated region, followed by sequences coding for the 25 zzso acids of the signal zzso all of the zzso zzso acids of the mature zzso and 140 zzso of the 3' untranslated region, including a zzso A additional zzso The coding region for the mature protein contains 261 zzso for the zzso repeat and zzso zzso for the zzso portion of zzso By comparing the zzso sequence of the mouse B chain of zzso with the human B chain zzso zzso 1985, zzso zzso zzso zzso we find a high zzso zzso within the mature zzso a lower zzso within the signal zzso zzso and the 3' untranslated region zzso and no zzso zzso in the zzso untranslated zzso
