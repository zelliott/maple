The zzso zzso acid zzso can be zzso to form zzso zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso zzso formation is an important zzso or zzso event and is greatly facilitated by the zzso zzso zzso although the impact of the zzso zzso on the potency and overall stability of zzso is not been well zzso Since most zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso acid and/or zzso at their zzso understanding the zzso mechanisms may shed light on the factors that control the zzso formation in therapeutic zzso zzso Here, two mass zzso techniques were developed to investigate zzso formation and the high conversion rate to zzso at the zzso of the zzso was reported in the zzso zzso The zzso formation is favored at pH 4 and 8, but is less common at the neutral pH that is optimum for the zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso formation can proceed zzso at mild conditions and that this zzso is not driven by zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also calculate the zzso of the zzso zzso at different pH and temperatures from the zzso data, which would be very helpful for predicting zzso formation and for selecting proper zzso and storage zzso
