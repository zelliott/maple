zzso zzso particles are derived from structural zzso which are zzso by the viral zzso zzso during zzso zzso Besides zzso viral zzso which is essential for zzso zzso of human zzso virus zzso also zzso cellular proteins and zzso expression causes a pronounced zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and contain two copies of the zzso zzso in the active center with the zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso acid presumed to have an important structural zzso We have changed this zzso in zzso type 1 zzso to a zzso The zzso zzso zzso had an approximately zzso to zzso lower activity against zzso type 1 zzso and zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso It did not induce toxicity on bacterial expression and yielded significantly reduced zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso lines was also markedly zzso zzso virus did, however, elicit productive infection of several zzso lines and of primary human zzso with no significant difference in zzso zzso and with similar infection zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso between reduced processing in zzso and normal zzso maturation can be explained by the observation that reduced activity was due to an increase in zzso which may not be relevant at the high zzso concentration in the virus zzso This zzso enables us therefore to zzso the essential function of zzso in viral maturation from its zzso zzso
