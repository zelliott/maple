To date, no zzso have been identified in the important zzso cotton species although there are several reports on zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we identified 73 zzso belonging to 49 families, from zzso cotton using a well-developed comparative zzso zzso zzso Several of the predicted zzso were validated using quantitative real time zzso zzso The length of zzso varied from 18 to 22 zzso with an average of 20 zzso The length of zzso precursors also varied from 46 to 684 zzso with an average of 138 zzso zzso For a majority of zzso cotton zzso there is only one member per family; however, multiple members were identified for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A and U were dominant, accounted for zzso in the zzso cotton zzso The zzso cotton zzso had high negative minimal folding free energy zzso and adjusted zzso zzso and high zzso index zzso Many zzso identified in zzso cotton suggest that zzso also play a similar regulatory mechanism in zzso zzso
