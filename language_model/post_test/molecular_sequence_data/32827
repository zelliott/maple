Plant zzso zzso are involved in plant defense and in zzso Very little data are available on the expression of rice zzso both in zzso zzso and under various zzso In this study, we cloned and characterized zzso rice zzso zzso zzso from at total of 71 putative zzso The zzso genes were obtained by zzso from a zzso library and were classified into seven groups zzso I to zzso according to their DNA or zzso acid sequence zzso Analysis of the expression of the zzso zzso genes by Northern zzso revealed that they were zzso expressed in different zzso zzso as well as in response to plant hormones, zzso stress, high salt zzso zzso and 27 in Group IV were clearly expressed only in stem and leaf and were also induced strongly by zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10, 11, and 14 were induced earlier and to higher levels in incompatible zzso zzso interaction than in compatible zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that the zzso rice zzso gene products play diverse roles not only in plant defense but also in hormonal responses and in zzso
