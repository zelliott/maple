Mass zzso zzso is a powerful tool for the characterization of zzso peptides that play a major role in the immune zzso Most of the major zzso complex zzso class I peptides are generated during the degradation of zzso proteins by the zzso a zzso complex present in all zzso zzso This chapter focuses on the contribution of zzso to the understanding of the mechanisms of zzso processing by the zzso This knowledge may be valuable for the design of specific zzso of zzso which has recently been recognized as a therapeutic target in cancer therapies and for the development of efficient zzso vaccines in zzso Examples from the literature have been chosen to illustrate how zzso data can contribute first to the understanding of the mechanisms of zzso processing and, second, to the understanding of the crucial role of zzso in zzso T zzso zzso zzso The general strategy based on zzso analyses used in these studies is also zzso
