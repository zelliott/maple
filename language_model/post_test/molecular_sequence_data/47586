zzso third-stage larvae zzso of zzso zzso were labeled with zzso in zzso and proteins released into the culture zzso before and during the third zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained abundant proteins of 14, 18, 29, and 36 zzso The zzso and zzso proteins were exclusively found in the zzso while the zzso and zzso proteins were also produced by zzso zzso albeit in much lower zzso The zzso for the most abundant protein in the zzso an zzso protein zzso was isolated by zzso chain reaction zzso with reverse transcribed zzso zzso of zzso using information of the protein zzso The zzso full-length zzso of zzso base pairs contained the zzso spliced leader sequence of zzso an open reading frame of zzso base pairs, and a zzso tail in typical distance to a zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence encodes for a protein with a calculated size of zzso zzso The zzso starts with a zzso signal sequence and a predicted zzso site after zzso acid zzso The zzso protein showed zzso to the deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso transcripts zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso proteins zzso as well as to the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso is present in all zzso stages within the zzso host, as determined by zzso with zzso against the zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso However, it was released into culture medium only by zzso and adult female zzso In female worms zzso was localized in the zzso region as demonstrated by zzso zzso tests using zzso
