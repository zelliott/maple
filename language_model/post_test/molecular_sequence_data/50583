zzso to zzso disease in Northern Europe is associated with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which exist together on an extended zzso The strong predominance of this zzso within the Northern European zzso zzso together with the linkage zzso which occurs between these zzso does not allow identification of the zzso primarily associated with disease zzso Studies from Southern Europe using both zzso and examination of restriction zzso length zzso zzso have demonstrated associations with zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso locus is primarily zzso We investigated 43 zzso patients and 41 healthy controls from Rome, Italy, using zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with gene amplification by the zzso chain reaction zzso to determine zzso at the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients possessed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso patients were zzso for zzso The strongest association with zzso disease zzso was the combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso There was no additional zzso associated with zzso at the zzso zzso This study confirms the hypothesis that zzso is associated with a particular combination of zzso zzso and the ethnic variation in DR zzso is secondary to linkage zzso with these zzso zzso
