zzso play an important role in the synthesis of zzso Here we report the isolation of a brain zzso coding for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso The zzso was used for screening a zzso liver DNA library and isolation of a zzso zzso zzso II zzso containing the complete zzso zzso gene and upstream and downstream zzso The zzso II gene zzso a single zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso coding for a zzso zzso acid protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso The promoter of the zzso gene is lacking a zzso and shows variable zzso start zzso In the zzso region a zzso zzso stretch was zzso The zzso zzso gene contains four zzso zzso zzso analysis of a zzso hybrid cell panel revealed the zzso location of the zzso gene on zzso zzso The mapping data of the cell panel were confirmed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso
