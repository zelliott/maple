The common characteristics of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso and zzso proteins offer the prospect that zzso model systems can be used to systematically dissect the driving forces of zzso zzso We recently reported the de zzso designed zzso beta zzso model system that forms a zzso zzso structure at low temperatures and which can be switched to zzso zzso by increasing the zzso Here, we report a detailed molecular description of the system in its zzso state by characterizing the zzso zzso zzso using several microscopic techniques, circular zzso zzso X-ray fiber zzso solid-state nuclear magnetic zzso and molecular dynamics zzso We show that zzso zzso forms zzso zzso of different zzso on both the zzso and atomic levels, which can be controlled by variations of assembly zzso Interestingly, zzso is also observed along single zzso We propose atomic models of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which are in good agreement with all experimental zzso The models provide a rational explanation why zzso of zzso zzso completely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, indicating that a small number of zzso zzso interactions can play a major role in the packing of zzso segments within zzso zzso The detailed structural information available for the zzso beta model system provides a strong molecular basis for understanding the influence and relative contribution of zzso interactions on zzso stability, zzso of zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso
