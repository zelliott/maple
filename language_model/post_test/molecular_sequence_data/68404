zzso and zzso data suggest that a relatively limited number of zzso zzso of viable zzso zzso larvae are available to be recognized by the zzso immune zzso A partial zzso clone zzso one such zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated by screening an expression zzso library with zzso raised against viable zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso by this clone was subsequently found to be zzso in the majority of individuals exposed to zzso zzso In the present study, the native zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and in zzso zzso techniques have been used to zzso zzso in adult and zzso stages of the zzso In adult zzso zzso was localized primarily in the zzso zzso was accessible to surface labeling zzso in viable adult zzso zzso zzso clones zzso zzso suggested that the nascent protein contains a putative leader zzso which is almost immediately followed by a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso to zzso proteins containing and lacking the zzso tract demonstrated that this structure was not a significant B cell zzso in individuals exposed to zzso zzso
