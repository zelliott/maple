zzso reverse zzso is a zzso zzso having both DNA zzso zzso and zzso and zzso H zzso zzso reverse zzso has been an exceptionally important target for zzso therapeutic development, and nearly half of the current clinically used zzso target reverse zzso DNA zzso However, no zzso of reverse zzso zzso H are on the market or in zzso zzso Several zzso small zzso zzso of reverse zzso zzso H have been zzso but little structural information is available about the interactions between reverse zzso zzso H and zzso that exhibit zzso zzso In this report, we describe zzso studies of the interaction of a new zzso H zzso zzso with a zzso active zzso reverse zzso zzso H domain zzso We carried out solution zzso experiments to identify the interaction interface of zzso with the zzso H domain zzso Chemical shift changes of backbone zzso signals at different zzso zzso clearly demonstrate that zzso mainly recognizes the zzso handle region in the zzso H zzso Using zzso H zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso the binding specificity of zzso was compared with another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results provide a structural characterization of the zzso H inhibitor interaction and are likely to be useful for further improvements of the zzso
