zzso and colleagues demonstrated that a particular clinical isolate of zzso zzso designated zzso and here zzso as zzso can zzso transfer zzso zzso The zzso resistance is zzso by a zzso born linked set of genes in the zzso designated the zzso zzso to the zzso of an zzso zzso recipient, zzso Here it is reported that an earlier isolate of zzso zzso from the same patient who later zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso gene cluster but is otherwise similar (by zzso zzso fingerprint and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a strong suspect as the base strain for the clinical acquisition of the zzso cluster present in zzso Thirteen zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso between zzso and zzso were subjected to further analysis, allowing a comparison between transfer in the laboratory and transfer that occurred in the clinical zzso Surprisingly, each zzso zzso had a unique constellation of abilities to zzso various members of a panel of potential carbon zzso This pattern was stable for each zzso and it was not changed by growing the strains with or without zzso zzso had zzso gel zzso zzso patterns largely consistent with that of zzso the recipient in zzso zzso However, zzso analysis showed that a large but variable amount of DNA, between 145 zzso and 277 zzso was transferred into different zzso The mechanism appears to be zzso zzso in which new DNA is added to the pre-existing zzso rather than substituting for a segment in the zzso zzso and zzso studies of several zzso showed that each received similar, but not exactly the same, DNA zzso of at least 30 zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes was used to confirm that the recipient and donor strains used in zzso experiments were different zzso zzso analysis was also used to consider the possibility that zzso zzso might be mobilized in zzso but no evidence for the transfer of zzso zzso was zzso An apparent zzso sequence in zzso zzso almost identical to IS zzso and 57% sequence identity to IS 199 of zzso zzso was found in the region of DNA zzso The results imply new consequences of zzso transfer and zzso zzso
