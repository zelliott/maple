A zzso zzso cap is a signature feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caps are also present on zzso of two species of zzso zzso strand zzso viruses of the zzso zzso It is presently not known how viral zzso might acquire a zzso zzso zzso a giant DNA virus that zzso zzso encodes many putative zzso and proteins implicated in zzso transactions, including the synthesis and capping of viral zzso and the promotion of zzso zzso Here we report the zzso zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso a single round of zzso transfer from zzso to an zzso cap zzso to form a zzso cap zzso zzso is apparently unable to convert a zzso cap to a zzso cap, and is thereby distinguished from the structurally zzso zzso and human zzso zzso Nonetheless, we show genetically that zzso is a true zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results hint that zzso caps can satisfy many of the functions of zzso caps in zzso We speculate that zzso capping of zzso zzso might favor viral protein synthesis in the infected zzso
