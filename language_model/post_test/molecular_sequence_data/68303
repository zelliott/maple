zzso a gene from zzso zzso which encodes a protein with striking zzso to other integral membrane zzso was zzso The gene was specifically expressed in mature seeds and during zzso zzso particularly in zzso of zzso grown in the zzso The deduced product, called zzso for dark intrinsic zzso shows strong zzso with the zzso family of channel zzso which zzso the bovine major intrinsic protein zzso the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein from kidney bean zzso zzso is most similar to other plant members of this family, and in particular to the tobacco protein zzso which is expressed specifically in zzso However, the expression pattern of zzso suggests that its product is functionally more similar to the zzso intrinsic protein from kidney bean since it is most highly expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso before the cells undergo expansion growth and become zzso
