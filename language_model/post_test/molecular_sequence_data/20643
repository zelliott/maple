zzso and Extension zzso control the relative amount of zzso and zzso production in zzso that, in turn, affects pigmentation of skin and zzso The Extension locus encodes the zzso 1 zzso zzso whose permanent zzso caused by functional zzso results in black coat zzso whereas other zzso zzso cause red coat zzso in different zzso 

The whole coding region of the zzso gene was zzso in zzso of six different breeds showing different coat zzso zzso white cream with usually small red spots in the zzso zzso white with black cheeks and zzso zzso di zzso solid zzso zzso solid black or solid zzso zzso zzso zzso brown with black stripes; zzso zzso F1 zzso and the parental zzso Five single zzso zzso zzso were zzso one nonsense zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one silent zzso The stop zzso at position 225 should cause the production of a shorter zzso protein whose functionality may be zzso These zzso were investigated in a larger sample of animals belonging to the six zzso The zzso breed was almost fixed for the zzso zzso However, there was not complete association between the presence of red spots in the face and the presence of this zzso in zzso zzso The same zzso was identified in the zzso di zzso zzso However, its frequency was only zzso despite the fact that these animals are completely zzso The zzso zzso was present in all zzso black zzso whereas it was never identified in the brown zzso Moreover, the same substitution was present in almost all zzso zzso providing evidence of association between this zzso and black coat zzso 

According to the results obtained in the investigated goat breeds, zzso zzso may determine zzso and zzso zzso However, they are probably not the only zzso In particular, the surprising not complete association of the nonsense zzso zzso with red coat zzso raises a few hypotheses on the determination of zzso zzso in zzso that should be further zzso
