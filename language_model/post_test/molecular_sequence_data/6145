The zzso of passively transferred maternal zzso to zzso of zzso zzso and the dynamics of acquisition of these zzso during the first year of life was investigated in infants born in a malaria endemic area of zzso zzso Blood samples were collected from the infants at zzso follow-up visits for the analysis of total serum zzso G, zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso and against synthetic peptides representing zzso sequences of the blood stage zzso zzso and zzso or the zzso protein zzso zzso levels fell from birth till 4 months and a steady rise was observed thereafter till ten months of zzso On the contrary mean zzso and zzso levels increased throughout the first year of zzso Generally the number of infants positive for zzso to the zzso under investigation fell from birth and between 4-6 months of age was either low or zzso None of the infants were positive for zzso to the zzso representing zzso during the first year of zzso The earliest zzso was detected at 6 months of age involving the zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate a high level of exposure in this study area to malaria infection early in zzso The finding of an active zzso response to zzso zzso in infancy encourages the hope that a malaria vaccine administered early in life may accelerate the development of naturally acquired immunity and thus protect the population most at zzso
