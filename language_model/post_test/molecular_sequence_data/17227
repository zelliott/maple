zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor genes cause transformation of zzso to zzso leaf fates by altering a zzso complementary site present in processed zzso and zzso zzso but not in the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulate excess zzso transcript throughout the leaf zzso indicating defective regulation of zzso transcript synthesis and/or zzso We show that zzso and zzso coding sequences are heavily zzso downstream of the zzso complementary site in most zzso plant cells and that zzso is reduced in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is limited to the zzso bearing the dominant zzso zzso in zzso zzso Low levels of zzso are detected in zzso zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso These results suggest a model in which the zzso interacts with zzso newly processed zzso zzso to alter zzso of the corresponding zzso template DNA predominantly in differentiated zzso
