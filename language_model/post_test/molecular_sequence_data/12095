The zzso of protein zzso C zzso is zzso regulated by limited zzso zzso by a zzso neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha at specific sites in the hinge region between the zzso and the regulatory zzso of this zzso Here we show a novel method for production of zzso that bind specifically to the zzso zzso of zzso alpha but not to the zzso zzso To detect zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso which recognize zzso regions in the nascent zzso fragments and do not zzso with the zzso zzso were raised using synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso The synthetic peptides used in this study were the sequences of human zzso alpha at the zzso sites by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and they are designated as zzso alpha 2, zzso alpha 4, in this zzso Each synthetic zzso was injected into rabbit after zzso with a carrier zzso The zzso thus obtained zzso alpha 2 or zzso alpha 4) specifically reacted with either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso respectively, whereas they did not zzso with other zzso Furthermore, the zzso did not bind to the zzso zzso nor fragments of zzso alpha obtained by treatment with other zzso unless the zzso carried the same zzso zzso When human zzso were treated with calcium zzso the zzso fragments of zzso alpha zzso and zzso were detected in the zzso by zzso with the zzso However, these zzso did not bind zzso zzso zzso zzso although this form was dominant in the zzso of the calcium zzso human zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha was detected in an zzso human zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso zzso Our method is zzso for analysis of zzso in various cellular zzso
