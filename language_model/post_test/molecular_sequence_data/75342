The neural zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso detected in neural zzso as well as in zzso zzso We report here the zzso sequence of the chicken zzso zzso and the deduced zzso acid zzso The sequence data suggest that zzso has one zzso domain which divides the zzso into an zzso and a zzso zzso the zzso domain contains internal repeats of characteristic zzso When the zzso zzso connected with virus promoters was zzso into L cells which have no zzso zzso the zzso acquired the zzso zzso property, indicating that the cloned zzso contained all information necessary for the zzso binding action of this zzso We then compared the primary structure of zzso with that of other molecules defined as zzso zzso The results showed that these molecules contain common zzso acid sequences throughout their entire zzso which confirms our hypothesis that zzso make a gene zzso
