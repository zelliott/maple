DNA double strand breaks zzso are usually repaired through either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso While zzso is basically zzso repair, zzso is a zzso zzso that leads to zzso zzso must be precisely regulated to maintain zzso zzso To clarify the role of zzso we investigated the genetic consequences of zzso repair of zzso in human zzso Human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso have, respectively, single and double zzso zzso sites in the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso located on zzso zzso zzso expression generated zzso at the zzso zzso We used the novel zzso system zzso zzso to introduce an zzso expression zzso into the cells and randomly isolated zzso We found zzso involved in the zzso in the zzso gene in zzso of zzso cells and zzso of zzso cell zzso Most of the zzso in zzso were small zzso deletions with a zzso zzso at the zzso The others consisted of large zzso zzso zzso an zzso and a zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso also occurred, but zzso Most of the zzso in zzso on the other hand, were deletions that zzso the two zzso sites generated by zzso at zzso The sequence joint was similar to that found in zzso zzso Interestingly, some zzso formed a new zzso site by perfectly joining the two original zzso sites without deletion of the zzso These results support the idea that zzso for repairing zzso zzso mainly results in small or no zzso Thus, zzso must help maintain zzso integrity in zzso cells by repairing zzso as well as by preventing many deleterious zzso
