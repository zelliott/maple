We developed a DNA zzso for identification of zzso zzso and other zzso groupings within the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso containing genes for zzso from 52 zzso zzso strains were found to be identical to sequences from seven strains published previously and different from all other zzso When 42 zzso zzso targeting zzso sites were immobilized on glass slides and zzso to zzso labeled zzso amplification products, one or more zzso could be zzso in all but one zzso zzso zzso events were highly specific and identification of zzso zzso was zzso
