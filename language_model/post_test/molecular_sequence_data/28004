A specific zzso of zzso zzso translation originally detected in rabbit zzso zzso has now been zzso to zzso from rabbit liver, as described in a companion paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is a zzso protein that binds to a sequence in the zzso region of zzso zzso In this communication we describe the molecular features of a zzso light chain transcript that are required for the repression of its translation by this zzso zzso of small amounts of the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso completely inhibited translation of zzso transcripts in a wheat germ zzso This repression did not require zzso sequences contained in the zzso region or in the majority of the zzso coding zzso In contrast, the first 130 zzso of the zzso region, which contains the zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso was required for the repressive zzso Moreover, repression of full length transcripts was relieved by addition of a zzso excess of a zzso transcript of the zzso region which also contained the zzso These results suggest that no sequence information other than a portion of the zzso region containing the zzso sequence is required for action of the zzso zzso In addition, a quantitative comparison of the repression of transcript with that of zzso zzso indicates that no zzso modifications of the latter zzso than cap zzso are involved in the action of the zzso zzso
