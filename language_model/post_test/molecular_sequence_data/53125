zzso to zzso zzso zzso causes severe nervous system symptoms under low dose zzso In search of direct genetic zzso for this sensitivity, we studied six regions in the extended 22 zzso promoter of the zzso gene in individuals who presented adverse responses to zzso and in randomly chosen zzso Two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso response element, and a zzso zzso abolishing one of two adjacent zzso binding sites, were identified 17 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso zzso for these zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso individuals of various ethnic origins, with a strong linkage between the deletion and the zzso neutral zzso zzso in the coding region of zzso zzso carriers of the deletion included a zzso who presented with acute hypersensitivity to the zzso zzso and another with unexplained excessive vomiting during a fourth pregnancy following three spontaneous zzso zzso shift zzso zzso studies and zzso of zzso levels in immortalized zzso as well as in peripheral blood from both carriers and zzso revealed functional relevance for this zzso both in zzso and in zzso and showed it to increase zzso zzso probably by alleviating competition between the two zzso nuclear factor 3 binding zzso Moreover, zzso transgenic mice, unlike normal zzso mice, displayed zzso hypersensitivity and failed to zzso induce zzso production following exposure to zzso Our findings point to promoter zzso in the zzso gene as the dominant zzso zzso for adverse responses to exposure or to treatment with zzso
