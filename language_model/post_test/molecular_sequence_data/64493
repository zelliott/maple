Here, we describe the zzso sequencing and characterization of an zzso A zzso zzso zzso from cattle zzso By screening a translated zzso database with the protein sequence of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified a putative bovine zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification confirmed that the identified full-length zzso was expressed in bovine zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso containing the cloned zzso bound to beads coated with either bovine or human zzso but not to beads coated with bovine zzso or human zzso The zzso zzso is 873 zzso long and is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of two zzso zzso zzso a zzso region and a short zzso tail devoid of known zzso zzso zzso zzso is more closely related to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso gene families than to other zzso Moreover, the zzso gene maps to the bovine zzso zzso complex on zzso zzso Identification of the zzso will aid in the understanding of zzso zzso and may facilitate the isolation of zzso from other zzso
