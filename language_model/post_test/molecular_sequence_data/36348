Although zzso zzso beta chain zzso zzso expressed in various zzso cell lines binds zzso with an intermediate zzso zzso beta expressed in zzso is unable to bind zzso suggesting that zzso beta is on its own not sufficient for generating the zzso zzso and that zzso regulatory control may be operated to allow zzso beta to bind zzso In the present study, we observed that human zzso beta expressed in a mouse myeloma zzso zzso by zzso zzso did not bind zzso while the same zzso beta expressed in an zzso mouse B cell zzso zzso which was obtained by cell fusion between zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound zzso with the intermediate zzso Interestingly, when the human zzso beta zzso zzso zzso which by itself zzso no zzso zzso was fused with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso binding was specifically inhibited by addition of zzso zzso beta zzso zzso 1) but not by zzso against mouse zzso zzso indicating that human zzso beta was responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso beta in zzso was converted to competent zzso beta by zzso with a mouse zzso zzso zzso through the cell zzso zzso experiments with zzso revealed the presence of a 61 zzso protein other than zzso beta in cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
