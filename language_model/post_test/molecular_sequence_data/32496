Plants possess three types of DNA zzso among which zzso type 1 zzso is considered to play a major role by maintaining the zzso zzso zzso However, little information is available as to its zzso activity, interacting proteins and spatial and zzso zzso during DNA zzso In the present study, one example, zzso from tobacco plants, was selected and an analysis was made of its zzso properties and cellular zzso 

zzso was expressed in zzso insect cells, and a zzso sample was subjected to a standard in zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction was examined by the zzso zzso and pull-down zzso zzso tobacco plants zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed via zzso zzso Cellular zzso was examined by zzso protein fusion, which was expressed in tobacco bright yellow 2 zzso 

In zzso zzso showed no zzso zzso activity when both zzso and zzso DNA samples were used as the zzso In zzso zzso with zzso transgenic lines showed no zzso but rather zzso of zzso zzso The inability of zzso was conceivably due to a tight zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso regions with the zzso domain residing on the zzso being completely zzso Cellular zzso analyses indicated that zzso localized to the nucleus in the resting stage and zzso to the zzso during zzso particularly at zzso The pattern observed resembled that of Ran zzso and in zzso pull-down zzso showed a clear interaction between zzso and zzso an zzso zzso of tobacco Ran zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso activity of zzso is well adjusted by its own zzso interaction and perhaps by interactions with other zzso one of which was found to be Ran zzso zzso also revealed that zzso becomes localized to the vicinity of zzso with the aid of Ran zzso during cell division, and may play an important role in progress through zzso independently of zzso zzso
