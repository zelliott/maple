We have raised specific zzso to the second zzso domain of zzso growth factor receptors zzso and used these to investigate the expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in breast zzso zzso All four receptors classes could be detected in breast cell zzso however, zzso and zzso appeared to be expressed at a higher level in breast cancer cell lines than in normal zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso localized in the cell nucleus by zzso A second zzso to a separate zzso confirmed this finding and showed that the form of zzso present must contain an intact zzso domain as well as the growth factor binding zzso Western analysis of zzso cells revealed the presence of two forms of zzso of 135 and 110 zzso The zzso form was predominantly found in the nucleus, whereas the 135 zzso form was sometimes found in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed the presence of a zzso zzso in which zzso 7 and 8 are zzso This results in the translation of zzso missing the zzso domain but with an intact zzso domain, which could be a zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso containing this deletion and no signal zzso gave an identical nuclear zzso pattern to that seen in breast zzso zzso We conclude that two forms of zzso are present in breast zzso zzso a full-length zzso zzso which has a conventional membrane zzso and a novel soluble form of 110 zzso
