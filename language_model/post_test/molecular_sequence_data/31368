During early zzso development, a series of zzso tissue interactions appear to be involved in establishing regional zzso that are eventually elaborated in the basic body plan of the zzso These early zzso interactions are particularly difficult to study because they often occur in the absence of any associated zzso zzso In the chick zzso the regional subdivision of the early zzso is evidenced by a marked zzso bias in the head zzso which is absent from the zzso zzso zzso of the trunk zzso This striking divergence in zzso state is present long before any differentiation into lens or zzso zzso can be zzso As a strategy for zzso genes whose differential expression might be a reflection of this regional zzso a zzso library was prepared from early zzso and screened for differential zzso to zzso zzso prepared from head zzso and trunk zzso Two related zzso clones were isolated that zzso to transcripts present at much higher levels in trunk zzso than in head zzso zzso analysis of one of these clones revealed a high degree of similarity to members of the type II zzso of intermediate filament zzso This clone zzso was used to examine zzso gene expression in zzso zzso A large increase in the level of zzso transcripts was found to take place in trunk zzso approximately coordinate with zzso contrasting sharply with the much lower levels detected in head zzso and neural zzso at all stages zzso These results indicate that differential zzso gene expression can occur within a zzso layer of simple embryonic zzso and that this expression pattern zzso closely to the subdivision of the early zzso into regions with distinct zzso zzso This type of regulation has not been described previously for members of the zzso gene zzso
