zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso together with the two other zzso beta and gamma zzso composes a zzso G protein and zzso visual signals in the zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha gene was cloned from human zzso library using a zzso probe isolated from a human zzso cell line, zzso The zzso region of zzso alpha was zzso and the mechanism of zzso alpha expression was zzso by primer extension and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 hypersensitivity test and zzso sequencing were zzso zzso extension revealed two zzso initiation zzso A zzso box and an zzso zzso box were identified just upstream of the zzso initiation sites, which constituted a typical promoter zzso In further upstream region, an zzso sequence zzso and an zzso zzso were zzso The latter sequence is frequently present upstream of the genes expressed exclusively in retinal zzso No specific DNA element enhancing the expression of zzso alpha in zzso cells (a zzso alpha expressing cell line) was found by zzso zzso However, zzso hypersensitivity test revealed the region to be in an active zzso structure in zzso as opposed to zzso (a zzso alpha zzso cell zzso By further study utilizing zzso sequencing, zzso DNA was zzso in contrast to zzso suggesting zzso as one of the zzso factors of this zzso
