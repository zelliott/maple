zzso zzso cells have been shown to produce zzso growth zzso proteins zzso however, the identity of these zzso has not been zzso We now demonstrate that cultured bovine zzso cells produce zzso zzso and zzso and have zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso -5 and zzso DNA zzso for bovine zzso were obtained by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso from bovine large vessel pulmonary artery and zzso zzso cells as well as zzso and zzso fat zzso cells, using zzso zzso whose sequences were based on the reported zzso sequences of zzso The zzso zzso were labeled with zzso and used for Northern zzso analysis of zzso obtained from the four bovine zzso cell zzso zzso corresponding to zzso were found in zzso from large vessel zzso cells zzso pulmonary artery and bovine zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso The zzso probe for zzso was used to screen a bovine pulmonary artery zzso library for a full-length bovine zzso zzso zzso One positive zzso containing a single zzso insert of approximately zzso zzso was selected for further characterization by DNA sequence zzso This clone contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso acid protein that was zzso identical to human zzso 268 zzso of zzso region, and a longer zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso from bovine pulmonary zzso zzso shown to have zzso zzso acid sequence zzso zzso to human zzso and to be zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso further demonstrated that zzso cells, at early passage, zzso predominantly zzso and zzso while large vessel cells, at early and late passages, zzso zzso and zzso Thus, cultured bovine zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and have zzso zzso zzso The production of specific zzso by zzso cells raises the interesting possibility that the vascular zzso contributes to circulating and tissue levels of specific zzso in zzso
