The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to tooth surfaces via a cell surface zzso termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies identified an zzso zzso within zzso zzso A synthetic zzso zzso spanning these zzso inhibited zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and was tested in an in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso application of zzso to the teeth prevented zzso of the oral cavity by zzso zzso but not zzso zzso This review also describes various other zzso peptides have been identified in zzso We suggest that zzso synthetic peptides may provide novel zzso zzso zzso application of such peptides at zzso surfaces does not provide sustained selective pressure and in contrast to zzso may not induce zzso
