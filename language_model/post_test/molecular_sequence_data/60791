zzso zzso the zzso green zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in its reduced and oxidized state and the three-dimensional structure of the protein in both zzso states was determined by X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso in the space group P zzso whereas the oxidized protein zzso as a zzso in the space group P zzso The structures were solved by molecular replacement and refined to zzso 9 and zzso A, zzso zzso of the structures of both zzso states revealed only slight differences on the protein surface, whereas a distortion along the axis between the zzso iron and its zzso zzso zzso was zzso No zzso movement of internal water molecules could be zzso The high degree of similarity of the surfaces and charge zzso of both zzso states, as well as the zzso of zzso zzso observed in the oxidized zzso is discussed with respect to its biological relevance and its implications for the reaction mechanisms between zzso zzso its zzso zzso The zzso of oxidized zzso zzso represent a molecular structure occurring in a zzso complex with zzso zzso This assembly might be required for the correct orientation of zzso zzso respect to its zzso partner zzso zzso zzso the electron transfer within the zzso If the zzso is not zzso in zzso the almost identical surfaces of both zzso states do not support a long range differentiation between reduced and oxidized zzso zzso zzso a random collision model for the formation of an electron transfer complex must be zzso
