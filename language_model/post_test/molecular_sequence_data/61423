The development of a strain of zzso knockout mice has provided confirmation of a neuroendocrine role for zzso as well as supporting results of previous zzso investigations indicating a role for zzso in analgesia and zzso pain, and potentially in zzso growth and zzso zzso Whether zzso of zzso expression in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease represents a survival response or zzso functional deficit in afflicted individuals remains to be zzso More detailed analysis of the zzso of the zzso knockout mouse should provide insights into the zzso role of zzso in memory and learning zzso as well as in zzso function and other aspects of neuroendocrine zzso zzso and molecular cloning efforts have demonstrated that the zzso of actions of zzso is matched by complexity in the distribution and regulation of zzso and its zzso A focus on zzso of zzso receptors has resulted in the molecular cloning of three zzso zzso to zzso The distribution and functional properties of these receptors have not yet been fully zzso currently zzso assignment of discrete functions of zzso to any one zzso zzso It is not currently possible to reconcile available pharmacological data using zzso of zzso and zzso peptides in functional zzso systems with the pharmacological properties of cloned zzso zzso This highlights the value of further knockout approaches targeting zzso zzso zzso but also raises the possibility of the existence of additional zzso zzso that have yet to be zzso or that zzso activity may be modulated by regulatory molecules that remain to be zzso The development of zzso zzso compounds remains a high priority to advance work in this zzso The ability to selectively zzso the many different actions of zzso through a clearer understanding of zzso zzso relationships and zzso distribution, promises to provide important insights into the molecular and cellular basis of zzso action in normal zzso and may provide lead compounds with therapeutic application in the prevention and treatment of a range of zzso
