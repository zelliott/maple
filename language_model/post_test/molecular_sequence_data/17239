We characterized the specifically zzso gene zzso which is expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso positive cell line zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression can be zzso by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso expression is high in prostate zzso zzso is composed of four zzso and spans a region of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the result of alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lack zzso 2 and vary in length of zzso zzso The zzso protein has a length of zzso zzso acids and is located in the zzso By screening the 18 zzso zzso sequence zzso the zzso start site we identified the imperfect direct repeat zzso zzso 1 as an active zzso response element zzso A zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso containing this element functioned as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cooperated with zzso sequences for optimal zzso zzso of zzso completely abolished the zzso response of the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed zzso structural changes of the zzso in the presence of zzso zzso was able to bind to the zzso zzso but not to the zzso zzso zzso with its zzso activity in zzso
