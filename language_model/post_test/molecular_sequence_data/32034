The zzso protein of zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso and gastric cancer zzso zzso is zzso into the host cell by a zzso zzso type IV zzso system via mechanisms that are poorly zzso zzso zzso interacts with numerous host factors, altering a variety of host zzso zzso The recently determined crystal structure of zzso zzso indicated the presence of two zzso the smaller, flexible zzso domain and the larger, middle zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso zzso state and stability of the zzso middle and zzso zzso zzso All three zzso are zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso observed in infected cells is likely to be zzso not by zzso itself but by its interacting zzso The middle and the zzso zzso but not the zzso domain, are capable of zzso spontaneously upon heat zzso lending support to the hypothesis that unfolded zzso is threaded zzso first through the type IV zzso channel with its zzso domain, which likely requires interactions with other zzso to zzso being threaded zzso Our findings also revealed that the zzso zzso domain of zzso exists in an zzso zzso zzso zzso state with regions in zzso zzso feature that is shared by many scaffold proteins that bind multiple protein components of zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide a deeper understanding of the zzso properties of zzso that zzso its complex cellular and zzso zzso
