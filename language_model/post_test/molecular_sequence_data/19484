The number of zzso in pigs varies and is associated with meat zzso Wild zzso which are ancestors of domestic zzso have 19 zzso In comparison, European commercial breeds have zzso zzso probably zzso to selective breeding for enlargement of body zzso We previously identified two quantitative trait zzso zzso for the number of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso These zzso explained an increase of more than two zzso Here, we performed a zzso study to define the zzso region on zzso By using three zzso experimental families, we performed zzso mapping and zzso analyses and defined the zzso within a zzso zzso Then we analyzed the linkage zzso of zzso markers in this zzso and found that 10 adjacent markers in a zzso region were almost fixed in European commercial zzso zzso variation of the markers was observed in Asian local breeds or wild zzso This region zzso an orphan nuclear zzso germ cell nuclear factor zzso formerly known as zzso which contained an zzso acid substitution zzso zzso with the zzso This substitution altered the binding activity of zzso to its zzso nuclear zzso protein 80 zzso and nuclear zzso zzso 1 zzso In addition, zzso of mouse zzso demonstrated expression of zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is a strong candidate for one of the zzso that influence number of zzso in zzso
