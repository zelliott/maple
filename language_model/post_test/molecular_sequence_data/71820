The zzso zzso zzso has been successfully incorporated into a series of collagen zzso composed of zzso and zzso sequences and has been able to maintain triple zzso in appropriate zzso The zzso zzso sequence zzso as a guest sequence in structures such as zzso retains triple zzso As an extension of this study, we report, in this paper, on a series of zzso collagen zzso structures in which zzso sequences are employed as the zzso The guest sequences for these zzso structures include zzso and zzso sequences where zzso is composed of a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso From these zzso collagen zzso structures, we are able to zzso the contributions of zzso and zzso effects on triple zzso zzso The zzso sequences have been shown to be effective in inducing triple zzso zzso characterization of the zzso collagen zzso structures was established by techniques such as zzso optical rotation zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso
