We examined the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with human zzso zzso on human tumors transplanted into nude mice and compared it with that of tumor necrosis factor zzso The results were as zzso zzso The systemic administration of zzso zzso combined with zzso produced a significant zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma, zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso all of which are relatively resistant to a single treatment with zzso or zzso The synergistic effect was also seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect was observed after either zzso or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no synergistic or additive effect on zzso zzso tumors was observed in the case of zzso combined with zzso zzso The serum zzso of zzso zzso in zzso mice was about zzso longer than that of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso especially in combination with zzso appears to be a potent zzso against tumor growth in zzso compared with zzso Its long serum zzso can result in a strong zzso effect in combination with zzso in zzso
