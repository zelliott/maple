The gene zzso the zzso acid zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso has been cloned and zzso and the zzso has been zzso to zzso and subjected to kinetic and zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso processes zzso but not zzso with a turnover number of approximately 10 zzso The product of the reaction is zzso zzso which was confirmed by its characteristic zzso zzso zzso The zzso shares low but significant sequence similarity with the previously studied zzso acid zzso zzso and with other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso and zzso function as zzso and zzso respectively, zzso appears to be a zzso protein as assessed by gel zzso zzso On the basis of the known three-dimensional structures and reaction mechanisms of zzso and zzso a sequence alignment implicated zzso zzso zzso and zzso as important zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed these zzso The zzso compounds, zzso and zzso and zzso were processed by zzso to products consistent with an zzso zzso reaction previously established for zzso zzso of zzso afforded zzso while the zzso became irreversible zzso that modified zzso The results of this work revealed that zzso and zzso have different primary and zzso structures, and display different zzso specificity and zzso zzso but likely share a highly zzso zzso zzso The mechanism may have evolved independently because sequence analysis indicates that zzso is not a zzso family member, but represents the first characterized member of a new family in the zzso zzso that probably resulted from an independent zzso of a zzso zzso The discovery of a fifth family of zzso within this zzso further demonstrates the diversity of activities and structures that can be created from zzso zzso
