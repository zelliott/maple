A zzso zzso spinach zzso was cloned and zzso by the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The zzso comprised zzso zzso and included an open reading frame which encodes a zzso of 903 zzso acid zzso The calculated molecular mass of 101 zzso was larger than those of native zzso in spinach seeds, which are 78, 78, 82, and 82 zzso by zzso for zzso I, II, III, and IV, zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence included those of zzso peptides from native zzso Southern zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene was a zzso zzso These results indicate the possibility that the zzso of zzso in spinach occurs via zzso zzso
