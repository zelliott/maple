zzso group C and G zzso cause a considerable invasive disease burden and sometimes cause disease zzso Little is known about the critical zzso zzso of genetic zzso between zzso We determined the zzso types of 334 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and attempted zzso typing of 5 zzso zzso zzso from a recent zzso surveillance for invasive zzso Thirty-four zzso types were observed, including one from zzso zzso We formulated zzso sequence typing zzso zzso with six of the seven zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso We performed zzso with 65 of the 334 surveillance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso to represent each zzso type identified, including 2 to 3 zzso for each of the 25 zzso represented zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence types zzso were zzso zzso within 16 zzso represented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso types shared identical or nearly identical zzso demonstrating zzso between the zzso type and genetic zzso However, seven zzso were each represented by two to four different zzso types, and 7 of the 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso groups represented up to six different zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar to zzso zzso zzso in that strains of the same zzso type were often highly zzso but they differed from zzso zzso in that zzso zzso zzso zzso strains with identical or closely similar zzso often exhibited multiple unrelated zzso zzso The zzso relationships between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed a history of zzso zzso with either species often serving as genetic zzso The four zzso zzso zzso shared highly zzso zzso but were unrelated clones without evidence of past zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
