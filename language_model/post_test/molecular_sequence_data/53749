Three isolated strains from human feces were characterized by zzso tests and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these isolated strains were members of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso characters resembled those of the zzso zzso but these strains were shown to be zzso distant from the type species of the zzso zzso zzso The strains showed a specific zzso association with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on a zzso zzso sequence divergence of greater than zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso a new zzso zzso is proposed for three zzso with one species, zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso
