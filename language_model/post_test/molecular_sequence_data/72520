The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a major zzso during natural syphilis infection in humans and experimental infection in other zzso The zzso and cellular immune responses to this zzso appear late in infection as resistance to zzso is zzso One therefore might zzso that this zzso is important for protective zzso This possibility is explored by using both genetic and zzso zzso Limited or no zzso has been demonstrated between the zzso zzso subspecies and strains or between zzso zzso We therefore hypothesized that if the zzso zzso was of major importance in protective zzso it might be a likely site of zzso zzso To explore this possibility, the sequences of the open reading frames of the zzso gene have been determined for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso and K zzso and a zzso zzso isolate of zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant differences in DNA sequences of the genes for the coding region of the zzso zzso were found among the different species and subspecies zzso In addition, all organisms showed expression of the zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso The role of the zzso zzso in protection against zzso infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined in rabbits zzso with a zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso No zzso in zzso development was observed in zzso compared to zzso zzso and the zzso induced by the zzso failed to enhance zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso These results do not support a major role for this zzso in protection against syphilis zzso
