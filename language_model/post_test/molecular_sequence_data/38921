The major house dust zzso zzso zzso p 1 elicits strong zzso zzso responses in patients suffering from zzso zzso 

This study reports the expression and characterization of a zzso precursor form of zzso p 1 zzso as zzso p 1 from insect zzso 

The zzso coding for zzso p 1 was cloned downstream to the zzso signal zzso starting from commercial zzso zzso zzso p 1 and zzso zzso p 1 zzso zzso zzso p 1, expressed in zzso cells and zzso from culture zzso was compared to zzso p 1 isolated from zzso culture, in terms of zzso zzso activity as well as zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of the zzso clone of zzso p 1 revealed that, besides two zzso in the mature zzso p 1 coding zzso two zzso were also present in the zzso coding zzso zzso p 1 was zzso to zzso by a combination of zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso The precursor form of zzso p 1 could be processed in zzso into mature zzso p 1 under zzso and reducing zzso zzso analysis clearly indicated that zzso p 1 expressed from insect cells was zzso and that zzso structures were located only in the zzso zzso p 1 displayed a similar zzso towards zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to natural zzso p zzso zzso activity zzso using synthetic zzso clearly indicated that, contrary to natural zzso p 1, zzso p 1 was totally zzso zzso 

The expression of an zzso inactive and highly zzso zzso p 1 zzso zzso could be a suitable strategy for the development of in zzso diagnosis test as well as for specific zzso
