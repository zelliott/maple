We describe evidence for a sequence of events in which the Human zzso first zzso spontaneous zzso zzso zzso and then zzso at the zzso site to produce a complex with the zzso unusual zzso This property of the zzso is a result of its ability to respond to a general loss of symmetry at its zzso recognition zzso The data suggest that DNA zzso itself, may physically participate in biological processes that distinguish between DNA that is in the normal zzso paired zzso and DNA that is zzso unusual zzso a hairpin loop or zzso replication zzso The in zzso zzso of spontaneous zzso from the zzso locus illustrates the zzso
