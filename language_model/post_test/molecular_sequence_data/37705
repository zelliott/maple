We have identified the protein zzso (for zzso zzso protein of zzso from a zzso zzso screen by using zzso as zzso zzso shares strong zzso with bacterial zzso zzso It interacts with zzso and, more zzso with several other selected zzso zzso Analysis of deletion zzso showed that the zzso region of the zzso domain in zzso is required for its interaction with zzso zzso is an integral membrane zzso because it remained associated with membrane zzso after alkaline treatment and because, in some cells, it is sensitive to zzso with zzso zzso By zzso and zzso zzso zzso was localized on the plasma membrane in liver and kidney and on zzso zzso in rat zzso and cultured zzso zzso zzso represents the only integral membrane protein identified thus far to interact with an zzso domain and, to our knowledge, is the only zzso zzso zzso that has been zzso The putative zzso activity of zzso and its interaction with zzso suggest that it may play important roles in zzso metabolism and in G protein zzso
