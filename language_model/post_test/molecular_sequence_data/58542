The zzso region of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope protein is known to have a major influence on zzso zzso as well as the ability to cause zzso formation or fusion in zzso zzso zzso Using infectious molecular zzso zzso a series of zzso clones was created which allowed detailed mapping of zzso zzso acid positions involved in these zzso In these experiments the zzso zzso in T cells did not always correlate with zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to depend on the presence of certain combinations of zzso acids at five specific positions within and just outside of the zzso loop itself, whereas zzso formation in zzso was influenced by substitution of particular zzso at two to four positions within zzso In most cases, different zzso zzso acid positions were found to independently influence zzso zzso and zzso formation in T cells and position 13 was the only zzso location which appeared to simultaneously influence both zzso zzso and zzso formation in zzso
