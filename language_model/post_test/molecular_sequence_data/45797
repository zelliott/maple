Development of the lip and zzso involves a complex series of events that are frequently disturbed resulting in the zzso anomalies zzso lip and zzso zzso Van der zzso syndrome zzso is an zzso dominant disorder that is zzso by zzso lip, zzso zzso lower lip pits, and zzso zzso arises as the result of zzso in the gene zzso zzso regulatory factor 6 zzso To provide insights into the role of zzso during zzso we have zzso the expression of this zzso during mouse and chick facial zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso covering the facial processes during their fusion to form the upper lip and primary zzso in both mouse and zzso However, while zzso was expressed in the zzso edge zzso of the developing secondary zzso of the zzso which zzso as in man, zzso was not expressed in the zzso edge zzso of the naturally zzso chick secondary zzso Similarly, zzso was found to be zzso in the zzso edge zzso of transforming growth factor zzso mice, which also exhibit zzso zzso Together, these results support a role for zzso during the fusion events that occur during development of the lip and zzso
