zzso zzso is a marine zzso with doubly zzso inheritance zzso of zzso In this study we analyzed the largest zzso region zzso of its zzso and zzso zzso zzso described their fine characteristics and searched for shared zzso Our results suggest that both zzso contain the control region of their respective zzso zzso The zzso control region is duplicated in tandem, with the two copies evolving in zzso This makes the zzso of zzso zzso the first zzso zzso zzso with this zzso We also compared zzso zzso control regions to that of other zzso and demonstrated that signals for basic zzso functions are retained over evolutionary times even among the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we discussed how similarities between female and male zzso may be explained in the context of zzso evolution and if the duplicated female control region might have influenced the zzso system in this zzso
