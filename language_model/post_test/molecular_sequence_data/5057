In the process of T cell differentiation zzso undergo positive and negative zzso The positive and negative selections result from interactions between the T cell zzso zzso zzso and self peptides presented by the major zzso complex zzso zzso Positive selection generates functional T cells restricted to the zzso zzso selection eliminates or zzso T cells bearing self zzso zzso with high affinity to self peptides plus zzso In this study, differentiation and selection of zzso were analyzed using bone zzso zzso It was demonstrated that differentiation of zzso zzso to zzso or zzso mature zzso occurred between 12 and 16 days post bone zzso zzso When pigeon zzso c zzso related zzso zzso were injected zzso 13 days after bone zzso zzso various changes were observed in zzso T cell zzso zzso injection of peptides with high affinity to the zzso class II resulted in specific zzso of T cell responses to the zzso whereas injection of peptides with low affinity to the zzso induced no zzso Furthermore, no modification of T cell responses was observed, when these peptides were administered after 14 days post zzso The present findings demonstrate that when peptides with high affinity to the zzso class II molecules are administered zzso at a critical stage of zzso zzso negative selection is induced in a manner of one zzso vs one T cell zzso
