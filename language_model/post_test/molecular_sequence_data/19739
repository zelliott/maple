zzso evolution in the envelope gene zzso was analyzed in four zzso zzso therapy zzso patients with typical and slow disease progression zzso In typical zzso viral populations were zzso and two distinct evolutionary patterns were zzso In one patient, zzso evolution displayed a strong zzso structure similar to the consistent pattern previously zzso In the other, viral evolution displayed a lack of zzso structure with no increase in genetic zzso and divergence over zzso In slow zzso several zzso were observed in viral zzso However, analysis within the major zzso revealed the same two evolutionary patterns described for typical zzso zzso and zzso substitution rate analyses indicated that positive selection was the major force driving zzso evolution in viral populations with zzso structure, while evolution in viral populations with an zzso structure was dominated by genetic drift and zzso zzso These results support the existence of distinct patterns of zzso evolution in zzso zzso zzso
