zzso zzso methods have played an important role in the development of transcript zzso In one in zzso zzso method, zzso in a zzso DNA clone are zzso and they are recovered without any a zzso information on the nature of the expressed zzso The only requirement is that the zzso DNA clone contains zzso separated by intervening zzso that are removed by zzso during zzso zzso and that the zzso donor and zzso site sequences follow those used by zzso It is not known whether zzso zzso donor and zzso sites from genes that contain short zzso will be processed correctly using an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this report, an analysis of zzso zzso sites using software designed to identify zzso in zzso DNA sequence suggested that the zzso zzso zzso method could recognize zzso zzso and zzso When a zzso zzso DNA clone containing the D7 gene was tested zzso this method failed to recognize and process small zzso zzso 63 zzso zzso In spite of this failure, zzso and zzso fragments were zzso The implications of these findings and their application to zzso zzso cloning in zzso zzso is zzso
