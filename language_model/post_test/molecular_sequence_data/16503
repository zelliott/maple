We have previously demonstrated that vaccination of mice with zzso DNA zzso expressing zzso zzso genes induced cellular immune responses and significant protection against challenge with zzso zzso We demonstrate here, using in zzso zzso that vaccination with DNA or zzso zzso expressing the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso are capable of inducing specific zzso and zzso immune responses and zzso modest but significant protection against zzso tuberculosis challenge in zzso This is the first report of protective immunity zzso against zzso bacteria by an zzso zzso This novel approach avoids some of the drawbacks of DNA vaccines and illustrates the potential for developing new zzso zzso zzso
