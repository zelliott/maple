Type I zzso elicit a number of biological responses by rapidly and zzso stimulating the zzso expression of a specific set of zzso The promoters of the zzso genes contain an zzso element which is required for zzso zzso A specific zzso of 18 zzso is sufficient for zzso induction when positioned in a zzso zzso Previous studies have identified three protein factors which can bind to the zzso zzso zzso We show here that the binding of one of the zzso factors requires specific zzso zzso the minimum recognition site for the other two zzso The distinct interaction of this factor with the response element is of significant importance since this factor is the sole candidate for a primary zzso zzso of zzso zzso
