zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso are classified into the same zzso because of their overall structural zzso However, their evolutionary relationship has remained obscure zzso to low sequence zzso zzso similarity of two proteins often provides evidence for divergent zzso however, structural convergence can not be completely ruled out in this zzso zzso gene structure and related function provide new evidence in favor of a common ancestral origin for zzso and zzso On the basis of two zzso the zzso location of the zzso zzso domain and evolutionary gain of one 3' zzso I propose a gradual evolution model to explain how the zzso evolved from the ancestral zzso zzso
