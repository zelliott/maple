zzso is a protein prevalent in a large number of zzso bacteria that is believed to be responsible for the energy zzso component in the import of zzso iron complexes and vitamin zzso across the outer zzso We have analyzed all the zzso proteins that are currently contained in the zzso database and have identified nine different clusters based on its zzso zzso zzso domain zzso acid zzso The vast majority of the proteins contained a single predicted zzso zzso zzso however, nine of the zzso proteins zzso a approximately 290 zzso acid zzso extension zzso to the zzso zzso which is composed of three additional predicted zzso zzso The zzso zzso region, which is located between the zzso domain and the zzso domain, is extremely variable both in length zzso zzso zzso and in zzso content, indicating that a zzso domain is not a required feature for all zzso zzso The secondary structure of the zzso domain is found to be well preserved across all families, with the most variable region being between the second zzso and the third zzso of the zzso zzso The fourth zzso found in the solution structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso domain is not a well zzso feature in zzso proteins in most of the zzso Interestingly, several of the zzso proteins contained two zzso zzso in zzso This analysis provides a framework for future zzso studies of zzso and it draws attention to the unusual features of several zzso zzso
