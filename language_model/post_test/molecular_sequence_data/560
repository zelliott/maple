The marine zzso strain zzso is a member of the alpha zzso of the zzso that contains the zzso zzso and was the first member of this group to be cultured zzso The zzso zzso are not closely related to any other known zzso and are only zzso related to other zzso zzso The zzso of zzso contains an extensive zzso zzso zzso island that includes numerous genes that are zzso among all known zzso bacteria, as well as some genes that are zzso Interestingly, certain genes that zzso proteins considered to be important in zzso assembly zzso and zzso are absent from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibit polar zzso and the zzso zzso contains a relatively large number of identified zzso zzso Although zzso is capable of both zzso and zzso growth, it does not appear to be metabolically zzso with zzso growth confined to the zzso of zzso Central carbon metabolism is zzso by genes for the zzso acid cycle zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The zzso also reveals the presence or absence of specific genes involved in the zzso zzso iron, and zzso metabolism of zzso allowing us to zzso the presence or absence of specific zzso pathways in strain zzso The pathways zzso from the zzso zzso provide important information regarding central metabolism in this strain that could provide insights useful for the isolation and zzso of new zzso bacterial zzso in particular strains of other zzso zzso
