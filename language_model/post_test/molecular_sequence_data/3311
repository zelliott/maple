The widespread use of zzso drugs against zzso has increased the prevalence of zzso resistant strains among zzso individuals due to transmission of resistant zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of zzso strains harboring resistance zzso in zzso patients in zzso Blood samples were collected from 25 zzso The DNA sequence of zzso and partial reverse zzso regions zzso zzso were obtained by direct zzso Our results showed the absence of any primary resistance zzso in the study zzso However, we were able to identify high prevalence of sequence zzso at positions in reverse zzso region associated mainly with resistance to zzso Moreover, in zzso region several secondary zzso were zzso suggesting the higher genetic zzso of this zzso The clinical significance of the zzso associated with reduced zzso to zzso remains to be zzso
