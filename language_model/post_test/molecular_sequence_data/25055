In this report we describe the cloning of zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso complementary DNA zzso contains a single open reading frame that would zzso a protein of 114 zzso acids that has zzso sequence identity to zzso zzso zzso expression of a green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso zzso gene demonstrated that the zzso protein could zzso to the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso the growth zzso caused by zzso depletion of zzso zzso levels in zzso These results support an zzso relationship between the zzso and zzso zzso and open the way for future studies into the potential value of zzso proteins as zzso zzso
