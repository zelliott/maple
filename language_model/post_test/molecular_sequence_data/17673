The introduction of zzso constraints into a flexible zzso hormone can be exploited to develop models for the zzso required for zzso binding and zzso In this review, we illustrate this approach to analog design using our work on zzso of zzso hormone zzso Design of a zzso zzso competitive zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso led to the prediction of its zzso zzso zzso forcing experiments show that this zzso is accessible to other active zzso zzso zzso zzso studies verified the predicted zzso in zzso The predicted binding zzso has recently been used to design two new zzso incorporating side zzso chain linkages suggested by the zzso model: zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso were zzso and the one predicted to be most similar to the parent zzso had equivalent potency while the second, designed to refine the zzso hypothesis, was found to exhibit enhanced zzso thus confirming the original binding zzso zzso These compounds and their derivatives now provide a new class of zzso zzso possessing both high biological potency and limited zzso flexibility, thus making them ideal for both zzso and zzso zzso
