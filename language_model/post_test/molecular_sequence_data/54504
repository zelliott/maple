A combined zzso zzso amplification lateral flow zzso zzso format was evaluated in the detection of human zzso zzso DNA from clinical zzso The zzso showed zzso sensitivity equivalent to zzso zzso levels that were identical to using gel zzso and zzso Green I zzso The zzso showed superior specificity to zzso Green I when zzso prepared from boiled human biological samples was used as zzso These results indicate that the use of zzso DNA zzso may produce false zzso when partially processed templates are zzso The zzso format presented here is simple, zzso and has future potential use in diagnosis of sleeping zzso
