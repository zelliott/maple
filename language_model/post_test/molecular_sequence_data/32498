zzso of LDL is associated with generation of zzso against a large number of different zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso recognizing zzso sequences in the LDL zzso region of zzso zzso could potentially affect both cholesterol metabolism and zzso The aim of the present study was to determine zzso effects of induction of immune responses against the zzso zzso LDL zzso site in mice deficient for the LDL zzso 

Mice received three zzso beginning at 6 weeks of age, with zzso or zzso peptides corresponding to the zzso acid sequence of the LDL zzso zzso Analysis of zzso response by zzso unexpectedly revealed high zzso of pre-existing zzso against both native and zzso binding site sequences in zzso zzso zzso with zzso binding site sequences resulted in an almost complete zzso of this zzso zzso It was also associated with a rapid increase in zzso plaques in the zzso and a substantial depletion of the zzso content of the liver, whereas plasma zzso and zzso B values were similar in all zzso 

These observations demonstrate existence of an zzso T zzso zzso response against the LDL zzso site in LDL zzso mice and suggest that this may help to prevent zzso of zzso lipids in the artery wall, whereas zzso with the corresponding zzso modified sequence zzso this response and zzso substantial zzso zzso
