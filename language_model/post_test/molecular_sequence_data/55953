A partial zzso clone has been isolated which represents a gene that is induced in potato zzso zzso zzso leaves upon zzso zzso The gene is also present in tobacco zzso zzso zzso where it is induced upon zzso and in tomato zzso zzso zzso where it is induced when the plant starts to form zzso This provides further evidence for the similarity of the zzso and zzso zzso and raises the possibility that this gene may be involved in a common step in both of these zzso zzso it could be involved in a secondary process that is induced during zzso flowering and fruit zzso
