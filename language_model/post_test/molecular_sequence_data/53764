zzso complexes provide useful models for studying the structure and zzso of zzso zzso We report the zzso bacterial zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso egg white zzso zzso zzso zzso in both free and zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso with zzso was determined to zzso A resolution, while the structure of the zzso zzso was determined in two crystal forms, to zzso and zzso A zzso In the complex, 19 zzso zzso from all six zzso regions zzso of the zzso contact 21 zzso zzso from three zzso zzso segments of the zzso The interface also includes 11 bound water zzso 3 of which are completely buried in the zzso zzso of the structures of free and bound zzso zzso reveals that several of the ordered water molecules in the free zzso site are retained and that additional waters are added upon complex zzso The interface waters serve to increase shape and chemical zzso by filling cavities between the interacting surfaces and by contributing to the hydrogen bonding network linking the zzso and zzso zzso is further enhanced by small zzso zzso movements in the zzso zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso by zzso of side chains in the zzso and by a slight shift in the relative orientation of the zzso and zzso zzso The combining site zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibit reduced temperature factors compared with those of the free zzso suggesting a loss in zzso zzso upon zzso To probe the relative contribution of individual zzso zzso to complex stabilization, single zzso zzso were introduced in the zzso of zzso recognized by zzso and their effects on zzso affinity were measured using surface zzso zzso In agreement with the crystal structure, zzso zzso at the center of the interface that are buried in the complex contribute most to the binding zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the apparent contributions of zzso zzso at the periphery are much less pronounced zzso zzso In the latter case, the zzso may be partially compensated by local zzso in zzso structure that help preserve shape zzso and the interface hydrogen bonding zzso
