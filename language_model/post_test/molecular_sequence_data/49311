A zzso study of putative zzso zzso in rat liver zzso zzso has been carried zzso Identification of these zzso acids was based on data derived from a structural model of the zzso No zzso in the CD zzso or the zzso zzso zzso pattern were observed with the zzso thus suggesting no modification in the secondary structure content or in the association state of the zzso All the zzso obtained showed a reduction of the zzso activity, the most dramatic effect being that of zzso followed by zzso and zzso Changes in affinity for either of the zzso homocysteine or zzso were detected when zzso were performed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso to be involved in homocysteine zzso has a strong effect on affinity for zzso The relevance of these results is discussed in the light of very recent structural data obtained for the human zzso
