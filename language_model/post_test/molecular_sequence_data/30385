zzso carrier zzso zzso is a zzso protein that is thought to be involved in the zzso transport of zzso Using synthetic zzso based on the protein sequence of zzso a clone zzso was isolated from a rat liver zzso zzso The DNA sequence revealed that the zzso could zzso a zzso of 273 zzso acids zzso zzso or 143 zzso acids zzso zzso in which the zzso 123 zzso acids are identical to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that a variety of rat zzso contain a zzso zzso of a size similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased in parallel with zzso zzso zzso in the immature zzso rat zzso The isolation of a zzso clone zzso zzso will facilitate studies on its role in cholesterol zzso
