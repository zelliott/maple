zzso the ecological and evolutionary forces that shape the genetic structure of invasive populations and facilitate their expansion across a large spectrum of environments is critical for the prediction of spread and management of ongoing zzso Here, we study the dynamics of zzso colonization in the colonial zzso zzso zzso a notorious marine zzso After its initial introduction from the Northwest Pacific, zzso zzso spread rapidly along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, zzso both aquaculture facilities and natural zzso We compare genetic diversity and patterns of gene flow among 25 populations zzso from the West and East zzso and evaluate the contribution of sexual zzso asexual reproduction to this zzso invasion success using data from the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene and 13 nuclear zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal contrasting patterns of spread in the coastal waters of North zzso While the West coast was zzso by zzso zzso zzso the East coast invasion appears to have occurred through zzso zzso zzso zzso data further indicate that although zzso in colonial zzso is predominantly achieved through sexually produced zzso aquaculture practices such as zzso washing can facilitate fragmentation and potentially exacerbate zzso and spread via asexual zzso The results presented here suggest that caution should be used against the general assumption that all zzso even within a single species, exhibit similar patterns of zzso as highly contrasting dynamics may transpire in different invaded zzso
