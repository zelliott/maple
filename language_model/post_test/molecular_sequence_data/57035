We have characterized the zzso organization, complete 3' untranslated region zzso and approximately zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region of the mouse zzso 2 zzso zzso The sizes of zzso and the pattern of interruption of the reading frame by zzso are highly zzso in mouse zzso in comparison with mouse or human zzso a finding that suggests a close evolutionary relationship between the two zzso The zzso and zzso genes are also similar in that the zzso of both genes contain multiple zzso and zzso motifs that might function as zzso of zzso zzso However, the sequences of the promoter regions in zzso and zzso are very zzso in particular, the zzso gene lacks the serum response element and the zzso binding site that have been implicated in the serum response of the human zzso zzso The structure of the zzso gene is consistent with emerging evidence supporting the view that zzso and zzso perform overlapping but distinct zzso
