The second internal transcribed zzso zzso of the zzso DNA of zzso zzso from zzso D zzso from fallow zzso D zzso from sheep and D zzso from donkeys has been zzso to investigate the genetic relationships among zzso species, especially between D zzso and D zzso because the latter is not generally accepted as a separate zzso The length of the zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso content ranged from 25 to 33 per zzso zzso variations in D zzso zzso to zzso per zzso and D zzso zzso to zzso per zzso were zzso sequence zzso between the species ranged from zzso to zzso per zzso Some sequence differences occurred at restriction sites of zzso leading to characteristic restriction zzso length zzso The zzso differences between D zzso and D zzso far exceeded the zzso variation, thus providing additional evidence that the two species are genetically zzso
