During banana zzso zzso zzso fruit zzso zzso production triggers a zzso cascade that is accompanied by a massive conversion of starch to zzso an associated burst of respiratory activity, and an increase in protein zzso zzso screening of zzso libraries representing banana pulp at zzso stages 1 and 3 has led to the isolation of 11 zzso groups of zzso expressed zzso Identification of these transcripts by partial sequence analysis indicates that two of the zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso whereas others zzso proteins thought to be associated with zzso zzso or stress responses in zzso Their relative abundance in the pulp and zzso distribution in zzso banana plants were determined by zzso zzso The relative abundance of transcripts zzso starch zzso zzso starch zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso decreased in pulp during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a putative zzso protein increased early in zzso The zzso of the molecular events associated with banana zzso will facilitate a better understanding and control of these zzso and will allow us to attain our long-term goal of producing candidate oral vaccines in transgenic banana zzso
