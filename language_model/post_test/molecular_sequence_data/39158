zzso of Southern zzso analyses and zzso chain reaction revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso to the zzso gene of zzso zzso In zzso coli, the zzso gene product is essential for zzso of proteins across the inner membrane via the zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and its zzso sequence zzso zzso acid sequence analysis of the cloned gene revealed significant zzso to the zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the cloned gene did not complement a temperature sensitive zzso in the zzso coli zzso zzso strains harboring the cloned gene did produce a protein that zzso with zzso zzso In addition, the cloned gene did restore sensitivity to sodium zzso in an zzso coli zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso zzso may use a system similar to the zzso system of zzso coli to transport proteins across the zzso zzso but suggest that the zzso zzso gene product may require zzso zzso proteins to complement some zzso zzso in zzso zzso
