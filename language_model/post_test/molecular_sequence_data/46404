zzso are zzso that digest zzso zzso present principally in insects and zzso In plants, these zzso play an important role in zzso against pathogen attack, although they have also been described as induced by mechanical damage, zzso heavy metals, cold, zzso zzso Using an zzso control zzso we isolated a gene zzso whose translated sequence has high zzso with a class III zzso The zzso named zzso consisted of one zzso of zzso zzso which codes for a zzso of 334 zzso zzso including a deduced signal zzso of 27 zzso acid that directs protein to the zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso is within a cluster that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso max class III zzso This group is differentiated from other species of zzso by the presence of an additional extension in zzso zzso Moreover, in comparison with the majority of zzso zzso has two additional zzso zzso which, according to zzso zzso studies, are very zzso Gene expression analysis showed enhanced transcript abundance of this gene during drought stress in zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared with growth under normal zzso Furthermore, its expression is restricted to zzso and zzso zzso of this gene was also induced by salt stress, hydrogen zzso and zzso with zzso zzso
