A zzso library enriched for human zzso liver genes was constructed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generated from this library was found to represent a novel putative zzso zzso zzso A full-length clone isolated for this gene encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence has zzso identity over zzso zzso acids with the zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso This gene has therefore been named zzso zzso virus zzso zzso related zzso zzso was also found to have sequence identity zzso over zzso zzso to a database zzso A full-length clone for this zzso was isolated and zzso Conceptual translation predicts a protein of 508 zzso acids that, like zzso has similarity to zzso zzso zzso identity over 300 zzso zzso This gene has been named zzso zzso of zzso with zzso indicates that they zzso structurally related putative zzso protein zzso Northern analysis shows that expression of both genes is widespread and elevated in highly zzso cells, such as zzso zzso and fetal zzso zzso zzso is reported to be essential for DNA replication of zzso zzso The similarity of zzso and zzso to zzso indicates that these genes may have similar zzso
