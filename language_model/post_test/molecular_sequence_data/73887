The infection of zzso by zzso zzso virus zzso represents an attractive model to study the zzso zzso of zzso and human zzso zzso The utility of this model would be enhanced if genetic changes in human zzso virus zzso associated with interesting in zzso properties would, when introduced into zzso result in similar zzso In this study, we introduced zzso acid changes into the zzso envelope zzso that, in the context of the zzso envelope zzso disproportionately attenuated in zzso zzso effects compared with the viral replication zzso zzso acid changes in the zzso zzso zzso altered the zzso association of the zzso and zzso zzso significantly more than did analogous changes in the zzso envelope zzso zzso in the affinity of the zzso interaction were observed and were associated with a dramatic zzso of virus replication not seen in the zzso zzso The increased sensitivity of the zzso zzso interaction to zzso acid changes presents an obstacle to the direct extension of results obtained with the zzso envelope zzso to the zzso zzso
