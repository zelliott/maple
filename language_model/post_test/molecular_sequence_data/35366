Some zzso and zzso species are among the most prevalent zzso bacteria present in the zzso zzso of healthy zzso These flagellate species contribute zzso zzso category genes to the zzso zzso and zzso proteins to the zzso zzso We reviewed and revised the zzso of zzso genes in the zzso of six zzso and zzso species that occur in the human zzso zzso and examined their respective locus organization by comparative zzso zzso gene order was generally zzso across these zzso Five of these species zzso multiple genes for predicted zzso zzso proteins were isolated from zzso zzso strain zzso and from zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins were almost zzso These protein preparations zzso zzso of zzso zzso from human zzso zzso cell lines, suggesting that these zzso were zzso zzso from the other four species were predicted to be zzso on the basis of alignment to the consensus sequence of zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso Many zzso genes were deduced to be under the control of zzso The relative abundance of the target zzso and zzso species varied across shotgun zzso from 27 elderly zzso Genes involved in the zzso zzso pathways of these species were zzso abundant in these zzso suggesting that the current depth of coverage used for zzso sequencing zzso zzso total sequence in our zzso insufficiently captures the functional diversity of zzso present at low zzso relative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus appear to zzso complex zzso composed of zzso proteins that stimulate zzso zzso A greater depth of sequencing, improved zzso of sequencing and improved zzso assembly from short reads will be required to facilitate in zzso analyses of complete complex zzso pathways for zzso target species from shotgun zzso
