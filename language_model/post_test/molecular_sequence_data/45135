The human zzso X zzso zzso also known as steroid and zzso zzso is a member of the orphan nuclear receptors and mediates the zzso zzso response with broad specificity and implications for drug zzso The mouse zzso X zzso is highly similar to the human zzso in structure but with subtle species differentiation in the zzso binding domain zzso The zzso zzso named zzso or zzso zzso in other nuclear receptors is responsible for zzso zzso by recruiting zzso through zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso can also repress gene expression by interacting with zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso hormone zzso zzso We first constructed zzso models of the complete zzso with two zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We then performed energy zzso and molecular dynamics simulations on these systems to study the specific interactions between the interacting zzso and zzso Further experimental results supported and validated the observed preference of zzso toward zzso over zzso Our modeling results revealed the key interactions that account for the binding zzso Here, we propose structural models of the zzso and zzso complexes to understand their molecular interactions and potential zzso zzso
