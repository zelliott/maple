The zzso zzso which are members of the zzso family of zzso factors, have previously been shown to interact with the zzso zzso zzso and to mediate its zzso zzso they zzso with zzso zzso or related zzso factors, possibly altering their zzso zzso they also zzso bind zzso a zzso protein zzso Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel protein isolated in a zzso zzso screen using the zzso half of zzso as a zzso This zzso protein zzso for mouse zzso zzso is rather zzso zzso zzso and contains high proportions of zzso zzso and Pro zzso zzso It zzso and interacts with zzso in zzso cells, contains a zzso nuclear zzso signal and possesses an zzso zzso zzso experiments show that zzso is able to zzso zzso activity, in an zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso interacts with several components of the zzso zzso machinery zzso and zzso including zzso zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso gene zzso by interfering with the assembly or stability of specific zzso zzso zzso
