The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes the zzso delta zzso zzso zzso (the third zzso of zzso zzso and ranks among the numerous zzso genes which are poorly transcribed in zzso zzso The promoters of the zzso gene were located by deletion zzso The zzso ends of the zzso transcripts originating from one promoter were determined by primer zzso This promoter has a zzso motif with a 16 zzso spacing between the zzso zzso and the zzso start zzso Such spacing is unusually long for zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso fusion was expressed at zzso levels, suggesting that zzso 54 zzso zzso is not involved in zzso zzso The expression of another zzso zzso zzso zzso (for zzso regulation of nitrate zzso and zzso zzso zzso also appeared to be independent of zzso in zzso and occurred at a very low level in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso promoters have sequence similarities in addition to the zzso zzso motif and may also be related to some zzso zzso promoters of zzso zzso We propose that the zzso and zzso promoters are activated by zzso including perhaps an alternative zzso factor, which are present in zzso but absent from zzso zzso
