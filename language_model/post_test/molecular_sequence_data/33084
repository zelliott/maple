Various transcripts coding for proteins considered to be central to zzso interactions were identified previously as zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Among these genes were an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The present study extends this previous work to investigate similar molecules in other zzso zzso Specifically, partial zzso sequences zzso three different zzso molecules and two different zzso zzso zzso were isolated, and the differential zzso between adult male and female worms was compared by conventional and quantitative reverse zzso zzso for three species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In accordance with previous findings, zzso zzso was observed for all molecules zzso Based on this information, it is hypothesized that adult males are responsible for producing proteins essential to the survival of zzso inside the host and for supporting zzso and zzso processes in female zzso
