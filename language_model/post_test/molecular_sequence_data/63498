Next to the zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of submerged zzso may offer an additional niche for zzso bacteria in shallow freshwater zzso In this study, we explored the potential activities and community compositions of zzso bacteria of the zzso zzso and zzso compartments of seven shallow freshwater lakes which differed in their zzso status, distribution of submerged zzso and restoration zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso compartment was inhabited by species belonging to cluster 3 of the zzso lineage and to the zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso bacterial community compositions and the potential activities differed significantly between zzso Interestingly, both the zzso bacterial community composition and potential activity were influenced by the restoration status of the different lakes zzso
