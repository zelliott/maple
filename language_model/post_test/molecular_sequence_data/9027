zzso zzso interactions are involved in the initial stages of many fundamental biological and pathological processes through zzso zzso The design of high affinity zzso is therefore necessary to study, inhibit and control the processes governed through zzso recognition by their zzso zzso zzso gold zzso zzso zzso show promising potential as zzso tools for studies in fundamental zzso research as well as biomedical zzso Here we present the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and their effectiveness as binding partners for zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso surface zzso resonance zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the gold zzso platform displays a significant cluster zzso effect for presenting zzso zzso with almost a zzso increase in binding compared with a zzso reference probe in free zzso The most effective zzso exhibited a zzso constant zzso of 50 zzso per zzso the most effective zzso of zzso measured to date; another demonstration of the potential of zzso towards zzso tools and potent zzso for the prevention of pathogen zzso The influence of zzso presentation density on their recognition by protein receptors is also zzso
