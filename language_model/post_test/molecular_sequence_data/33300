zzso are important evolutionary forces but can be deleterious if left zzso Members of the human zzso family of zzso zzso can inhibit a wide range of zzso as well as zzso zzso These zzso are structurally organized in one or two zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso contains two such zzso only the C terminal of which is endowed with editing activity, while its zzso counterpart binds zzso promotes zzso and is necessary for packaging into human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso Here, we performed a large-scale zzso analysis of the zzso N zzso testing zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, in the absence of structural information on this domain, we used zzso modeling to examine the positions of functionally important zzso and of zzso found to be under positive selection by zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal the importance of a predicted zzso binding zzso interface both for packaging into zzso zzso and zzso of both zzso infection and zzso zzso We further found that the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso defective for packaging can be almost entirely rescued if their zzso incorporation is forced by fusion with zzso indicating that the corresponding region of zzso plays little role in other aspects of its action against this zzso Interestingly, zzso forming the zzso zzso interface are highly zzso contrasting with the rapid evolution of two neighboring zzso zzso acid patches, one targeted by the zzso protein of zzso zzso and the other of zzso zzso
