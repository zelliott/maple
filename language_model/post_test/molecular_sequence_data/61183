A zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was cloned as a protein involved in the zzso complex formed on the zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso directly bound to zzso in zzso and in zzso in cultured zzso The zzso complex required the zzso element as well as zzso in the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso recognized only zzso even in the presence of zzso Both the zzso and zzso elements were also required for the zzso zzso In transient zzso experiments, the zzso complex, as well as zzso due to the zzso was increased by the introduction of zzso at low doses but decreased at high zzso The repression of both complex formation and zzso by zzso at high doses was zzso by the introduction of zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso complex bound to the zzso appeared in the early zzso phase of the cell cycle when zzso was not zzso expressed and gradually disappeared after the zzso expression reached its zzso The results indicate that the cell zzso expression of the zzso gene is regulated by the zzso amount of zzso through the complex formation states between zzso and zzso
