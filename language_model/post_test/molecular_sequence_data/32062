Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is a newly emergent human disease, which requires rapid diagnosis and effective zzso Among zzso sources, zzso Y zzso is the major zzso found in chicken eggs and can be used as an alternative to zzso zzso normally used in research and zzso In this study, zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso was chosen and characterized with zzso display zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso spike protein were cloned in zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso After zzso the purity of these zzso spike proteins was examined on zzso and their identity verified with Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso and zzso from zzso stage zzso zzso Using these zzso proteins to zzso zzso it was found that zzso zzso zzso in the egg zzso and zzso were highly zzso to the zzso as shown by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso displaying zzso library was also established from zzso B cells of zzso chicken with 5 zzso zzso zzso After four panning cycles, the zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso In sequence analysis with chicken zzso zzso five zzso clones zzso with large zzso of between 31 and zzso in the zzso regions, one dominant zzso zzso had strong binding to zzso zzso located between zzso acid zzso zzso of the spike protein and this particular zzso had significantly strong binding to zzso zzso E6 zzso Based on the results, we conclude that generating specific zzso zzso zzso with the zzso display system can be successfully achieved and that this knowledge can be applied in clinical or academic zzso
