During development, each tissue receives and maintains a number of specific zzso projections that are adequate to sustain its zzso The mechanism by which this intricate process occurs is not well zzso but it has been proposed that zzso zzso factors derived from the target tissue may be zzso Here we describe the identification of a novel human protein that is important for the growth, zzso and survival of primary sympathetic and zzso sensory zzso This zzso designated zzso has a broad tissue distribution and is structurally related to both nerve growth factor and zzso zzso zzso Its unique range of zzso and zzso activities suggests that it is likely to play a wide role in defining the fate and function of nerve cells during zzso
