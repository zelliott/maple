zzso zzso zzso are artificial restriction zzso custom designed for induction of zzso breaks zzso at a specific zzso These zzso may result in zzso zzso or zzso zzso at the repair site, depending on the DNA repair zzso that is zzso These promising techniques for zzso engineering were evaluated in zzso plants using zzso floral dip zzso A zzso containing the target site for a zzso pair, that was shown to be active in zzso was integrated in the zzso zzso zzso the corresponding pair of zzso genes was zzso integrated in the zzso zzso and zzso activity was determined by zzso and sequence analysis of the target zzso zzso were obtained in up to zzso of the zzso products, consisting of deletions ranging between 1 and 200 zzso and insertions ranging between 1 and 14 zzso We did not observe any toxicity from expression of the zzso In order to obtain zzso zzso zzso zzso plants containing the target site and expressing the zzso pair were transformed with a zzso zzso zzso Three zzso plants were obtained from approximately zzso zzso Two of these represent zzso true zzso events, as determined by zzso Southern zzso analysis and sequencing of the resulting zzso zzso The third plant showed an zzso zzso zzso No zzso plants were obtained in a comparable number of zzso that did not contain the zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso enhance zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso delivered through floral dip zzso
