zzso tannins zzso are an important factor in the zzso and dietary quality of many forage zzso We report here experiments aimed at altering the levels and zzso composition of condensed tannins zzso in zzso zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso foot zzso using genetic zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in sense in zzso zzso and CT levels in transgenic root cultures were zzso Two zzso lines were noted with decreased CT content relative to controls and these levels were comparable with zzso zzso In zzso a zzso line with the highest CT levels, CT structure was altered in a manner consistent with the zzso specificity of the introduced zzso that is an increase in zzso zzso noted after zzso of zzso zzso confirmed the expression of zzso zzso zzso in both zzso zzso lines and also in zzso Analysis of selected root culture lines indicated that the zzso composition of zzso did not change during growth and development but that levels of zzso varied in a regulated zzso
