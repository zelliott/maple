zzso is a member of the zzso heat shock protein zzso family and under various zzso conditions accumulates in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso region of the zzso gene on human zzso zzso where a zzso zzso I hypersensitive site is located, we identified a gene transcribed in the opposite zzso Analysis of its zzso structure by zzso and zzso revealed that this gene is composed of two zzso and encodes a new member of the zzso zzso zzso This gene was designated the zzso gene by the zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso structure of the rat zzso was also zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the zzso gene is expressed zzso in skeletal muscle and heart but not in the zzso while the neighboring zzso gene is highly expressed in all three zzso The two related genes are arranged in a head-to-head manner with an zzso sequence of less than 1 zzso raising a possibility of shared regulatory elements for their zzso
