A single gene zzso zzso for the zzso zzso was produced by reverse zzso of zzso isolated from differentiated zzso cells and subsequently amplified by means of the zzso chain zzso This zzso was introduced into the zzso expression zzso zzso and used to zzso a zzso cell line zzso expressing a viral zzso zzso zzso characteristics identical to the native zzso zzso were zzso A combination of zzso selection and cell sorting using zzso zzso zzso were then used to generate stable cell lines expressing up to zzso zzso zzso functional zzso zzso with a lower affinity for zzso It is zzso that this zzso of zzso affinity is dependent on zzso to native zzso in the host zzso
