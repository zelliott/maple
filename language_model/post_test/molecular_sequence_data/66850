In the zzso zzso zzso acts early in zzso as a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Gene expression profiling of zzso zzso cell zzso isolated 3 h after hormonal treatment of zzso mice revealed the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso genes whose functions are associated with DNA zzso This group included all of the zzso maintenance zzso proteins that are required for DNA replication zzso zzso regulated loading of these zzso proteins onto zzso in parallel with its induction of DNA zzso zzso caused this zzso loading by retention of zzso proteins in the nucleus and through the induction of the loading factor zzso which is necessary for the zzso zzso to bind to the origin of DNA zzso zzso dramatically reduced the binding of the zzso to zzso by a number of zzso First, zzso zzso and protein abundance was zzso Second, zzso inhibited the zzso induction of zzso Third, zzso treatment zzso the normally nuclear zzso proteins into the zzso This reduced zzso binding resulted in the complete zzso of zzso DNA synthesis by zzso These data reveal mechanisms not only for female sex steroid hormone action but also in the regulation of DNA replication zzso
