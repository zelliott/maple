zzso zzso is the major zzso minus zzso zzso Although studies have zzso the mechanism of the zzso motor domain, if and how zzso zzso tail and the accessory chains it binds regulate motor activity remain to be zzso Here, we investigate the structure and function of the zzso zzso zzso light zzso and intermediate zzso chains in zzso heavy chain zzso zzso We present the crystal structure of a zzso complex, showing zzso zzso zzso To determine the molecular effects of zzso and zzso on zzso function, we generated zzso and zzso strains and analyzed zzso zzso motor zzso We find that the zzso complex promotes zzso zzso and zzso zzso The absence of zzso and zzso yields zzso with decreased zzso dramatically reduced zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduces zzso complex formation, yielding zzso zzso with activity similar to zzso from the zzso zzso Of interest, motor zzso resulting from zzso complex depletion bear similarity to a point zzso in the zzso zzso zzso tail zzso highlighting this region as a zzso regulatory motor zzso
