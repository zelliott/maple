A zzso zzso a new human zzso protein zzso was zzso The corresponding protein is highly zzso with the previously described zzso zzso suggesting that it represents a second zzso of the human zzso zzso This new zzso protein was subsequently named zzso and represents the second example of multiple zzso of an zzso protein in a single zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso band zzso zzso to Sonic zzso Gene structure analysis revealed that at least part of the observed zzso zzso zzso is caused by alternative zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso produced after zzso 2 skipping are predicted to zzso truncated products, whose functionality is still zzso An zzso zzso was detected on zzso zzso by database zzso Several zzso zzso species were detected by Northern zzso and their abundance varied zzso among zzso the highest expression levels were detected in fetal and adult brain, whereas lower levels were observed in liver, muscle and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso were detected in all zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso the expression of zzso in brain was shown to be restricted to zzso and zzso cells from zzso zzso This suggests a specific function for zzso in the physiology of the development and/or maintenance of distinct zzso of nerve zzso
