The early detection of zzso zzso encephalitis zzso represents a major problem in viral zzso We have now established a test system based on zzso for the specific amplification of zzso in zzso fluid zzso samples followed by zzso zzso The test proved to be very zzso Five molecules of zzso 1 DNA still yielded positive signals after zzso The zzso was applied to zzso samples from 6 patients with confirmed zzso All except one zzso sample obtained from the 2nd to the 8th day after onset of neurological symptoms yielded positive zzso The zzso used also exhibit a certain degree of zzso with zzso 2, as revealed by testing of a zzso sample from an zzso zzso zzso No positive signals were obtained with human DNA and with DNA from zzso and zzso zzso Also 42 zzso samples of patients suffering from other diseases of the zzso yielded negative zzso The present results indicate that the detection of zzso DNA in zzso by zzso represents a valuable tool for the early diagnosis of zzso
