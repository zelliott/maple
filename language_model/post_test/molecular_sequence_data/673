A gene zzso a novel zzso zzso was cloned from the fungus zzso zzso by using inverse zzso The DNA sequence of zzso contains a zzso zzso open reading frame and two zzso that are 52 and 201 zzso in zzso Regarding our in zzso analysis, zzso is a modular zzso composed of a zzso zzso domain, which is responsible for zzso activity, and a zzso domain containing several zzso Apparently, the function of these zzso is to anchor the zzso tightly onto the large zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso of zzso and a deduced molecular mass of 58 zzso The optimal pH and temperature conditions were determined to be zzso and 45 degrees C, respectively, when zzso zzso was used as the zzso zzso and zzso analyses indicated the presence of a single active zzso zzso with zzso produced an zzso zzso that had an activity of 39 zzso zzso Metal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also influenced the activity of the zzso zzso
