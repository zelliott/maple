In this study, we report the cloning of the rat cardiac zzso of zzso on the basis of its interaction with an zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso derived form the zzso zzso C regulatory zzso zzso binds activated zzso zzso C zzso better than the inactive zzso and nearly three times better than other protein zzso C zzso The interaction between zzso zzso C and zzso is zzso by sequences in both the regulatory and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso is an zzso zzso C zzso in zzso and protein zzso C zzso of zzso leads to a decreased binding of zzso zzso C to zzso
