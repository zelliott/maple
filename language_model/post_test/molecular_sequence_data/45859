Unlike many bacterial zzso zzso zzso is not known to produce classical zzso and precisely how zzso zzso zzso the respiratory zzso has remained a mystery for zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of a zzso factor zzso possibly responsible for airway cellular damage and other zzso associated with zzso zzso infections in zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that possesses zzso zzso zzso Within its N zzso zzso contains key zzso acids associated with zzso binding and zzso activity, similar to zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso both identical and distinct zzso proteins when compared with zzso zzso zzso elicits extensive zzso and ultimate cell death of zzso cells, including distinct and progressive patterns of zzso in zzso rings in organ culture that had been previously ascribed to infection with zzso virulent zzso zzso We observed dramatic zzso to zzso in patients diagnosed with zzso zzso pneumonia, indicating that this toxin is zzso in zzso and possesses highly zzso zzso
