Root chicory zzso zzso zzso is a zzso crop, but is harvested to obtain root zzso at the end of the first growing season before zzso However, cold temperatures may zzso seeds or zzso leading to incidental early zzso and hence understanding the molecular basis of zzso is zzso A zzso box sequence was isolated by zzso and named zzso zzso because of its zzso positioning within the same zzso as the floral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso caused late flowering and prevented zzso of the zzso target zzso zzso by zzso suggesting functional conservation between root chicory and zzso Like zzso in zzso zzso was zzso during zzso of seeds or zzso of zzso but repression of zzso was unstable when the zzso temperature was favorable to flowering and when it zzso the zzso This instability of zzso repression may be linked to the zzso of root chicory compared with the annual zzso of zzso However, zzso of zzso was also observed in zzso when a high temperature treatment was used straight after seed zzso eliminating the zzso effect of cold on zzso zzso zzso of a zzso box floral zzso and its zzso by high temperature thus appear to be zzso features of the zzso and zzso responses in distant zzso
