This report completes a preliminary analysis of the sequence of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso the largest virus zzso to be zzso to zzso The zzso zzso is 57% the size of the zzso from the smallest zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of 74 zzso of newly zzso DNA, from the right zzso of the zzso zzso revealed 153 open reading frames zzso of 65 zzso or zzso zzso of these zzso which are evenly distributed on both strands of the DNA, were considered major zzso zzso of the major zzso were separated by less than 100 zzso The largest zzso distance was zzso zzso which occurred between two zzso located in the zzso zzso terminal repeat region of the zzso zzso zzso of the 85 major zzso resemble proteins in databases, including the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso type II DNA zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso a zzso zzso translation zzso factor 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso and an zzso DNA zzso and its corresponding DNA zzso zzso zzso of the 153 zzso resembled other zzso zzso suggesting that they represent either gene zzso or gene zzso
