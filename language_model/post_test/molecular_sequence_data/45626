zzso releasing hormone zzso stimulates an increase in plasma cortisol in horses with zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso zzso A similar phenomenon is observed in humans with zzso disease or Nelson's zzso The mechanism of the response in humans is not known, but an zzso in zzso zzso selectivity or responsiveness in abnormal zzso has been zzso zzso with zzso unlike humans, almost exclusively have zzso of zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the mechanism responsible for the zzso response observed in horses likely zzso We proposed that zzso directly stimulates the zzso in normal and zzso horses to release zzso zzso derived zzso Using zzso stimulating hormone zzso as a marker of a zzso response and zzso as a marker of a zzso response, we were able to demonstrate a marked increase in plasma concentration of zzso and a modest, but significant increase in zzso after zzso treatment in normal zzso The ability of zzso to directly stimulate release of zzso peptides was confirmed using zzso and zzso tissue zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tissue from both normal and zzso horses was confirmed using reverse zzso zzso chain zzso We conclude that zzso triggers the release of zzso peptides from the zzso through the direct stimulation of zzso receptors normally expressed on zzso The increase in plasma cortisol following zzso in horses with zzso is likely attributable to the release of zzso from the zzso zzso
