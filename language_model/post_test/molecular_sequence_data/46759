We report the zzso zzso and characterization of a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family that transfers zzso to a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the gene zzso this zzso termed zzso is expressed in a highly zzso zzso zzso levels of transcript were found in rat and mouse zzso zzso stomach, small zzso and zzso trace amounts were seen in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed zzso in zzso cells but demonstrated no zzso activity in zzso against a panel of unmodified zzso including zzso zzso However, when incubated with the total zzso products obtained by action of zzso on zzso zzso zzso additional incorporation of zzso was zzso resulting in new zzso acids being zzso The zzso zzso failed to serve as a zzso for zzso after modification of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso and sodium zzso reduction, indicating a requirement for the presence of intact zzso This suggests that zzso of zzso zzso may proceed in a specific zzso manner and underscores the potential complexity of the processes that regulate zzso
