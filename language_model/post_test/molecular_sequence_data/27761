The zzso sequences of zzso of members of the zzso species zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso The external transcribed zzso zzso the region zzso the zzso end of the primary transcript, upstream from the zzso zzso are highly zzso between in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas the more zzso related zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ in having apparent deletions of 22 and 27 zzso respectively, in this zzso The divergence of zzso sequence upstream from the zzso start points is consistent with the established zzso of the five zzso The sequences between zzso positions zzso and zzso from the primary zzso start point show extremely little variation between each zzso This is also the case for sequences between the approximate zzso positions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso This could indicate a functional importance not only of the sequences next to the zzso start point, but also of these upstream zzso An array of zzso repeats can be found at a comparable distance upstream from the zzso start point in each zzso zzso zzso comparisons indicate that for each species not only is the sequence at the primary zzso start point duplicated within the zzso repeats as previously reported for zzso zzso but that this is part of a longer interrupted zzso which includes a region of strong similarity with the sequence between the approximate positions zzso to zzso This region is contained within one of the regions upstream from the zzso start point that is strongly zzso between the zzso This sequence may therefore have functional significance not only for the zzso of the zzso zzso but also for zzso of the so-called zzso sequences which is now known to zzso The zzso zzso are themselves highly zzso within a species indicating that zzso mechanisms are zzso The divergence of these zzso between species is consistent with the zzso zzso The 3' sequences of the primary zzso unit, now known to be zzso sites, are also highly similar between the zzso Immediately downstream from these sites there is little zzso between the zzso of the different species, until zzso tandem zzso are reached in each zzso
