In an effort to study zzso diversity within and between the Indian zzso of the Asian rice zzso zzso zzso zzso a major insect zzso of rice, we made use of zzso zzso element integration site zzso Using zzso zzso the design of which is based on zzso zzso we amplified a zzso 450 zzso zzso sequence from the rice zzso zzso The zzso sequence showed zzso with that of a zzso element isolated from the zzso fly, zzso zzso a major zzso zzso of zzso Southern zzso using this zzso zzso as a probe, revealed that the zzso elements are moderately to highly repetitive in the rice zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence information of this zzso zzso fragment, zzso zzso were designed and used in an inverse zzso zzso to amplify the DNA zzso the zzso zzso To study the regions zzso the zzso integration sites, we employed a novel zzso approach: a combination of sequence specific amplification zzso zzso and amplified zzso length zzso zzso The zzso zzso primer was used in combination with zzso zzso with 1-3 selective zzso at their 3' zzso The amplification products were resolved on an zzso zzso zzso onto nylon zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso in the regions zzso the zzso integration sites, suggesting that zzso elements in the rice zzso zzso may be fixed in a zzso zzso The implications of these results are discussed in the context of zzso zzso
