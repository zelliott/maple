One of the requirements for engineering expansion of the genetic code is a unique zzso which is available for specifying the new zzso zzso The potential of the zzso zzso in zzso coli to specify a single zzso acid zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso containing the extra zzso zzso at position zzso of its zzso loop has been zzso With this zzso combination and at least partial zzso of release factor 1, the zzso zzso specifies a zzso zzso with an efficiency of 13 to 26 zzso The decoding properties of zzso with U at position zzso of its zzso zzso loop, and a counterpart with A at position zzso strongly suggest that in both cases their zzso loop bases stack in alternative zzso The identity of the zzso immediately zzso of the zzso zzso influences the efficiency of zzso translation via the properties of its zzso zzso When there is the potential for the zzso of this zzso to zzso from pairing with its zzso and to zzso to zzso at a nearby 3' closely matched zzso the efficiency of zzso translation at zzso is zzso Evidence is presented which suggests that when there is a zzso base at position 32 of this zzso zzso zzso it influences decoding of the zzso zzso
