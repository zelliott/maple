We have investigated the existence and genetic organization of a functional type III zzso system zzso in a zzso zzso strain by initially using the zzso zzso strain zzso We report for the first time the complete zzso DNA sequence of an zzso strain that comprises 35 genes organized in a similar disposition as that in zzso zzso Using several gene zzso we also determined the presence of a zzso in clinical or environmental strains of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using one of the zzso genes zzso we were able to obtain a defined zzso zzso in strain zzso zzso which showed reduced toxicity and zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strain with a zzso zzso carrying zzso was fully able to restore the zzso toxicity and zzso
