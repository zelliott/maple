zzso zzso I zzso is the major active constituent of zzso zzso which are widely used for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is classified as type II zzso protein zzso due to the zzso zzso activity of the zzso also referred to as toxic zzso zzso and the close relative zzso both belong to the family of the zzso plant type II zzso zzso Isolation of the zzso proteins from plant material yield zzso material probably due to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to prepare pure and homogeneous protein as a prerequisite for structural and zzso studies in order to gain insight into the mode of action of this zzso plant protein on zzso and immune zzso Of particular interest was to explain whether the differences in toxicity of zzso and zzso are the result of variations of their zzso zzso By investigating the sequence zzso between the active sites of different zzso we were able to deduce a set of zzso which were suitable for specific amplification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso strategy the full-length 1923 zzso DNA sequence coding for the zzso was obtained showing the existence of a single zzso zzso In order to zzso the molecular basis for the observed differences in zzso within the family of zzso the zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso coli zzso resulted in production of zzso inclusion bodies zzso zzso of total zzso zzso led to a pure and homogeneous protein species with an apparent molecular mass of 27 zzso and a zzso value of zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was in the same range as that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was very similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the higher zzso of zzso cannot be accountable for differences in the zzso activities of the type II zzso zzso
