The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso the growth of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso The molecular target of zzso 1 was identified as zzso protein zzso zzso using a zzso analogue to purify a approximately zzso protein from zzso of zzso zzso This represents the first example of a zzso zzso Cloning of zzso from several zzso zzso has identified a zzso signature sequence of nearly 300 zzso acids that is not found in zzso or zzso zzso and which contains an zzso third zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso is remarkably different from zzso zzso The activity of both native and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso by zzso with significant zzso Two zzso of the zzso zzso are expressed from a single copy zzso zzso sequence of the soluble zzso of zzso is consistent with alternative translation initiation within the open reading frame of the zzso A larger, zzso zzso zzso to the deduced full-length protein zzso zzso 1 is a potent inhibitor of both soluble and zzso zzso of native zzso as well as zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso
