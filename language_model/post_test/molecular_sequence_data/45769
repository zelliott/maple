zzso zzso is a novel zzso protein isolated from the red zzso zzso zzso The potent zzso activity of zzso against both laboratory and primary zzso of zzso at zzso zzso makes this protein an attractive candidate zzso to prevent sexual transmission of zzso Here, we describe the zzso production and zzso of a biologically active zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso To facilitate a large-scale production of zzso zzso we tested different expression conditions to zzso the expression in the zzso of zzso coli to increase the overall production of soluble zzso Attempts to express zzso in shake flask cultures resulted in a modest yield of soluble zzso with a large zzso of the protein in inclusion zzso The use of a zzso and of a rich, zzso medium allowed the total amount of zzso per liter to be increased by about zzso with approximately zzso of the protein expressed in the soluble zzso zzso sequencing and zzso analyses of the zzso zzso confirmed that the initial zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso showed equivalent activity with natural zzso both in respect to zzso characteristics as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that both native zzso and zzso zzso existed as zzso in zzso The expression system described in this work provides a basis for the mass production of zzso to allow further studies of the protein and investigation of therapeutic and preventive strategies against zzso
