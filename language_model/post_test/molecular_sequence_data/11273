A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be able to zzso zzso DNA efficiently for delivery into several different types of cells in zzso by several different types of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited increased zzso activities comparable to that seen with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso superior in zzso activity arises from its ability to zzso DNA efficiently and that zzso primary role is that of a zzso agent, although it also possesses several zzso acid sequences resembling that of a nuclear zzso zzso While the use of zzso to zzso DNA has been previously reported, the of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso agent was found to be superior to zzso as well as to various other types of zzso These differences among various salt forms of zzso appear to be attributable to structural differences between the zzso and not due to differences in the net charge of the zzso The appearance of zzso zzso within the zzso zzso correlate with a reduction in binding affinity to zzso DNA as well as an observed loss in zzso enhancing zzso This finding sheds light on the structural requirements of zzso agents for use in gene transfer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso is an zzso compound with a documented safety profile and could be readily used as an zzso to a human gene therapy zzso
