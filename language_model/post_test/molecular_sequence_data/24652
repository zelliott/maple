zzso of a closed to open complex of a promoter upon zzso zzso binding involves base zzso at the zzso zzso After zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso we studied base zzso at the zzso region during zzso upon zzso zzso binding at the zzso and zzso promoters of the gal zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso at the zzso A small middle zzso base pair at the zzso position of zzso and zzso prevented zzso not only at that position but also at the other downstream positions, suggesting a zzso role of the zzso base at zzso of the template strand in overall base zzso zzso at zzso did not inhibit the formation of zzso zzso small middle zzso complex and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso at several other positions did not affect zzso zzso zzso the position of the zzso group from zzso in zzso to C2 in zzso is zzso only at the master switch position, zzso
