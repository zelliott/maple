Rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso is a zzso chain reaction zzso technique which was developed to facilitate the cloning of full-length zzso zzso and zzso after a partial zzso sequence has been obtained by other zzso While zzso can yield complete sequences of zzso ends in only a few days, the zzso procedure frequently results in the exclusive amplification of truncated zzso ends, undermining efforts to generate full-length zzso Many investigators have suggested modifications to the zzso protocol to improve the effectiveness of the zzso Based on first-hand experience with zzso a critical review of numerous published variations of the key steps in the zzso method is zzso Also included is a detailed, effective protocol based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a demonstration of its zzso
