The zzso zzso zzso zzso uses various aromatic compounds as sources of cell carbon and zzso In this work, we studied the initial steps in the aromatic metabolism of this strictly zzso model zzso An zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso composed of a single zzso zzso was zzso from extracts of cells grown on zzso zzso activity was highest with zzso and some zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso acids were virtually zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence showed high similarities with zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso When cultivated on zzso cells strictly required zzso and zzso whereas growth on zzso compounds, such as zzso or zzso did not depend on the presence of the two trace zzso The growth rate on zzso was half zzso with 1 zzso zzso present in the growth zzso In zzso and/or zzso cultures, growth on zzso could be induced by addition of the missing trace zzso In extracts of cells grown on zzso in the presence of zzso three zzso labeled proteins with molecular masses of approximately 100, 30, and 27 zzso were detected by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to zzso induced in cells grown on zzso compared to cells grown on zzso These results suggest that the zzso process in zzso zzso is not zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as in zzso zzso but rather involves unknown zzso and zzso zzso
