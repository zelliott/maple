The zzso zzso chains recognize zzso peptides bound to the groove of the zzso class II zzso The crystal structure analyses of the zzso class II complexes have revealed that the zzso chains play a significant role in zzso zzso However, molecular details which zzso acid zzso of the zzso chain are able to contribute to fine zzso specificity are not clearly zzso Previously, we have classified a panel of T hybrids specific for insulin zzso from different species of animals into four groups based on response profiles to these zzso In particular, the group III zzso insulin zzso or zzso beef insulin hierarchy of zzso and IV zzso insulin zzso beef insulin hierarchy of zzso T hybrids are interesting, since these zzso zzso chains with marked different zzso zzso demonstrate identical gene zzso and very similar zzso To specifically address the molecular requirements for insulin recognition by zzso the zzso alpha and beta chain genes from these group III and IV T hybrids were zzso into 58 zzso T zzso The experiments suggested that zzso dictates the fine zzso zzso Then, we have introduced a series of zzso into position 95 of zzso The zzso experiments clearly indicated that position zzso determines the zzso specificity of the group III and IV T zzso
