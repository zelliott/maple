We describe the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso the precursor zzso of the zzso zzso associated with the reaction center core of the zzso II complex from zzso zzso the gene zzso this zzso is present in a single copy per zzso zzso The mature zzso with 54 zzso acid zzso is characterized by a zzso zzso segment, and, although an intrinsic membrane zzso it carries a zzso transit zzso of 83 zzso acid zzso which directs the N zzso of the mature protein into the zzso zzso zzso integration of this zzso does not require a delta pH across the zzso nor is it zzso suggesting that the zzso chain zzso spontaneously in an as yet unknown zzso The zzso zzso levels are light zzso Similar to zzso zzso and zzso but different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso II, zzso is present in zzso spinach zzso
