The zinc finger protein zzso has been shown to mediate multiple functions connected to gene zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso blocking and zzso insulation are documented for zzso in men, mice and zzso Additionally, zzso has been linked to zzso and zzso In line with these basic cellular functions, zzso has been found to be expressed in every cell type and adult tissue tested and has thus been deemed an ubiquitous zzso Here, we report the identification of the zzso zzso from zzso and the analysis of the zzso expression of zzso during zzso Within the DNA binding domain, zzso is virtually identical to other identified zzso zzso zzso zzso also extends to other zzso regions that are important for zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is present during all stages of early zzso development, a remarkable increase in expression is observed in zzso zzso Early in development, zzso is highly expressed in the neural plate and later in the neural tube and developing zzso By zzso stage, elevated expression is also seen in the developing sensory zzso of the zzso This is the first detailed description of the expression pattern of a zzso zzso protein during zzso
