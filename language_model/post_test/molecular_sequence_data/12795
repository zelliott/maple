Genes for zzso and zzso proteins in zzso are zzso by a variety of physical zzso which include rain, wind and touch zzso and Davis zzso Cell zzso zzso We have isolated five genes for zzso zzso 2, 3, 5, 6) and one gene for a zzso protein zzso from an zzso zzso zzso Touch stimulus of zzso plants zzso the zzso of zzso transcribed from zzso and zzso but not from the other isolated zzso The two zzso genes are arrayed in tandem with a short zzso region of 700 zzso but they show different zzso patterns of zzso
