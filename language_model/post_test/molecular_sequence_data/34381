From a total of 73 bacterial strains isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso grown in zzso of the zzso region of the Moroccan zzso 68 strains clustered into 19 repetitive zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The nearly complete zzso zzso gene sequence from each strain showed they were closely related to members of the zzso zzso of the zzso but affiliation at the species level was not zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso analysis showed that 11 out of the 19 strains belong to zzso zzso and that another three strains were zzso zzso The remaining five strains represented new lineages within the zzso zzso since they were not identified with any previously described zzso zzso of the symbiotic zzso and zzso genes from each zzso strain revealed they were all similar to those of the strains included in zzso zzso
