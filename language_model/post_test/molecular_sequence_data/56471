We used zzso methods to examine the cellular distribution of zzso in chicken zzso in primary zzso zzso showed mainly diffuse distribution in the zzso except for rather strong zzso around the zzso and faint zzso patterns along zzso but did not stain inside the zzso Neither stress zzso structures nor zzso were clearly zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were composed of zzso zzso and zzso were formed in all the zzso of individual zzso In the zzso zzso a putative nuclear zzso signal zzso was zzso We examined the zzso activity of this portion by using a synthetic zzso corresponding to the putative zzso When the zzso zzso zzso with bovine serum zzso was zzso into the zzso of zzso it was rapidly accumulated into the zzso The same result was obtained with in zzso a nuclear protein import zzso system with zzso zzso zzso we suggest that this portion is responsible for the nuclear transport of zzso In zzso the majority of zzso was present in an zzso form and this form remained unchanged after the zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that the zzso of zzso itself is not directly involved in its nuclear transport at least in zzso
