The sequences of zzso 2 to 5 of five United States zzso zzso zzso and respiratory syndrome virus zzso zzso with differing zzso were zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of these zzso were compared with those of other known zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence identity between seven US zzso zzso was zzso in zzso 2, zzso in zzso 3, zzso in zzso 4 and zzso in zzso zzso The low zzso US isolate had highest sequence variation in zzso 2 to 4 compared to the other US zzso A zzso region with zzso potential was identified within the major envelope zzso zzso analysis of zzso 2 to 7 indicated the existence of at least three minor zzso within the major US zzso The low zzso US isolate formed a branch distinct from the other US zzso The results of this study have implications for both the zzso of zzso and vaccine zzso
