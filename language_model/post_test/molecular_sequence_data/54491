zzso are short and highly basic zzso nuclear proteins that replace zzso zzso during zzso in a process that is crucial for zzso formation and zzso Many zzso have two zzso genes zzso and zzso located in a gene zzso which appears to evolve zzso Another gene in this cluster zzso zzso 3 zzso encodes a protein that is zzso among zzso but that does not seem to be involved in zzso zzso We have compared protein sequences and zzso acid compositions of zzso in this gene zzso searched for evidence of positive selection of zzso and examined whether sexual selection zzso zzso may drive the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid analyses of mouse sequences revealed that zzso was very different from zzso and from both the precursor and the mature sequences of zzso Among 10 mouse species, zzso showed weak evidence of positive selection in two species, but there was no clear association with levels of zzso zzso In analyses from among zzso species, no evidence of positive selection was found in zzso We conclude that zzso exhibits several clear differences from other zzso and, zzso that it cannot be regarded as a true zzso
