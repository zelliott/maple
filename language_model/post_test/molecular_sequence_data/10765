To analyze the degradation of product proteins at the late stage of virus infection in the zzso expression system, a zzso zzso was zzso from zzso of zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso virus zzso The zzso zzso zzso preparation had two protein bands zzso zzso active protein and zzso inactive zzso on zzso Based on the zzso zzso acid sequences of them, it was found that both proteins originated in the zzso zzso gene of zzso The zzso zzso zzso had an optimum pH at zzso and also had activities at neutral zzso When zzso zzso was used as a natural zzso it was zzso rapidly by the zzso zzso at the zzso pH of zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso from a zzso gene zzso in the degradation of foreign protein expressed by the zzso zzso
