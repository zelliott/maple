The zzso zzso protein is a zzso factor that recognizes the sequence zzso The zzso zzso gene is highly zzso in a wide variety of species and the zzso zzso has been shown to be identical to zzso of zzso zzso which plays important roles in the development of the peripheral nervous zzso To explore the function of the zzso zzso gene in mouse zzso a zzso was introduced into the functional zzso zzso gene in embryonic stem zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells survived but zzso zzso mice showed embryonic zzso before zzso days of zzso The zzso mice showed severe growth zzso as early as zzso days of zzso zzso zzso including incomplete turning of the body zzso zzso abnormal zzso development, anterior zzso opening and defective zzso were observed in the zzso mice at zzso days of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed a zzso zzso marker zzso Their zzso shaped zzso expressed a zzso marker gene zzso 1 but failed to express zzso The zzso zzso gene was revealed to be essential for zzso development of zzso
