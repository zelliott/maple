Several zzso contain zzso zzso acid sequences similar to the zzso bond zzso domain of sugar zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are believed to have a role in the active zzso site by the attack of a water zzso at the zzso atom of the bridging zzso zzso zzso contains both zzso acids in analogous regions, and is active as a zzso Two forms of zzso contain only zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso yet retain zzso activity equal to or greater than that of tear zzso However, zzso protein lacks both of these motifs and shows no zzso zzso zzso activity is decreased by zzso in the zzso of tear zzso that replaces zzso but is unchanged by zzso of zzso The zzso activity of tear zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso or zzso but is decreased at high zzso of zzso These findings indicate that some zzso have zzso zzso activity similar in characteristics to the zzso zzso and related to the zzso sequence zzso (where zzso denotes zzso other zzso in which the zzso zzso seems to be important for zzso
