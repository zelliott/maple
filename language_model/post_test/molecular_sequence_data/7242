zzso zzso zzso channels of retinal zzso and zzso zzso are zzso activated by zzso that vary only in their zzso ring zzso The zzso selectivity of the bovine rod zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly altered by zzso of a single zzso acid zzso in the binding domain zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso at this position zzso zzso selectivity zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso These effects resulted from an zzso in the relative ability of the zzso to promote the zzso zzso change associated with channel zzso not from a modification in their initial binding zzso We propose a general mechanism for zzso zzso discrimination, in common with that observed in high affinity zzso zzso involving the formation of a pair of hydrogen bonds between the zzso acid side chain and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso
