To detect potential zzso in zzso gene for a family affected with zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosed by clinical inspection and urine zzso 

zzso chain reaction and direct DNA sequencing were carried out for the affected child and her zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were verified in 100 healthy controls to exclude zzso 

The child was found to have carried 2 zzso zzso zzso in the coding region of zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso for which her mother and father were respectively zzso The same zzso were not detected in 100 healthy zzso The child was also found to have carried two previously described zzso including a zzso zzso from her zzso and a zzso zzso from her zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso gene are responsible for the zzso of the disease in this zzso
