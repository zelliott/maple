zzso zzso is an abundant zzso present in plasma and the zzso zzso of most zzso Though the precise function of zzso in zzso is unknown, it has been implicated as a participant in diverse biological zzso including cell attachment and zzso complement zzso and regulation of zzso The major site of synthesis appears to be the liver, though zzso is also found in the brain at an early stage of mouse zzso suggesting that it may play an important role in mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso has not been reported in humans or in other higher zzso To examine the zzso function of zzso within the context of the intact animal, we have established a zzso model for zzso zzso through targeted disruption of the zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of DNA obtained from zzso zzso mice demonstrates deletion of all zzso coding zzso and zzso analysis confirms the complete absence of zzso protein expression in zzso However, zzso mice carrying one normal and one zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice completely deficient in zzso demonstrate normal development, zzso and zzso zzso obtained from zzso mice are completely deficient in zzso spreading zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor 1 binding zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso is not essential for cell zzso and migration during normal mouse development and suggest that its role in these processes may partially overlap with other adhesive zzso zzso
