This report describes the genetic and zzso zzso of bovine viral zzso virus strains isolated in zzso Part of the zzso untranslated region and the zzso end of the zzso zzso coding sequence were amplified by zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that most field zzso zzso into zzso zzso or zzso Only one out of 28 field zzso belonged to zzso zzso Interestingly, some type I strains were equally divergent from types zzso and zzso strains and clustered into additional zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso from young calves zzso zzso with field zzso first identified on the basis of their sequences were used in zzso zzso zzso The results clearly differentiated type I from type II strains although some degree of zzso was zzso Within type I, the new clusters could not be zzso differentiated from the more prevalent type zzso strains or from type zzso strain zzso suggesting that zzso zzso I is zzso zzso The isolation of zzso types I and II strains from cell lines and from a bovine vaccine suggest that molecular epidemiology surveillance is warranted for zzso
