The major zzso form of chicken liver alcohol zzso was zzso The primary structure was determined by zzso analysis and, to a large part, was also deduced by zzso analysis of a near full-length zzso zzso The latter was detected by screening of a chicken liver zzso library with zzso raised against the zzso zzso The structure shows that the avian zzso exhibits characteristics of the complex zzso alcohol zzso system, tracing its origin and zzso and allowing functional zzso The chicken protein analyzed proves to be a class I alcohol zzso with zzso zzso identity to gamma chains of the human zzso a zzso for ethanol of zzso zzso and a Ki for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the other two classes are zzso zzso exchanges towards the human classes increase in the order I less than III less than II, and zzso differences are less than zzso zzso zzso the origins of the classes are more distant than the zzso zzso They reflect zzso events separated in time, and the lines that lead to zzso classes I and II zzso zzso Integrated with the data for the quail zzso the structure of the chicken protein shows that within the avian zzso the degree of variation is comparable to that within the zzso class I zzso which are more variable than the class III zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of this chicken alcohol zzso are largely identical to those in the zzso class I zzso However, the zzso areas are more variable and suggest some relationships of the avian zzso with both class I and III zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso class I zzso zzso previously considered characteristic of all alcohol zzso is replaced by zzso
