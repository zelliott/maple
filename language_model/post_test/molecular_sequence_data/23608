zzso I from zzso zzso (Da zzso is a small zzso zzso cluster protein that exchanges electrons with zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the energy metabolism of zzso The zzso properties and the electron transfer between zzso and either native or zzso zzso have been investigated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The association constant of the zzso complex is zzso zzso zzso zzso and the binding affinity has been found to be highly sensitive to zzso strength, suggesting the involvement of zzso forces in formation of the zzso Surprisingly, the zzso or combined zzso of zzso zzso surrounding the zzso cluster slightly affect the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso around the cluster do not seem to be crucial for the zzso system zzso however, some of them play an important role in the stability of the zzso zzso zzso restrained zzso associated with zzso zzso studies suggested the presence of various interacting sites on Da zzso The modification of additional zzso zzso at the interacting zzso generating a zzso zzso evidenced at least two distinct zzso binding sites facing the zzso zzso cluster of the zzso We also used a set of various small zzso partners to investigate the specificity of zzso toward zzso zzso The remarkable flexibility of the zzso system supports the idea that the specificity of the zzso complex has probably been zzso to improve the turnover rate and thus the efficiency of bacterial electron zzso
