zzso domain 4 zzso DNA zzso is involved in zzso of spontaneous zzso products of zzso and zzso in animals, but it is unknown whether related proteins perform similar functions in zzso We report here the isolation and zzso characterization of a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso The plant zzso lacks the zzso domain present in zzso zzso zzso but zzso a DNA zzso domain with critical zzso for zzso recognition and zzso and it is more closely related to zzso zzso than to other members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso opposite G, and the presence of zzso zzso at zzso of the target base greatly increases its zzso zzso No significant activity is detected on zzso derivatives such as zzso or zzso The zzso binds to the zzso site product generated after zzso which decreases its zzso turnover in zzso Both the full-length protein and a zzso truncated version retaining the zzso domain exhibit a preference for a zzso sequence context, where most plant DNA zzso is zzso Our results suggest that an important function of zzso zzso is to protect the plant zzso from the zzso consequences of zzso and zzso zzso
