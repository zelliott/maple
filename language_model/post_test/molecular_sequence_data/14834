zzso zzso is one of the most zzso zzso due to its importance in both innate and zzso immune responses and other zzso zzso In this study, we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by investigating the zzso between the human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso Although zzso zzso showed a low sequence zzso with other zzso sequences in other species, it presented a high structural similarity to human zzso We also zzso zzso expression in several different zzso along with analysis of the expression of the genes that form the zzso zzso complex, zzso and zzso After treatment with bacterial or viral zzso zzso zzso expression was modulated in a manner similar to that of other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso was also studied during the zzso of zzso larvae using quantitative zzso and in zzso zzso Our results indicated that the transcripts were detected very early, increased during the first week of life and were predominantly expressed in the head, zzso and zzso of the anterior and zzso lateral line system, suggesting their involvement in the normal development of these zzso
