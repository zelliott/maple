zzso zzso zzso zzso mercury resistance zzso to a zzso zzso zzso Two zzso regions, separated by zzso zzso and sharing zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were cloned separately and each was shown to carry a cluster of functional and independently regulated zzso zzso One of the two gene clusters zzso resistance only to zzso mercury, and had a structure identical to the classical model of zzso zzso zzso In the other cluster a novel zzso zzso not zzso to the other known zzso but with the same function, was mapped upstream from zzso zzso between an zzso regulatory element and transport zzso Evidence suggests that zzso and the other structural zzso genes might be transcribed from two distinct zzso The presence of two zzso zzso zzso identical to those of zzso upstream from zzso suggests that the zzso zzso cluster could be part of a zzso zzso
