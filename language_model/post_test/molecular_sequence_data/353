zzso zzso zzso produce a large variety of zzso zzso This communication reports the identification of zzso components obtained by sequencing clones isolated from a zzso library prepared with zzso zzso of the Brazilian scorpion zzso zzso zzso Two main types of components were zzso peptides with zzso sequences and proteins involved in cellular zzso Using the expressed sequence tag zzso strategy 118 clones were identified, from which 61 code for unique sequences (17 zzso and 44 zzso with an average length of 531 zzso zzso These results were compared with those previously obtained by the zzso analysis of the same zzso showing a considerable degree of similarity in terms of the molecular masses expected and DNA sequences zzso About zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso peptides and proteins with identifiable open reading frames zzso The zzso sequencing results also show the presence of sequences whose putative products zzso to a zzso zzso three short zzso zzso three zzso zzso and an additional zzso containing 78 zzso acid zzso whose sequence resembles zzso zzso from another zzso scorpion zzso zzso thus far with unknown zzso
