Four types of human zzso have been cloned and characterized at the molecular zzso They are classified according to their major zzso location as zzso zzso zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso and zzso or zzso membrane zzso associated zzso These human zzso are distinct from each other in their zzso properties as well as their zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso has been correlated with zzso transformation of cells and different zzso have been known to behave differently during zzso zzso increased expression of zzso has been implicated in the survival of various cancer cells and also in the development of insulin zzso In the present study, we have modeled three-dimensional structures of zzso zzso and zzso based on the crystal structure of zzso using the zzso modeling program zzso The best model in each zzso case was chosen on the basis of various standard protein analysis zzso zzso structures and the experimental zzso complex of zzso were compared to identify similarities and differences among the active zzso The molecular zzso potential zzso was calculated for the predicted models to identify the differences in charge distribution around the active site and its zzso The primary objective of the present work is to identify the structural differences between the different zzso of human zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus providing a better insight into the differences in the active sites of these zzso This can in turn guide us in the better understanding and rationale of the differential zzso recognition and activity, thereby aiding in the zzso design of selective zzso zzso
