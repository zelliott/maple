zzso zzso zzso D zzso is zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso to a more active form zzso where the two parts of the zzso are still tightly zzso Based on previous sequencing results of authentic zzso we have constructed a zzso consisting of separate zzso for the zzso and zzso portions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso active zzso zzso Neither zzso cloned separately folded zzso The identity of each zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso with zzso mass zzso The zzso complex had a specific activity about six times higher than that of the zzso intact zzso zzso and was no longer activated by zzso acid zzso zzso activity, binding affinity to zzso zzso loss of product zzso pH profile and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were comparable to authentic zzso zzso from zzso zzso growth zzso zzso alone could also be zzso the zzso was active but not as stable as zzso These experimental results strongly support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is necessary for correct folding and zzso of zzso metal zzso However, they suggest the zzso involved in zzso coordination must be altered upon zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso fragment, whose replacement zzso zzso binding to the zzso must be replaced by another zzso since the zzso fragment, once zzso is zzso In the process of cloning the two zzso the complete signal sequence for this protein was also zzso The signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso contained a twin zzso motif suggesting that zzso zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso is most likely zzso by the zzso zzso zzso under the zzso control of the pho zzso
