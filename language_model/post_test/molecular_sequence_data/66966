zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso although the extent to which this DNA modification functions to regulate the zzso is still zzso Here we report the first comprehensive DNA zzso map of an entire zzso at 35 base pair resolution, using the flowering plant zzso zzso as a zzso We find that zzso zzso repetitive zzso and regions producing small interfering zzso are heavily zzso zzso over one-third of expressed genes contain zzso within transcribed regions, whereas only approximately zzso of genes show zzso within promoter zzso Interestingly, genes zzso in transcribed regions are highly expressed and zzso active, whereas zzso genes show a greater degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling of DNA zzso zzso zzso identified hundreds of genes and zzso zzso zzso with altered expression levels, many of which may be zzso controlled by DNA zzso
