In the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso To better understand the role of these zzso in antibiotics production, we determined the zzso zzso contents of zzso zzso zzso Using a novel in zzso approach, we first obtained a zzso of 200 zzso zzso proteins with putative zzso targeting signals zzso This included two zzso of proteins involved in zzso zzso which we demonstrate to be bona fide zzso zzso zzso zzso we performed a zzso based inventory of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins using zzso zzso We identified 89 zzso zzso 79 with a zzso including the two known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparative analysis revealed that 69 out of 79 zzso proteins identified zzso were in the reference zzso A prominent zzso protein was identified as a novel zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso which contains an internal zzso between the two functional zzso We show that this protein indeed zzso to zzso zzso zzso
