Changes of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression have been linked to several human gastrointestinal disorders such as zzso diabetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso They could be caused by differential zzso control or alternative zzso generating different zzso zzso The aims of this study were to characterize zzso zzso promoter zzso and zzso expression of zzso in the human gastrointestinal zzso 

zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso amplification of complementary DNA ends, and Southern zzso zzso analysis was performed by rapid amplification of zzso ends, followed by reporter gene zzso 

Six different zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified showing specific expressions at various sites of the human gastrointestinal zzso Three zzso zzso for zzso which has a specific zzso zzso domain and interaction sites for regulatory zzso Two zzso zzso for zzso and 1 for zzso which both lack the zzso zzso of zzso In addition to 2 known first zzso a novel first zzso of human zzso with a separate functionally active downstream promoter and multiple binding sites for zzso factors was identified and zzso 

Six zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 3 different zzso proteins are expressed in the human zzso The differential expression of these proteins could be implicated in different biological zzso
