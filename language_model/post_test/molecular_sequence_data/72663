zzso zzso from zzso coli was zzso enriched with zzso and zzso zzso and its oxidized form in zzso solution investigated by three-dimensional zzso zzso Nearly complete zzso zzso and zzso resonance assignments were zzso The secondary structure was determined from chemical shift, zzso and zzso zzso zzso constant zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso contains a zzso parallel zzso and five zzso The zzso were found to comprise the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso comprise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso site was determined by zzso zzso and zzso shifted zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso group of the zzso The data are in good agreement with a previously predicted model of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso The analysis of of zzso zzso revealed the presence of two, possibly three, buried zzso water molecules which are located at sites, where zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain zzso zzso water zzso One of these water molecules mediates hydrogen bonds between the protein backbone and the zzso chain of the zzso zzso
