zzso zzso A zzso reduces fat deposition in zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso zzso is increased by zzso acid zzso treatment in human zzso These studies asked whether zzso decreases fat deposition through zzso and explored the mechanisms zzso We demonstrated that zzso increased human zzso and zzso zzso expression in human zzso cells, zzso zzso a promoter deletion zzso we found that a zzso protein beta zzso site in the zzso promoter region between zzso and zzso zzso was critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the putative zzso site suppressed the zzso zzso promoter zzso The addition of the protein zzso A inhibitor zzso negated the zzso increase in zzso protein zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and protein by zzso was also inhibited by zzso We also demonstrated that zzso increased protein zzso A zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is involved in the zzso increase in zzso expression via zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso was abolished by zzso in zzso cells and zzso indicating that zzso also reduces zzso zzso via zzso The observation of increased zzso expression coupled with reduced fat zzso zzso by zzso via zzso suggests that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso These findings provide new insights into the complicated regulatory network in zzso zzso metabolism and are useful in developing new approaches to reduce body fat deposition and fatty zzso
