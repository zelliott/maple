Here we describe the use of zzso liquid zzso mass zzso zzso to simultaneously characterize zzso and zzso modified zzso for each zzso The analysis of intact proteins significantly reduces the time of sample preparation and zzso data zzso zzso analysis and zzso mass mapping have previously been applied to identify zzso proteins and to characterize their zzso zzso However, these studies provided limited characterization of both zzso zzso and core zzso The current zzso analysis allows for the simultaneous observation of all zzso zzso and zzso (both replacement and bulk zzso without further enrichment, which will be valuable in comparative zzso zzso identities were verified by the analysis of zzso zzso species using zzso zzso zzso separation and zzso
