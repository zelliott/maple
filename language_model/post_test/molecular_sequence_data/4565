We have isolated a zzso clone coding for a birch zzso zzso zzso v zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso v 4 contained two typical zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities of zzso v 4 to zzso are primarily confined to the zzso zzso However, significant sequence similarities extending outside the zzso sites were found with a recently described group of zzso zzso of zzso and Bermuda zzso Both zzso zzso of zzso v 4 are able to bind zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso overlay of wild type and zzso deficient zzso of zzso v zzso Among zzso patients, zzso zzso was not an absolute requirement for zzso recognition of zzso v zzso However, disruption of the zzso zzso domain indicated that most zzso zzso from allergic patients are directed against this zzso zzso zzso experiments suggested that zzso v 4 represents a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of allergic zzso with zzso v 4 drastically reduced zzso binding to proteins of similar molecular weight in zzso extracts from zzso related plant species zzso zzso grass, zzso zzso but not in extracts from zzso zzso To test for a possible biological role in zzso zzso and tube growth, we introduced zzso zzso v 4 protein into growing zzso zzso tubes by zzso As a result, zzso streaming stopped in the vicinity of the zzso tip, and a slight zzso of the membrane zzso was zzso These effects were not observed with zzso deficient zzso of zzso v zzso Thus, zzso v 4 and zzso proteins represent a new class of zzso zzso zzso that may have a zzso role as zzso of zzso streaming in zzso zzso zzso
