Two genes zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins related to the zzso zzso zzso were cloned and the zzso proteins were zzso A cloned zzso designated zzso zzso contained a zzso transcript of zzso zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso had a similarity of about zzso to that of the zzso zzso 43 zzso zzso A cloned zzso designated zzso zzso contained a zzso transcript of zzso zzso and the predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso had a similarity of about zzso to that of the zzso zzso 53 zzso zzso Southern blots indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were zzso in a single copy within the zzso zzso zzso Western blots showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins in the zzso product were 3 and 9 zzso greater than the expected molecular mass, respectively, and had three zzso with a similar molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction results showed that the production of the zzso transcript for the zzso zzso or zzso zzso gene was restricted predominantly to muscle zzso Western blots confirmed that the gene products were predominantly expressed by zzso zzso An zzso study showed the zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were present within the zzso and the zzso of muscle larvae, zzso
