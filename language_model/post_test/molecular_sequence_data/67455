zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso have been associated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso disease, which is characterized by serious zzso of brain zzso zzso The zzso protein contains multiple interaction zzso and zzso suggesting that it might act as a scaffold for the assembly of functional protein complexes involved in signaling zzso In previous work, we defined zzso relationships underlying zzso zzso and zzso interactions and zzso zzso and found that zzso plays an important role in molecular mechanisms involved in the maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso Species zzso zzso to prevent zzso cellular zzso Here we report the identification of the zzso family protein zzso as a novel molecular zzso of zzso This interaction was discovered through zzso zzso screening of a mouse zzso zzso library, and confirmed by pull-down and zzso zzso of zzso zzso as well as by zzso of zzso proteins in human zzso zzso Furthermore, using distinct zzso zzso and zzso we defined the role of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Finally, functional zzso showed that zzso may contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso shuttling and cooperate with zzso in modulating the expression levels of the zzso protein zzso opening a novel avenue for future zzso zzso The identification of zzso as a novel zzso interacting protein provides a novel piece of the molecular puzzle involving zzso and suggests a potential functional cooperation in cellular responses to zzso stress, thus expanding the framework of molecular complexes and mechanisms that may zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
