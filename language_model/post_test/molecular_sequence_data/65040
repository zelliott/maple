zzso investigations of zzso relationships within and among the animal zzso have been hampered by a lack of slowly evolving genes that are amenable to study by molecular zzso To provide new data for use in zzso zzso zzso studies, zzso were developed to amplify a zzso region of the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene from 31 zzso representing several zzso zzso zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso analyses of these sequences zzso with zzso sequences for 23 zzso downloaded from zzso yield zzso trees that corroborate recent findings based on analyses of other data sets zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso trees support zzso for several zzso (including zzso a form of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but do not support zzso for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso tests reject zzso for zzso and zzso but are unable to reject zzso zzso Overall, the zzso zzso zzso gene appears to be useful for zzso studies of zzso zzso
