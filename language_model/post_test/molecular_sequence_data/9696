zzso rolling circle replication involves generation of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso released after leading strand synthesis is converted to a zzso form using solely host zzso Most plasmids that replicate by the rolling circle mode contain zzso sequences that act as the single strand origin, zzso We have investigated the host requirements for the functionality of one such zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso We used a new zzso replication system from zzso zzso to investigate whether host DNA zzso I was required for lagging strand zzso zzso from DNA zzso zzso cells failed to zzso but this was corrected by adding zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso DNA synthesis from the zzso required the entire DNA zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso was a zzso for specific zzso zzso binding and a template for zzso zzso synthesis of a 20 zzso zzso zzso We constructed zzso in two highly zzso regions within the zzso a six zzso zzso sequence and the zzso site zzso Our results show that the former seemed to function as a zzso for primer zzso zzso while the latter may be a binding site for zzso zzso
