A full-length zzso clone of zzso segment 7 of African zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso was obtained using the zzso zzso The clone was zzso and found to be zzso zzso to the previously published sequence of the equivalent zzso clone from zzso at the zzso level and to exhibit zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso The zzso clone was transferred to zzso zzso a bacterial expression zzso such that the reading frame of zzso zzso was continuous with that of the bacterial zzso zzso zzso under the control of the bacterial zzso zzso On induction with zzso a fusion protein consisting of zzso and zzso was zzso which was readily zzso on a zzso column zzso The fusion protein reacted equally well in an indirect zzso using zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso or zzso guinea pig zzso raised against zzso infectious zzso zzso This protein was also shown to be a suitable substitute for virus zzso prepared from infected zzso cell zzso in a competitive zzso zzso zzso recorded for zzso positive and negative horse zzso were similar in the competitive zzso using either bacterial zzso zzso or zzso extracted virus as the source of zzso in combination with zzso or zzso zzso respectively, as the zzso
