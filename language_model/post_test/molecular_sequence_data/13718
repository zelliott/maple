The objectives of this study were to determine the zzso and derived zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso expression during zzso Total zzso was extracted from zzso through use of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso pool derived from the zzso zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used in 3' zzso methodology to generate a zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to screen a zzso zzso zzso zzso library, and a clone containing the entire coding region was zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed a zzso open reading frame for zzso The derived zzso acid sequence contained a 22 zzso acid signal zzso followed by a 155 zzso acid zzso sequence with a calculated molecular weight of zzso The derived zzso zzso acid sequence had zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and pig zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso during the latter half of gestation was evaluated by Northern and/or zzso analysis using the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso was first detected in the zzso on Day zzso zzso of the zzso transcript increased to a plateau on Days 10, 12, and 14 and subsequently increased further on Day zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso zzso or zzso
