zzso translation initiation factor 3 zzso consists of core zzso that are zzso from zzso to man as well as less zzso zzso zzso with potential regulatory zzso Whereas core zzso tend to be indispensable for cell growth, the roles of the zzso zzso remain poorly zzso We addressed the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso have accessory functions that help to regulate translation zzso by focusing on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso was not essential for general protein zzso However, results from transient expression zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the translation efficiency of specific zzso zzso leader sequences was compromised in an zzso zzso including the zzso for the basic domain zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso translation of which is regulated by zzso Among other zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso required zzso sugar to transit from zzso to zzso development, but it was hypersensitive to elevated levels of zzso zzso The zzso zzso was rendered sensitive to the zzso level by a series of upstream open reading zzso Moreover, zzso could physically interact with zzso of the zzso zzso a protein complex implicated primarily in the regulation of protein zzso supporting a direct zzso connection between translation initiation and protein zzso Together, these data zzso zzso in zzso translation initiation events, such as zzso start zzso recognition, or zzso and suggest that poor translation initiation of specific zzso contributes to the zzso spectrum of zzso defects in the zzso zzso
