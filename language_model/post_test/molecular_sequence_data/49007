zzso protein zzso zzso beta zzso zzso mediates zzso and zzso zzso By searching for zzso proteins that interact with the zzso region of this zzso using the zzso method, we identified several proteins containing zzso zzso One of these zzso zzso contains a zzso region, six zzso and two WW zzso The interaction between zzso beta and zzso was confirmed by zzso and zzso experiments in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso is concentrated in specific sites at the plasma membrane and in the zzso In zzso cells, zzso was localized with zzso and zzso at tight zzso whereas in primary cultured zzso it was found in zzso zzso contacts and in focal zzso zzso Although zzso itself was not zzso on zzso zzso it became associated with zzso proteins following a short treatment of the cells with zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso was associated with a zzso protein with the apparent molecular weight of 130 zzso whereas in zzso cells it was associated with a 90 zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso served as a zzso for zzso beta and that its zzso required the zzso sequence of the zzso which zzso the interaction with zzso These findings suggest a possible role for zzso as a scaffolding zzso that links zzso zzso zzso with its zzso at the plasma zzso
