Y zzso zzso based on zzso or single zzso zzso has recently proven to be a powerful approach for evolutionary studies of human zzso and also holds great promise for the studies of wild zzso However, the use of the approach is hampered in most natural populations by the lack of Y zzso markers and sequence zzso Here, we report the large-scale development of Y zzso zzso anchor zzso sequence zzso markers in zzso by a zzso chain reaction screening zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 different zzso of zzso genes were developed based on human and mouse zzso and screened on a set of 20 different zzso On average about 10 zzso were amplified for each species and a total of 100 zzso of Y zzso sequence were zzso zzso size in humans was a reasonable predictor of zzso size in other zzso zzso zzso zzso and there was a negative correlation between human zzso size and amplification zzso We discuss a number of factors affecting the possibility of developing zzso Y zzso zzso including fast evolution of Y zzso sequences due to zzso zzso and zzso evolution of zzso zzso dynamic evolution of the Y zzso due to being a zzso unit, and zzso with X zzso zzso
