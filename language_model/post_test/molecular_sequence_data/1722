Variation in the zzso zzso gene was investigated in approximately 2,000 sheep from six zzso zzso of DNA containing the zzso zzso zzso 2 were amplified using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and DNA sequence analysis were employed to detect genetic zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso 22 zzso zzso acid zzso were zzso This increases the number of zzso identified from 10 to zzso In some cases, three or four unique sequences were isolated from individual zzso suggesting that these zzso sequences may represent two zzso zzso tree analysis revealed that 5 of these 23 sequences were more closely related to cattle zzso or zzso sequences than to other sheep zzso zzso These sequences clustered together and were called zzso to differentiate them from other zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso sequences in zzso Information zzso analysis indicated that some of the zzso sequences had low information content at zzso sites, suggesting that these zzso may have low functional zzso zzso lineages were observed not only at the zzso zzso but also at the zzso zzso supporting the zzso mode of evolution of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences suggests that zzso seems to have arisen largely by point zzso and gene conversion, and a recent gene conversion event seems to have occurred between the zzso and zzso zzso The high level of sequence zzso detected and varied number of zzso demonstrate the extensive diversity of the zzso zzso zzso
