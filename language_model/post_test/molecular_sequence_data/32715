zzso zzso possess large zzso zzso and exist as zzso which increases the possibility of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso were recognized as important pathogens in captive wild zzso This is the first report of the isolation and detailed zzso zzso and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso park in the United zzso zzso particles were detected by immune electron zzso in zzso samples from three zzso with zzso zzso From one of the three zzso samples, a zzso zzso was isolated and successfully adapted to serial passage in human zzso tumor 18 cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso focus zzso tests revealed close biological and zzso relationships between the zzso isolate and selected respiratory and enteric bovine zzso zzso zzso When orally zzso into a zzso zzso calf, zzso caused severe zzso and virus shedding within 2 to 3 zzso zzso comparisons and zzso analyses were performed to assess its genetic zzso to other zzso zzso characterization confirmed that the new isolate belongs to group zzso of the zzso zzso and revealed closer genetic zzso between zzso and the enteric zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was more zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso spike gene demonstrated the presence of a deletion in the variable region of the zzso zzso (from zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso which is a region associated with zzso and tissue zzso for other zzso The point zzso identified in the structural proteins (by comparing zzso zzso zzso and zzso were most zzso among zzso zzso and zzso whereas most of the point zzso in the zzso proteins were unique to zzso Our results confirm the existence of a zzso zzso zzso to cattle from wild zzso zzso zzso but with certain genetic properties different from those of zzso
