Four zzso peptides were zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso degradation and mass zzso of plasma revealed zzso a previously characterized zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hoffmann, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso three new zzso zzso C, D, and zzso The four molecules exhibited complementary zzso zzso The zzso sequence coding for the zzso B precursor was obtained from a zzso zzso zzso This precursor contains a putative signal zzso of 22 zzso a processing zzso sequence of 34 zzso zzso and a zzso extension of 48 zzso rich in zzso zzso Distribution of zzso B zzso and of the corresponding zzso in various zzso zzso revealed that zzso are zzso and stored in a specific zzso zzso Furthermore, in an experimental model of infection, we showed zzso a recruitment of zzso containing zzso toward the injection site within hours following bacterial challenge, zzso that zzso probably play a prominent role in killing zzso bacteria after zzso and zzso later an increase of zzso material occurred in the plasma suggesting a secondary systemic zzso
