The question of how to design a zzso zzso protein zzso We report here the synthesis of a zzso and zzso small zzso protein zzso 69 zzso acid zzso The protein was designed to have four zzso a zzso short zzso zzso in the middle surrounded by three zzso long basic zzso zzso zzso zzso and CD zzso indicated that in buffer solution zzso is zzso with a 50% zzso zzso zzso did not completely zzso even at high temperature (90 degrees zzso and at relatively high Gu zzso zzso concentration so that the zzso concentration at the zzso of the transition is 5 zzso zzso binding studies and zzso energy transfer experiments showed that zzso possesses a zzso binding site and its zzso of the central zzso is present at a relatively zzso region and accepts the energy from zzso in other zzso zzso indicating that zzso takes a stable zzso structure in zzso zzso From the zzso fluorescent studies using egg PC zzso containing zzso fatty acids and zzso zzso as zzso it was found that the zzso central zzso is able to enter spontaneously into the zzso zzso and the zzso in the central zzso is located at about the middle of the zzso chain in the outer layer of the zzso zzso The zzso is also able to increase the membrane zzso with two modes of current zzso current and single zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicating the spontaneous zzso of the protein into the zzso zzso zzso zzso and then the formation of a uniform size of channel pore zzso zzso zzso is useful as a basic and starting model to find good zzso acid sequences that fold to a desired protein structure and to search zzso mechanisms from zzso solution into zzso zzso
