zzso zzso proteins are zzso nuclear regulators of gene expression but do not contain a known zzso zzso We tested whether a common zzso protein can deliver these proteins to specific zzso zzso We screened for proteins that interact with two members of a zzso of zzso zzso These zzso proteins were Tomato zzso zzso which does not seem to be involved in the control of flowering time, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein which mediates zzso induction of zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TIMING OF zzso zzso 1) domain of both proteins binds the zzso zzso binding factor zzso via its zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is recruited to the zzso motifs of the zzso zzso and zzso promoters by zzso In zzso each of the three zzso components is zzso by several different genes that are highly zzso Under warm long days, high levels of expression of a tomato zzso zzso gene can reduce the flowering time of zzso A zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso the interaction with zzso and the analogous zzso in zzso zzso its function and delays zzso zzso are therefore likely to recruit zzso proteins to their DNA target motifs in zzso
