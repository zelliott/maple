Even though nearly every human gene has at least one alternative zzso form, very little is so far known about the structure and function of resulting protein zzso It is becoming increasingly clear that a significant fraction of all zzso are products of noisy selection of zzso sites and thus contribute little to actual functional diversity, and may potentially be zzso In this study, we examine the impact of alternative zzso on protein sequence and structure in three zzso alternative zzso events zzso across multiple species, alternative zzso events in genes that are strongly linked to disease and all observed alternative zzso zzso We find that the vast majority of all alternative zzso result in unstable protein zzso In contrast to that, the small subset of zzso zzso across species tends to maintain protein structural integrity to a greater zzso Alternative zzso in zzso genes produces unstable structures just as frequently as all other zzso indicating that selection to reduce the effects of alternative zzso on this set is not especially zzso Overall, the properties of alternative spliced proteins are consistent with the outcome of noisy selection of zzso sites by zzso zzso
