The zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in a subset of human breast zzso They also zzso from cell zzso and associate directly in zzso Whereas the zzso zzso domain binds strongly to zzso the zzso domain of zzso a protein closely related to zzso does zzso We have investigated the preferred binding site of zzso within the zzso zzso domain and the zzso domain zzso that determine the high affinity of zzso compared with zzso for this zzso zzso competition and zzso zzso revealed that zzso of zzso is the major binding site for the zzso zzso domain, indicating an overlap in binding specificity between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Substituting individual zzso acids in the zzso zzso domain with the corresponding zzso from zzso demonstrated that a zzso to zzso change at the zzso position imparted high affinity zzso interaction, paralleled by a marked increase in affinity for the zzso zzso The reverse switch at the zzso position zzso zzso binding to zzso This zzso therefore represents an important zzso of zzso domain specificity within the zzso zzso
