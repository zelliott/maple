Cellular interactions with zzso zzso have a complex molecular basis involving multiple zzso A zzso cell and zzso binding region of zzso zzso is particularly interesting because it is a strong promoter of zzso outgrowth zzso zzso zzso McCarthy, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell attachment zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso To further understand the molecular mechanisms of zzso interactions with this region of zzso we screened two peptides from the zzso zzso binding zzso of the zzso A chain, zzso II zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for their ability to promote zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso II and zzso promoted zzso cell attachment in a zzso and zzso manner, with attachment to zzso II exceeding attachment to zzso In solution, both zzso zzso II or zzso partially inhibited cell zzso to the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso II zzso In contrast, soluble zzso did not affect zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso These results indicate that both zzso II and zzso represent zzso zzso cell zzso sites active within the zzso fragment, and further define zzso II as a novel neural recognition sequence in zzso zzso zzso to zzso II and zzso differs in sensitivity to zzso yet each zzso inhibited zzso to the other zzso suggesting cell zzso is somehow related at the cellular zzso Within the A chain zzso fragment, zzso II and zzso are contiguous, and might represent components of a larger domain with greater zzso activity since only the zzso fragment, and neither individual zzso was effective at promoting zzso zzso zzso These data further support the hypothesis that cell responses to zzso are zzso by multiple sites involving both zzso and zzso zzso
