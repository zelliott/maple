During zzso zzso germ cells undergo four rounds of zzso an extended zzso zzso phase and two zzso zzso In males zzso for zzso in zzso the zzso zzso divisions are normal, but the cell cycle arrests prior to the first zzso zzso zzso males are therefore zzso zzso begin to zzso in these zzso but other zzso zzso including nuclear envelope breakdown and zzso formation, do not zzso The arrest zzso closely resembles that of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is blocked in zzso and zzso zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso is also required for patterning in the eye and zzso divisions in the zzso We have cloned the zzso locus and show it encodes a 44 zzso zzso zzso protein with zzso plant, zzso and human zzso
