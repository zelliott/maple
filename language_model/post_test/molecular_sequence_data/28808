zzso sites and zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso arise at significant frequency in the zzso due to spontaneous zzso zzso or replication zzso To avert the potentially zzso or zzso effects of these zzso zzso organisms are equipped with zzso (AP) zzso and zzso that initiate zzso zzso which shares zzso with zzso coli zzso III zzso is the major zzso zzso in zzso and an important, yet selective, contributor to zzso zzso zzso also possess a second protein zzso with sequence zzso to zzso but this protein exhibits comparatively weak zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso modeling studies, we found that zzso in the zzso pocket of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso reduce zzso incision potency about fourfold to zzso while introduction of an zzso pocket into zzso enhances its zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso at zzso and zzso of zzso increase 3' to zzso DNA zzso zzso These results, coupled with prior comparative sequence analysis, indicate that this zzso zzso pocket influences the zzso specificity of a diverse set of zzso proteins possessing the zzso zzso zzso Lastly, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a rate up to zzso higher than correctly zzso zzso depending greatly on the structure and sequence of the DNA zzso suggesting a novel, selective role for the human protein in zzso zzso
