zzso is a zzso protein whose zzso region zzso zzso zzso and then binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex is implicated in regulation of cell zzso In addition, zzso and its zzso zzso constitute an zzso recognition system that contributes to zzso of cell migration by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso has now been shown to be shed from cells in a reaction likely zzso by a zzso This process was promoted by zzso of protein zzso C or of zzso and the released zzso exhibited minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso fusion protein in zzso and the primary zzso site was localized to the zzso region of zzso zzso expression of an zzso zzso resistant to zzso shedding impaired cell migration, cell zzso and reorganization of the zzso zzso It also increased the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso triggered by cell zzso These results suggest that shedding of the zzso of zzso plays an important role in regulation of cell migration and spreading by this zzso
