In C4 plants, such as zzso the zzso apparatus is zzso over two cell types called zzso zzso and bundle sheath zzso which have different structure and specialization of the zzso zzso zzso We characterized protein zzso in zzso of the two cell types from zzso grown under either low or high zzso Western zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected zzso changes in the protein zzso zzso zzso with alternating zzso and electron transfer zzso sequencing of zzso zzso mapped 15 protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found only in M zzso A previously unknown zzso site was mapped in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was calculated from the ratios of zzso zzso currents for zzso to zzso zzso pairs from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins of zzso II zzso Every zzso in M zzso contained on average zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso groups in plants grown under either low or high light, while in zzso zzso the corresponding numbers were zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that the zzso level, as well as turnover of zzso depend on the structure of zzso
