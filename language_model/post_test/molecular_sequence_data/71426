DNA damage can cause zzso which in turn may lead to zzso In the zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso It encodes the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso that specifically functions in zzso DNA zzso We have cloned a zzso of the human zzso of zzso zzso which consists of zzso zzso and codes for a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso zzso acids show extensive zzso with the zzso protein at the zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso This region contains the six highly zzso DNA zzso zzso Furthermore, we have identified four sequence motifs in the zzso region outside the zzso domain that are zzso in DNA zzso delta from various zzso Three of which are present in DNA zzso zzso zzso by human, zzso and plant zzso zzso indicating that this protein is a member of the DNA zzso delta zzso DNA zzso delta and zzso are structurally distinguished by the presence of a specific delta IV motif in the former and motifs zzso I and zzso II in the latter, zzso Human DNA zzso zzso is zzso expressed in various zzso consistent with the notion that the zzso zzso may be a fundamental mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso
