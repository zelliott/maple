The zzso protein is an zzso protein identified as a putative zzso protein zzso zzso from zzso zzso Here, we have determined zzso structure of zzso using Nuclear zzso zzso It has a zzso fold, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso motifs which are thought to be important in zzso zzso By using structural zzso search and analyzing zzso potential of surface, we could compared zzso with other zzso proteins zzso zzso restricted zzso zzso zzso to predict zzso sites of zzso We could predict that beta sheets of zzso especially zzso and zzso are primary region for zzso zzso zzso similar to other zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso zzso zzso positively charged and zzso regions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are proposed as a putative zzso zzso In addition, differences in zzso acids composition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fold and the orientation of zzso with other zzso recognition motif proteins could give specific biological functions to zzso Finally, the study on natural zzso target is also important to completely understand the biological function of zzso
