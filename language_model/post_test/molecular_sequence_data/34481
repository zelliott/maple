The application of zzso display technology to zzso proteins with multiple zzso regions has had limited success due to the difficulty in generating these proteins in sufficient amounts and zzso We report here a method that can be easily and generally applied to sorting of zzso display libraries with zzso protein targets zzso in zzso A key feature of this approach is the production of zzso zzso proteins in zzso of a zzso zzso that allows library panning without prior zzso of the target zzso We obtained zzso fragments from a zzso synthetic zzso zzso library that, when engineered into full-length zzso zzso specifically bind cells expressing zzso a protein with four zzso regions that is used as an entry zzso by the zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso of one of these zzso efficiently inhibited zzso zzso The use of zzso particles as a source of zzso zzso protein zzso the application of zzso display to this difficult class of zzso
