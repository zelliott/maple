One of the most cultivated and consumed vegetables in Brazil is the common zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this plant species with zzso bacteria that are adapted to the stresses commonly found in tropical zzso can increase zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the symbiotic effectiveness of bacterial strains from zzso under different land uses in the Amazon zzso Further, zzso tolerance to acidity and zzso and the involvement of some possible zzso mechanisms of such tolerance were also zzso In assessing the efficiency of biological nitrogen zzso zzso with strains zzso zzso and zzso belonging to the zzso zzso resulted in greater plant growth, higher shoot nitrogen content and good zzso compared to the zzso with the strain zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the mineral nitrogen control or zzso zzso strains that zzso or not bean zzso These efficient strains grew better at pH zzso than at pH zzso or pH zzso they also tolerated up to 1 zzso zzso of zzso and showed an increased production of zzso where the growing rates were less zzso zzso and pH zzso With respect to zzso the highest production of zzso produced greater tolerance to this zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the strains evaluated in this study were tolerant to acidity and zzso they appeared to have developed resistance mechanisms such as zzso production and a resistant cell outer membrane zzso by resistance to zzso and zzso zzso As these strains also gave increased yields of the host species, further studies on whether to recommend these strains as zzso are already zzso
