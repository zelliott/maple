An zzso binding zzso requiring large zzso zzso occurs commonly with many zzso zzso To explore this process of zzso we have investigated the zzso change upon zzso zzso binding with molecular dynamics zzso simulations and free energy zzso We zzso the energetic cost of zzso change in zzso and zzso loop binding using a hybrid of molecular mechanics and zzso zzso zzso zzso in all four free energy comparisons zzso slightly different zzso two different zzso the free zzso was more stable than the bound form by the physically reasonable value of approximately 10 zzso We calculated the absolute binding free energies for both complexes to be in the same range as that found zzso
