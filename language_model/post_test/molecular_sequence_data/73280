zzso DNA of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso of the zzso transport deficient zzso zzso strain zzso Here we describe the zzso gene that encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a corresponding molecular mass of zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso contains 12 putative zzso segments and is zzso to the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso with several zzso acid motifs of this sugar zzso zzso It is also zzso to other sugar carriers from human, mouse and zzso zzso The function of the zzso protein as a zzso zzso was proved both by zzso and zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both transformed zzso strains transported zzso with zzso specificity similar to that in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the cells of the two transformed zzso strains accumulated zzso a zzso zzso zzso with an efficiency similar to zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to accumulate zzso in an delta zzso zzso dependent manner after transformation with zzso provides evidence that the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso
