The zzso protein is an zzso zzso factor that is expressed in zzso and B zzso We present evidence that zzso binds to the promoter of the I-A beta zzso zzso a zzso box located next to the Y zzso zzso of zzso in B zzso or in zzso zzso zzso I-A beta gene zzso The zzso effect of zzso was obtained with the DNA binding domain of the zzso but not with the zzso zzso Using the gel shift zzso zzso we found that in zzso zzso zzso and zzso bind to the Y box of the I-A beta zzso When zzso was added to the zzso a zzso DNA band was found, indicating that zzso and zzso proteins bind to the same DNA zzso We conclude that I-A beta gene expression is zzso by zzso binding to the zzso box zzso
