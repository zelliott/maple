The early zzso zzso zzso response in human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso C infections is often characterized by high zzso but the response is type specific with little to no zzso zzso The zzso of these early zzso zzso are not zzso however, the type specificity suggests that they may target the variable regions of the zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso developed within 3 to 12 weeks in six individuals but did not mediate zzso zzso Using a series of zzso zzso we found that zzso directed at the zzso zzso and zzso regions contributed to zzso zzso in some individuals, with zzso playing a more substantial zzso However, these zzso did not account for the total zzso capacity of these zzso against the early zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso region were involved in zzso zzso in all four zzso zzso In two zzso transfer of the zzso region rendered the zzso as sensitive to zzso zzso as the parental zzso Although the zzso region, which contains the highly variable zzso was not a direct target in most cases, it contributed to the formation of zzso zzso as substitution of this region resulted in zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso and zzso regions combine to form important structural motifs and that zzso in this region are major targets of the early zzso zzso response in zzso zzso C zzso
