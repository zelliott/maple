We have previously found that monkey zzso T cells mount zzso immune responses in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now analyzed zzso monkey zzso T cell responses to zzso zzso and zzso Like human zzso T cells, zzso monkey zzso T cells are zzso when exposed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was limited to zzso T cells expressing zzso zzso zzso monkey zzso T cells also responded to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso monkey zzso zzso revealed a strong sequence zzso to human zzso zzso that preserves important sequence zzso Moreover, zzso zzso that pair human zzso with monkey zzso and monkey zzso with human zzso retain zzso to zzso zzso and B cell zzso A molecular model of the zzso monkey zzso zzso has a basic region in the zzso region 3 binding groove that is similar to that seen in the human zzso zzso and preserves the zzso of the zzso region zzso Thus, recognition of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso in primates suggesting that primates can provide an animal model for human zzso T cell zzso zzso
