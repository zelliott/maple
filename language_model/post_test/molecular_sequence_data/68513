zzso zzso zzso regulate cell growth by zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso signal zzso Within this gene family, the zzso common zzso zzso gene is of particular interest with respect to the nervous system because it has sequence similarity to the neural cell zzso zzso zzso and is located in a zzso region zzso frequently deleted in zzso zzso However, zzso has detected zzso in zzso zzso but not in the central nervous system, peripheral zzso or adrenal zzso In this study, rat brain zzso library zzso clones corresponding to zzso and zzso regions of human zzso were zzso Using zzso derived from these zzso high stringency Northern blots revealed approximately 8 zzso and variable length zzso and zzso zzso transcripts in cortex, zzso zzso spinal cord, peripheral zzso and cultured zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed expression by brain and zzso root zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso regulated in a zzso zzso Changes in zzso expression were also found during nerve growth zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation and with zzso zzso of zzso zzso These observations and studies demonstrating zzso functioning via zzso zzso receptors suggest that zzso represents an additional mechanism regulating neural zzso
