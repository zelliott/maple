The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso plant zzso Here, we describe the first zzso zzso study of the fungus in real-time infection zzso zzso of zzso zzso leaves by zzso was monitored using zzso containing zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso genes are zzso expressed during infection and allowed us to identify 27 genes significantly zzso in zzso Among them, two genes have already been associated with zzso zzso while eight genes have unidentified zzso The 27 genes were separated into three groups according to their expression zzso The first group showed zzso expression at the early stage following zzso zzso the second one showed zzso expression at the outset of the colonization of plant leaves and the third group showed zzso expression when the colonization of plant leaves was zzso A gene of the last group zzso which is zzso to zzso zzso was disrupted in order to determine its role in zzso At seven days zzso the zzso caused by the zzso zzso on bean leaves were reduced by zzso and did not further expand compared to the zzso These results confirm that zzso analysis under infection conditions can be very valuable for the identification of zzso genes related to zzso
