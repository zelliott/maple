The study of zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso was performed using a zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso displayed a high affinity for the zzso expressed in Chinese zzso zzso cell zzso and specifically labeled two protein bands with apparent molecular mass at zzso and 46 zzso Our results clearly show that the zzso zzso is zzso during incubation with the zzso and that the zzso species is probably the result of the zzso species zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was then confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso A zzso zzso directed against a zzso zzso added at the zzso zzso zzso allowed zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein never zzso indicating that the truncated form of the zzso lacks the zzso zzso zzso To zzso zzso zzso of the zzso the zzso protein was zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso The identity of the smallest zzso fragment, observed at approximately 6 zzso was then confirmed by zzso of the potential zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso labeling of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso occurs in a region including zzso domain zzso zzso zzso
