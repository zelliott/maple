zzso analyses based on primary structures of zzso zzso indicated that three zzso zzso zzso seminal and brain zzso present in the bovine species are the results of gene zzso events, which occurred in the zzso of the zzso after divergence from other zzso In this paper sequences are presented of genes zzso pancreatic and zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene could not be detected in this species, neither by zzso amplification nor by Southern zzso zzso indicating that it may be deleted completely in this zzso Previously we demonstrated of a study of zzso acid sequences of pancreatic zzso of a large number of zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso and that zzso groups with zzso Here we present zzso analyses of zzso sequences of zzso and other molecules from zzso species and compare these with published zzso zzso zzso always groups with the other zzso as separate zzso from the zzso or true zzso Within the zzso the relationships between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be decided with zzso although in the majority of analyses zzso zzso first, separately or joined with zzso Broad zzso sampling and investigation of specific sequence features may be as important for reliable conclusions in zzso as the lengths of analyzed zzso
