The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso transport protein in the outer membrane of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso peptides of zzso generated zzso proteins that were incapable of zzso zzso but that instead formed zzso passive channels in the outer zzso Unlike native zzso these pores acted independently of the accessory protein zzso which suggests that zzso is a gated zzso and that zzso acts as its gatekeeper by zzso the entry of zzso into the zzso zzso The sequence zzso among zzso proteins suggests that all zzso outer membrane receptors may function by this zzso zzso
