The fungus zzso zzso is an important and increasingly common pathogen of humans, particularly in zzso zzso Despite this, little is known about the attributes that allow this zzso to cause disease or its interaction with the host immune zzso However, in common with other zzso the cell wall of zzso zzso is the initial point of contact between the host and zzso and as such, it is likely to play an important role in zzso interactions and hence zzso Here, we show both through genetic zzso and zzso structural analyses that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso functional zzso of the respective zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso directly affects the structure of the zzso zzso zzso in line with their predicted functions, and this has implications for cell wall integrity and consequently zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed increased zzso compared with zzso (and zzso zzso This is in contrast to zzso zzso where zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso has usually been linked to an zzso of zzso In the long term, a better understanding of the attributes that allow zzso zzso to cause disease will provide insights that can be adopted for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic zzso
