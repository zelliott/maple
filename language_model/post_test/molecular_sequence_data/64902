The zzso boundaries among species in the zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso selection, zzso zzso zzso DNA restriction analysis, and DNA sequence zzso zzso zzso arose from crosses between the two varieties of zzso zzso indicating that they should be recognized as separate zzso zzso zzso were recovered from crosses between zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing that some genetic exchange is possible in spite of the zzso of the zzso formed in zzso zzso zzso zzso although capable of zzso formation when its zzso mating type is crossed with the zzso mating type of the other species, did not give rise to zzso In the other species, some zzso acquired the ability to form zzso directly from single zzso These often contained the zzso of both parents, suggesting formation of zzso zzso Other zzso behaved as zzso and were similar to one parent except for having inherited the zzso zzso zzso from the other zzso In most, but not all cases, inheritance of the zzso zzso was zzso and correlated with the inheritance of the nuclear zzso zzso In some cases, what appeared to be a zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso derived from the sequences of various DNA regions were not zzso indicating that zzso may have taken place in nature as the zzso species zzso from their common zzso Further evidence that zzso zzso arose from a natural zzso event was zzso but a pair of zzso species that might represent derived forms of the parents could not be identified zzso zzso zzso and most of its closely related zzso species contained a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was absent in zzso zzso zzso zzso and other species in the zzso zzso
