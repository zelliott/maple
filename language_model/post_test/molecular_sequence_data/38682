An zzso in zzso zzso strategy was employed to select for optimal 3' zzso signals from a pool of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso of functional zzso sequences in zzso cell nuclear extract yielded a sequence motif that evolved from zzso after one round of zzso toward a zzso consensus after seven zzso A significant part of the selected sequences contained a zzso zzso motif that proved to be functional both as a zzso signal and a branch site in a competitive zzso zzso of the zzso in these clones to either the upstream or downstream zzso of the zzso sequence revealed that the branching process proceeded efficiently but quite zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso adjacent to the common zzso zzso zzso was found to be required only for zzso In an independent experiment, sequences surrounding an optimal zzso sequence were selected from two zzso zzso zzso The clones selected after six rounds of zzso revealed an extended zzso tract with a high frequency of zzso motifs and a highly zzso zzso sequence in the extreme 3' end of the zzso zzso zzso the 3' terminal zzso of the zzso strongly affects complex A formation, zzso that the zzso AG is recognized early in zzso zzso
