The activity of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso but could be further increased to zzso levels by zzso zzso Thus, zzso sensitivity was retained by the zzso zzso at least at short times of zzso In zzso zzso at higher temperatures and in the zzso zzso zzso at higher zzso ratios, the zzso became fully zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were converted by zzso to a zzso of approximately 124 zzso which still bound zzso and could be isolated on zzso columns when zzso occurred slowly but not when it occurred zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and of its zzso of about 124 zzso has shown that zzso attacked the zzso domain near the C zzso of the zzso This has also been supported by zzso of the zzso zzso and of its zzso of about 124 zzso A first cut occurred in the middle of the domain producing a zzso of about 14 zzso and a zzso zzso of about 124 zzso A second cut closer to the N zzso of the domain also produced a zzso of about 124 zzso and accounted for the loss of zzso binding at prolonged times of incubation of the zzso with zzso
