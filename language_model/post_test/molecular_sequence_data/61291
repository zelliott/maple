The shape and color of flowers are important for plant reproduction because they attract zzso such as insects and zzso zzso it is thought that zzso in these traits may result in the attraction of different zzso genetic isolation, and ultimately, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bear flowers with different shapes and colors that appear to be visited by different zzso The zzso zzso zzso a regulator of the zzso zzso pathway, is the main zzso of color zzso Here, we report an analysis of molecular events at the zzso locus that occur during zzso zzso zzso We isolated zzso by zzso tagging and found that it encodes a zzso domain zzso indicating that it is a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso subspecies with white flowers showed that they contain zzso zzso with two alternative zzso at one site, apparently caused by the zzso and subsequent zzso of a zzso A third zzso zzso has a nonsense zzso elsewhere, indicating that it arose zzso The distribution of zzso in zzso zzso suggests that the loss of zzso function and the zzso changes in floral color were not the primary cause for genetic separation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Rather, they were events that occurred late in the zzso process, possibly to reinforce genetic isolation and complete zzso
