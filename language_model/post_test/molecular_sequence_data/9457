zzso zzso zzso techniques provide valuable information about the structure, dynamics and zzso of zzso zzso In particular zzso peptides (or zzso zzso zzso have early on been investigated by solid-state zzso zzso and many technical innovations in this domain have been developed with the help of these compounds when zzso into oriented zzso zzso Using solid-state zzso zzso it could be shown for the first time that zzso or derivatives zzso exhibit potent zzso activities when their zzso zzso zzso is oriented parallel to the zzso surface, a zzso found in later years for many other linear zzso zzso zzso In contrast zzso alignments or zzso tilt angles have been found for more zzso sequences such as zzso or zzso zzso This review presents various solid-state zzso approaches and develops the basic underlying concept how angular information can be obtained from oriented zzso It is demonstrated how this information is used to calculate structures and zzso of peptides in their native zzso zzso zzso zzso Special emphasis is given to discuss which zzso parameters provide the most complementary information, the minimal number of restraints needed and the effect of motions on the analysis of the zzso zzso Furthermore, recent zzso and zzso solid-state zzso zzso of lipids are presented including some unpublished data which aim at investigating the zzso and structural changes of oriented or zzso zzso Finally the structural models that have been proposed for the mechanisms of action of these peptides will be presented and discussed in view of the solid-state zzso and other zzso zzso
