The zzso gene encodes a widely expressed zzso zzso zzso that zzso in various functions such as zzso zzso and cell volume zzso We isolated and characterized 75 zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso The zzso protein is zzso by 27 zzso zzso protection zzso and primer extension demonstrated zzso zzso initiation sites located within zzso base pairs upstream of the start zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed the presence of a weak zzso box, multiple zzso consensus sites, and the consensus sequence of a putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso reporter gene zzso in mouse inner zzso collecting duct zzso cells confirmed the location of the minimal promoter within a zzso pair zzso upstream of the zzso We also report the identification of an alternatively spliced zzso of the zzso expressed primarily in zzso This new spliced zzso lacks zzso 21, which encodes a zzso acid zzso located in the zzso tail of the zzso The absence of this zzso causes the loss of the single protein zzso A consensus site of the zzso zzso
