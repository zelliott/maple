The membrane lipids of free living and zzso forms of zzso zzso obtained from zzso occupied by both typed and zzso bacteria, were isolated and characterized by a combination of zzso zzso mass zzso and other chemical and physical zzso These studies indicated that both the free living and zzso forms of this zzso contain zzso almost exclusively of the type found in plant zzso In the zzso forms, there was a dramatic shift towards the synthesis of zzso zzso as the major zzso This zzso has rarely been found outside of the plant kingdom and zzso bacteria, and its occurrence in the zzso form of a plant zzso is therefore zzso The presence of plant cell and zzso zzso in the zzso preparations was ruled out by scanning electron zzso Southern zzso analyses for plant DNA using specific gene zzso and chemical analyses for plant marker steroids, steroid zzso and zzso zzso zzso is not found in the plasma membrane of plant cells (of which the zzso membrane is an zzso but is thought to be restricted to zzso This result follows our earlier finding that the other zzso plant zzso zzso zzso is a membrane component of fast growing zzso and is found even when cells are cultivated in free culture where there is no question of plant zzso The near absence of these lipids in the zzso of bacteria outside of this special group of organisms and zzso bacteria suggests that the trait could have been passed on through gene transfer from plants to the bacteria at some point during the development of their symbiotic zzso In the case of zzso zzso there is also the possibility that some common zzso zzso are used by both the plant and the zzso This is a striking parallel with some zzso zzso
