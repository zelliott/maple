The zzso protein zzso by the zzso segment of the E1 open reading frame of bovine zzso type 1 zzso was previously ascribed a negative regulatory function for the replication of viral zzso zzso However, results from recent functional and zzso studies do not readily support this genetic zzso zzso we have zzso the role of this protein in zzso DNA replication by using a zzso of zzso which is unable to express this E1 zzso This zzso viral DNA was found to replicate zzso with stability and copy number per cell similar to those of zzso zzso zzso Thus, the absence of expression of the zzso E1 protein did not lead to zzso viral zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso E1 protein is zzso for stable zzso zzso
