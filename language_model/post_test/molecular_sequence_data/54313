zzso zzso numbered from zzso to zzso were isolated from six moribund zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of all strains zzso to the species description of zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso sequence of strain zzso was zzso and showed high similarity zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso of strain zzso was assessed by the zzso disk diffusion method, and the results showed it was susceptible and moderately susceptible to 12 and 3 of the 19 zzso zzso zzso of strain zzso to juvenile zzso was also tested, and we found that zzso was about zzso zzso zzso zzso per fish in zzso zzso This is the first article to report that zzso zzso was the zzso agent of zzso disease in juvenile zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the most frequently used zzso drugs in China, so the zzso resistance test should be carried out when these bacteria are isolated from biological samples in order to avoid therapeutic failures and spread of the zzso organisms in the zzso
