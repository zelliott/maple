We analyzed the stress responses of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A reporter zzso showed that under stress conditions the expression of only the zzso gene was zzso suggesting a functional assignment of these zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a typical stress response of zzso to heat and zzso zzso zzso extension mapping showed that zzso was transcribed from similar sites under various stress zzso Although no known sequence motif was detected in the upstream region, a zzso sequence element was highly zzso in zzso it was essential not only for the stress induction but also for the zzso expression of zzso The ubiquitous upstream zzso of this element in each heat shock gene suggests its important role in the zzso stress zzso
