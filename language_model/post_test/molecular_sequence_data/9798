zzso libraries of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an isolate from an zzso zzso were constructed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and screened with a serum from a rabbit zzso with surface proteins of an zzso zzso zzso isolate and zzso from four patients with zzso zzso Seventy-five zzso clones reacted with at least two of the zzso zzso of the 75 zzso clones were considered to contain distinct zzso based on their DNA restriction patterns and were chosen for further zzso into a zzso zzso Each zzso was screened with one of the five zzso and the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso Analysis of these sequences revealed similarities to a range of zzso including bacterial zzso factors, zzso zzso regulators, zzso zzso and membrane or cell surface zzso Fourteen zzso did not show significant similarity to any sequence in the databases and may contain novel zzso Thirteen of the zzso zzso clones did not yield zzso zzso and one such zzso clone produced a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
