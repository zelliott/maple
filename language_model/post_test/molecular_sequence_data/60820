The fusion zzso zzso of respiratory zzso virus zzso which mediates membrane fusion and virus entry, was shown to bind zzso a small zzso in zzso zzso interaction zzso The interaction was confirmed in zzso by zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso cells by zzso Furthermore, the interaction of F with zzso was confirmed in zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso interaction studies with various deletion zzso of F and with zzso indicate that the key binding zzso of these proteins are contained zzso or zzso zzso acids 146 to 155 and 67 to zzso zzso The biological significance of this interaction was studied in zzso zzso cells that were zzso zzso to zzso zzso There was a positive correlation between zzso expression and zzso zzso formation, indicating that zzso can facilitate zzso zzso zzso
