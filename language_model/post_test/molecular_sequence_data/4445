zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso disorder that results from the absence of a normal paternal contribution to the zzso zzso The clinical manifestations of zzso are a transient severe zzso in the newborn period, with mental zzso zzso and obesity observed later in zzso Five transcripts with exclusive expression from the paternal zzso have been isolated, but none of these has been shown to be involved in zzso In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of zzso a new human imprinted zzso zzso is exclusively expressed from the paternal zzso in the zzso zzso and is located in the zzso zzso It encodes a putative protein zzso to the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso as in zzso expression in brain is restricted to zzso zzso zzso displays several characteristics of an imprinted zzso including zzso DNA zzso and zzso DNA zzso A complete lack of zzso expression in zzso brain and zzso indicates that the gene is expressed exclusively from the paternal zzso in these zzso and suggests a possible role of this new gene in zzso
