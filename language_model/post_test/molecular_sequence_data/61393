The zzso gene was found among representatives of all bacterial zzso zzso protein is an essential component of cell division zzso zzso of this zzso ring is believed to be the universal way of bacterial zzso zzso zzso possesses all features of the minimal mycoplasma cell and some traits of zzso bacteria and seems to be a promising object for study of basic principles of the bacterial division zzso We cloned an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso gene and two zzso zzso which also were zzso zzso zzso zzso protein has been determined with zzso zzso raised in zzso It was demonstrated that zzso gene of zzso zzso could be expressed in zzso coli zzso We also revealed that zzso zzso zzso had a low similarity to proteins of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparison of zzso structures may be used for investigation of bacterial zzso zzso
