We have designed and chemically zzso an artificial zzso based on a minimal template derived from the comparative analysis of over 80 naturally occurring zzso This zzso has the zzso zzso core structure of natural zzso and shows a robust zzso zzso activity against bacteria and zzso as well as a zzso activity against immature zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso study using two truncated fragments or a zzso zzso zzso from which one or two of the three zzso bridges were zzso indicated that altering the structure resulted in a different type of membrane interaction and a switch to different modes of action towards both microbial and host cells, and that zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and biological activities of the artificial zzso with those of three human zzso and their zzso zzso provided useful information on how their mode of action may relate to specific structural zzso
