First member of zzso gene family was discovered a decade ago by studying avian zzso virus, zzso This virus encodes a zzso protein zzso with a molecular weight of 135 zzso zzso a series of cellular zzso genes were isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These genes share sequence zzso to zzso zzso gene zzso or viral zzso zzso genes are highly zzso in zzso divergent species from zzso to zzso zzso zzso genes are located on different zzso zzso gene products are zzso active zzso DNA binding proteins and are zzso zzso zzso genes are involved in certain zzso zzso leading to the formation of zzso fusion proteins that are associated with certain zzso and soft tissue zzso zzso genes also have a role in zzso development and molecular and genetic analysis of Down zzso patients have implicated the human zzso and zzso genes in the zzso Down zzso afflicted patients have zzso and zzso disorders as well as a greater risk for zzso zzso Thus, zzso genes having zzso to viral zzso may be instrumental in regulating cellular growth and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso of these genes and their products may cause deregulation of normal cell growth and differentiation and result in a zzso
