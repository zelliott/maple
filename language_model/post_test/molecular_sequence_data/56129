A zzso zzso zzso a new species of zzso isolated from zzso with zzso zzso a zzso into the culture zzso Western zzso zzso analysis indicated that this zzso zzso with zzso zzso derived from cattle zzso with zzso zzso Five overlapping zzso zzso carrying the gene for this zzso zzso were identified with a DNA probe containing sequences from the zzso zzso zzso genes from a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of a region of the cloned DNA revealed two open reading frames zzso proteins with predicted masses of zzso and zzso zzso These zzso which we designate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso (A zzso respectively, are similar in sequence to the zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso The structure of the zzso protein derived from the DNA sequence shows three zzso zzso in the zzso part of the zzso 13 zzso repeat zzso in the second half of the zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are strongly zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, this zzso kills both zzso and pig zzso and is not zzso
