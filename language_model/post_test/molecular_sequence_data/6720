This report describes experiments designed to demonstrate the suitability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a host for zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso strain was constructed and used as a host for the expression of a series of zzso zzso complementary to various regions of the target zzso zzso All zzso zzso genes were placed under control of the zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso and expressed from zzso zzso For each zzso zzso a corresponding sense control zzso was zzso All zzso zzso genes were shown to express zzso zzso of the expected size at equivalent zzso zzso zzso activity in transformed cells expressing the long, short zzso or short 3' zzso zzso zzso was shown to be reduced by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, relative to control zzso Further experiments indicated that zzso zzso regulation in this system was conditional and zzso with the observed reduction of zzso activity being dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results represent the first successful example of zzso zzso regulation of gene expression in zzso and establish zzso zzso as an experimental model for the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso
