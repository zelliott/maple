The function of the relatively well-studied DNA replication origins in the zzso zzso zzso is dependent upon interactions between origin replication complex zzso proteins and several defined origin sequence zzso including the 11 zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso Although the zzso zzso as well as numerous other protein components required for DNA replication zzso are largely zzso between zzso and zzso DNA sequences within zzso replication origins are highly variable and sequences zzso to the zzso zzso elements are generally not zzso We have previously identified several replication initiation sites within the zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso and found that two highly zzso sites each contain a zzso of the zzso zzso embedded within a DNA unwinding element and a zzso attachment zzso Here we examine protein binding within these initiation sites, and demonstrate that these zzso zzso specifically bind the alternate zzso factor zzso as well as zzso in zzso and present evidence that the zzso interaction also occurs within the zzso of intact zzso As the moderate zzso of zzso has been linked to zzso through the promotion of alternatively spliced forms of several regulatory zzso our results suggest an additional mechanism by which zzso may influence the transformed cell zzso
