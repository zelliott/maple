zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso capable of converting cellular zzso to zzso The zzso zzso from pea zzso can be activated by highly zzso soybean zzso zzso but not by the divergent soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine which zzso were responsible for this differential zzso of zzso zzso a series of zzso zzso were generated by exchanging functional zzso between zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that contains the first domain of zzso was severely impaired zzso zzso of zzso in its ability to activate zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that contains the first domain of zzso exhibited nearly full ( approximately zzso zzso of zzso zzso Only zzso containing domain I of zzso produced greater than zzso zzso of zzso zzso To define the zzso acid zzso in domain I that were responsible for this differential zzso seven single zzso substitution zzso of zzso were generated and tested for zzso zzso zzso Among these zzso only zzso and zzso showed greatly reduced zzso zzso zzso Also a double zzso substitution zzso zzso containing these two zzso in combination was severely impaired in its zzso zzso potential, reaching only zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, a triple zzso zzso completely abolished zzso zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that domain I of zzso plays a key role in the differential zzso of zzso zzso exhibited by zzso and zzso Further, the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are critical for this zzso
