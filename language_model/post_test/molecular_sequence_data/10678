In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been detected in zzso and zzso until zzso We have isolated and zzso seven zzso genes from the zzso nuclear zzso All of these genes contain zzso of identical length and zzso The 11 zzso long intervening sequences are located 1 zzso 3' to the zzso as found in other zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are efficiently transcribed in zzso cell nuclear zzso Moreover, processing and zzso occurred in zzso as well as in wheat germ zzso supporting the notion that zzso zzso zzso can be classified as authentic zzso zzso We have also isolated zzso zzso from zzso zzso This zzso zzso has a zzso zzso and is not a zzso zzso as shown in in zzso translation zzso Since zzso and zzso zzso are used as zzso zzso in zzso zzso DNA, the presence of a strong natural zzso zzso such as zzso with zzso zzso should cause zzso of the zzso as zzso zzso and the absence of the latter had thus been zzso zzso we have studied the organization of zzso genes in the zzso of zzso and have found two types of zzso gene zzso A minimum of 12 zzso genes are present as single copies in zzso DNA zzso restriction fragments ranging in size from zzso to 7 zzso zzso one cluster of zzso genes consisting of six members has been detected in a zzso zzso zzso zzso
