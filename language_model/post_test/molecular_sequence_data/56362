The effect of multiple zzso of zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso on virus replication was zzso zzso zzso used include some derived from zzso of virus zzso in tissue culture as well as others obtained by direct cloning of viral DNA from zzso of infected zzso The effect of zzso on virus replication was evaluated in the context of a zzso of the zzso zzso shown previously to require zzso for rapid growth in zzso human T cell lines and in primary peripheral blood zzso zzso The results of the experiments show that in this genetic context all of the studied viruses carrying zzso zzso that express stable zzso proteins replicate more rapidly than do their, otherwise zzso zzso zzso Two of the zzso zzso derived from primary zzso produce unstable zzso These studies demonstrate that naturally occurring zzso zzso can increase the rate of virus replication in both primary peripheral blood zzso cells and in a zzso T cell zzso The results also demonstrate that functional variation exists among naturally occurring zzso zzso
