The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like its zzso counterparts, encodes muscle and zzso zzso through two promoters and alternatively spliced zzso In the present study we describe a zzso clone zzso zzso a skeletal muscle zzso of the gene that differs from the previously described skeletal TM transcript zzso by its zzso zzso The two skeletal zzso zzso zzso are generated through distinct zzso processing using different zzso signals and distinct patterns of zzso zzso Using zzso protection and zzso in zzso zzso we have zzso the zzso and spatial expression of the two zzso Both are expressed in the zzso but zzso is by far the most prevalent of the zzso In contrast, only zzso is expressed in adult zzso muscle zzso In the zzso the spatial expression of zzso is restricted to the zzso whereas zzso is expressed in both zzso and embryonic zzso
