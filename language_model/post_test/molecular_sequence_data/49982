zzso in the zzso zzso gene cause cell cycle arrest of zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso encodes the zzso zzso of zzso and regulates zzso division by modulating both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of human zzso to zzso zzso brains in culture zzso the zzso proliferation zzso while addition of a zzso inhibitor causes cell cycle arrest of the regulated zzso in zzso zzso Like zzso zzso activates stem cell division in the zzso brain in a zzso zzso zzso studies are consistent with interactions between zzso and zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso that are not zzso with zzso zzso Finally, analyses of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso suggest that zzso affects zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso can mediate signaling through both of the zzso and zzso pathways to control the onset of stem cell proliferation in the developing nervous zzso
