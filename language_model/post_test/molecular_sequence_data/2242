Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated native high density zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate the release of human zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells in zzso To examine the mechanisms by which these zzso stimulate zzso release, we have studied zzso zzso in response to several synthetic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso structure of the zzso The magnitude of the stimulation of zzso release in response to the analog peptides correlated with the ability to zzso zzso from high density zzso and with other measures of zzso binding affinity such as the increase in zzso and the size of complexes formed between the zzso and zzso The correlation of zzso ability and zzso affinity suggests that the action of the zzso on zzso release may be zzso through an interaction with plasma membrane zzso
