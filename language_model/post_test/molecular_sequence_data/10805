zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene result in zzso and zzso of various zzso in the central nervous system, causing severe neurological zzso We studied two Japanese patients with zzso zzso and identified a zzso and a zzso error zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in patient zzso The zzso abolished zzso activity according to in zzso expression zzso The zzso zzso in patient 2 was markedly zzso zzso zzso chain reaction of the zzso generated a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The inserted sequence contained a termination zzso which was likely to affect the stability of the zzso Analysis of zzso DNA showed that the zzso was derived from putative zzso 3 of the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso substitution was present adjacent to the zzso of the inserted zzso The zzso change generated a sequence similar to an zzso zzso donor site and probably activated an upstream cryptic zzso site, thus producing an abnormal extra zzso
