zzso receptors were first proposed by zzso et zzso when they studied zzso effect of zzso A strong candidate for zzso known as zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been cloned from human zzso We reported that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso dependence in zzso zzso To zzso the functional and structure properties of zzso we developed the newly zzso zzso against the zzso zzso region including the zzso domain zzso through zzso of zzso mice with the zzso fusion protein containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were established and zzso zzso specifically recognized full-length zzso proteins in their native state by zzso and zzso zzso zzso stained in a predominantly zzso zzso pattern when applied to zzso zzso cells by indirect zzso zzso and demonstrated excellent zzso in flow zzso These zzso zzso will provide powerful zzso for the further investigation of zzso protein zzso
