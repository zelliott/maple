zzso of zzso by its zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso heavy chain zzso an initial step in switch zzso The following studies were undertaken to understand the molecular basis of this zzso zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso B cell lines induced zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the absence of zzso To identify a putative zzso response element, a reporter construct consisting of the 777 zzso of the zzso flank of the human zzso zzso region linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso into B cell zzso zzso with either zzso zzso cells or zzso induced zzso zzso zzso analysis of this promoter region confirmed that an zzso response element was identified within a 63 zzso segment 3' to the zzso element that was responsive to zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso promoter contains a zzso response element that is distinct from that accounting zzso zzso zzso zzso of this response element may explain the capacity of zzso of zzso to induce zzso zzso transcripts in the absence of zzso
