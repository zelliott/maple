The prediction of essential biological features based on a given protein sequence is a challenging task in zzso zzso To limit the amount of in zzso zzso the prediction of essential biological activities gives the opportunity to detect so far unknown sequences with similar zzso Besides the application within the identification of proteins being involved in zzso other functional classes of proteins can be zzso The prediction accuracy depends on the selected machine learning approach and even more on the composition of the zzso set zzso A zzso approach based on zzso neural networks was applied for the prediction of small zzso zzso this was realized by taking secondary structure and zzso information as a zzso architecture and thus, as zzso for the neural zzso We developed a neural network zzso which consists of a filter network and four zzso zzso The filter network was trained to identify small zzso and the zzso networks were trained to assign a small zzso to one of the zzso The accuracy of the zzso whether a given sequence represents a small zzso is very high zzso The zzso of the zzso networks yield comparable zzso The high prediction accuracy of the neural network cluster developed, gives the opportunity to suggest the use of zzso and secondary structure prediction in combination with a neural network zzso as a promising method for the prediction of essential biological zzso
