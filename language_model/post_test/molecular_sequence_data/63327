A natural way to study protein zzso structure, and function is to put them in the context of zzso zzso inherit similarities from their common zzso while zzso zzso to similar structures due to a limited number of energetically favorable ways to pack secondary structural zzso Using novel strategies, we previously assembled two reliable databases of zzso and zzso In this study, we compare these two data sets and develop a support zzso machine zzso zzso to discriminate between zzso and zzso The zzso uses a number of well-known similarity zzso We observe that although both structure scores and sequence scores contribute to zzso performance, profile sequence scores zzso based on structural alignments are the best zzso between remote zzso and structural zzso We apply our zzso to a representative set from the zzso database, zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso recovers zzso of the remote zzso defined as zzso in the same zzso zzso but from different zzso More importantly, we also detect and discuss interesting zzso relationships between zzso zzso from different zzso zzso and even zzso
