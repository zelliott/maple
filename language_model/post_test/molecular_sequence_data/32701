The expression of an zzso zzso in the indirectly developing zzso zzso zzso was characterized during zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the animal hemisphere, zzso is first expressed in zzso zzso and their immediate zzso Such discrete embryonic animal zzso zzso expression perhaps relates to zzso zzso functions of the zzso During feeding zzso transcripts are detected in adult cerebral zzso precursors and putative adult eye zzso where it may have adult brain zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in primary zzso zzso but it is expressed in cells adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in a group of cells in the zzso zzso of the early zzso zzso in putative zzso sensory organ zzso The vegetal zzso expression starts in oral and lateral sides of the zzso and later expands to central zzso that lead the zzso zzso During late zzso zzso the expression declines in zzso zzso but it is maintained in zzso zzso suggesting its involvement in zzso gut subdivision zzso zzso broader and earlier zzso expression zzso with zzso by zzso associated with the formation of the feeding zzso in contrast with a later and orally restricted zzso expression found in a zzso that zzso by zzso and forms a zzso zzso The zzso expression and functional roles in other zzso suggest an ancestral role of zzso related to zzso by zzso
