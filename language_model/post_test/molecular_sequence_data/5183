Gene density near the ends of zzso zzso zzso is much lower than on the rest of the zzso zzso zzso are common and a high proportion of the sequences are repeated elsewhere in the zzso This sequence arrangement suggests that the ends of zzso play a structural rather than a coding role and may be analogous to the highly repeated zzso DNA of higher zzso In order to evaluate the function of the ends of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of DNA from zzso I was zzso The region contains 16 open reading frames zzso and two zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that none of these genes are essential for growth on rich or minimal zzso mating or zzso In contrast to the central region where zzso of the genes are transcribed when cells are grown on rich zzso only seven zzso and the two zzso genes appeared to produce zzso Six of the transcribed zzso were from the zzso part of the region, leaving the zzso zzso with only a single sequence that is transcribed during zzso zzso Two genes located 3 and zzso from the zzso I zzso are almost identical to two genes located somewhat further from the zzso VIII zzso Surprisingly, the zzso VIII copies were transcribed while the zzso I genes were zzso These results suggest that the zzso I genes may be zzso by a natural zzso position zzso The low level of transcription, absence of essential genes as well as the repetitive nature of these sequences are consistent with their having a structural role in zzso zzso
