Three different nuclear genes zzso the essential zzso zzso of zzso complex II zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso raising interesting questions about their origin and zzso To find clues about their role, we have undertaken a detailed analysis of their zzso Two genes zzso and zzso that likely arose via a relatively recent zzso event are expressed in all zzso from adult plants, whereas transcripts from the third gene zzso were not zzso The zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso was investigated by in zzso zzso In flowers, both genes are regulated in a similar zzso zzso expression was observed in floral zzso and sex organ zzso at early stages of zzso As flowers zzso zzso and zzso transcripts accumulate in zzso particularly in the zzso zzso mother cells, and zzso in agreement with an essential role of zzso during zzso zzso Interestingly, in contrast to the situation in flowers, only zzso appears to be expressed at a significant level in root zzso Strong labeling was observed in all cell layers of the root zzso zone, and a zzso pattern of expression was found with increasing distance from the root tip, as cells attain their differentiated zzso Analysis of transgenic zzso plants carrying zzso and zzso promoters fused to the zzso reporter gene indicate that both promoters have similar activities in flowers, driving enhanced expression in zzso and/or zzso and that only the zzso promoter is active in root zzso These zzso zzso patterns parallel those obtained by in zzso zzso suggesting zzso regulation of these zzso Progressive deletions of the promoters identified regions important for zzso expression in zzso and/or zzso and for zzso expression in zzso and/or zzso and root zzso Interestingly, regions driving enhanced expression in zzso are differently located in the two zzso
