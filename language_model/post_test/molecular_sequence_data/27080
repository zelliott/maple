In the zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso three independent genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistance to zzso have been zzso Recently, we constructed infectious zzso clones of zzso zzso and zzso strains and found that these two strains differ in their ability to zzso soybean zzso possessing different zzso resistance genes despite a difference of only 33 zzso zzso In particular, zzso induced mosaic symptoms zzso in zzso zzso and provoked a lethal systemic hypersensitive response zzso in zzso whereas zzso could not zzso these soybean zzso To identify the responsible zzso zzso of zzso we exploited the differential responses of zzso and zzso zzso viruses and zzso acid substitution zzso viruses in several soybean zzso and demonstrated that zzso inclusion zzso protein is the zzso of zzso extreme resistance and a zzso zzso provoking zzso in zzso A single zzso acid substitution in zzso was found to be responsible for gain or loss of zzso function of zzso Our finding provides a role for zzso as a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and increases the understanding of the basis of the different disease responses of zzso zzso
