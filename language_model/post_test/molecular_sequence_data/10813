The evolution over the past century of two zzso infecting populations of the immigrant plant zzso zzso in New South Wales zzso Australia, has been zzso This plant species probably entered Australia in the zzso zzso of the viruses were obtained from zzso zzso specimens deposited in the zzso zzso between zzso and 1972, and others were obtained from living plants in 1985 and zzso It was found that the zzso zzso zzso population was infected with tobacco mosaic zzso zzso and tobacco mild green mosaic zzso zzso before 1950 but only with zzso after that zzso Half the zzso infections were zzso of the two zzso and one was a zzso zzso sequence analyses showed no increase in the genetic diversity among the zzso zzso over the zzso However, for zzso the genetic diversity of synonymous (but not of zzso differences between zzso varied and was correlated with their time of zzso zzso accumulated to smaller zzso than zzso in zzso zzso plants, and in mixed experimental infections, the zzso of zzso but not of zzso was around zzso that in single zzso However, no evidence was found of zzso interaction between the zzso We conclude that although zzso may have zzso zzso zzso in zzso earlier or faster than zzso the latter virus caused a decrease of the zzso population below a threshold at which deleterious zzso were zzso This phenomenon, called zzso zzso or a zzso zzso probably caused the disappearance of zzso from the zzso
