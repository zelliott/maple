In zzso coli there is a large increase of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso which are deficient in the zzso gene zzso zzso In this work it was shown that this increase in zzso synthesis does not occur in zzso zzso zzso deficient in both the zzso gene zzso protein and zzso a component of the zzso zzso It was also shown that the other components of the zzso system are required to obtain the increase of zzso synthesis in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by random zzso which had partial zzso zzso activity but which did not exhibit increased levels of zzso in a zzso zzso For three zzso the zzso was identified as a single point zzso This allowed the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso 463 which could be involved in the zzso gene zzso protein dependent zzso zzso
