Nuclear proteins were isolated from different aged chick embryonic zzso and examined by gel mobility shift and footprint analyses using the zzso to zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso A major zzso change in zzso complexes involved the loss of binding complexes present initially in the 8- to zzso nuclear zzso Both chemical and zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso binding complexes corresponded to positions zzso to zzso zzso within the zzso promoter zzso zzso shift competition zzso confirmed the identity of the specific DNA sequences zzso These results demonstrate that increased zzso during zzso zzso involves the zzso of a negative element functionality previously shown to be affected by zzso in zzso
