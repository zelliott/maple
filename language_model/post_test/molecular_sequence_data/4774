Previous attempts to produce active human zzso zzso in zzso coli have failed, due to its zzso in the form of zzso inclusion bodies, and the inability of the protein to enter the zzso export pathway, when fused to bacterial signal zzso We have reasoned that these limitations could be overcome by introducing changes in the signal sequence and/or in some zzso zzso not critical for its biological zzso and proceeded to test this hypothesis using a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso signal zzso and the zzso zzso display zzso zzso of the Pro zzso in zzso led to the export of a correct size zzso zzso to the bacterial zzso of zzso cells by the zzso zzso However, this was achieved under growth conditions that would not favor zzso assembly in zzso zzso zzso the zzso core of the leader zzso reversed this situation and allowed zzso assembly and display of a zzso hybrid protein in zzso zzso The zzso zzso is correctly zzso as judged by its ability to interact with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and maintains its biological activity when tested in a zzso cell proliferation zzso The changes introduced in zzso and the signal sequence will make possible to use the powerful zzso display technology for the selection of zzso zzso from libraries of zzso zzso
