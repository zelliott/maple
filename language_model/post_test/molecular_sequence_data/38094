The presence of zzso in marine zzso was zzso hypothesized in oyster and in zzso during the zzso however zzso and zzso zzso were completely zzso and zzso rather zzso Already from the first studies it was evident that the zzso of zzso zzso was more difficult than in zzso zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of a zzso and a zzso zzso Several zzso and zzso parameters can influence the concentration and the isolation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso variations in zzso isolation and zzso might depend on the zzso and storage zzso Because of possible zzso due to the isolation procedure the establishment of a standard protocol for zzso zzso in marine zzso is still an important zzso In a few species the presence of very low molecular weight metal binding zzso has also been reported, in these cases it cannot be excluded that the native zzso has been zzso by the action of zzso This review aims to report: 1) importance of a standard method for zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 2) distribution of zzso among zzso zzso 3) data concerning zzso and zzso zzso which are the two more deeply investigated marine zzso 4) zzso and zzso factors influencing zzso zzso and 5) biological role of zzso and use of zzso as a zzso marker of heavy metal zzso
