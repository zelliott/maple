Type 1 transforming growth zzso zzso beta 1) was found to be a potent zzso of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso protein by normal rat kidney zzso zzso This protein was related to type 1 zzso zzso inhibitor zzso on the basis of molecular mass, activity in the presence of sodium zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso and zzso sequence zzso zzso levels in the zzso medium of zzso cells were increased zzso to zzso when cells were incubated with zzso zzso of zzso beta 1 for 24 zzso reaching a concentration of approximately zzso zzso The zzso zzso was deposited in the zzso zzso zzso as well as released into the culture zzso A spontaneously transformed zzso cell line was found to zzso zzso times less zzso in the absence or presence of zzso beta 1, compared to the parent cell line, while zzso zzso in Kirsten zzso zzso zzso cells was almost completely zzso A novel zzso procedure was established, which results in the isolation of highly active and zzso zzso beta zzso zzso
