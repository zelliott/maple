Two major zzso zzso zzso zzso implicated in zzso transport in zzso cells are distinguished functionally on the basis of zzso zzso one is selective for zzso zzso but also binds zzso and the other has selectivity for zzso zzso but also binds zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso system has been established by zzso of zzso zzso whereas the conclusion that zzso is zzso of the zzso system is based on zzso zzso We investigated zzso transport zzso by a zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and compared it with that zzso by a zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso were 1 order of magnitude lower than those zzso by zzso In kinetic studies, zzso transported zzso with an apparent zzso value for influx zzso zzso similar to that for zzso but with a very much lower zzso value, and the zzso ratios were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from preloaded zzso demonstrating a capacity for zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that the rate of conversion of zzso from its zzso zzso to its zzso zzso was increased when the zzso was zzso with zzso and decreased when it was zzso with zzso Thus, although zzso binds zzso and zzso with similar zzso it zzso favors transport of zzso
