Common zzso in the zzso factor zzso 2 zzso gene have been identified as the strongest genetic risk factors for type 2 diabetes zzso However, the mechanisms by which these zzso zzso increase risk for zzso are not zzso We used 13 expression zzso to survey zzso expression of multiple zzso zzso forms in up to 380 samples from eight types of human tissue zzso pancreatic zzso zzso liver, zzso skeletal muscle, subcutaneous zzso tissue and zzso cell zzso and observed a zzso pattern of alternative zzso We tested whether the expression of zzso zzso forms was associated with single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located within zzso 3 and 4 of the gene and most strongly associated with zzso zzso of two zzso forms was lower in pancreatic zzso with increasing counts of zzso zzso of the zzso a ubiquitous zzso form zzso zzso zzso for zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso and a zzso form found in pancreatic zzso zzso and colon but not in other zzso tested here zzso zzso zzso for zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso zzso of this form in zzso pancreatic zzso correlated with expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso we identified a zzso pattern of alternative zzso of zzso After adjustment for multiple tests, no association between expression of zzso in eight types of human tissue samples and zzso genetic zzso remained zzso Alternative zzso of zzso in pancreatic zzso warrants future zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
