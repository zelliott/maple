DNA possesses many desirable zzso properties as a zzso zzso With the myriad of tools available to manipulate DNA, there is great potential for using DNA as a generic instead of a genetic zzso Although much progress has been made in DNA computing and DNA zzso the full achievement of zzso materials has not yet been zzso As almost all DNA molecules are either linear or zzso to rationally construct DNA materials one must first create additional shapes of DNA as basic building zzso In addition, these DNA building blocks must be readily incorporated into larger structures in a controlled zzso Here, we show the controlled assembly of zzso DNA zzso from zzso DNA zzso The synthesis of zzso and controlled assembly of zzso were robust and zzso the resulting zzso was stable and almost zzso The zzso DNA zzso can be either zzso or zzso providing great potential to link other zzso
