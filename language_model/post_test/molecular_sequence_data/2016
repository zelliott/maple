Several zzso zzso of zzso zzso arise spontaneously at extremely high zzso (up to zzso and are readily identified by inspection of bacterial zzso Two zzso types, those lacking the buoyant gas zzso or the zzso purple zzso have been studied in detail by zzso and molecular genetic zzso In the zzso zzso strain, the bop zzso zzso the purple membrane protein zzso is found on the bacterial zzso while the gas zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso are present on zzso a zzso zzso of approximately 150 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes are on a single zzso unit, while the major bop zzso is zzso Essentially all of the purple membrane deficient zzso contain zzso sequence zzso elements into or upstream of the bop zzso Two zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, account for most zzso of the purple membrane zzso but at least three other zzso zzso 23, zzso 26, and zzso S1, have also been zzso The gas zzso zzso are more heterogeneous, with many displaying partial zzso Three major classes of gas zzso zzso are zzso class I and class III zzso are the result of large deletions in zzso however, while class I zzso are partially gas zzso deficient and contain a zzso reduced number of zzso zzso copies, class III zzso contain no zzso copies of the gas zzso genes and are essentially completely gas zzso zzso Class II zzso like the purple membrane zzso contain IS elements into or upstream of the gas zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
