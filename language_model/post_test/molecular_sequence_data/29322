The 10 extant species of zzso zzso represent an array of zzso and ecological forms recognizable and popular among scientists and zzso Nevertheless, the zzso affinities of most zzso remain zzso Here, we examine the evolutionary relationships of zzso zzso using zzso zzso of DNA zzso the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and adjacent zzso These data contain 339 zzso zzso characters that we use to erect hypotheses of relationships for the zzso Both maximum zzso and maximum likelihood methods yield a zzso zzso in which all but three zzso are well zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a zzso zzso as do the species of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form a third zzso group that may be sister to all other zzso zzso zzso is problematic and probably related to zzso Based on this zzso and previous molecular work on the group, we suggest the following zzso zzso zzso zzso should be restricted to a single species, zzso zzso zzso zzso should be zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso should be expanded to include three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, our analyses show that neither zzso nor zzso zzso form zzso zzso zzso shell zzso was either independently gained in zzso and zzso or zzso lost in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence, and the multiple origins of shell zzso in related turtle lineages (especially zzso support the independent origin of zzso zzso
