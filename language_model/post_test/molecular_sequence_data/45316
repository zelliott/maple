The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso contains an ARE zzso zzso that potentially regulates the stability of zzso zzso in a cell specific zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that multiple proteins interact with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, potentially contributing to the zzso of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso or zzso acid has been shown to induce zzso of zzso zzso which was associated with decreased binding of zzso factors to zzso zzso zzso has been identified as one of the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 279, zzso In an effort to identify additional zzso zzso zzso two zzso of zzso 45 zzso and 60 zzso were isolated from zzso cells by zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso These proteins were identified as the human proliferation associated zzso zzso and human zzso zzso stranded zzso protein zzso respectively, by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso but not to the group 1 ARE present in zzso zzso zzso stimulating zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is present in zzso zzso complexes formed with zzso zzso zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso zzso in zzso cells was also demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso This interaction was not detected in extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further revealed that zzso zzso with zzso from zzso zzso zzso The observation that zzso was decreased when extracts were treated with zzso suggests that zzso and zzso are present in the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further demonstrated that zzso decreased the rate of zzso of zzso transcripts in zzso cell zzso zzso these results indicate a novel function for zzso in contributing to the regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso
