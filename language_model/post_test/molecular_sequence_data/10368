The high degree of zzso of the zzso genes at the zzso sequence level has proven zzso typing a major typing zzso For zzso the zzso zzso is predominantly present in the second zzso and by DNA sequencing of zzso 2 all zzso known zzso zzso can be zzso For the associated genes zzso zzso and zzso the situation is slightly zzso zzso differences are not limited to zzso 2 and the sequence of zzso 3 and sometimes zzso 4 is needed for complete zzso zzso to amplify the zzso needed for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso products were generated to make simultaneous detection of zzso in zzso combinations zzso In this way zzso individuals were fully typed for their zzso 4 and 5 zzso Additional samples were typed for only one of the zzso All samples had been previously typed by zzso zzso typing results were obtained for all individuals zzso The zzso zzso typed for included zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso they were zzso zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso were easily detected by the protocol described except for zzso zzso of zzso 3 and 4 of the zzso zzso showed this zzso to be a sequencing error and the sequences obtained were identical to the zzso 2, 3 and 4 sequences of zzso Two new zzso were identified in the samples zzso zzso and zzso zzso based typing has been recognized as a valuable tool for zzso typing of zzso zzso and zzso since several zzso It is shown to be a superior typing method as well in the detection of the different zzso 4 and 5 zzso
