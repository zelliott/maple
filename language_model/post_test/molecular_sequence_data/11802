Two ferret zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were identified that reacted zzso with a panel of zzso zzso zzso although their zzso sequences were zzso zzso Each clone zzso to a single zzso species of 3,600 zzso only in zzso zzso lung zzso but zzso analysis demonstrated that these zzso clones were derived from two distinct zzso zzso zzso Further zzso analysis demonstrated that the ferret zzso zzso zzso contains at least two zzso genes lying in tandem on a single zzso separated by a zzso zzso zzso Based on the terminal gene sequences of this tandem repeat and the zzso zzso a composite full-length ferret zzso zzso zzso coding sequence was zzso The zzso region immediately downstream of the stop zzso of the first zzso gene contains three putative zzso signals, and constitutes the 3' untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso extension of the zzso zzso resulted in products extending 74 and zzso zzso into the zzso zzso However, the zzso region lying greater than 25 zzso upstream of the first zzso of the second zzso gene was found to be absent from the zzso zzso
