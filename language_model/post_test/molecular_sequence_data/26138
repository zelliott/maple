In a previous work we showed that the two functionally different zzso zzso and zzso could only be differentiated by zzso analysis using two mutually exclusive fragments zzso zzso II zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The zzso Workshop synthetic analysis localized these fragments in the zzso zzso zzso Our results zzso however, that they are located between the A1 and B1 zzso the zzso II restriction site responsible for the zzso zzso zzso was localized between the first and second zzso of the zzso gene and inside the zzso zzso zzso A single zzso point inside this restriction site is responsible for the absence of the zzso zzso fragment, changing the specificity attributed by zzso zzso
