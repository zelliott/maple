Recently, rapid progress in our structural knowledge of zzso channels has started to provide a basis for zzso the zzso machinery underlying their zzso zzso These studies have begun to reveal how a diverse array of zzso zzso positioned zzso affect the activity of associated zzso Some of these establish functional diversity by selectively zzso channel zzso More importantly, these zzso zzso couple zzso signals to the gating of their associated zzso New structural insights are providing a clearer understanding of the fundamental molecular mechanisms of these zzso channels that, in turn, partly zzso complex neurological zzso
