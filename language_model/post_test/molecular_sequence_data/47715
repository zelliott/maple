zzso is a large zzso complex that regulates zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the role of zzso most abundant zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a cell cycle delay at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso apparatus zzso protein were recruited to multiple zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso Point zzso were generated in zzso that identified specific zzso acids required for the zzso delay and for the formation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso proteins formed zzso in cells that zzso with zzso and zzso zzso but in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso remained zzso Although expression of zzso zzso proteins had no effect on zzso cells, in zzso cells expression of the zzso resulted in disruption of the zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso proteins in cell zzso and that these interactions are zzso in the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso acids altered in the zzso zzso proteins participate in stabilizing interactions between zzso zzso and components of the zzso zzso complex as well as the zzso zzso
