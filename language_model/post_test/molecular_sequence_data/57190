Several proteins that interact with zzso zzso the zzso zzso particle A and B zzso zzso and zzso contain the modified zzso acid zzso Here, we report that two synthetic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are based on zzso sequences in zzso and zzso inhibit the zzso of a large majority of the zzso proteins observed in extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the peptides themselves become zzso suggesting that they compete for the same zzso that carries out the bulk of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso in zzso zzso with a lesser effect on zzso and zzso zzso brain contains an activity that zzso zzso zzso zzso After partial zzso the bovine zzso efficiently zzso zzso and zzso yielding zzso rates of zzso at approximately zzso and approximately 2 zzso zzso zzso A search of the zzso database for the zzso motif revealed 13 candidate zzso zzso containing zzso and at most two similar zzso or one zzso Of these, 10 are known or presumed to interact with zzso These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a majority of proteins containing zzso interact with zzso
