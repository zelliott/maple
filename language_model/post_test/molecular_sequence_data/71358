The zzso of the genes zzso and zzso responsible for the majority of cases of zzso dominant zzso kidney disease is zzso While zzso encodes a large integral membrane protein containing several structural motifs found in known proteins involved in zzso or zzso zzso zzso has zzso to zzso and the major zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We now describe sequence zzso between zzso and various members of the zzso transient zzso potential channel zzso zzso thought to be activated by G zzso zzso zzso and/or depletion of internal zzso zzso We show that zzso can directly associate with zzso but not zzso in zzso cells and in zzso This association is zzso by two distinct zzso in zzso One domain involves a minimal region of 73 zzso acids in the zzso zzso tail of zzso shown previously to constitute an interacting domain with zzso However, distinct zzso within this region mediate specific interactions with zzso or zzso The zzso domain is sufficient but not necessary for the zzso zzso A more zzso domain located within zzso segments zzso and zzso including a putative pore zzso region between zzso and zzso is also responsible for the zzso Given the ability of the zzso to form functional zzso and zzso complexes, these data provide evidence that zzso may be functionally related to zzso proteins and suggest a possible role of zzso in modulating zzso entry in response to G zzso zzso zzso and/or store zzso
