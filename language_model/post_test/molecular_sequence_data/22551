Mouse and human zzso T cells primed during an immune response may differentiate into zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso that mediate effective immunity against different classes of zzso However, primed zzso T cells can also remain zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso We now show that human zzso T cells primed by protein vaccines mostly zzso zzso but not zzso whereas in the same individuals most zzso T cells initially primed by infection with live pathogens zzso zzso We further demonstrate that many zzso zzso cells are zzso and that a single zzso cell can differentiate into zzso or zzso zzso following in zzso stimulation under appropriate polarizing zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso cells maintained a zzso zzso even under zzso zzso Similarly, zzso transferred zzso transgenic mouse T cells zzso mainly zzso after zzso with zzso in zzso but were biased toward zzso zzso when primed with the same zzso zzso presented as a pathogen zzso during live zzso Thus, protein zzso vaccines may prime a unique subset of zzso but zzso zzso T cells that lack some of the functional properties of committed zzso induced by zzso This has implications for the design of more effective vaccines against pathogens requiring strong zzso zzso T cell zzso
