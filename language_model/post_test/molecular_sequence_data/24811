zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli is composed of an alpha and a beta zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso contains a single zzso As compared to the latter zzso using a zzso model for its membrane zzso the point of fusion is between the zzso zzso 4 and 6 where the fusion zzso provides the extra zzso zzso zzso In order to clarify the potential role of this extra zzso the alpha and the beta zzso were fused using three connecting peptides of different zzso one zzso involving essentially a direct zzso a second zzso with a linking zzso of 18 zzso and a third zzso with a linking zzso of 32 zzso as compared to the zzso extra zzso of 27 zzso The results demonstrate that the plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the short zzso was partly zzso and strongly inhibited with regard to both zzso activities and zzso zzso whereas the properties of zzso and zzso with longer zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso coli zzso but partly different from those of the zzso zzso although zzso generally gave higher zzso It is concluded that a zzso linking zzso is required for proper folding and activity of the zzso coli fused zzso and that differences between the zzso properties of the zzso coli and the zzso zzso are unrelated to the linking zzso This is the first time that larger zzso of a membrane protein with multiple zzso zzso have been fused with retained zzso
