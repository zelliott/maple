A bacterial strain, designated strain zzso was isolated from a zzso microcosm packed with a mixture of soil and sewage sludge zzso designed to study the evolution of microbial zzso over zzso The bacterial strain was selected for its potential ability to store zzso zzso as zzso zzso The cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the strain was classified within the zzso zzso as its zzso zzso gene sequence had similarity of zzso with respect to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed low zzso of strain zzso to the type strains of other, zzso related species of the zzso zzso It contained zzso as the zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso as the major fatty zzso It was found to contain small amounts of the fatty acids zzso and zzso zzso a feature that served to distinguish it from its closest zzso relatives within the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso data obtained in this study suggest that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
