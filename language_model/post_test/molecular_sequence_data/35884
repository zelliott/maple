In view to study the possible participation of the sequence portions of zzso including or close to the free zzso groups at positions 15 and/or 72 to the binding with pancreatic zzso we have used three synthetic peptides matching portions zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso rabbit zzso immune serum, which zzso with peptides in zzso was zzso on columns of zzso coupled to zzso Of the three zzso of zzso only that interacting with zzso zzso had the capacity to inhibit zzso zzso activity by specifically preventing the association of zzso with its protein zzso previously bound to zzso We conclude that the region spanning zzso zzso of zzso is of importance for zzso interaction in the active complex formed at zzso
