The zzso zzso proteins zzso stimulate the intrinsic zzso activity of zzso thus converting the protein into its inactive zzso We have now analyzed zzso mouse liver tumors for the possible occurrence of zzso changes in one of the two known GAP zzso namely zzso zzso from a total of 21 tumors was reverse transcribed by use of zzso zzso amplified by zzso and zzso All known functional zzso of zzso were included into the zzso None of the liver tumors analyzed was found to be zzso within these regions of the zzso Moreover, Southern zzso analysis of the gene did not reveal any structural zzso However, at five positions we discovered zzso from the published mouse zzso zzso including two mouse zzso sequence zzso
