For various groups of plant zzso the zzso zzso end with a zzso structure zzso instead of the 3' zzso tail of common zzso The actual function of these zzso has long been zzso Recently, however, it became clear that for zzso yellow mosaic virus, a zzso the zzso zzso of the single zzso zzso functions as a bait for host zzso and directs them to the internal initiation site of translation (with zzso zzso of the second open reading frame for the zzso This discovery prompted us to investigate whether the much larger zzso of a different zzso of viruses have a comparable function in zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso a zzso has a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso for coat protein zzso All four zzso carry a highly zzso and bulky 3' zzso (about 200 zzso with zzso for zzso We discovered zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but could not clearly detect zzso incorporation into any zzso zzso We established that zzso proteins do not need zzso zzso for their zzso However, disruption of the zzso strongly reduced the translation of zzso zzso zzso and less zzso zzso whereas coat protein expression from zzso remained zzso This zzso translation could be partially restored by providing the zzso in zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso could even almost fully restore translation to the original zzso We discuss here a model with a central and dominant role for the zzso during the zzso infection zzso
