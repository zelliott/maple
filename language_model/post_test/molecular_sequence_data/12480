zzso zzso a zzso responsible for the American zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the gut of zzso insect zzso The effects of zzso and synthetic peptides carrying alpha zzso fragments on both the growth and the transformation of zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso This differentiation in the zzso gut is expressed when zzso and synthetic peptides corresponding to zzso zzso and zzso of the alpha zzso were added to the plasma zzso However, synthetic zzso zzso does not induce differentiation of zzso even in the presence of the two former synthetic zzso Thus, these data delineate an unusual molecular mechanism which zzso the dynamics of transformation of zzso into zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
