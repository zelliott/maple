A simple, efficient, and sensitive technique has been developed for amplification of zzso zzso molecules with zzso regions of unknown zzso In this zzso zzso T4 zzso zzso is used to zzso link an zzso zzso to zzso zzso These anchored zzso are then amplified by using one zzso primer specific for the anchor and another specific for a sequence within the zzso of zzso The anchor zzso has been especially designed to facilitate subsequent analysis and cloning of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso procedure does not require zzso of product between steps and avoids many of the technical difficulties associated with established anchored zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso zzso was demonstrated by amplification of a specific zzso zzso total zzso equivalent to as few as 100 cells yielded the expected zzso zzso
