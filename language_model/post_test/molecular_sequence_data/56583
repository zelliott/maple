zzso zzso zzso of zzso acute zzso is an zzso preparation isolated in this laboratory from the bone zzso or peripheral blood zzso of persons with zzso zzso and shown using an zzso slide test to be diagnostic of these zzso zzso further zzso from zzso zzso which zzso in the range of zzso zzso zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso which is referred to as zzso zzso and was previously shown to be zzso to colony formation by zzso cells from normal healthy human donors in zzso This zzso activity was directed toward zzso zzso colonies zzso in zzso We now report that zzso zzso is zzso to colony formation by zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso from zzso zzso cultures of zzso bone zzso cells were reduced in number and in size, an effect similar to that seen in cultures of human zzso As in zzso using human cells, zzso zzso appeared to be zzso targeted by the zzso activity of zzso zzso In addition, day 10 zzso colony formation was inhibited by zzso zzso in an ex zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells appear to parallel the effects observed using human zzso These observations support the possibility that zzso might be a regulatory protein in zzso which is zzso between zzso
