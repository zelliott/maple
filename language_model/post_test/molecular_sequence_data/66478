Plant invasion by zzso zzso involves regulated growth and highly organized zzso zzso zzso For instance, when the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso its zzso zzso filament is cell cycle arrested, and zzso are differentiated prior to plant zzso Once the filament enters the plant, the cell cycle block is released and zzso cells begin zzso suggesting a tight interaction between plant invasion and the cell cycle and zzso control zzso We describe a novel factor, zzso zzso zinc finger zzso which has two zzso zinc finger zzso and nuclear zzso suggesting a zzso regulatory zzso The deletion of zzso shows no zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso However, zzso cells show a severe reduction in zzso formation and plant zzso and those zzso that invade the plant arrest their zzso development directly after plant zzso zzso is induced via the zzso zzso the key control instance for zzso zzso The gene is expressed at high levels throughout zzso development, which zzso a zzso cell cycle arrest that is a direct consequence of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our data support a model in which zzso is involved in cell cycle arrest preceding plant penetration as well as in the induction of zzso
