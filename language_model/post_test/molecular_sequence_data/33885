The Met zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso play an important role in zzso both tumor progression and tissue zzso The zzso and first zzso zzso zzso of zzso comprise a naturally occurring zzso zzso that retains the ability to activate the Met zzso However, zzso is a weak zzso and is relatively zzso limiting its therapeutic zzso Here, we engineered zzso zzso with improved zzso and zzso properties that function as Met zzso zzso or zzso We first engineered zzso for increased stability and zzso expression yield using directed zzso The zzso zzso isolated from our library screens acted as weak Met zzso zzso due to a zzso at the zzso zzso zzso We introduced point zzso that restored this zzso zzso interface to create an zzso zzso or that further disrupted this interface to create more effective zzso The rationally engineered zzso exhibited melting temperatures up to approximately 64 zzso a 15 zzso improvement over zzso derived from zzso zzso and approximately zzso improvement in expression zzso Next, we created zzso zzso zzso through introduction of an zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso exhibited nearly an order of magnitude improved zzso activity compared to zzso zzso approaching the activity of full-length zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso formed from zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso similar activity, further signifying that zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso These engineered zzso proteins are promising candidates for therapeutic development and will be useful tools for further exploring zzso of Met zzso zzso
