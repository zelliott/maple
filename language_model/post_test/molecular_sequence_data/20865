The zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso proteins play a fundamental role in the skeleton as regulators of bone zzso In the zzso zzso is essential for the maintenance of bone mass and for balancing bone formation and zzso in response to zzso hormone zzso It promotes zzso differentiation and cell zzso zzso regulating the expression of zzso in the skeleton and in other zzso remain poorly zzso We found that the zzso region of the mouse zzso 3' untranslated region zzso contains a zzso dominant regulatory motif that interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso increased zzso protein levels, whereas zzso of zzso precursor zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso were increased during zzso differentiation in zzso The zzso of these zzso correlated with decreased zzso protein during the zzso maturation and zzso zzso of late zzso In contrast, zzso transcript levels remained relatively constant during this process, zzso repression of zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso induced zzso and zzso expression and decreased zzso zzso When cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso which is increased during zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso mechanisms regulating zzso in zzso are likely to be active in other cell zzso
