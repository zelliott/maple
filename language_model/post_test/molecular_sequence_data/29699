The first 57 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of the human zzso zzso gene are essential for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso carried out by zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear extracts with zzso zzso probe from the zzso promoter showed the formation of three zzso zzso The fastest complex contained zzso factor zzso and zzso the intermediate complex contained zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and the zzso complex contained an zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in a zzso increase in the binding intensity of only the upper complex and also activated zzso gene zzso zzso zzso with zzso indicating direct interaction between these zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, the repression of zzso zzso construct zzso activity resulted from zzso interacting with the zzso zzso zzso A attenuated the zzso of zzso transcription, suggesting that a zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso Our studies lend support to the idea that the balance between zzso zzso and repression is essential in the control of zzso steroid hormone zzso
