Using a zzso enrichment method, we isolated two zzso bacterial zzso which could completely degrade zzso zzso zzso including zzso acid zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso zzso treating zzso zzso mill zzso at 55 degrees C, grew on zzso as sole carbon zzso while zzso isolated from municipal zzso required dilute zzso soy broth for growth on zzso zzso grew on zzso from 30 degrees C to 60 degrees C with maximum growth at 50 degrees zzso while, zzso grew on zzso from 37 degrees C to 60 degrees C with maximum growth at 55 degrees zzso At 55 degrees C, the doubling times for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had growth yields of zzso and zzso g of protein per g of zzso zzso During growth on zzso both strains converted zzso to zzso zzso and dissolved organic zzso zzso of the zzso sequences of these two strains suggest that they belong to two new zzso in the zzso zzso of the beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the first two bacteria isolated and characterized that are capable of zzso of zzso acids at high zzso This study provided direct evidence for zzso of zzso acids and feasibility for zzso of pulp mill zzso at elevated zzso
