The zzso zzso protein B zzso gene promoter, spanning zzso zzso to zzso is composed of functionally distinct zzso and zzso zzso Although both regions contain zzso zzso protein 1 zzso sites, the zzso but not the zzso region mediates the zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso reporter activity of zzso zzso containing zzso promoter fragments that lacked the zzso putative zzso site, indicating that another regulatory motif mediates zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and in zzso analyses identified a DNA target sequence zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso factors that regulate zzso promoter zzso The identified sequence contains a zzso protein zzso consensus recognition zzso zzso of the site reduced zzso promoter activity and sensitivity to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso which did not recognize the zzso to zzso target sequence when added alone, zzso the mobility of in zzso translated zzso and zzso proteins zzso with the identified zzso zzso These findings support the idea that zzso between zzso and zzso and/or zzso targets zzso to the zzso promoter, thereby zzso its zzso regulatory zzso
