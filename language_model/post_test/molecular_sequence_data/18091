A zzso clone corresponding to a zzso that rapidly accumulates during the zzso response induced by zzso treatment of potato zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The clone encodes a zzso (Mr zzso zzso having zzso zzso acid identity with known plant alcohol zzso sequences zzso zzso zzso The identity of the clone was confirmed by measuring the zzso zzso activity in extracts of zzso coli transformed with the zzso zzso In potato zzso zzso a wide range of zzso including treatment with fatty acid zzso salicylic acid, zzso light and zzso was shown to induce zzso of zzso zzso In zzso a high zzso level of zzso transcripts could be detected in zzso old plants, but not in zzso old zzso However, the zzso could be induced to accumulate in stems of zzso old plants by treatment with zzso acid zzso or by zzso zzso in leaves was also obtained during zzso and after treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso
