zzso infection activates two distinct zzso zzso zzso in the zzso fat body of zzso zzso bacteria and zzso predominantly induce the Toll zzso pathway, whereas zzso bacteria activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso in either zzso reduce the resistance to corresponding zzso zzso screens have identified a range of genes involved in these zzso zzso zzso but how they are activated by microbial infection is largely zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Toll requires a zzso zzso form of an zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that Toll does not itself function as a bona fide recognition zzso of microbial zzso This is in apparent contrast with the zzso zzso receptors and raises the question of which host molecules actually recognize microbial patterns to activate Toll through zzso Here we present a zzso that blocks Toll zzso by zzso bacteria and significantly decreases resistance to this type of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene zzso a zzso recognition protein zzso Interestingly, zzso does not affect Toll zzso by zzso infection, indicating the existence of a distinct recognition system for zzso to activate the Toll zzso
