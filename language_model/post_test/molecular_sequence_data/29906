The mechanism by which the zzso nuclear zzso zzso activates zzso of several viral and host promoters is an important issue in the regulation of zzso gene expression and zzso cell zzso Identification of zzso elements of the promoters and the zzso host zzso factors that are targets for zzso action is crucial for our understanding of the zzso control of zzso regulated zzso The zzso zzso early promoter has a complex architecture and contains two overlapping promoters with start sites at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The major promoter responds strongly to zzso trans zzso zzso and zzso and contains four zzso a zzso motif analogous to the zzso box, two zzso sites present in an zzso orientation, and an zzso zzso To determine precisely the roles played by these zzso elements in both zzso and zzso zzso when the promoter is situated in its natural context, we investigated the zzso of a series of zzso scan promoter substitution zzso inserted into the viral zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso scan zzso in each element were rebuilt into a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity was monitored in zzso zzso In the absence of zzso trans zzso zzso activity in zzso was dependent on all four zzso zzso Surprisingly, a promoter zzso with only one of the two zzso sites intact could not promote zzso in zzso suggesting that the two zzso sites function zzso even in zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso in either of these two zzso sites also failed to bind to an zzso form of zzso in gel shift zzso and zzso only very zzso for zzso binding with the zzso promoter zzso The dramatic zzso shown by the two zzso zzso sites of the zzso promoter both in zzso and in zzso could reflect simultaneous contact of both sites by the zzso factor zzso Furthermore, promoter zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso the two zzso sites, and the single zzso site all failed to respond to zzso trans zzso Whereas recent results demonstrate that zzso activity can be modulated independently by zzso leading to zzso of this promoter, our results and those published previously strongly indicate that the three different zzso factors that bind to zzso zzso and zzso motifs of the zzso early promoter are all targets for zzso regulation in zzso Thus, strong zzso of the zzso early promoter through these multiple zzso elements and independently by the recently discovered zzso zzso suggests that the zzso early promoter is zzso regulated in zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
