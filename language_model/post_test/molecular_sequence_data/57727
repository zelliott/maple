The promoter region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is capable of directing high levels of expression of reporter zzso in various cell lines, albeit even in cells that do not express their zzso zzso alpha zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying this ubiquitous zzso we have characterized the promoter region of the mouse zzso alpha gene by a variety of in zzso and in zzso zzso We show that three sites related in sequence to zzso zzso and zzso binding sites and present in promoter region zzso are recognized by proteins from rat liver nuclear zzso The sequence of the zzso alpha promoter that includes the zzso binding site is also capable of forming stable complexes with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of this site drastically reduces zzso of zzso alpha promoter zzso zzso both in liver and non liver cell zzso In addition, we identify three novel zzso sites two of which display similarity to zzso and a zzso zzso B binding zzso The region located between zzso zzso and zzso forms several zzso complexes with liver nuclear proteins in zzso which are recognized mainly by zzso specific for zzso zzso Furthermore, transient expression of zzso alpha and to a lesser extent zzso beta expression zzso results in zzso of a zzso zzso alpha zzso reporter zzso These experiments support the notion that the zzso alpha gene is regulated by zzso alpha but other zzso proteins may also be zzso
