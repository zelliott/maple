A gene zzso zzso the zzso N zzso of zzso zzso zzso was cloned in a zzso zzso zzso zzso using a probe corresponding to the zzso end of the zzso The zzso zzso was trimmed down to a zzso zzso zzso zzso that contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of 331 zzso acids with an Mr of zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso by the zzso gene of strain zzso contains a zzso at position zzso whereas the gene of the high zzso producing strain zzso shows an zzso at the same zzso The zzso gene is expressed in zzso coli zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Some similar sequence motifs were found in the upstream region of the zzso gene of zzso zzso when compared with the upstream sequences of the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso extension studies indicated that the start of the zzso zzso with a T in position zzso which is located in a zzso zzso zzso near two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Wis zzso transformed with the zzso gene showed a zzso higher zzso N zzso activity than the zzso zzso
