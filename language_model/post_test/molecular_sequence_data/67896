Bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso signaling proteins - they zzso their signals by assembling complexes comprised of one of three known type II receptors and one of four known type I zzso zzso binds and signals through the type I zzso zzso but not other zzso while zzso zzso and zzso bind and signal through zzso and the close zzso zzso but not zzso The present results, which include the determination of the zzso structure using zzso and identification of zzso important for binding using zzso show that the zzso framework of zzso is highly similar to zzso yet there are significant differences in zzso shown previously to be important for zzso The most pronounced difference is in the zzso portion of the zzso loop, which is structurally ordered and includes a similarly placed but shorter zzso in zzso compared to zzso The altered zzso of the zzso loop, and to lesser extent zzso loop, cause clashes when zzso is positioned onto zzso in the manner that zzso is positioned onto zzso This zzso an alternative manner of zzso which is supported by a model of the zzso complex constructed using the program zzso The model shows that zzso is positioned similar to zzso but is rotated by 40 zzso The alternate positioning allows zzso to bind zzso through a large zzso zzso consistent with zzso analysis that identified several zzso in the central portion of the zzso loop that contribute significantly to binding and are zzso zzso relative to the corresponding zzso in zzso
