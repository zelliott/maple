We developed a highly accurate method to predict zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures zzso in microbial zzso zzso are zzso of zzso chains zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We analyzed domain sequences corresponding to specific zzso and physical interactions between zzso in order to predict which zzso zzso zzso are selected and assembled into highly ordered chemical zzso The predicted zzso were represented as the sequences of zzso units to extract the structural motifs zzso We applied our method to zzso zzso and found 619 zzso We also collected zzso zzso whose chemical structures have been determined zzso The structural sequences were compared using the zzso algorithm, and clustered into zzso zzso From the compound zzso we extracted 33 structural motifs that are significantly related with their zzso We used the structural motifs to zzso functions of 13 novel zzso clusters produced by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and found a putative zzso zzso The zzso analysis of zzso and chemical information given here will provide a strategy to predict the chemical structures, the zzso zzso and the biological activities of zzso which is useful for the rational design of novel zzso
