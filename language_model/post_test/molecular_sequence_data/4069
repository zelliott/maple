zzso syndrome zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disease, characterized by zzso retinal dystrophy, zzso and type 2 diabetes zzso that has been mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso We have studied an individual with zzso syndrome carrying a familial balanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso involving the previously implicated critical zzso We zzso that this individual was a compound zzso carrying one copy of a gene disrupted by the zzso and the other copy disrupted by an zzso zzso We mapped the zzso zzso on the maternal zzso to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which contains zzso 4 and the start of zzso 5 of a newly discovered gene zzso we detected a zzso zzso in the paternal copy of the zzso The zzso transcript of zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids whose function is zzso The protein contains a large zzso domain zzso 34 imperfect repetitions of 47 zzso zzso We have detected six different zzso zzso nonsense and four zzso zzso causing premature stop zzso in seven families, confirming that zzso is the gene underlying zzso zzso We believe that zzso is the first human disease gene characterized by zzso zzso inheritance to be identified as a result of a balanced zzso zzso
