zzso zzso represent a family of proteins that play an important role in the survival, development, and function of zzso zzso efforts are currently being made to develop small molecules endowed with zzso or zzso zzso zzso The structurally versatile zzso of these proteins are considered regions of interest for the design of new zzso By combining experimental and zzso approaches, we analyzed the intrinsic zzso preferences of the zzso of two of the most important zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clearly indicate that both peptides show a preference for random zzso zzso Because this finding does not zzso the possibility that structured forms may occur in solution as minor zzso states, we performed zzso simulations to gain insights into the structural features of populated zzso In line with the circular zzso analysis, the simulations show a preference for zzso states for both zzso However, the simulations also show that for zzso and to a lesser extent for zzso zzso zzso which are required for binding to the zzso zzso are present in the repertoire of structures that are zzso accessible to these zzso zzso molecular recognition of zzso by the zzso zzso is accomplished by the general mechanism known as population zzso These findings provide a structural rationale for the observed activity of synthetic peptides based on these zzso zzso They also suggest strategies for the development of biologically active zzso zzso
