A zzso orphan nuclear zzso zzso was previously identified from zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein contains a highly zzso DNA binding domain zzso C zzso a less zzso zzso binding domain zzso E zzso and three highly variable regions, the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso a large hinge region zzso domain, zzso zzso and an F domain zzso zzso zzso we characterize the DNA binding properties and the zzso activity of zzso In in zzso zzso zzso bound as a zzso to a response element zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso factor 1 zzso and to related sequences zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived from known zzso gene zzso Competition zzso with zzso zzso containing a single zzso at each zzso position defined the optimum DNA sequence required for zzso zzso The optimal consensus sequence for zzso binding is zzso zzso any zzso This sequence is similar but not identical to the zzso response element zzso consensus sequence zzso By performing zzso zzso zzso the ability of zzso to bind zzso to a zzso zzso pair sequence was demonstrated in zzso The ability of the full-length zzso to zzso reporter gene expression was shown to be zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, the hinge region contained an unexpected zzso function zzso domain, termed zzso while no zzso activity was detected within the zzso zzso This zzso region (from zzso zzso to zzso zzso revealed a strong autonomous zzso activity, which was masked when it was present in the full-length zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso possesses the characteristic DNA binding specificity of zzso zzso members and the capacity to zzso a reporter zzso
