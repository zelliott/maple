During hair zzso zzso several families of zzso proteins are zzso zzso In the present study, zzso clones zzso six members of mouse zzso protein were isolated by screening a zzso library prepared from the mouse skin of an zzso phase with a differential zzso zzso On the basis of their zzso and deduced zzso acid zzso they were found to zzso two members of zzso protein type I and four of type zzso Interestingly, one of the four type II proteins had been zzso by two distinct zzso Among the zzso clones isolated were included the ones zzso a new member of type I and II zzso respectively, which possessed an entire open reading zzso Novel type II zzso termed type zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da was revealed to have significant direct repeats and a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso which indicates that this protein has characteristics intermediate between zzso proteins and zzso zzso In addition, the new member of type I protein has some features common with type II zzso We propose to term this protein type zzso until it is further zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated that gene expression of mouse zzso proteins followed the hair cycle growth fundamentally and reached its peak at day 9 in the first hair cycle, while two zzso of their expression were observed at day 33 and day 39 in the second zzso Their transcripts were expressed in the cortical cells of hair zzso but not in the cells of the outer root zzso inner root zzso or zzso Moreover, their gene expression commenced at different levels in cortical zzso The novel findings that each gene is activated zzso with a distinct expression pattern zzso and temporally suggest that there is a remarkable difference in the distribution of these proteins in zzso
