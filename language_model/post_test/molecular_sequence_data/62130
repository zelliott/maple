zzso zzso and zzso are large zzso zzso regulators belonging to the family of zzso DNA binding proteins known as the Fox zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to act as zzso zzso while regulatory activity of the recently identified zzso has not been zzso Given the importance of this Fox gene zzso in neural and lung development, we sought to zzso the mechanisms by which zzso zzso and zzso repress gene zzso We show that like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso repression domain in zzso zzso and zzso shows that this region contains two separate and distinct repression zzso that are highly zzso termed zzso 1 and zzso zzso However, zzso 2 is not functional in zzso zzso for proteins that interact with zzso 1 and 2 of zzso using zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso 2 binds to zzso binding protein 1, which can zzso repress zzso with zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso 1 contains a highly zzso zzso zzso similar to that found in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso family zzso These interactions are dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that the integrity of this zzso is essential for DNA zzso making zzso zzso and zzso the first Fox proteins that require zzso for DNA zzso These data reveal a complex regulatory mechanism underlying zzso zzso and zzso activity, demonstrating that zzso zzso and zzso are the first Fox proteins reported whose activity is regulated by zzso and zzso
