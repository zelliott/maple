Several promoter elements with sequence similarity to the zzso zzso element zzso were compared by zzso zzso zzso within whole cell extracts were identified that bind to the zzso elements in the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso The corresponding factors appeared to differ in their degree of selectivity for these zzso zzso One protein species bound equally well to all zzso In addition, a subset of specific activities zzso only the zzso and the zzso element and one zzso complex had exclusive specificity for the zzso present in the zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso some of the protein components of the specific complexes were identified as zzso and zzso zzso Based on these data we zzso that zzso protein zzso differ in their ability to tolerate variations from the zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso promoter elements are distinguished by this ability to bind to different zzso of a family of related zzso zzso
