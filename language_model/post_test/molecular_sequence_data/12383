The rat possesses two pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been known to stimulate zzso zzso release, whereas zzso did zzso Both zzso are zzso in the pancreatic zzso zzso zzso has a zzso effect on pancreatic zzso cells, and the exclusion of zzso juice from the zzso has been known to be a most potent zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we examined whether the zzso levels of zzso and zzso produced by zzso juice diversion were different from each other and compared the changes in zzso zzso levels in the small zzso zzso and the plasma and zzso zzso zzso Male zzso rats were prepared with internal zzso and zzso juice was excluded from the zzso zzso being introduced into the zzso zzso zzso were sacrificed 1, 3, and 7 days after the zzso The zzso of plasma and zzso zzso and the levels of zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso were significantly increased by zzso juice zzso The increase in the zzso level of zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso Administration of zzso zzso inhibited these changes but administration of zzso zzso could not fully reproduce these zzso These studies suggest that zzso juice regulates gene expression of zzso and zzso and that the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression of zzso and zzso may be zzso
