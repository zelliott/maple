zzso in the mouse zzso zzso zzso formerly known as the limb zzso zzso zzso give rise to zzso inherited limb zzso and zzso zzso or zzso The zzso gene encodes many zzso processed transcripts that are expressed in both adult and embryonic zzso To study the zzso organization of the zzso zzso we have used zzso zzso to isolate and characterize zzso clones spanning 500 zzso Our analysis of these clones shows that the zzso gene is composed of at least 24 zzso and spans 400 zzso We have identified two novel zzso that are expressed in the developing embryonic limb bud as well as adult zzso such as brain and zzso We have also used a zzso zzso from within the zzso gene to map it genetically to a zzso zzso between zzso and zzso
