zzso are small peptides isolated from the zzso of several snake families which act as zzso or zzso interacting with a variety of biological processes zzso by zzso In this work we describe five new zzso zzso within zzso precursor zzso obtained from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the new zzso zzso four were contained in zzso zzso zzso with three of them presenting zzso and one presenting a new zzso Moreover, we found three zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso Two of them are similar to the already described zzso zzso and zzso The third zzso is unusual, presenting some typical zzso zzso characteristics but lacking the zzso domain being, thus, classified as a zzso zzso Only few reports presented molecules with these zzso zzso analysis suggests that these molecules are intermediate steps between the more ancient zzso and the more recent zzso zzso We also investigated zzso zzso diversity in zzso zzso crude zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and analyzing them by mass zzso
