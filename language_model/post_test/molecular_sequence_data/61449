A series of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso have been reported that differ only at their zzso These zzso all contain zzso 1, 2, and 3 of the zzso the zzso responsible for coding all seven zzso zzso Whereas zzso also has zzso 4 that encodes for an additional 12 zzso acids at the tip of the zzso the other zzso zzso have unique zzso acid sequences distinct from those in zzso due to alternative zzso All these zzso are zzso in binding zzso The current study explored the ability of these zzso to stimulate zzso binding to assess them zzso Only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso we noted marked differences in their zzso stimulation among the zzso This was most prominent with zzso which zzso zzso binding in the zzso expressing cells to a greater degree than zzso zzso zzso and was far less effective than zzso in zzso cells zzso The rank order of zzso stimulation of the drugs varied among the clones as zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso were most effective in stimulating zzso binding in zzso while zzso and zzso were most effective in zzso expressing zzso The potency zzso of some of the drugs also varied extensively among the zzso with a poor correlation between the potency of the drugs to stimulate zzso binding and their binding zzso Together, these findings reveal marked functional differences among the zzso that only can be explained by their structural differences at the tip of their zzso
