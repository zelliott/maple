We report on the isolation and characterization of zzso clones for mouse zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using nine zzso zzso sequences from five species indicates that the zzso are derived from an ancestral gene by two zzso events, zzso 1 and 2 being more closely related and having resulted from a more recent zzso than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is highly regulated in adult mouse zzso zzso is strongly expressed in the liver, heart, zzso skeletal muscle and kidney zzso zzso expression is high in the heart, zzso zzso eye, zzso and zzso whereas zzso expression is high in the heart, zzso liver and zzso zzso
