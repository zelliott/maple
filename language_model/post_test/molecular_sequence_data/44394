We have analyzed all currently zzso zzso proteins containing either a zzso module or a receiver zzso corresponding to those found in bacterial sensor zzso or response regulators, respectively, of the so-called zzso regulatory zzso We demonstrate that the zzso receiver zzso belong to a single zzso of the bacterial receiver zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit a similar zzso pattern on the sensor zzso zzso tree, suggesting that they evolved in parallel with the receiver zzso from a common ancestral source that bore both zzso Multiple alignments of the sequences corresponding to these zzso are presented and discussed, and zzso signature sequences are zzso
