zzso species and zzso zzso coli strains carry a large zzso to zzso zzso called zzso which contains genes essential for the zzso of these zzso zzso with specific zzso derived from the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso present in 35 clinical zzso are zzso with zzso but not zzso regardless of the zzso of the zzso or zzso coli zzso zzso of zzso in turn, is very similar to zzso zzso of zzso R zzso These and other related zzso constitute the zzso zzso With one zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso 5, we demonstrated the existence of a functional zzso zzso with a restriction map similar to that of zzso of zzso zzso We isolated the putative inc zzso coding region of zzso which is a major zzso of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso region was determined and compared with the corresponding sequences of zzso and zzso The differences were small, but apparently were sufficient to affect the target specificity of the inc zzso thus rendering the zzso compatible with each zzso We conclude that zzso present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli constitute a homogeneous group, containing one basic zzso that belongs to the zzso family of zzso
