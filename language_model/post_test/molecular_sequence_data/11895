zzso is a serum zzso that zzso the alternative zzso of complement by stabilizing the zzso zzso It also binds zzso zzso such as zzso in zzso zzso is composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains an zzso region of no known zzso and six zzso type 1 repeats zzso of approximately 60 zzso zzso To identify the regions of zzso important for function, we have expressed human zzso and zzso forms each lacking a single zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso In addition, limited zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso by the zzso of one zzso bond in zzso The structural and functional properties of these altered forms of zzso were zzso zzso zzso in zzso is unable to bind zzso but retains its overall structure and its ability to bind zzso The removal of zzso prevents zzso and zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso is unable to stabilize the zzso complex but is able to bind zzso and zzso and shows the presence of zzso and zzso in an electron zzso zzso without zzso is able to stabilize the zzso complex, to bind zzso and zzso and forms zzso zzso and zzso zzso lacking zzso is unable to form zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is not required for zzso or stabilization of the zzso zzso The results zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso and suggest that zzso may also be involved in stabilization of the zzso zzso
