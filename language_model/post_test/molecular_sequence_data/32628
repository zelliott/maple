Early B cell factor zzso is a zzso factor known to be of critical importance for early B zzso zzso zzso has been shown to directly interact with and regulate expression of a set of genes involved in the functional formation of the zzso cell zzso but the dramatic zzso observed in the zzso mice suggests that several additional genes are activated by this zzso In order to identify additional target genes for zzso we zzso a zzso zzso cell line, zzso with an zzso zzso and investigated the induced gene expression pattern by zzso This analysis suggested that among others, the zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso genes both were induced by zzso expression of zzso Identification of the zzso end of the zzso enabled the identification of promoter elements with functional binding sites for zzso and ability to respond to zzso expression in transient zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are direct genetic targets for zzso providing additional information concerning the activity of this crucial zzso factor in zzso
