Previously we established a series of zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso DNA prepared by zzso zzso A group of these zzso exhibited high zzso and zzso zzso To determine the molecular basis for these zzso we zzso zzso and expressed the variable regions of this group of zzso as functional zzso zzso The zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the expressed light chain zzso zzso gene assignments confidently belonged to zzso family zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso number zzso while heavy chain variable region zzso genes belonged to zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso number zzso A well-established expression system based on the zzso zzso was examined for its ability to produce zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso ) fragments were zzso and their zzso activity was analyzed against zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso The study of zzso provides important information about the potential zzso activities of zzso whose structure allows us to understand their basis of zzso zzso surface analysis and zzso studies were performed on the molecular interactions between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Surface analysis identified the important sequence motifs at the binding sites, and different effects exerted by zzso and zzso zzso at different positions in the light and heavy zzso This study demonstrates the potential usefulness of the protein DNA surrogate in the investigation of the origin of zzso zzso These studies may define important features of DNA zzso
