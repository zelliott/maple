The human zzso contains a number of zzso zzso binding proteins that translate DNA zzso into a zzso zzso To gain insight into the function of zzso and zzso we first applied protein tagging and mass zzso We show that zzso and zzso assemble into mutually exclusive distinct zzso complexes, called zzso and zzso We identified zzso a putative tumor zzso as a novel core zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were identified as specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and specifically associates with and zzso the zzso N zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso and zzso are recruited to zzso islands in a zzso manner in zzso and that zzso a zzso of zzso is zzso at these zzso Our data show that zzso and zzso are distinct protein complexes with different zzso and functional zzso
