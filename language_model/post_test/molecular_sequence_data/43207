To isolate genes that zzso regulate cell growth, we constructed a zzso expression library with partially zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragments inserted downstream of the zzso zzso In all, zzso zzso zzso were screened for zzso on zzso zzso From 17 such zzso identified, 16 zzso DNA sequences were zzso zzso mapping and determination of DNA sequences adjacent to the zzso promoter indicated that the zzso zzso part or all of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and also open reading frames zzso from zzso IV, zzso IX, zzso and zzso Some of the identified sequences lacked the zzso sequences of the zzso suggesting that truncated forms of the proteins might be necessary for growth zzso The sequence of the zzso insert was highly zzso to the zzso zzso and contained an zzso consensus zzso suggesting a possible growth zzso effect of an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which lacked zzso zzso was associated with zzso similar to those of zzso defective in bud zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso sequences induced zzso buds and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso induced by the zzso of our cloned sequences could result from either a zzso or a zzso effect and, unexpectedly, in one case from an effect of an zzso
