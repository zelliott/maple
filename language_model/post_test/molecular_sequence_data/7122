zzso zzso based on zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso amplify a 650 zzso segment of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The segment was used as a probe for zzso and sequencing the gene from a zzso library of the zzso zzso the zzso was amplified by reverse zzso cloned and zzso The pep gene was found to consist of four zzso zzso for 395 zzso The zzso deduced has an zzso leader sequence of 70 zzso preceding the sequence of the mature zzso consisting of 325 zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso The zzso sequence of the mature zzso matched the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso sequences of the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso to the corresponding sequences of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA with a specific zzso probe suggested the presence of a single copy of the pep zzso
