Iron acquisition of zzso plants is characterized by the synthesis and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and by a specific zzso system for zzso zzso We identified a gene specifically zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso which is the most tolerant species to iron zzso among zzso zzso zzso was predicted to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids and to have zzso identity with zzso a first protein identified as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was mainly expressed in the roots, and its expression was enhanced under iron zzso In zzso zzso analysis of zzso barley roots revealed that the zzso of zzso was localized in zzso root zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed the same zzso as the zzso zzso functionally zzso zzso strains defective in iron zzso on media containing zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso showed strict specificity for both metals and zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso with zzso The zzso and zzso specificity of zzso is different from those of zzso indicating that zzso is a specific zzso for zzso involved in primary iron acquisition from soil in barley zzso
