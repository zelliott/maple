zzso transfer zzso zzso are alpha zzso found in zzso zzso and zzso We have identified currently zzso protein members of the zzso and zzso zzso Members of these two families include zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and bacteria, zzso zzso pairs of proteins zzso that are essential for nitrogen fixation in some bacteria, and zzso a pair of zzso proteins zzso by two open reading frames in zzso coli zzso and zzso These three groups of proteins comprise three clusters on both the zzso and zzso zzso trees, separated from each other by comparable zzso zzso This fact suggests that these two protein families evolved with similar overall rates of evolutionary zzso Relative regions of sequence conservation are zzso and signature sequences for both families are zzso
