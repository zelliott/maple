The zzso zzso opens through a zzso mechanism known as zzso zzso which is essential for zzso of the zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso that is necessary for fruit opening and is involved in patterning each of the three fruit cell types required for seed zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso factor family, is required for fruit growth since zzso zzso fruit fail to undergo the dramatic enlargement that normally occurs after zzso Here we show, however, that zzso is not directly required for fruit zzso and instead is required to prevent zzso activity of zzso Our molecular and genetic studies suggest a model for the regulatory interactions among the genes that control fruit development and the mechanism that results in the expression of zzso in a narrow stripe of zzso
